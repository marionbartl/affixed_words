Surprise , The Sims 3 will soon shed its PC exclusivity by gracing not one , not two , but all three of the major consoles and a handheld to boot .
Publisher Electronic
Arts just revealed that The Sims 3 ( PCW Score : 4.5 out of 5 ) is in the mixer for the PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 , Wii , and Nintendo DS .
It 's been secretly churning for some time too , apparently , since EA says it 'll be available for those four already this fall .
Worried it wo n't transition comfortably from keyboard - mouse to couch - and - gamepad ?
Stay skeptical , but EA claims it " tailored each platform [ version ] of The Sims 3 with exclusive features to allow for even more control , creativity , and connectivity . "
( I know , a little silly with the alliterative sunshine ... and we 're not even to the part where they trot out shelf - syntax like " rich , " " immersive , " and " seamlessly integrated . " )
New to the console versions , " Karma Powers " let you fiddle more directly with your Sims ' well - being , and EA says you can employ them to help your Sim " get lucky , " offer them an " instant beauty " makeover , or slap them down with an " epic fail . "
It sounds like the powers have flip - sides , too , and EA says using them " may have unexpected results and karma may come back to bite . "
Of the lot , it looks like the Wii and DS versions are the ones to beat .
The PS3 and Xbox 360 ports will share the PC version 's option to share custom content with others .
They 'll also include an option to automatically annoy -- I mean " notify " Facebook friends of your in - game achievements .
But it 's the Wii and DS that have with the coolest - sounding new content .
For instance , the Wii gets a brand new beach town , with " unique residents , traits , careers and lifetime wishes . "
You 'll be able to square off with friends in a new " Life Moments " mode ( no explanation how it works ) to earn rewards .
And it sounds like EA 's added exclusive " adventure quests " designed to flesh out each area and break up stretches of needs - juggling monotony .
The DS version , by comparison , gets a " never before seen " feature where players can use the device 's stylus to " build their Sims ' homes with tools , draw walls and floors , and customize virtually everything from décor objects , textures , and more . "
The Create - a- Sim aspect 's also reportedly been finessed to play to the DS 's strengths , allowing you to literally sculpt your Sims ' attributes and wardrobe .
And while I 'm not sure what this next bit means exactly , you can " for the first time ever on the Nintendo DS ... enjoy a complete life simulation . "
I 'll just read that as " notably less emasculated " overall gameplay than previous handheld ports .
Conspicuously absent from the lineup of supported devices ?
Sony 's PlayStation Portable , whose monthly unit sales are in the toilet .
That 's a shame , considering how well the PSP version of The Sims 2 sold ( tepid critical reaction notwithstanding ) when it shipped back in December 2005 .

Yesterday I had a nice chat with Matthieu about the upcoming Coq release that will have proof irrelevance .
Proof irrelevance means that all objects of some proposition are equal ( perhaps they are even convertible ) .
The problem with proof irrelevance is that it can screw up fixpoint reduction when you have a proof of termination witnessed by something in Prop .
The standard example of this is well - founded recursion where the recursion is over Acc .
Well - founded recursion is nice because it does structural recursion over a proposition .
When extracting the program the proposition goes away and you are left with just the relevant computational parts .
The problem occurs when well founded recursion is done inside an inconsistent context .
Then the proof of termination may be based on false premises .
If all the different termination proofs happen to be convertible , then the fixpoint can always unfold .
Then you lose normalization .
What I vaguely understand is that the forthcoming version of Coq will have proof irrelevance .
It will give you the choice between reducing these fixpoints and losing strong normalization , or not reducing these fixpoints and losing canonicity .
Lack of canonicity would mean that there would be some natural numbers which do n't begin with a constructor .
Up till now I had figured that Epigram 2 with its OTT logic would have everything I want : proof irrelevance , functional extensional equality , etc. Matthieu asked me what OTT loses .
I said that it loses inductive types in Prop , but I figured that was no big deal .
Then Matthieu asked me how to do well - founded recursion in OTT .
The problem is that Acc is inductively defined .
I had assumed that there would be some non-inductive replacement for it , but now it is not looking that way .
I believe I was told that all propositions in OTT are double - negation stable .
I thought that maybe if I prove that Acc is stable , then I would get some insight into how to define it without induction .
The problem is that I cannot prove that Acc is stable .
This really surprised me .
It is my first example of something that is proof irrelevant ( assuming functional extensional equality ) , but not double negation stable .
Matthieu pointed me to the a lemma done by the Chalmers people that stability of Acc implies Markov 's principle .
I redid this proof in Coq to see the result for myself .
Since Markov 's principle is n't constructive , we can not expect Acc to be stable .
Since ( i believe ) that all props in OTT are stable , that means that Acc cannot be defined in Prop in OTT .
When squash types are added to OTT , then these new squashed propositions are not double negation stable .
One one solution may be to define Acc in Type and then squash it into Prop .
But I do n't know what the reduction properties would be , or if this would even work .
I 'm starting to think that the following four things are incompatible
Well - founded recursion
Proof irrelevance
Canonicity
Normalization
By well - founded recursion , I mean being able to do structural recursion over propositions to product a value in type , such as recursion over Acc ( of course if you put Acc in Type then everything works , but we do n't want to do that because we want to strip Acc during program extraction ) .
By proof irrelevance I mean that all proofs of the same proposition are equal ( and maybe I mean that they are convertible ) .
By canonicity I mean that all normalized inductive objects in the empty context begin with a constructor .
Coq currently leaves out proof irrelevance .
The forthcoming version of Coq will leave out ( at your choice ) either canonicity or normalization ( as I understand ) .
Finally , OTT leaves out well - founded recursion ( as I 've defined it ) .
Perhaps OTT plus squash types will give all 4 properties , but I do n't think I would bet on it .
After months of limited action on a nearly global crisis over the sexual abuse of children by Catholic priests , Pope Benedict XVI and the Vatican press office affirmed today that the church plans to take steps towards bringing clerical abusers to justice .
At a Wednesday address in St. Peter ’s Square Pope Benedict described a tearful meeting with eight abused men in Malta on his trip to the tiny Catholic island nation last weekend on what Catholics believe was 1,950th anniversary of the apostle Paul ’s famed shipwreck there .
The Malta trip was reportedly viewed with considerable trepidation after the abuse of dozens of children there came to light April 5 .
" I shared with them their suffering , and emotionally prayed with them , assuring them of church action , " Benedict said today amid well wishers in Rome , according to the Associated Press .
Today ’s admission of abuse by Catholic priests and a focus on victims is a departure for the Vatican in the midst of a volcanic flow of media stories in the US , Ireland , Germany , Kenya , Malta and elsewhere that involve either abuse or the cover up of abuse by the Catholic church hierarchy .
In recent months church officials accused media and the press of exaggerating the scandal , issued statements defending the pontiff , and spent time comparing the church ’s sexual abuse percentages with other sectors of society .
“ The focus is now on victims , not on protecting the church , that I think is the breakthrough right now , ” says Andreas Batlogg , an editor at Jesuit - based Catholic intellectual journal in Munich , “ Stimmen der Zeit . ”
Last week the Vatican openly published internal guidelines for handling pedophiles and others accused of illegal behavior inside the church for the first time and stressed that cases of priests and others in the church found culpable should be turned over to civil authorities .
Malta trip
Last Sunday in Malta , the pope was quoted as saying the church would do “ all in its power to investigate allegations , to bring to justice those responsible for abuse and to implement effective measures designed to safeguard young people in the future . "
That message was repeated again today , and the Vatican issued a statement saying it would take “ effective measures ” to deal with wayward priests – though specifics were not given .
Christian Weisner of the German branch of the international group “ We are Church ” which describes itself as composed of loyal Catholics who disagree with some Vatican policies , said that if Benedict is sincere about taking action against a history of sexually abusing priests , it will be an important step for the church , even if it is “ too weak and too late . "
“ But so far I have seen no other Catholic leaders meet with as many victims as the pope has , ” Weisner continued .
“ What we mostly see are bishops now talking about victims , and making press statements about victims , but not much more . ”
So I flew down to Birmingham yesterday for a visit and to play a gig ( Marty ’s on Friday at midnight–be there ! ) .
And the planes that make the direct flights from New York - LaGuardia to Birmingham are tiny .
These are the ones where they often make people move from the front to the back to redistribute weight during take - off .
And on these planes , there is very little room for carry - ons–much less room even than on larger passenger planes where everyone is increasingly bringing everything they own on board to avoid bag checking fees , causing fistfights in the aisles on almost every flight I take .
Anyway …
I had to check my guitar anyway , so I went ahead and also checked my small suitcase .
And just to make things even easier on myself , I packed my work laptop inside the suitcase instead of bringing it on board with me .
I know …
For some reason , everybody thinks I ’m crazy for checking a laptop , but just shut up about that and focus .
Focus .
Okay , are you with me ?
So I get to Birmingham , and I take the laptop out of my suitcase to do some work , and this is what I find .
If you ca n’t read the note , it says :
Youtube
“ Fall of the Republic ”
“ End Game ”
“ Obama Deception ”
Google
“ Money Masters ”
So what this tells me is that some TSA employee at LaGuardia , or perhaps a Delta baggage handler , wants me to watch these youtube videos for some reason .
And I did watch a little bit of each one , but it ’s not the sort of thing that generally interests me .
They are perpetuating right - wing conspiracy theories about Obama and banks .
It seems to be the same old illuminati stuff that people have trotted out every few years since the 18th century , but dressed up in the most recent issues .
So what do I make of this ?
I suppose it ’s disturbing that someone at TSA is taking advantage of their job to furtively distribute anti-government propaganda ( and I would n’t think it any less disturbing if it was pro-government propaganda ) .
But I ’m more amused by it than disturbed , though I guess whoever did this out to get called out for it .
It does seem really creepy when I think about it .
UPDATE
When I originally posted , I had not yet opened my guitar case .
When I did take out my guitar later in the day , I found ANOTHER NOTE .
Basically the same as the first note , but with an additional message on the back saying , “ Just check it out ! ”
And to the people that have a problem with me calling these videos “ right - wing , ” — really , that is beside the point .
I could make arguments to defend that characterization , but ultimately it does n’t matter .
What is happening here is that a government employee is taking advantage of his / her job to furtively distribute anti-government propaganda , and that ’s an interesting story to me .
And even if you are one of those people that believes or agrees with the videos this person is promoting , that has no bearing on the fact that these messages came to me in a very strange and inappropriate manner .
The content of the videos is really not important .
I still find this whole thing more amusing than alarming , although the second note makes it all a bit creepier .
Prologue
Because designing GPUs this big is " [ redacted ] hard " - NVIDIA ’s VP of Product Marketing Ujesh Desai on GF100
Fermi/GF100 / GTX400 has been a long time coming .
For an industry where the major players are usually in lockstep with each other in some fashion , this latest cycle has been distinctly out of sync .
In September of 2009 we saw AMD launch their Radeon 5000 series , and spend the next 6 months as the performance leader for the discrete graphics market for virtually every price point .
NVIDIA on the other hand missed the latest cycle by a mile , and when AMD was delivering 5000 series cards NVIDIA could only talk about the High Performance Computing applications of their next GPU , Fermi .
It would be the next big thing , both figuratively and literally .
In January we got the next piece of the Fermi story at CES , when NVIDIA was willing to talk about the gaming - oriented hardware and applications of the first Fermi GPU : GF100 .
We found out it would be significantly different from the GT200 GPU powering NVIDIA ’s GTX200 series , that NVIDIA was going to break up the traditional fixed - function pipeline and at the same time take a particularly keen interest in tessellation .
What we did n’t find out is when it would ship .
Much of this has been in NVIDIA ’s hands – some of it has not .
What ’s indisputable is that TSMC , the chip foundry used by both AMD and NVIDIA , was not delivering the kind of yields on their 40nm process that AMD and NVIDIA were expecting .
Both of them suffered for it .
AMD could not get enough viable chips to meet demand for their 5000 series part , leaving a wake of disappointed gamers who could not get AMD ’s latest wonder , and limiting AMD ’s ability to profit from one of the few times in AMD / ATI ’s history where the company had a clear lead over NVIDIA , and if you ask AMD also limiting their ability to control prices .
NVIDIA meanwhile had to deal with the fact that they were trying to produce a very large chip on a low - yielding process , a combination for disaster given that size is the enemy of high yields .
What ’s also indisputable is that this 6 month wait has benefited few people .
For the observers of an industry where the competition is cut - throat we saw GPU prices rise , when in the last generation AMD and NVIDIA knocked upwards of hundreds of dollars off of each other ’s prices practically overnight .
It may have been good times overall for AMD , but for buyers the competitive marketplace is sorely missed .
That brings us to today .
We can see the light at the end of the tunnel , the end of NVIDIA ’s 6 month journey is near .
We ’ve told you about the compute applications of Fermi , we ’ve told you about the gaming applications of Fermi , and now at long last we can tell you about the first products .
It ’s time to say hello to the GTX 400 series .
Meet the GTX 480 and GTX 470

Today NVIDIA is launching two cards : the GeForce GTX 480 , and the GeForce GTX 470 .
Both of them are based on GF100 , the first and largest member of the Fermi family .
Right off the bat , we can tell you that neither card is a complete GF100 chip .
We know from NVIDIA ’s earlier announcements that a complete GF100 is a 512 SP / core part organized in a 4x16x32 fashion , but these first parts will not have all of GF100 ’s functional units activated .
Instead we ’ll be getting a 480 core part for the GTX 480 , and a 448 core part for the GTX 470 .
Ultimately we will not be seeing the full power of GF100 right away , but you can be sure that somewhere down the line we ’ll see a GTX 485 or GTX 490 with all of GF100 ’s functional units enabled .
NVIDIA 's GeForce GTX 480
What we ’re starting out with today at the high - end is the GTX 480 , a card based on a GF100 with 1 of the 16 SMs disabled that will sell for $ 499 , making it the primary competitor for the Radeon 5870 .
The disabled SM has no affect on the ROPs which are part of a separate functional block , but it does cut down on the shading , texturing , and tessellation capabilities of the card compared to where a full GF100 card would be .
This gives the GTX 480 the full 48 ROPs and 768KB of L2 cache of GF100 , along with 60 texture units , 15 PolyMorph engines , and 480 cores .
Although the architectural overhaul means we can’t compare the GTX 480 to the GTX 285 quite as easily as we could the Radeon 5000 series to the Radeon 4000 series , the GTX 480 is still in some ways a doubled - up GTX 285 from a shader standpoint .
The GTX 470 on the other hand is a further cut - down GF100 - based product that will sell for $ 349 .
As we stated earlier it has only 448 cores , a product of NVIDIA disabling 2 of the 16 SMs .
Along with disabling the SMs , NVIDIA also disabled 1 of the 6 ROP clusters , which disables 6 ROPs , 128KB of L2 cache , and 2 of the 32 bit memory channels .
This leaves us with 448 cores running alongside 40 ROPs , 640KB of L2 cache , all on a 320 bit GDDR5 memory bus .
NVIDIA 's GeForce GTX 470
As is usually the case for a harvested part , GTX 470 takes a clockspeed hit compared to GTX 480 .
The core clock falls 13 % to 607MHz , and the shader clock falls the same distance to 1215MHz .
The memory clock on the other hand only drops by 10 % to 837MHz ( 3348MHz effective ) .
Overall this gives the GTX 470 around 80 % of the shading , texturing , and tessellation capabilities of the GTX 480 and 72 % of the ROP capability and memory bandwidth .
One thing that caught our eye with all of this was that NVIDIA ’s memory clocks are lower than we had been initially expecting .
GDDR5 is readily available up to 5GHz while NVIDIA does n’t go any higher than 3.7GHz ; in fact between the smaller memory bus than the GTX 285 and the lower than expected memory clocks , the GTX 400 series does n’t have all that much more bandwidth than the GTX 285 did .
As it stands the GTX 480 only has 11 % more memory bandwidth than the GTX 285 , while the GTX 470 has 15 % less than the GTX 285 .
Given the 384 - bit bus , we initially assumed NVIDIA was running in to even greater memory bus issues than AMD ran in to for the 5000 series , but as it turns out that ’s not the case .
When we asked NVIDIA about working with GDDR5 , they told us that their biggest limitation was n’t the bus like AMD but rather deficiencies in their own I/ O controller , which in turn caused them to miss their targeted memory speeds .
Unlike AMD who has been using GDDR5 for nearly 2 years , NVIDIA is still relatively new at using GDDR5 ( their first product was the GT 240 late last year ) , so we ca n’t say we ’re completely surprised here .
If nothing else , this gives NVIDIA ample room to grow in the future if they can get a 384 - bit memory bus up to the same speeds as AMD has gotten their 256 - bit bus .
This leaves us with the other elephant in the room : yield on GF100 .
NVIDIA has n’t commented specifically on the yields coming out of TSMC but we know even 6 months later that AMD still is n’t satisfied with things , so that should offer some guidance on the situation given NVIDIA ’s larger die .
As it stands NVIDIA chose to launch their highest end GF100 part with only 15 of 16 SMs in order to reach the “ broadest availability ” , which is a clear sign that NVIDIA is n’t getting enough full - yielding and high - clocking dies at this time to offer a proper unharvested part .
The power / heat situation also bears mentioning , since it often goes hand - in - hand with yield issues .
With a 500 m m2 + die on the 40nm process , it should come as no surprise that both the GTX 480 and GTX 470 are hot cards .
NVIDIA has to pay the piper for having such a large die , and this is one of the places where they do so .
The TDP for the GTX 480 is 250W while it ’s 215W for the GTX 470 ; meanwhile the cards idle at 47W and 33W respectively .
NVIDIA ’s large die strategy usually leads to them having power - hungry parts , but from a historical perspective the GTX 480 is the hungriest yet for a single - GPU card ; even the GTX280 was n’t quite as high .
We ’ll get in to this more when we take a look at measured power consumption .
This weekend war memorials across the nation will be the focus of Anzac remembrance services .
From tiny outback hamlets to the capital cities , the solemn strains of the Last Post will sound as wreaths are laid and heads bowed in contemplation of war time loss .
There are about 1,500 memorials to the First World War across the country - so many that Australia has been called a " nation of small town memorials " .
Emeritus Professor of History Ken Inglis says the memorials are a profound reminder of an unnatural phenomenon .
" All our cemeteries , our civilian memorials to the dead , are put up by the young to mourn the old , but memorials , war memorials are put up to serve this unnatural purpose in which the old are left to mourn the young whom they 've lost , " Professor Inglis said .
But he also believes their real meaning has been partly obscured by the years .
" A new generation probably views them a different way , sometimes as a statement for people of the futility of war .
" That 's not how they were erected in the first place .
When new ones are built these days they tend to be devoted retrospectively to people who served in all wars . "
Professor Inglis ' interest dates back to the 1960s when he observed that many memorials to the Great War received little attention .
In researching Sacred Places - his award winning study of war memorials - he sought to explain why war memorials once stood so prominently in the Australian landscape .
He found a nation , already grieving for its momentous losses on the battlefields of Europe and the Middle East , also divided on how best to commemorate its dead .
" There was a great controversy or a great uncertainly after the Great War , about whether to make the war memorials traditionally monumental , stone or bronze , or whether to make useful objects like halls and hospitals , " he said .
" So one faction said 'we do n't want cold , dead stone ' and the other said 'we do n't want to insult the dead by making a war memorial out of something we were going to build for ourselves anyway , like a hall ' . "
Consequently , memorials vary greatly in scale and scope observes Australian War Memorial historian Ashley Ekins .
" The one that everyone always remembers of course is the little digger on the pedestal , " Mr Ekins said .
" Sometimes with arms reversed and head bowed , sometimes standing erect with his rifle by his side , but then they ranged through a whole variety often depending on the wealth of the district , to really quite elaborate and beautiful bronze statues .
" Sometimes very martial in their character , soldiers with bayonets fixed and charging , sometimes fairly poignant , rescuing a wounded mate and so on .
" So they run the whole gamut of those things , but as well as those there are very simple , common memorials and I suppose the simplest form is the simple little obelisk ; a broken column on a pedestal with the names around the base - very poignant , simple little memorial and that 's the most common feature . "
Honouring the dead
Honouring the dead began while the war still raged and continued into the late 1930s .
By the time the last of the memorials had been dedicated , there was roughly one memorial for every 40 men who died .
Post war Australia was a nation in mourning ; 60,000 dead from a nation of less than 5 million and about 100,000 returned men who bore physical or mental scars .
Grieving families and communities in Australia had to decide how best to publicly commemorate their loss and with no government help had to raise all their own funds .
" For a small town it was n't a cheap enterprise to put this together and they had to get the expertise as well , " Mr Ekins said .
" A lot of the little diggers that people have come to associate with the Australian soldier so strongly were actually made in Italy .
" They were almost mass produced by Italian stone masons and even Italian stone masons in this country . "
Ken Inglis made another discovery ; Australia was the only allied nation whose memorials recorded all the names of those who served , not just those killed .
He reasons it is because they were all volunteers .
Even New Zealand had conscription and like New Zealand , the memorials became substitute graves for loved ones whose bodies lay in far off battlefields .
" Most families could n't afford to visit those graves so these became a substitute grave that they could visit , particularly on those important dates , like Anzac Day , our national day , " Ashley Ekins said .
" But also on Remembrance Day , Armistice Day as it used to be , and perhaps even on the days if they knew the date of death of the loved one , perhaps on that day too .
" But they were a central part of every little country community , dotted right across Australia . "
Other combatant nations such as France and America returned their bodies home .
There was a grass roots movement amongst returned diggers to bring home the body of an unknown soldier , a request denied because it ran counter to imperial government policy .
" Sixty thousand died and none of their remains were brought home until the Unknown Soldier , one single Australian was returned here in 1993 , 75 years after the end of the war , " Mr Ekins said .
Memorials and honour boards reveal a more obvious reality - the Great War 's shocking toll .
" You 'll often find men from the same family .
That was one of the tragedies of the war that a man in a battalion could claim his younger brother , to join him in that same battalion , " Mr Ekins said .
" And of course if that battalion came to grief in an incident , in an action , the likelihood was much higher that two might be killed or three as was often the case , and really it touched every single family in the land in one way of another . "
Remembrance found expression in other ways .
" You 've got things like avenues of trees - famously in Ballarat - the long avenue of trees , gardens , parks , gateways , conspicuous large gateways of memorials , so right through the country there are these different features , " Mr Ekins said .
" Often for the Second World War they went for more practical things ; parks and pools , gardens , but usually the custom was to attach the names to the old memorial .
" And it 's always conspicuous that the number of those that died in the Second World War is markedly lower than the First World War . "
There has been a resurgence of interest in memorials in recent years , but not all have survived the passage of years .
" Well the cold stone survived , nearly always and the halls did n't so people did n't know that they once had a war memorial , " Professor Inglis said .
" I think there 's a new recognition now and there 's another generation who are more curious about how they came into being and what it was that drove them , " Mr Ekins said .
" The conspicuous feature in all the little country towns will always remain those simple memorials that were erected after the First [ World War ] .
It 's a strange paradox , the further we go back in time the stronger the legend appears to become . "

Cities are havens for weirdness .
From communities built around garbage to dogs that ride the subway , urban environments have fostered all manner of weird patterns .
Here are the 10 freakiest urban ecosystems on the planet .

The other day , we showed you the Kowloon Walled City — a bizarre , super - dense development that arose as an accident of politics and urban ingenuity .
You ca n't visit the Walled City because it was torn down in the 1990s — but here are 10 other urban ecosystems that still exist .
They range from animal life adapting to cities , to developers gone mad , to cities clawing their way towards a new state of being .
They include a few urban environments that no longer support people , but still remain intact .

Moscow's Metro Dogs :
Stray dogs in Moscow are nothing new — they 've been around since the 19th century .
But around 500 dogs have started living in the Metro ( subway ) stations , begging for scraps from passengers .
The dogs have developed a keen instinct for which Muscovites are likely to feed them and which ones to avoid — an important survival trait since one Moscow woman stabbed a Metro dog a few years ago .
And instead of the strongest or fiercest dog being the Alpha dog of the Metro dog packs , the smartest one generally is , according to experts who 've studied them .
Not only that , but some of the Metro dogs have learned to ride the subway on their own , apparently recognizing stations based on the conductor calling out their names , plus sense of smell — and this lets them add multiple stations to their territories .
They even have their own website .
For other examples of weird urban animals , check out the baboon gangs of Cape Town and the coyotes of Los Angeles .

SubTropolis :
Many cities have weird subterranean structures — Paris and Rome have catacombs , Odessa has miles of weird tunnels that are full of human remains , smuggler gear , leftover war stuff and people 's random attempts to grow magic mushrooms — but only Kansas City has succeeded in turning its subterranean infrastructure into tons of office space and businesses .
Some 90 percent of the world 's " subsurface office space " is in Kansas City , in tunnels carved out by limestone miners , including 55 businesses in SubTropolis .
And many denizens of SubTropolis believe it 's the wave of the future , because its environmental impact is much lower .
It costs way less to heat and cool offices deep underground , and you do n't need as much energy - intensive materials like steel and aluminum .
The limestone keeps things cool and dry , so it 's perfect for storage .
And a whole SubTropolis culture has developed , in which people talk about getting a pillar instead of getting a corner office .

Thames Town
This quaint English village , housing 10,000 people , is just 20 miles outside the center of Shanghai , and a new rail system puts it just 15 minutes from downtown , as part of a rapidly expanding Greater Shanghai .
Thames
Town was designed to look exactly like a bucolic English town , complete with red brick buildings , a sandstone church , a village green , a market square , and a pub .
But it 's not a theme park - developers insist it 's a real residential community .
As the Independent wrote :
Residents can sip their bitter in a traditional English pub , " The Thames Town " , as children scamper across the medieval market square to a bilingual school , while red - brick warehouses form a commercial area on the waterfront .
Developers are targeting British companies such as Tesco and Sainsbury to add to the authentic high - street feel so the town's ... 10,000 residents can shop in true British style .
There are sporting facilities and everything a town of its size should have .

If you saw the movie Slumdog Millionaire , then you 've already seen this Mumbai slum , which occupies 0.67 square miles but houses between 600,000 and 1 million people , smack dab in the middle of greater Mumbai .
The tightly packed neighborhood has a strong sense of community , and a booming economy , as the Guardian reports :
Dharavi may be one of the world 's largest slums , but it is by far its most prosperous - a thriving business centre propelled by thousands of micro-entrepreneurs who have created an invaluable industry - turning around the discarded waste of Mumbai 's 19 million citizens .
A new estimate by economists of the output of the slum is as impressive as it seems improbable : £ 700 m a year .

According to National Geographic , the slum's two main streets are called 90 Feet Road and 60 Feet Road , after their widths — even though 60 Feet Road is actually wider .
Residents have jury - rigged access to things like water and plumbing , but there 's only one toilet per 60 people and everybody uses the local creek .
There 's a plan underway to redevelop the area and build fancy new housing for some — but not all — of its residents .

The Gowanus Canal :
This Brooklyn , NY canal is one of the foulest places on Earth , and it was recently named a federal Superfund site .
As housewife Eda Figueroa told the New York Daily News , " Any fish that goes in there dies of poison or if it lives , it becomes a zombie . "
But the canal 's extreme pollution , including cancer - causing agents , may turn out to be a blessing in disguise .
Two City College professors , the Haque sisters , have discovered evidence that the canal 's micro-organisms may have adapted to survive in such a toxic environment .
Explains Nasreen Haque , " Despite the canal 's toxicity , which includes cancer - causing chemical agents , microorganisms are surviving by adapting to the harsh environment there that should n't survive at all .
Working in synergy , they seem to sense if nutrients are available ; they exchange genes and secrete substances — some of which operate like antibiotics .
I believe these substances may provide clues that lead to the development of new drugs to combat human disease . "
The canal 's evolved organisms could provide the keys to curing Alzheimer 's , heart disease or AIDS .

Centralia , PA
In 1962 , sanitation workers in this town began setting fire to some garbage , near a disused mine opening .
The fire spread to a rich underground seam of coal , igniting a blaze that has been going for decades and could continue for up to 250 years according to some experts .
The fire expanded and mutated like an amoeba .
At first it was nice — the town 's residents no longer had to shovel snow off their sidewalks and tomatoes grew in the middle of winter .
But then trees started dying and after a child nearly fell down a sinkhole full of carbon monoxide in 1981 , the town was evacuated .
Now , only a few stubborn residents remain despite efforts to evacuate them .
( And rumor has it this town was the inspiration for the video game Silent Hill . )
Other urban developments abandoned due to disasters include Chernobyl and the nearby town Prypiat .

Manshiyat Naser / Garbage City
This area of Cairo , inhabited largely by a community of Coptic Christains known as the Zabbaleen , is completely packed with trash .
But it 's not necessarily due to a failure of public services or slumlike conditions .
It 's an ecosystem created by economics .
Many of the Zabbaleen make a living sorting the city 's trash .
People live and work alongside the garbage , and every space not occupied by garbage is taken up with livestock or makeshift gardens .
Some families had as many as 100 garbage - eating pigs living in their homes , until the Egyptian government launched a new pig- slaughtering policy .
The government also recently privatized garbage collection , giving the contract to foreign companies — which turned right around and outsourced the job to the Zabbaleen , who are getting less money than before .

Gunkanjima
Mitsubishi bought a reef and built it out into an artificial island , a kilometer long , so the company would have a base for undersea coal mining operations in the area .
And for many years , it was the world 's most densely populated place , with 85,500 people per square kilometer in 1959 — and 135,000 people per square kilometer in the densest areas .
The name , Gunkanjima , is Japanese for " Battleship Island , " because the artificial island resembles a battleship when seen from the ocean .
The island was completely closed down in 1975 , when the coal ran out , and now it 's quite possibly the world 's largest ghost town .
It looks like a dark fortress , its shadowy walls looming like death .

Petra
Anyone who has seen Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade will recognize Petra .
Built as the capital of the Nabataeans around the 6th century BC , it was a central stopping point for several trade routes that ran through the area .
Built in a rift valley , the city was virtually impregnable and also had the advantage of a steady , well - maintained water supply , thanks to underground cisterns that captured every drop of rainwater .
The advent of sea - based trade sent the city into rapid decline under Roman rule in the first couple of centuries AD .
The city 's remarkably well - preserved and restored , and a burgeoning urban area has sprung up on its outskirts to service the tourists who visit it .

The Snow Castle Of Kemi
Every year , the town of Kemi in Finland rebuilds its snow castle , including restaurants , an art gallery , a hotel and a chapel .
It 's believed to be the largest snow castle in the world , and its architecture changes every year .
Typically , the castle has occupied between 13,000 and 20,000 square meters , with its tallest tower typically being 20 meters tall .
Finnish power - metal band Sonata Arctica performed in the castle in 2007 .
Here are some polar bears made out of ice guarding a tunnel inside the castle :

An Islamic group based in New York said that a recent episode of “ South Park , ” the satirical animated series , insulted the Prophet Muhammad , and compared the show ’s creators , Trey Parker and Matt Stone , to Theo van Gogh , the Dutch filmmaker who was killed in 2004 by an Islamic militant , CNN reported .
The group , Revolution Muslim , published its post after a “ South Park ” episode last week that depicted the founders of various religions , including Moses , Jesus and Buddha , but declined to show the Prophet Muhammad , instead representing him as wearing a bear costume .
The post , written by Abu Talhah Al - Amrikee , said that the episode had “ outright insulted ” Muhammad , adding : “ We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid , and they will probably wind up like Theo van Gogh for airing this show .
This is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them . ”
Mr. van Gogh was killed in Amsterdam after making a film that discussed the abuse of Muslim women in some Islamic societies .
A telephone message left at a number listed on the group ’s Web site , revolutionmuslim.com , was not immediately returned ; on Wednesday the Web site was largely inaccessible .
Comedy Central declined to comment on the group ’s remarks or say if it was taking any precautions because of them .
El Camino will be established on Aaron Paul ’s Jesse Pinkman .
Netflix has released a title and release date for the cutting off horrible turn movie .
About El Camino .
This motion picture is facilitated by Vince Gilligan .
A mystery was released by Netflix .
The riddle told about the release date and the plots .
The movie will release on October 11 , 2019 .
This film will be established in Aaron Paul ’s Pinkman .
After he continues running from the Neo - Nazis and Walter White , Pinkman is still on the continued running from the law .
The star of the secret released is Skinny Pete .
He is Jesse ’s past friend and astute accessory .
The official theoretical of the film lights up that the breaking horrendous reunites with Jesse Pinkman .
The film will show how Jesse ponders his past to create a type of future .
The movie is conveyed by Mark Johnson , Melissa Bernstein , Charles Newirth , Aaron Paul and Diane Mercer in association with SONY .
One of the cast part , Bob Odenkirk who plays Saul Goodman revealed that the film has wrapped up shooting .
Where is Pinkman ?
In Breaking Bad season 3 a fasten demonstrated Pinkman getting out Walter White for crushing his life .
At the finale of the course of action , Pinkman was seen taking off from the Nazi pack .
He made sense of how to get shielded separately .
Aaron Paul mentioned that the gathering of onlookers watches a breaking horrendous scene before El Camino .
He asks fans to rewatch a critical Jesse Pinkman scene before the new film debuts .
Paul needs fans to review Pinkman .
He will be detached from the cutting - edge film .
In the wake of his emotional departure from bondage in an El Camino vehicle subsequent to being saved by Bryan Cranson ’s Walter White in the “ Breaking Bad ” arrangement finale , Jesse should now accommodate his past so as to fashion a future .
Betrayed : Iraq hero is placed behind criminals in queue for a home
Hero : Private Joe MacDonald and his family wanted a council house but were offered a room in a hostel instead
Fighting on the hellish battlefields of Iraq , he risked his life for his country every day .
But when Private Joe MacDonald asked his local authority to help find his young family a house , his sacrifice counted for nothing .
He first met with a point - blank refusal , followed by the offer of nothing more than a room in a hostel for himself , his wife and three young children .
The council , which organises the provision of social housing through housing associations , put his case behind the unemployed , single mothers , criminals freed from prison and asylum seekers .
It claimed that because he was leaving the Army he was deliberately making himself homeless .
The bizarre loophole could affect thousands of military personnel when they end their service .
Pte MacDonald , 25 , completed a gruelling seven - month tour of duty with the Royal Logistic Corps in southern Iraq in 2006 .
He fought gun battles with Iraqi insurgents as he protected Army convoys carrying food , fuel , ammunition and kit to troops in UK bases around the British - held part of the country .
Last year he decided to quit the regiment to spend more time with his family and began searching for accommodation once his final posting in Germany ends this month .
He was born and brought up in Bexley , south - east London , and his parents still live there .
But he was stunned when the council refused to provide a house for him and his wife Rachael , 21 , and children Ellen - May , four , Harry - Joe , 19 months , and baby Maissy - Ann .
Pte MacDonald said officials told him that because he was making himself homeless by voluntarily leaving Army quarters , he was ineligible for any property at all .
Later , they offered the family the hostel room where they would have to share a bathroom , kitchen and living room with other families .
Pte MacDonald fears he and his family will be forced to live with his mother - in - law near Salisbury , Wiltshire , where nine people will have to share the house .
He said : ‘ I have put my life on the line .
I have been to war and spent nine years in service for this country .
It is absolutely disgusting that it is not recognised .
‘ I am retraining as an IT engineer and desperately need somewhere for my family to stay as I wo n’t earn enough initially to afford private accommodation .
' It seems incredible that no one can find me a council house to live in while I find my feet .
It seems like people in the Army are last on the list to be given help . ’
In 2008 , the Ministry of Defence pledged to give fairer treatment to forces ’ families over accommodation .
Homeless : Soldier Joe MacDonald with his wife Rachel , and children Ellen - May , Harry - Joe and Maissy - Ann
Recognising that the military struggle to get council housing because they go back to the bottom of the waiting list each time they move to different area of the country during their careers , ministers vowed to make it easier for them to apply for social housing .
Bernard Jenkin , a Tory MP on the defence select committee , said : ‘ Labour gives the impression that veterans get priority for public services , including housing , but the reality is that they do n’t .
' We urgently need a agency dedicated to looking after the welfare of veterans . ’
A Royal British Legion spokesman said : ‘ We are extremely concerned by this .
The Government ’s guidance to local councils makes it quite clear that service personnel should not be considered to be intentionally homeless in circumstances such as these .
We will seek to ensure he is not discriminated against for selflessly serving his country . ’
A Bexley Council spokesman said : ‘ Mr MacDonald and his family contacted us in January for help with housing when he voluntarily leaves the Army .
He has tied accommodation provided by the Army and he is not yet homeless .
‘ He has some time in which to make arrangements for his housing and the council will try to help him find private rented accommodation in this area .
' Mr MacDonald told us that he has had two postings in Germany but made no mention of active service in Iraq . ’
JPMorgan Chase reports $ 3.3 billion profit
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Profits at JPMorgan Chase jumped 55 % from a year ago to $ 3.3 billion on the back of the bank 's Wall Street business and an improvement in the overall economy .
The first of the nation 's top banks to report first - quarter results , JPMorgan Chase said Wednesday it earned 74 cents a share during the first quarter , easily topping what investors were anticipating .

Even as its consumer - banking business weighed on its latest results , JPMorgan Chase managed to deliver better - than - expected profits in the latest quarter .
JPMorgan Chase shares , which climbed as much as 3.4 % during Wednesday 's session , are up sharply from a year ago .
Consensus estimates from analysts were for the New York City - based bank to record a profit of 64 cents a share , according to Thomson Reuters .
Powering the firm 's latest results was its investment banking business , particularly trading activity within its fixed income division .
The investment banking unit booked $ 2.5 billion in profits during the quarter .
An improvement in the broader U.S. economy also helped alleviate some of the troubles within the company 's traditional lending businesses , which have been buffeted by the high level of unemployment and persistent weakness in the housing market .
" There is a clear and broad - based improvement in economic factors in the U.S. and around the world , " said Jamie Dimon , the company 's chairman and CEO .
" I think the chance of a double dip is rapidly going away . "
Delinquencies within the bank 's mortgage , auto and student lending business , for example , fell during the quarter .
JPMorgan
Chase said the percentage of its credit card holders who were 30 days behind on a payment was 1.47 % , down from 1.75 % in the fourth quarter .
The bank scaled back on the number of reserves for future loan losses in its credit card division by $ 1 billion , suggesting that troubles within that business could soon start to moderate .
Standard & Poor 's analyst Matt Albrecht wrote in a note to clients Wednesday that the bank should be able to further reduce provisions for loan losses because of the improved credit trends .
Still , JPMorgan 's consumer banking and credit card business both ended the quarter in the red , with its persistently troubled card division delivering a loss of $ 303 million .
But when pressed about his outlook for the credit card business , Dimon said that it could very well turn profitable by year end .
The company also reiterated that it planned on adding 9,000 jobs in the U.S. across a number of different areas , including its private and retail banking businesses , hinting that it is priming itself for growth .
The firm however , did not provide a time frame as to when those workers would be hired .
JPMorgan 's latest results extend the good fortune the firm has enjoyed throughout the crisis .
Unlike many of its peers , the bank has managed to stay profitable over the past two years .
Its latest results are also likely to set a high bar for the rest of the nation 's top banks due to report in the coming weeks .
On deck is rival Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , which will deliver its results before Friday 's opening bell .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) are scheduled to report their first quarter results next week .
JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) shares gained nearly 3 % in midday trading Wednesday on the news .

As the sun emerges from a long lull in activity , the star ’s emissions in the radio band of the spectrum have also picked up .
And from a shed on three acres of land outside Santa Fe , New Mexico , amateur radio astronomer Thomas Ashcraft is making recordings of them available for download .
“ The Sun has become hyper - dynamic the past few days , ” Ashcraft wrote on his website Sunday , along with links to four “ specimens ” of radio bursts , as he calls them .
The sun is crackling with solar flares now as a very large sunspot continues to circle our star .
The recent solar activity almost assuredly signals the end of the solar minimum .
Only 5 percent of the days in 2010 have seen a blank sun .
In 2008 and 2009 , more than 70 percent of the days had no sunspot activity .
Here is what one long burst sounded like on Sunday .
Not all bursts sound the same , though .
Another kind , Type V , is generally shorter and sharper .
They happen to be Ashcraft ’s favorites .
“ I like that one because they are very strong and very fast , ” Ashcraft told Wired.com .
“ They are only short lived , only a minute or two minutes .
You can get a rush out of it .
You can get high off of it .
You can trip on it a little bit . ”
Ashcraft recorded a decently powerful Type V on Sunday .
The wires running from the antennas on his property to his observatory are visible in the photo above .
The physics of solar radio emissions are quite complicated , but Ashcraft just likes to listen to the radio static out in the shed on his property .
It gives him a feel for what the sun is doing , he said .
He held up the phone to his speakers where the standard hiss of the radio , speckled by cosmic background radiation , constantly plays .
“ I have that playing at a low level .
I ’m able to hear when there are sudden fluctuations , ” Ashcraft said .
“ That makes me hypersensitive to the sun .
I consider my antennas , which are mostly dipole antennas , I consider them my hyperextended nervous systems , so I can feel subtle solar movements . ”
When he processes the recordings , Ashcraft likes to track one frequency ( say , 21 megahertz ) in one channel and another ( say , 24 megahertz ) in the other channel .
It tends to give his specimens what he calls “ spatiality ” and a kind of pulsating effect .
That ’s because he is n’t just trying to record the sun , he ’s trying to make it into something with which people can connect .
“ I sort of see it as a possible musical form of the future .
You know ?
An energetic form , ” Ashcraft said .
“ Maybe the word is n’t even art anymore , it ’s almost nutritional to the nervous system in a way that I do n’t know about , but I ’m groping towards , kind of as an artist . ”
After almost 20 years of studying the sun , Ashcraft said his view of being a human has actually changed .
“ I ’m very conscious of myself as an organism , an electroreceptor sensing the sun , ” Ashcroft said .
“ It ’s human , but the human is a subset of being an organism . ”

Is there a comparable argument to be made for greenhouse - gas emissions ?
My initial reaction , which I suspect most economists would share , is that the very scale and complexity of the situation requires a market - based solution , whether cap and trade or an emissions tax .
After all , greenhouse gases are a direct or indirect byproduct of almost everything produced in a modern economy , from the houses we live in to the cars we drive .
Reducing emissions of those gases will require getting people to change their behavior in many different ways , some of them impossible to identify until we have a much better grasp of green technology .
So can we really make meaningful progress by telling people specifically what will or will not be permitted ?
Econ 101 tells us — probably correctly — that the only way to get people to change their behavior appropriately is to put a price on emissions so this cost in turn gets incorporated into everything else in a way that reflects ultimate environmental impacts .
When shoppers go to the grocery store , for example , they will find that fruits and vegetables from farther away have higher prices than local produce , reflecting in part the cost of emission licenses or taxes paid to ship that produce .
When businesses decide how much to spend on insulation , they will take into account the costs of heating and air - conditioning that include the price of emissions licenses or taxes for electricity generation .
When electric utilities have to choose among energy sources , they will have to take into account the higher license fees or taxes associated with fossil - fuel consumption .
And so on down the line .
A market - based system would create decentralized incentives to do the right thing , and that ’s the only way it can be done .
That said , some specific rules may be required .
James Hansen , the renowned climate scientist who deserves much of the credit for making global warming an issue in the first place , has argued forcefully that most of the climate - change problem comes down to just one thing , burning coal , and that whatever else we do , we have to shut down coal burning over the next couple decades .
My economist ’s reaction is that a stiff license fee would strongly discourage coal use anyway .
But a market - based system might turn out to have loopholes — and their consequences could be dire .
So I would advocate supplementing market - based disincentives with direct controls on coal burning .
What about the case for an emissions tax rather than cap and trade ?
There ’s no question that a straightforward tax would have many advantages over legislation like Waxman - Markey , which is full of exceptions and special situations .
But that ’s not really a useful comparison : of course an idealized emissions tax looks better than a cap - and - trade system that has already passed the House with all its attendant compromises .
The question is whether the emissions tax that could actually be put in place is better than cap and trade .
There is no reason to believe that it would be — indeed , there is no reason to believe that a broad - based emissions tax would make it through Congress .
To be fair , Hansen has made an interesting moral argument against cap and trade , one that ’s much more sophisticated than the old view that it ’s wrong to let polluters buy the right to pollute .
What Hansen draws attention to is the fact that in a cap - and - trade world , acts of individual virtue do not contribute to social goals .
If you choose to drive a hybrid car or buy a house with a small carbon footprint , all you are doing is freeing up emissions permits for someone else , which means that you have done nothing to reduce the threat of climate change .
He has a point .
But altruism cannot effectively deal with climate change .
Any serious solution must rely mainly on creating a system that gives everyone a self - interested reason to produce fewer emissions .
It ’s a shame , but climate altruism must take a back seat to the task of getting such a system in place .
The bottom line , then , is that while climate change may be a vastly bigger problem than acid rain , the logic of how to respond to it is much the same .
What we need are market incentives for reducing greenhouse - gas emissions — along with some direct controls over coal use — and cap and trade is a reasonable way to create those incentives .
But can we afford to do that ?
Equally important , can we afford not to ?
The Cost of Action
Just as there is a rough consensus among climate modelers about the likely trajectory of temperatures if we do not act to cut the emissions of greenhouse gases , there is a rough consensus among economic modelers about the costs of action .
That general opinion may be summed up as follows : Restricting emissions would slow economic growth — but not by much .
The Congressional Budget Office , relying on a survey of models , has concluded that Waxman - Markey “ would reduce the projected average annual rate of growth of gross domestic product between 2010 and 2050 by 0.03 to 0.09 percentage points . ”
That is , it would trim average annual growth to 2.31 percent , at worst , from 2.4 percent .
Over all , the Budget Office concludes , strong climate - change policy would leave the American economy between 1.1 percent and 3.4 percent smaller in 2050 than it would be otherwise .

Latest poll ( Sunday Times / YouGov ) : Labour nine seats short of a majority .
" Gordon Brown on course to win election " is a headline almost no one would have expected to see at this stage of the electoral cycle .
But today 's YouGov poll confirms what a terrible start the Conservatives have made to their campaign .
It puts the Tories on 37 per cent , just 2 points ahead of Labour , and the party 's lowest lead since December 2008 .
If the figures were repeated on a uniform swing at the election , Labour would emerge as the largest single party in a hung parliament , nine seats short of an overall majority .
The poll is particularly alarming for the Tories for two reasons .
First , it suggests that the potential number of Labour voters is far higher than previously thought .
Second , it suggests that the Tories suffer when their policies come under sustained scrutiny .
Brown 's call for voters to " take a second look at us , and a long , hard look at them " seems to have resonated with the media and the public .
How else can we explain the Conservatives ' precipitous decline ?
New Statesman poll of polls
Labour 28 seats short of a majority .
As I 've pointed out before , the fragile nature of the economic recovery appears to be working in Brown 's favour -- it strengthens his argument that immediate spending cuts would damage the economy and upsets the Tories ' message .
The poll also confirms that the bullying allegations against the PM have done no damage to Labour 's support .
It may be that the voters actually rather like being led by someone with a bit of a temper .
Brown will surely now be tempted to call an election while the political momentum is with Labour and go to the country in April .
But I 'd still be surprised if he does n't plump for 6 May in order to avoid the cost of holding two separate elections .
As a word of caution to Labour optimists , it 's worth pointing out that there 's still almost no chance of Brown winning an overall majority .
Boundary changes mean that Labour 's 66 - seat majority has fallen to a notional lead of 48 .
This leaves Cameron with only 24 seats to win to knock off Labour 's overall advantage .
I expect the Tories still to be leading in the key marginals .
But for Labour to emerge as the largest single party would be an astonishing turnaround .
That the Tories are still struggling to defeat a government battered by recession and the expenses scandal is quite remarkable .
Can Cameron lead a successful Tory comeback ?
He has done so before , of course , in the run-up to the election - that - never was .
We 'll begin to find out later today .

In my ongoing quest to get a Grantlee release out the door , I recently imported the KRichTextBuilders from kdepimlibs and renamed them Grantlee : : RichTextBuilders .
I wrote those classes in 2008 but they were never used yet , and their headers were never installed .
The reason for that is mainly that I was not happy with the API .
The intention of the builders classes was to make it easier to create “ cleaner ” html from a QTextDocument that what is returned from QTextDocument : : toHtml ( ) .
Users seem to have a lot of complaints about it taking more space than it needs to , but on a more relevant level , the toHtml call returns a html document complete with metadata such as a element which needs to be removed if data from multiple QTextDocuments is to be combined into one with an external theme , as is the case with KJots .
Up to now the way KJots has done that is to have an aggregation QTextDocument and do something like
foreach ( QTextDocument * page , book ) aggregationDocument->insertHtml ( page.toHtml( ) ) ;
There is some other processing done to put things like breadcrumbs and table of contents into the aggregation document .
That works , but it ties the content of the aggregation document into the C++ code , which is exactly what I want to avoid in the bright future with Grantlee .
All of that stuff , including the placement and content of the table of contents , and even whether it should exist at all should be externalized to Grantlee themes .
I recently wrote about that with screenshots on the dot .
Additionally , the toHtml ( ) does not know what to create in the html output when it comes across the custom QTextObject you have inserted into your document .
Finally , maybe you do n’t want to output html from your QTextDocument at all , but you want the contents output as MediaWiki markup or Markdown .
What then ?
The more flexible way to get the data out of a QTextDocument is then to iterate over the content of it , which is made up of QTextFrames and QTextBlocks .
That is exactly what the RichTextBuilders written back in 2008 do .
I had just finished reading the GoF book ( that is , Gang of Four 🙂 ) about design patterns , which has an example of exactly this problem , and so I used an interpretation of the Builder pattern to implement them .
QTextObjectInterface
The problem is that was not extensible in all the ways QTextDocument is .
Custom objects may be inserted into a QTextDocument to do anything you want .
For example , maybe you want to drop sound files into your notes application and get a nice widget for playing it .
When you export the file to html you want the sound file to still be usable in the exported version .
The way this is done in the application is to implement QTextObjectInterface , insert the custom object as a UnicodeReplacementCharacter with a specific QTextCharFormat , and that can be intercepted and drawn in a custom way later when laying out the document in a QTextEdit .
The problem is that adding that kind of functionality to the RichTextBuilders would require adding a new virtual function in the AbstractMarkupBuilder , and adding calls to that in the MarkupDirector .
Adding new virtual functions is not really an option if binary compatibility is to be maintained .
I realized though that the use of virtual inheritance would allow me to extend the Builder interface to output custom markup , and to implement the code in the MarkupDirector to handle the custom QTextObjects , or to handle custom QTextBlockUserData .
That is exactly what the textedit example in the Grantlee source does .
The AbstractAudioBuilder interface defines an extra method for creating markup for representing audio .
That interface is implemented by AudioTextHtmlBuilder , which also inherits the rest of Grantlee : : TextHTMLMarkupBuilder , and by AudioPlainTextBuilder , which also inherits the rest of Grantlee : : PlainTextMarkupBuilder .
The Audio*Builder implementations really only implement support for creating output for representing audio .
There is very strong separation of concerns .
In turn , the AudioTextDocumentDirector is concerned only with extracting the audio information from the QTextDocument .
The entire process is also documented in the Handling Custom QTextObjects example .
The result is a text editing application which can play and export sounds .
Maybe KJots 4.6 will have a feature like this .
On the left is a QText Edit whose content is editable and which supports a stylish play button , and on the right , a QWebKit element which supports the html5 element showing the exported version .
Unfortunately , I get hangs with even trivial WebKit using apps , so I ’ve put the text of the audio tag in the output instead of the actual tag because I can’t test it properly .
Of course it uses Phonon internally .
KJots in trunk already uses Akonadi and Plasma , with more integration with Nepomuk , GHNS and now Phonon potentially in the future .
Now all I need is an excuse to add a Marble dependency .

Riders have slammed the penalty as excessive and " crazy " and the council says it has seven signs around the square warning riders they risk a fine .
Community Services chair Geraldine Knapp said riders received a warning before being fined unless they were directly endangering public safety or damaging property .
" People have n't been allowed to cycle or skate through King George Square for almost 40 years so this is nothing new , " Cr Knapp said .
" These are busy public spaces and we can't have cyclists or skaters careering through crowds of people and knocking them over .
" The best way for people to avoid a fine is to hop off their bike or board and walk it through the square , just as they would when they 're crossing the road . "
Veteran skateboarder Sam Messina said he knew several people who had copped the fine .
" $ 500 is pretty crazy , what do you have to do in your car to cop a $ 500 fine ? " the Skatebiz manager said .
" I can see their [ public safety ] point but that 's a lot of money for riding a skateboard . "
Instead of fining people they should be promoting the sport as a healthy activity and getting more people into it .
Mr Messina said the council should be encouraging more people to use the environmentally - friendly and healthy alternative to cars .
He no longer skates in the city because there are too many no - go zones .
" I do n't think it should be a problem for people to skate through [ the square ] , " Mr Messina said .
" Obviously if they 're wrecking public property then that 's a different story but a lot of people use skateboarding for transport .
" Instead of fining people they should be promoting the sport as a healthy activity and getting more people into it .
" They spend all this money on other means of transport like busways and tunnels , they should [ spend some to promote ] skateboarding , bikes , rollerblades as an effective means of transport . "
Bicycle Queensland manager Ben Wilson , who represents 11,000 cyclists , said he was in disbelief the fine was so high .
" That seems to be well out of kilter with fines for other misdemeanours , " Mr Wilson said .
He was not aware of his members copping the fine and suggested it could be kids riding BMX bikes or couriers using it as a short cut and riding too fast .
Mr Wilson said he would seek confirmation from council that cautious cyclists would not be fined in the square on their way to the new bike parking station .
" It 's a city link to be able to get through to the roadway in front of King George Square , " he said .
Since September last year , on - the - spot fines of $ 500 have been issued rather than sending offenders to court , where the penalty could be increased to $ 5000 .

" Eagle ! "
The shout goes up as a great shadow sweeps over our boat .
The white - tailed eagle makes its descent to one of the 24,000 islands that make up Sweden 's pine - covered , rocky Stockholm Archipelago .
The tourists on board for this nature tour in August 2009 mostly miss the photo op .
But local wildlife expert Peter Westman , of the conservation group WWF Sweden , assures the group that there will be others .
Numbers of this once - threatened predator have soared from 1,000 to more than 23,000 in the Baltic Sea ( map ) since pollutants including DDT , an eggshell - thinning pesticide , and PCBs , chemical compounds used in electrical equipment , were banned in the 1970s , Westman said .
But there is a new danger to the eagle and many other marine species :
An explosion of microscopic algae called phytoplankton has inundated the Baltic 's sensitive waters , sucking up oxygen and choking aquatic life .
Though a natural phenomenon at a smaller scale , these blooms have recently mushroomed at an alarming rate , fed by nutrients such as phosphorous and nitrogen from agricultural fertilizers and sewage .
When it rains , farm fertilizers are washed into the sea .
Sewage - treatment facilities also discharge waste into the Baltic ecosystem .
As a result , the Baltic is now home to seven of the of the world 's ten largest marine " dead zones " — areas where the sea 's oxygen has been used up by seabed bacteria that decompose the raining mass of dead algae .
" We ’ve had enormous algal blooms here the last few years which have affected the whole ecosystem , " Westman said .
Overfishing Adding to Algal Blooms
Overfishing of Baltic cod has greatly intensified the problem , Westman said .
Cod eat sprats , a small , herring - like species that eat microscopic marine creatures called zooplankton that in turn eat the algae .
So , fewer cod and an explosion of zooplankton - eating sprats means more algae and less oxygen .
This vicious cycle gets worse as the spreading dead zones engulf the cod ’s deep - water breeding grounds , he added .
The algal blooms , which can be toxic to animals and human swimmers , leave behind an ugly layer of green scum that fouls tourist beaches and starves seaweeds of light .
" Other species have taken the place [ of seaweed ] , which do n’t provide as good habitats for fish , " especially juveniles , Westman said .
" In the past couple of years common fishes like pike and perch have had virtually no reproduction in the inner part of the archipelago . "
Too Late to Save the Baltic Sea ?
Back in Stockholm , it 's World Water Week , the annual global meeting on water issues organized by the Stockholm International Water Institute .
On a conference room wall is a satellite image of the Baltic Sea , its deep blue edges giving way to a swirling , milky center that shows the algal blooms .
World Water
Week attendees are pushing a new action plan called the Baltic Sea Strategy .
The European Union - led initiative will attempt to coordinate the efforts of the eight EU members within the nine Baltic states — not including Russia — to revitalize their shared sea .
While the speakers all agree " it ’s time for action , " they do n’t sound optimistic .
" It might well be too late , " said Søren Nors Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen .
The planet ’s youngest sea at less than 10,000 years old , the Baltic is unique in that it formed after the last ice age .
It 's also one of the world ’s largest bodies of brackish water .
" Experience tells us such a system is almost impossible to predict , " Nielsen said .
The Baltic Sea 's unusual mix of fresh water and marine species means it's also especially vulnerable to environmental changes .
" Evolution did n’t have time to develop an ecosystem able to tolerate flux , " Nielsen explained .
Water - law attorney Megan Walline of the Stockholm International Water Institute , who spoke at the Baltic Sea presentation , said there 's already " a sea of laws " for dealing with human activities that threaten the Baltic .
Too numerous to list , they include existing EU directives that cover nutrient pollution and illegal fishing .
The laws are there , they just need to be implemented , she said .
For his part , WWF ’s Westman hopes the new EU strategy will at least turn the Baltic into " a kind of test area for enforcing and implementing the directives . "
For instance , the plan calls for phasing out phosphates in laundry and kitchen detergents , and putting in place more sustainable fishing regulations .
Even so , " There are no quick fixes , unfortunately , " Westman concludes , reaching for his binoculars .
Twitter has published an announcement on its blog where it attributes a recent phishing attack to an unnamed torrent site script .
Twitter is blaming a torrent site developer for intentionally installing backdoors into the code he sells to people who want to run a torrent site of their own .
The big question is , who is behind this attack ?
Twitter alleges that a torrent script developer has installed backdoors into his software , allowing it to gain login credentials of users .
These credentials have been abused to boost the follower count of unnamed Twitter accounts .
Below is an excerpt of Twitters blog post revealing the threat .
It appears that for a number of years , a person has been creating torrent sites that require a login and password as well as creating forums set up for torrent site usage and then selling these purportedly well - crafted sites and forums to other people innocently looking to start a download site of their very own .
However , these sites came with a little extra — security exploits and backdoors throughout the system .
This person then waited for the forums and sites to get popular and then used those exploits to get access to the username , email address , and password of every person who had signed up .
Additional exploits to gain admin root on forums that were n’t created by this person also appear to have been utilized ; in some instances , the exploit involved redirecting attempts to access the forums to another site that would request log - in information .
This information was then used to attempt to gain access to third party sites like Twitter .
So , the company blames ‘ someone ’ of installing backdoors in a torrent site script that was sold to prospective torrent sites operators , something that has apparently gone unnoticed for years .
The question that comes to mind immediately is , if this is such a serious and widespread threat , why does n’t Twitter name the source or at least give some examples of affected sites ?
All of the popular public torrent sites are custom built and cannot be the source of the exploit .
From the information Twitter has made available it seems they could be blaming a private tracker script for the attack – most private trackers also operate forums which matches Twitter ’s description of the sites involved .
There are quite a few private tracker scripts out there and the most established ones , such as TBDev and Gazelle for example , have been examined by untold numbers of experts and come free of charge – any suggestion that they could be involved in underhand activity is unthinkable .
But there are also a few scripts that are created by middle - men whose reputations are less - easily tested .
Accusations of including back doors and exploits in tracker code are not new .
The owner of Template Shares , a site that sells a heavily modified version of the TBDev BitTorrent tracker script , has been accused by several people of installing backdoors which provide access to the user databases of customers ’ sites .
Template Shares is used by hundreds of smaller private BitTorrent trackers .
To warn the public , other online services and the operators of the affected torrent sites , it would be appropriate if Twitter gave out some more information .
TorrentFreak will continue to look into this case and will post an update if we find out more .
( CNN ) -- Afghan authorities will investigate the sudden illness of students and staff at three schools in the past week in northern Afghanistan , the Afghan Human Independent Rights Commission said on Sunday .
Local doctors suggested the Taliban may be the perpetrators of possible poison attacks .
" During the last seven days three cases of poisoning [ have ] occurred in Kunduz Province , " said Syed Karim Talash , the director of the commission office in the province .
At least 88 girls and teachers became ill in separate cases at three girls ' schools .
The cause of the illnesses was not known , but Talash said poison gas was suspected .
" It is really big concern for us , and big concern for the family of the girls , " Talash said .
Dr. Mohammad Qasam Khamoosh , who treated girls from two schools , said " unknown gases " were responsible for the mass illnesses .
These are " terrorist activities against education in the country , " he said .
Girls were not allowed to attend school during the Taliban 's rule .
Girls ' schools have been open in the region since 2001 .
Khamoosh said authorities were able to gather a sample of the gas , which has been sent off for testing .
Kunduz province has seen a drastic influx in terrorist activity , particularly by the group known as Hizb - e - Islami , led by the notorious leader Gulbudeen Hekmatyar .
It 's an independent group that has increasingly worked under the Taliban umbrella in recent years .
CNN 's Atia Abawi and journalist Muhib Habibi contributed to this report .

Gov. Brad Henry AP file OKLAHOMA CITY ( AP )  Oklahoma Gov. Brad
Henry vetoed two abortion bills that he said are an unconstitutional attempt by the Legislature to insert government into the private lives and decisions of citizens .
One measure would have required women to undergo an intrusive ultrasound and listen to a detailed description of the fetus before getting abortions .
Henry said Friday that legislation is flawed because it does not allow rape and incest victims to be exempted .
Lawmakers who supported the vetoed measures promised an override vote in the House and Senate as early as next week .
A national abortion rights group has said the ultrasound bill would have been among the strictest anti-abortion measures in the United States if it had been signed into law .
Henry said " it would be unconscionable to subject rape and incest victims to such treatment " because it would victimize a victim a second time .
" State policymakers should never mandate that a citizen be forced to undergo any medical procedure against his or her will , especially when such a procedure could cause physical or mental trauma .
To do so amounts to an unconstitutional invasion of privacy , " he said .
Under the ultrasound legislation , doctors would have been required to use a vaginal probe in cases where it would provide a clearer picture of the fetus than a regular ultrasound .
Doctors have said this is usually the case early in pregnancies , when most abortions are done .
Henry vetoed similar legislation in 2008 but was overridden by lawmakers .
The bill was struck down by an Oklahoma County judge before it went into effect on the grounds that it contained multiple subjects in violation of the state Constitution .
The second abortion bill that the governor vetoed Friday was one that would have prohibited pregnant women from seeking damages if physicians withhold important information or provide inaccurate information about their pregnancy .
Supporters of that measure said it was an attempt to keep pregnant women from discriminating against fetuses with disabilities .
But Henry said the bill would allow unscrupulous or negligent physicians to withhold or provide inaccurate information without facing the potential of legal consequences .
Tony Lauinger , state chairman of the anti-abortion group Oklahomans for Life and vice president of the National Right to Life Committee , said each of the measures are designed to protect the unborn as well as pregnant women .
" It is just as important for a woman who is pregnant as a result of rape or incest as it is for any other woman to have the benefit of full and complete information prior to taking the irrevocable step of having her baby aborted , " Lauinger said .
Stephanie Toti , an attorney for the New York - based abortion rights group , Center for Reproductive Rights , applauded the governor 's vetoes .
The group has said the ultrasound bill would have been among the strictest anti-abortion measures in the nation .
" The patient has no autonomy to make a decision .
And the physician has no discretion , " Toti said .
Henry did sign one abortion bill into law Friday : one requiring abortion clinics to post signs stating it is against the law for anyone to force a woman to have an abortion , and that an abortion will not be performed until the woman gives her voluntary consent .
Earlier this month ,
Henry signed three other abortion - related bills , including a ban on abortions based on the gender of the child and tighter restrictions on the use of the RU - 486 abortion pill .
At least two other abortion measures are pending in the Oklahoma Legislature , including one that would require pregnant women to complete a lengthy questionnaire before receiving an abortion .

Trawl a few forums for advice on which high - end graphics card to buy at the moment and you ’ll likely hit a torrent of scorn that implies you ’re wasting your money , that the consoles are holding back PC game engine development and that you ’re Hitler in disguise ( there ’s always someone who has to lower the tone ) .
Hitler jibes aside , the rest of the criticism is bad news if you ’re a graphics card manufacturer , and worse if you make GPUs .
The obvious answer to the problem ( perceived or real ) of stagnation in pixel processing finesse is to develop some kind of technology that raises theof pixels to process : enter ATI 's Eyefinity .
Eyefinity ws introduced back in September 2009 , with the first Cypress GPU , which powered the Radeon HD 5870 .
ATI built three output controllers into the back - end of the GPU , and that let you output to three screens concurrently from one card , so it 's something that all standard HD 5870s are capable of .
Crazier still , ATI showed an Eyefinity Edition of the HD 5870 , which could output to six screens simultaneously .
It ’s this card - called the HD 5870 Eyefinity 6 - that we have today and will be looking at .
As this is the only model of graphics card in the world that can run games across six screens , there ’s nothing to really compare it to for huge - display gaming , something of a problem if you want real technical analysis of it .
We ’re also less than convinced that six - screen gaming is a particularly good idea from our first look at Eyefinity .
The problem is that with a two x three screen configuration , there will always be a double width of bezel right in your eye - line , which breaks the suspension of disbelief with irritating ease .
ATI says that Samsung is working on bezel - less screens , but Samsung ’s PR agency denies any knowledge of such a product , which at best means that such screens are n’t going to arrive any time soon .
Even if you have bezel - less screens , there ’s a problem is how you turn them on or off or adjust the OSD – presumably the buttons will be on the back of the screen , which means they ’ll be awkward to get to if you have six of them mounted edge - to - edge .
Even if you ’re planning to use low - resolution projectors , three would be fine unless you really fancy playing games as if you ’re sitting in the front row of the cinema .
As a result of the fact that six - screen gaming is such an oddity , when it comes to performance testing , in this article , we 're going to concentrate on three - screen gaming .
This allows us to directly compare the special HD 5870 Eyefinity 6 card with ATI ’s existing range .
The Eyefinity 6 card differs from a standard Radeon HD 5870 is two ways .
Firstly , it has 2GB of GDDR5 memory rather than 1GB ( though this runs at the usual 1.2GHz , or 4.8GHz effective ) and secondly , it has six mini-Display Port outputs rather than a jumble of standard - szied connections .
As mini-DisplayPort ports are so small , ATI can line them up and leave the entire second slot ’s worth of backplate clear for a rear cooler vent .
The addition of extra memory obviously leads to an increase in the cost of the card , though we doubt it ’s the extra memory alone that accounts for the £ 110 price difference between a HD 5870 ( at £ 317 inc VAT ) and the cheapest Eyefinity 6 card .
Part of the high price of an Eyefinity 6 card might be covered by the five adapters that ATI says will be in Eyefinity 6 boxes .
There will be two mini-DisplayPort to DisplayPort dongles , two passive mini-DisplayPort to ( single - link ) DVI dongles and a passive mini-DisplayPort to HDMI dongle .
A passive DisplayPort adapter is one that does no signal conversion work , and so can only be connected to one of the DisplayPort outputs that supports ‘ legacy ’ connections such as HDMI , DVI and D - Sub .
An Eyefinity 6 card has two of these – if you want to use more than two ‘ legacy ’ connetions , you ’ll need to buy an active adapter from ATI ’s qualified active DisplayPort adapters list Let ’s have a quick look at the specs before heading on to how we tested
( CNN ) --
The sound of meditation for some people is full of deep breaths or gentle humming .
For Marc Umile , it 's " 3.14159265358979 ... "
Whether in the shower , driving to work , or walking down the street , he 'll mentally rattle off digits of pi to pass the time .
Holding 10th place in the world for pi memorization -- he typed out 15,314 digits from memory in 2007 -- Umile meditates through one of the most beloved and mysterious numbers in all of mathematics .
Pi , the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle , has captivated imaginations for thousands of years -- perhaps even since the first person tried to draw a perfect circle on the ground or wondered how to construct something round like a wheel .
Approximately 3.14 , the number has its own holiday on March 14 -- 3 - 14 , get it ? -- which also happens to be Albert Einstein 's birthday .
You wo n't get off school for Pi Day , but you might be doing something special in school on Friday ( the last weekday before Pi Day ) .
Mathematicians , teachers , museum directors , math students of all ages and other aficionados celebrate the number with pi recitations , pie-baking , pie-eating contests and math - related activities .
The holiday has gained popularity worldwide every year during the last decade as enthusiasm has spread on the Web , said David Blatner , author of " The Joy of Pi . "
One of the oldest , if not the first , established Pi Day celebrations is at the Exploratorium in San Francisco , California , which boasts 22 years of pi mayhem .
The day is even recognized by the U.S. government : Last March , the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution supporting Pi Day and encouraging schools to teach children about the number .
It does n't take a math whiz to appreciate pi .
Umile , a Medicare biller training to be an emergency medical technician , never took advanced math classes in school , not even algebra .
Memorizing pi for him seemed like a good test of memory , and he found that putting the digits in a definite rhythm , which repeated exactly every 1,000 digits , helped him remember them .
See pi calculated to the 10,000 digit
But Umile also appreciates pi's importance in the world around us .
" There are many things that could not be built without implementing the constant pi , " Umile said .
" The great engineering marvels like the arch or suspension bridges we cross over , the tunnels spanning within mountains or even under the water that we drive through .
...
Without it , everything would be incomplete or in danger of collapse . "
Designing any structure with cylindrical components involves pi , as the formula for area is pi multiplied by the square of the radius .
Let 's say you wanted to know if a column or cable , both of which have circular cross-sections , is strong enough to withstand a particular force .
You would calculate the stress -- force divided by area -- to see if the particular object would work in the construction .
You can increase the area if the stress is too great .
Pi has broad appeal because it " reeks of mystery , " Blatner said .
Author 's note :
My life with pi
If a circle is such a simple shape , how can its key proportion be so complex ?
Why is it impossible to know what pi is exactly , its digits continuing on infinitely in a seemingly random fashion ?
" It rubs off even on people who do n't really understand what it means , " Blatner said .
" We hunger for true mystery , even in our everyday lives , because there 's so little that really seems mysterious anymore . "
Besides a plethora of educational Web sites that have cropped up with facts about pi and activities for Pi Day , dozens of memorization enthusiasts such as Umile have posted videos of themselves reciting or typing out digits on YouTube ( here 's Umile at 1,000 digits ) .
There are also plenty of poems and songs dedicated to pi , including my own American Pi .
Despite efforts to calculate pi by everyone from Archimedes to Sir Isaac Newton to present - day mathematicians with supercomputers , there is still no formula that would allow you to figure out , in base 10 , any digit of pi without having to calculate everything that came before it .
In other words , if you wanted to know the 24,000th digit , there 's no way of figuring that out without putting down all 23,999 numbers before it .
Such calculations can be done in binary , but it 's not so interesting to know whether it 's just a 0 or a 1 .
Mathematicians know that pi is irrational -- it cannot be represented as one number divided by another -- and transcendental , meaning it is not algebraic .
That means , theoretically , that its digits will continue on indefinitely without ending in repetition -- in other words , the digits wo n't suddenly continue infinitely as 5s after 3 trillion digits ( Pi's digits were calculated out to a record 2.7 trillion places in December by French computer scientist Fabrice Bellard ) .
That also means , mathematicians theorize , that any string of numbers you can imagine is somewhere in pi -- for instance , look for your birthday .
Coincidentally , " 360 , " the number of degrees in a circle , occurs at digits 358 to 360 .
On the other hand , the true " randomness " of pi's digits has never been proven , which is frustrating , said David Bailey , a technologist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory who is still working on this question .
" For all we know , just out beyond where we calculated , there are no more 5s , " he said .
Bailey , whose interest in pi began with memorizing a couple hundred digits in graduate school , co-wrote a seminal paper in 1996 on calculating pi with Peter Borwein and Simon Plouffe , resulting in what 's called the Bailey - Borwein - Plouffe formula .
He has continued working with Borwein and his brother Jonathan Borwein on a number of studies , some related to pi .
" You might say calculating pi has its practical benefits , because it's led to a career - long collaboration , " Bailey said .
The question of whether there 's a pattern in pi's apparent chaos has enormous implications as biologists look for meaning in the map of the human genome , Peter Borwein says .
" If you have a subtle pattern , how do you know it 's there in a mess of numbers ? " said Borwein , professor at Simon Fraser University .
Having achieved recognition for the formula , Borwein says he 's " a little embarrassed to be the pi guy . "
After all , he 's done a lot of non-pi-related research .
Still , he 's also gearing up for his school 's Pi Day celebration , which will feature pi-digit cookies , pie and a lecture about the number .
Umile says he feels a little like a weightlifter who has gotten out of shape , having forgotten some of the thousands of digits .
Because of hard economic times , work and EMT school , pi memorization is much more of a distraction .
Still , for this Pi Day he 's thinking about testing himself to type out 1,000 digits or more .
He also still enjoys hearing from others about pi memorization .
" I think it 's very fun .
It 's good to be an inspiration to people who would like to broaden their minds and climb the Mount Everest of their minds , " he said .
After finding myself on the receiving end of so many flames after failing to name Halo : Reach as one of our most - anticipated games of 2010 , I promised myself I 'd deliver some good coverage of the game for our readers .
Bungie did one better , and let us simply play the game for an afternoon .
As is our policy , Ars Technica paid for 100 percent of our travel and hotel expenses .
The best preview events , the ones where you know the game is going to be good , are the ones where the people behind the game know enough to get out of the way and let you play the game .
Last week I flew into Seattle at the invitation of Bungie to sample the multiplayer of Halo : Reach , and the crew gave the assembled press a short presentation of each of the maps and game modes we would be playing .
Then they simply stood back and allowed us to play against each other .
The mood was serious at first , as everyone spent time taking notes and murmuring to themselves about this detail or that reveal , but soon the room devolved into a group of hooting , cursing fans playing the game .
" This is the first time anyone outside of Bungie has played this , " we were told , but the developers were more than happy to allow us to enjoy the game .
" Do you guys want to play a round of Juggernaut ? " we were asked .
Of course we did .
There was some question of how much to reveal to us in our time with the game , and this seemed to create a short internal struggle .
" It 's in there , " one of the developers said , shrugging as he motioned to our builds of the game .
Soon he was setting the game type up on one of our stations , and we were playing .
In another round of Headhunter , things were extremely tense as a three - way tie finally ended with a victor .
After the cheers , those of us in the room took a moment to sink back into our seats and take a breath .
The gaming stations set up for the press
" That was one of the closest rounds of Headhunter I 've seen , " we were told by the onlookers .
I nodded .
The game clicked for everyone in the room , and we were lost in the struggle of collecting the flaming skulls and trying to up our own score .
It was a delicious assignment : hang out with a dozen or so members of the gaming press and just take the new multiplayer modes of Halo : Reach out for a test drive .
Kick the tires a few times .
We were n't shown everything , but we were given the run of the content that will be available in the beta when it goes live , with promises that there was a lot from the full game that we would n't be seeing .
There is a reason this series is so respected
There is a fair amount of hate for the Halo series , in the way that anything with this level of popularity brings out the haters .
What the nay - sayers do n't understand is that nothing else in gaming feels like Halo .
If you do n't enjoy the series , more power to you ; taste in games is personal and you should always play what you like .
For those who love Halo though , they understand that it's a slower paced , deliberate , slightly insane multiplayer experience .
The fact that you 're stuck with only two guns at a time , the reliance on grenades to flush out enemies , the floaty jumps and the love of melee attacks — it does n't look or play like anything else on the market .
Every time Bungie releases a Halo game , the multiplayer is tweaked and refined and improved , but the formula remains consistent .
Halo is a game that simply works , and its fans expect a high level of polish when they play .
Matchmaking is set to get a boost in this version of Halo , with a smoother experience that works well even with more players .
The new system also allows for impressive granularity : you can make the game prioritize connection speed , skill level , or games in your native language when trying to find a game .
You also have social settings to choose from , to make sure you play with people who match your style .
Do you talk ?
Are you quiet ?
Do you play competitively , or simply to enjoy yourself ?
Do you go Rambo , or enjoy teamwork ?
Do you like a polite game , or are you a trash talker ?
By adjusting all these options you 'll be able to filter out people whose play styles may be distasteful , allowing you a better play experience .
There is also a credit system , where you gain virtual currency by playing the game .
You use these credits to buy different options for your armor , and your aesthetic choices will be shown in both the single and multiplayer modes .
You gain credits by playing the game , and by clearing challenges that will be constantly added to the game .
Daily challenges may be easy to accomplish , but the weekly challenges will require a heavier time commitment .
Commendations will also be awarded based on your behavior , with seven different Commendations included in the beta .
All these things simply serve as your way to gain credits , and the credits are only spent on prestige items to change how you look to other players .
Credits can be used to change how your character looks in both single - and multiplayer , but it wo n't change any of your avatar 's capabilities .
Derek Carroll is the Multiplayer Designer on Halo : Reach , and I asked him if there was ever a temptation to allow players to purchase better weapons or powers with credits .
" Not for us , " he said .
He understands that some games have you begin with an underpowered character and make you earn a " good character , " but that simply does n't fit into what they want for their own games .
" Halo has always been about everyone having the same bag of tools ... when you first start playing it you 'll learn and grow , the RPG happens on the inside . "
You get better with practice , not by earning better weapons and abilities .
" It has come up , but internally there has not been the temptation to do that . "
The multiplayer is n't class - based , but you 'll be making choices
Certain game modes will ask you to choose from a selection of armor powers , which come with a set loadout when you spawn .
You 'll still be able to pick up any weapon in the battlefield , but these powers will affect your strategy and give you some advantages in certain situations .
The jetpack was the most remarked upon addition to multiplayer , and it adds a very welcome sense of the vertical to the game .
It 's also wonderful to simply fly over the head of an opponent stalking you with the energy sword .
You have a limited amount of thrust , and you can take falling damage if you fly too high and do n't have the energy left to break your fall .
Spartans can also take the Sprint ability , which is simply a flat run to increase your speed , while taking away your ability to shoot .
The Elites can take the Evade power , which allows them to dodge and roll away from attacks , just like they do in the single - player game .
Throwing a well - aimed grenade , only to have your prey tuck and roll to the side and continue to come after you is unsettling , to say the least .
Active Camo is now an Armor Ability as well , giving the player a limited time to be less visible .
Standing completely still makes you completely invisible , while walking , running , and shooting makes you easier to pick out .
Armor Lock is an interesting ability : when activated the Spartan crouches and becomes completely invincible , but can not shoot or move .
It 's an easy way to soak even the most powerful weapon shots , and if you stay down for long enough , you throw off an EMP charge when you get up , killing the shields of nearby enemies and allowing you to quickly turn the tables .
It 's a risk / reward move , but when used well it's a very effective tactic .
You choose your Armor Power when you spawn , and can change from one to the other as many times as you 'd like in a single round .
Do n't worry : there are still plenty of game modes that do n't allow these powers if you like a more classical experience .
Each game mode offers different loadouts , with a combination of weapons and Armor Abilities to choose from , and those will be specific to different game modes and maps .
In the final version you may also be able to customize these yourself .
Naps are a popular afternoon hobby , and a new study is only going to make them more appealing .
A paper published in Current Biology this week describes a study where participants who were able to take naps long enough for dreams to occur were able to perform a previously learned task more quickly than others who had had to stay awake .
The dreams sometimes , but did n't always , concern the task at hand — in some cases , the dreams appeared to be an attempt to integrate the maze with older memories .
In the study , 100 participants were asked to learn to navigate a three - dimensional maze on a computer in pursuit of a particular landmark ( in this case , a tree ) .
The participants were then split into two groups , with some taking 90 - minute naps and the rest staying awake .
The participants were retested a few hours later , and those who had taken naps were able to navigate the maze 30 seconds faster on average , with some completing it as much as a minute and a half faster .
In verbal reports , people who napped reported dreams that involved the maze to various degrees .
Some dreamed of the physical maze but added familiar landmarks , such as people or places ; others did n't see the maze but dreamed of the music that played during the training ; a few had tangentially related dreams , like one who navigated bat caves ; some did n't remember any maze - related dreams at all .
The paper 's authors note that there was no correlation between dream relevance , and that just having enough time to dream significantly improved performance .
However , the length of time needed to achieve a dreaming state may be prohibitively long : while 20 - minute " power naps " have become a somewhat acceptable habit , you boss may be somewhat less inclined to let you curl up under your desk for an hour and a half in the afternoon .

It was a 4.30 am wake - up call .
Three hours in the car did it – I had the luxury of being driven , so I was able to do a couple of phone interviews in the car on the way , publicising the fact that I cared enough about Welsh badgers to travel to Wales to sit in on a judicial review .
The review is a courageous action brought by the Badger Trust , challenging the legality of the Welsh assembly 's decision to slaughter thousands of badgers – an attempt to control bovine tuberculosis in Welsh cattle .
I knew I would not be able to speak at the hearing , but figured I could attract some attention for the cause , and perhaps rally some support for the threatened badgers .
I have every sympathy for the plight of farmers faced with losing their whole herds because of a suspected bovine TB case .
But the only scientific study so far performed on this issue came to the clear conclusion that " badger culling cannot meaningfully contribute to the control of cattle TB in Britain " .
If a farmer is forced to destroy his livestock , he is heavily compensated by the government – but this is expensive .
And farmers have somehow got the idea that killing the badgers constitutes a quick fix .
Unfortunately , this is not the case .
The ISG ( Independent Scientific Group ) report , costing millions of pounds and the lives of 11,000 badgers over a period of 10 years , concluded that culling badgers actually increased the incidence of bovine TB in some cases .
Quick fix ?
It 's not going to happen .
The same question came up in England a few years ago and the Countryside Alliance brought extreme pressure on the government to embark on a programme of badger - killing .
Luckily there is a God.
Hilary Benn bravely resisted all pressure and embarked on a course of vaccination – a five - year plan that has a good chance of succeeding in eradicating this scourge , without murdering a single badger .
So we arrived at the little courthouse in Swansea .
What was at stake ?
Badgers , yes , but much more ; the whole question of how we treat the other animals on our planet .
In farming , animals are routinely treated as nothing more than commodities : millions of them are confined in hideous containers , deprived of light or movement , never to see the light of day , force - fed , chained up , and then often killed in a degrading and painful way .
Wild animals fare just a shade better , but in areas where hunts flourish – despite the hunting ban – packs of brutalised hounds are let loose on foxes , who have often been kept in bags .
In laboratories in the UK mice , rats , cats , dogs and even monkeys are routinely subjected to appalling pain and indignity in the name of scientific knowledge , medicine and developing cosmetics .
The more I learn of how we behave , the less I can sleep at night .
So here I am , metaphorically trying to throw a lone starfish back into the sea .
The courtroom is filled with about 10 legal ladies and gentlemen , a judge and about 30 onlookers .
This particular judge is a benign figure – a soft - spoken man , a model of patience , diligence , and understanding – the kind of figure you pray will be presiding when you meet St Peter .
The Badger Trust 's advocate is on his feet .
It is his job to define why the decision to cull badgers in Wales is illegal .
It is a tough call .
The exposition is long and painstaking in detail – I think most of us in the audience alternate between rapt attention and drifting off .
We hear that a viable injectable vaccine for badgers will be available from May of this year , and an oral vaccine – a much easier proposition to administer – in 2014 .
We hear that in both vaccination and culling the animals have to be trapped , and an injection given .
We hear of a paper by Jenkins et al , published in 2008 , a follow - up to the ISG study , which revealed that even the tiny benefits the experimental cull produced faded away after the experiment was finished – and this paper , we are told , was ignored by the Welsh assembly in making their decision in 2009 for the slaughter to begin .
" Perturbation " of the badgers ' lifestyle is the reason that bovine TB can increase in the periphery of a culled area .
Perturbation ceases at the end of the trial , so the incidence of the pestilence dies down once more .
I now realise that in this " trial " moral arguments are not admissible .
The only mention of morality comes in when a directive from Europe that animals should not be submitted to unnecessary pain is cited .
This directive converts moral concerns into legal constraints .
But it is no use me standing up and proclaiming what I know to be true – and I suspect this wise judge knows too – that killing these innocent animals is wrong .
Only the law matters in this room .
Equally , and to me equally shockingly , scientific arguments have no place here either .
Science is admissible only in as far as it is used to demonstrate a shortcoming in the Welsh assembly 's behaviour – a breach of the law – if that can be proved .
So all of us – these QCs , this room , this whole country , and its human inhabitants , are reduced to squabbling over some small points that might , or might not , constitute a technical crime in law .
I find this infinitely demeaning and frustrating .
Concerning the glaring moral injustice , the cruelty , the arrogance of assuming that we have the right to treat any animal like this – ever – we have to remain silent .
It 's apparent that if the ministers '
QCs can make enough excuses for their alleged concealment of relevant information , they will be able to squirm out of any accusation .
Unless the judge can find a way to interpret the law to be merciful to Wales 's other population – the lovely badgers .
Everybody here shares a common bond .
We all want to eliminate bovine TB from the Welsh countryside .
But we disagree as to how it can be done .
In effect , we have a David and Goliath scenario here .
A small team leads the challenge to the decision to kill thousands of badgers this year , based on mistaken , and misunderstood advice .
This little team 's efforts are paid for by the limited amount of cash that the tiny Badger Trust can scrape together – virtually bankrupting themselves to try to save the lives of these furry creatures .
They are pitted against a powerful legion of top legal performers – QCs , barristers and advisors – apparently on a fat juicy budget paid for , ironically , by Welsh taxpayers .
It 's manifestly unfair .
Or would be , if it were n't for the fact that , presiding above it all , is a judge with an apparently limitless capacity for careful listening and the evaluation of everything that is being hurled at him .
We see him being encouraging to the QC – making sure that no balls are dropped .
Our QC is meticulously polite to the judge , sometimes evoking guarded smiles from the opposition .
Perhaps they think he is trying too hard and doomed to failure – his slingshot dwarfed by their mighty cannon ?
Perhaps they see this whole escapade as a mere fleabite on the long muscular arm of ministerial might .
Our QC , still ploughing on , suddenly becomes crystal clear : " We can not go out killing badgers in Wales , a protected species , without a damned good reason ! "
Well , that 's a paraphrase , but it sounded like this to me .
I could feel a little movement of air in the room .
This was stirring stuff : we all were gasping for the sound of a distant bugle , a sign that our colours were flying .
We 're returning to the significant assertion that the Welsh assembly called the benefits of the cull by the ISG " substantial " when they clearly were not .
Now the important question of " necessity " – was it necessary to instigate a killing spree to fight against bovine TB ?
Was there no other viable alternative ?
Well , yes , there was vaccination , so , yes , there evidently was a possible alternative , which was ruled out by the ministers .
The Welsh assembly 's two barristers are still waiting to present their case .
But the judge alone will decide the outcome , based on the validity of the arguments .
And if there is a fair decision to be divined within the framework of the law , I would trust this judge more than any man I can think of to find it .
Vive la Justice !
Vive le Badger !
Well , Europe has a hand in this .
If the decision goes against us , I imagine an appeal based on morality rather than law might one day be pursued in Europe .
OK .
Our chap has 20 minutes left until close of play .
He 's evidently going to be the night watchman .
So I wo n't get to see the opposition go in to bat .
Unless I cancel tomorrow .
Ca n't do that .
Deadlines to meet .
Kerry 's album will not get finished by itself .
And it 's seven hours to and from Swansea .
Maybe I 've done enough .
Poking my English nose in has attracted lots of attention for this case .
And I 've met many of the principal players on both sides , face to face .
Close of play : badgers 299 not out .
Prayers are in order .

Examining the capabilities of malicious software allows your IT team to better assess the nature of a security incident , and may help prevent further infections .
Here ’s how to set up a controlled malware analysis lab — for free .
A large number of computer intrusions involve some form of malicious software ( malware ) , which finds its way to the victim ’s workstation or to a server .
When investigating the incident , the IT responder typically seeks to answer questions such as :
What actions can the malware specimen perform on the system ?
How does it spread ?
How , if at all , does it maintain contact with the attacker ?
These questions can all be answered by analyzing the offending malware in a controlled environment .
A simple analysis toolkit , built from free and readily available software , can help you and your IT team develop the skills critical to responding to today ’s security incidents .
The steps below will help get you started .
We ’ll focus on malware analysis in a Windows environment , since that platform is particularly popular among malware authors .
If this topic interests you , take a look at the reverse - engineering malware course I teach at SANS Institute .
Step 1 : Allocate physical or virtual systems for the analysis lab
A common approach to examining malicious software involves infecting a system with the malware specimen and then using the appropriate monitoring tools to observe how it behaves .
This requires a laboratory system you can infect without affecting your production environment .
The most popular and flexible way to set up such a lab system involves virtualization software , which allows you to use a single physical computer for hosting multiple virtual systems , each running a potentially different operating system .
Free virtualization software options include :
Running multiple virtual systems simultaneously on a single physical computer is useful for analyzing malware that seeks to interact with other systems , perhaps for leaking data , obtaining instructions from the attacker , or upgrading itself .
Virtualization makes it easy to set up and use such systems without procuring numerous physical boxes .
Another useful feature of many virtualization tools is the ability to take instantaneous snapshots of the laboratory system .
This way , you can record the state of the system before you infect it , and revert to the pristine environment with a click of a button at the end of your analysis .
If using virtualization software , install as much RAM into the physical system as you can , as the availability of memory is arguably the most important performance factor for virtualization tools .
In addition , having a large hard drive will allow you to host many virtual machines , whose virtual file systems typically are stored as files on the physical system ’s hard drive .
Because malware may detect that it ’s running in a virtualized environment , some analysts prefer to rely on physical , rather than virtual , machines for implementing laboratory systems .
Your old and unused PCs or servers can make excellent systems for your malware - analysis lab , which usually does n’t need high - performing CPUs or highly redundant hardware components .
To allow malware to reach its full potential in the lab , laboratory systems typically are networked with each other .
This helps you observe the malicious program ’s network interactions .
If using physical systems , you can connect them with each other using an inexpensive hub or a switch .
Step 2 : Isolate laboratory systems from the production environment
You must take precautions to isolate the malware - analysis lab from the production network , to mitigate the risk that a malicious program will escape .
You can separate the laboratory network from production using a firewall .
Better yet , do n’t connect laboratory and production networks at all , to avoid firewall configuration issues that might allow malware to bypass filtering restrictions .
If your laboratory network is strongly isolated , you can use removable media to bring tools and malware into the lab .
Consider using write - once media , such as DVDs , to prevent malicious software from escaping the lab ’s confines by writing itself to a writable removable disk .
A more convenient option is a USB key that includes a physical write - protect switch .
Some malware - analysis scenarios benefit from the lab being connected to the internet .
Avoid using the production network for such connectivity .
If possible , provision a separate , and usually inexpensive , internet connection , perhaps by dedicating a DSL or Cable Modem line to this purpose .
Avoid keeping the lab connected to the internet all the time to minimize the chance of malware in your lab attacking someone else ’s system on the internet .
If virtualizing your lab , be sure to keep up with security patches released by the virtualization - software vendor .
Such software may have vulnerabilities that could allow malware to escape from the virtual system you infected and onto the physical host .
Furthermore , do n’t use the physical machine that ’s hosting your virtualized lab for any other purpose .
Step 3 : Install behavioral analysis tools
Before you ’re ready to infect your laboratory system with the malware specimen , you need to install and activate the appropriate monitoring tools .
Free utilities that will let you observe how Windows malware interacts with its environment include :
File system and registry monitoring : Process Monitor with ProcDOT offer a powerful way to observe how local processes read , write , or delete registry entries and files .
These tools can help you understand how malware attempts to embed into the system upon infection .
Process monitoring : Process Explorer and Process Hacker replace the built - in Windows Task Manager , helping you observe malicious processes , including local network ports they may attempt to open .
Network monitoring : Wireshark is a popular network sniffer , which can observe laboratory network traffic for malicious communication attempts , such as DNS resolution requests , bot traffic , or downloads .
Change detection : Regshot is a lightweight tool for comparing the system ’s state before and after the infection , to highlight the key changes malware made to the file system and the registry .
Behavioral monitoring tools can give you a sense for the key capabilities of malicious software .
For further details about its characteristics , you may need to roll up your sleeves and perform some code analysis .
Step 4 : Install code - analysis tools
Examining the code that comprises the specimen helps uncover characteristics that may be difficult to obtain through behavioral analysis .
In the case of a malicious executable , you rarely will have the luxury of access to the source code from which it was created .
Fortunately , the following free tools can help you reverse compiled Windows executables :
Disassembler and debugger : OllyDbg and IDA Pro Freeware can parse compiled Windows executables and , acting as disassemblers , display their code as assembly instructions .
These tools also have debugging capabilities , which allow you to execute the most interesting parts of the malicious program slowly and under highly controlled conditions , so you can better understand the purpose of the code .
Memory dumper : Scylla and OllyDumpEx help obtain protected code located in the lab system ’s memory and dump it to a file .
This technique is particularly useful when analyzing packed executables , which are difficult to disassemble because they encode or encrypt their instructions , extracting them into RAM only during run-time .
Step 5 : Utilize online analysis tools
To round off your malware - analysis toolkit , add to it some freely available online tools that may assist with the reverse engineering process .
One category of such tools performs automated behavioral analysis of the executables you supply .
These applications look similar at first glance , but use different technologies on the back end .
Consider submitting your malware specimen to several of these sites ; depending on the specimen , some sites will be more effective than others .
Such tools include :
You can see a longer list of free automated malware analysis services that can examine compiled Windows executables .
Another set of potentially useful online tools provides details about websites that are suspected of hosting malicious code .
Some of these tools examine the sites you specify in real time ; others provide historical information .
Consider submitting a suspicious URL to several of these sites , because each may offer a slightly different perspective on the website in question :
Real - time threat assessment : WebInspector , and Wepawet
Historical reputation data : URLVoid and MxToolbox
You can see a longer list of free on - line tools for looking up a potentially malicious website .
Next Steps
With your initial toolkit assembled , start experimenting in the lab with malware you come across on the web , in your e-mail box , on your systems , and so on .
There are several “ cheat sheets ” that can help you in this process , including :
Begin analysis with the tools and approaches most familiar to you .
Then , as you become more familiar with the inner workings of the malware specimen , venture out of your comfort zone to try other tools and techniques .
The tools I ’ve listed within each step operate virtually identically .
Since they ’re all free , you should feel free to try them all .
You ’ll find that one tool will work better than another , depending on the situation .
And with time , patience , and practice , you will learn to turn malware inside out .
For additional tips and resources , see my article How to Get Started With Malware Analysis and check out the Reverse - Engineering Malware course I teach at SANS Institute .
The problem with Software as a Service is you do n’t own it .
You get it for free , but you do n’t have a stake and you do n’t have negotiating power .
Instead , try to work with services that give you an exit plan or that have the safety stamp of an aGPL license .
Who cares ?
Let me back up and tell you a story about a social network I created .
Two big - time development bloggers , Jeff and Scott , were writing posts back and forth about how what colors they liked in their text editors and what fonts they used .
I ’m not kidding , this is important in a job where most of what you do is sip coffee and type .
I ’ve certainly killed some time messing about with how I color my source code .
Jeff is a big idea generator .
He posted the idea of a Pimp my Ride for text editing .
He said
What we really need is for some enterprising coder to create a “ Hot or Not ” site for IDE color schemes , where we can post screenshots and downloadable *. settings files for our preferred IDE color and font schemes .
I was a young man of that sort , so I whipped one up in 8 minutes .
Exactly 8 minutes .
I used Ning , the first “ social network in a box ” .
Back in those days they gave you full access to everything and they had tons of cool ways to structure your site .
You could upload a settings file and a screenshot , give it some descriptions and share it with other folks .
The site hummed along without much work from me , folks added settings every once in a while and all was good .
Ning promised that you could export your site if you wanted to migrate away , but that feature never got released .
This became important because Ning eventually had to deal with some nasty types who were using the platform to perform dastardly deeds , hacks that served pernicious purposes .
They reacted by rolling back features , locking things down and circling the wagons .
Eventually they moved things to a new , incompatible system and shut down http://idehotornot.ning.com.
I never got an email about it .
Recently , one of the users emailed me to let me know it was down .
After a month of emails with the Ning support group , they revealed the final solution they could give me :
After investigating the situation , our engineers were unable to extract the data from idehotornot.ning.com .
As we were unable to retrieve the content , and the application would be staying down indefinitely , we went ahead and removed it so that you could create a brand new Ning Network in it ’s place .
It looks like we did n’t clearly convey this to you before removing the application and I apologize .
This was an oversight by us which we should have checked ,
Regardless , idehotornot.ning.com is now free .
If you need help with any part of creating a Ning Network , setting it up or getting it running , please do n’t hesitate to ask .
They ’ve lost all the content that people put in there .
They ’ve lost all the pictures , descriptions , and files .
But hey , no problem because you can just go ahead and rebuild that for them .
No .
People put their time and energy in there and it disappeared .
Yes , it was a free service , but no , that does n’t excuse it .
Say I offer to hold your wallet for you while you swim .
When you get out of the pool some of the pictures are missing .
Is it ok that I was n’t charging you to hold your wallet ?
The important bit
This is the fundamental problem with software as a service – you do n’t own it , you do n’t control it , and there ’s no recourse to the providers like Ning .
It ’s why I like to have my own cloud .
Cloud computing , software in the cloud , these terms are names for the same basic idea .
Digital Sharecropping .
You ’ll get the resources you need for little or no money and you can produce value there for you and yours , but you never own it , you ca n’t take it somewhere else , and you have very little bargaining power for changes .
This is why Facebook is so troubling .
Most of my friends are n’t nerds , and they do n’t know how to work a feed reader or set up a blog for free .
That ’s all they are really using Facebook for – reading the things their friends wrote and writing things to their friends .
It ’s true .
The technology to do all of this is simple and easy .
But Facebook centralized it and went viral with it .
That ’s where my network of friends hang out .
My worry is , what happens to all of that content when Facebook changes its terms and decides to wall off part of it or charge for it or turn my comments to my friends into advertisements for products I do n’t endorse ?
What happens when Myspace turns that iMeem “ Vampire Weekend ” music playlist you made into an ad for Beyonce ringtones ?
There is a solution
When possible , work with cloud services that give you an escape route .
They have to give you ownership of your data , a way to get your data out , and you have to use that method to back up your data on a regular basis .
Do n’t be a chump .

No matter how otherwise impressive your spread of dishes might be , without a glossy , golden - brown ham at the center of the table , an Easter feast just does n't feel complete .
These seven recipes — for ham cooked sous vide , glazed with maple , rubbed with mustard and brown sugar , and more — will help you get the star player in your Easter dinner just right .
Need side dishes or desserts to complement your roast ?
You can find it all in our collection of Easter recipes .
Cooking big roasts for the holidays tends to bring out two of our worst fears .
First , of course , there 's the worry that we 'll overcook it , thus destroying the enormous chunk of meat we 've invested in .
Second , we dread the judgment we'd get from all those aunts , uncles , and friends for screwing up the holiday meal .
With a city ham cooked sous vide , you can put all those concerns aside :
Not only is the meat precooked and pre-seasoned , it can be dropped directly into the sous vide water bath , in its original packaging , to reheat .
When the ham is warm all the way through , place it on a baking sheet , crisp it in the oven , and glaze it with a simple and tasty mixture of brown sugar and balsamic vinegar .
It does n't get much easier than this .

Since most hams come precooked and pre-seasoned , it can be a challenge to make one that really stands out , but this one does just that .
We cook it on the grill for a deep smokiness that can't be replicated in an oven — even under the broiler .
While it 's grilling , we glaze the ham with a Filipino - inspired barbecue sauce that combines Coca - Cola , pineapple juice , soy sauce , ketchup , vinegar , and honey .

Tonight the BBC broadcast an edition of Panorama which , with remarkable foresight given the tendency of the media to merely commentate on the present , seeks to address the question of overpopulation in the UK .
Up here in Edinurgh overpopulation is not such an issue as most of the UK ’s migrant population concentrates itself in the South East or West Midlands , areas which are also worst affected by babies being born to existing large populations in these areas due to the inevitable tendency of living things to follow a pattern of exponential growth .
The Office of National Statistics says that the population will push 70 m people within the next two decades which is a frightening thought given that that growth will once again be concentrated in England ’s already overcrowded urban areas , meaning that many of the infrastructure projects and housing schemes currently underway will simply have their capacity sucked up by population growth .
The more people there are the faster the population grows and the more you need to build to keep them housed , fed and in employment .
Bearing in mind that Britain is already pushing its boundaries with regard to the provision of natural resources and power generation , another 10 m
Britons would be an absolute catastrophe in environmental terms , not to mention the negative impact on the country ’s already straining social cohesion .
But what then is to be done ?
There is at least a general consensus that net immigration has to be stopped so that the one easily - checkable source of population increase is dealt with .
There has been a reluctance to discuss this kind of thing as parties such as the BNP have used it as a cheap excuse to stop dirty foreigners stealing our jobs and daughters , though thankfully people now seem to realise that the issue is too important to ignore .
It is notable that some kind of immigration reduction features in the manifestos of all the major political parties .
Assuming that a cap can be put on immigration , we then have to turn to natural growth caused by millions of healthy babies and the millions of pensioners living far longer than would have been the case as little as forty years ago .
You will find very few people advocating wholesale culling of the elderly a la Soylent Green , but at the other end it is reasonable to sustainably and gradually reduce the birth rate so as to achieve a stable population with a roughly equal distribution over the age range .
Beyond the immediate time bomb of an ageing population there is a period of stability awaiting us .
If the current generation of baby boomers can be cared for into old age without younger generations producing large amounts of children themselves it should be possible to see a gradual reduction in the overall population .
How then do you discourage people from having children ?
There is a well established connection between the wealth of a family and how many children it produces .
Only the poorest families tend to produce many offspring and some people never procreate at all , which means that poverty alleviation has the potential to reduce the birth rate .
How it might work is another matter entirely but there is also scope for reforming a welfare system which makes childbirth , with its state income and short cut to the top of the housing list , a more attractive option than working for many girls upon leaving education .
There also seems to be a majority view that population reduction is wholly negative .
Whilst a massive drop in population overnight would have a catastrophic impact , a population which services itself in terms of provision of goods and services would negate the lower number of consumers and economic shrinkage as there would be fewer mouths to feed in very basic terms .
It is possible to maintain or increase a per capita GDP whilst the population itself is reduced and in many areas the quality of life would improve as less pressure is placed on infrastructure and natural resources .
This question is addressed at length in the excellent Limits to Growth by Jorgen Randers et al , a book which should be compulsory reading for anyone who thinks that population growth is in any way sustainable .

RNC chief of staff Ken McKay resigns
Updated 9:20 p.m.
Republican National Committee chief of staff Ken McKay has resigned in the wake of a controversy over an expenditure at a risque California nightclub , RNC communications director Doug Heye said Monday .
McKay 's resignation comes one week after the Daily Caller Web site reported that the RNC's January expenditure report included nearly $ 2,000 spent at Voyeur in West Hollywood , a topless nightclub .
RNC officials worked to distance Chairman Michael Steele from the controversy -- insisting that not only was he not in attendance but that he had no knowledge of the reimbursement -- and promised changes in the way that people were reimbursed by the committee .
McKay 's resignation appears to be the leading edge of those moves , and an attempt by Steele and the broader RNC to show donors worried about the stability of the committee that changes ares being made .
" The members of the Republican National Committee entrusted myself and every staffer to lead the loyal opposition against the destructive Obama agenda , build a stronger Republican party and win elections .
This is a role I take with the utmost seriousness .
With this in mind , I want to do everything in my power to ensure that the committee uses all its resources in the best possible fashion , " Steele said in a statement .
But other Republicans said the committee had lost a valuable contributor .
" This is a huge loss for the Republican Party , " said Curt Anderson , a consultant closely aligned with Steele , about McKay 's departure .
" Ken is enormously talented and has been the guy who has kept things on track , he 's the guy who steered the party through very successful elections last fall . "
Anderson also announced that his consulting firm -- On Message Inc. -- would sever ties from the RNC , breaking a long relationship with Steele and causing more consternation within the political chattering class about the future of the committee .
" Moving around deck chairs on the Titanic did n't make a darn bit of difference ( or sense ) either , " e-mailed one senior Republican operative , who discussed the departure on the condition of anonymity , to avoid damaging the party .
" If Ken 's resignation was to signal a positive shake - up at the RNC , it will actually have the opposite effect .
He was one of the few level - headed and widely respected aides at the committee . "
McKay will be replaced by Mike Leavitt , a longtime party operative who had been serving as deputy chief of staff at the committee .
" Mike brings a strong ability to work to manage the building and win elections across the country , " Steele said .
Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell ( R ) praised Leavitt 's " great energy , commitment , and experience . "
McKay was named to his post following a successful run in Rhode Island where he managed Gov. Don Carcieri 's 2002 and 2006 races and served as the governor 's chief of staff in the early part of the Carcieri administration .
Steele , for his part , insisted in an interview with George Stephanapoulos on " Good Morning America " this morning that he had no plans to resign his post .
" I 'm not staying at fancy hotels , " Steele said in response to a question about the committee 's expenditures .
In that same interview Steele stoked a bit of controversy over his comments on the role race has played in how his performance is being analyzed .
Asked by Stephanapoulos whether being an African American gave him a " slimmer margin of error " than another chairman might have , Steele said :
" The honest answer is ' yes , ' .
It just is .
Barack Obama has a slimmer margin .
We all -- a lot of folks do .
It 's a different role for me to play and others to play , and that 's just the reality of it .
But you take that as part of the nature of it . "
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs called Steele 's comment on race " silly " , adding : " I think Michael Steele 's problem is n't the race card , it 's the credit card . "

A science writer has won the right to rely on the defence of fair comment in a libel action , in a landmark ruling at the Court of Appeal .
Simon Singh was accused of libel by the British Chiropractic Association over an article in the Guardian in 2008 .
Dr Singh questioned the claims of some chiropractors over the treatment of certain childhood conditions .
The High Court had said the words were fact not opinion - meaning Dr Singh could not use the fair comment defence .
However , the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge , Master of the Rolls Lord Neuberger and Lord Justice Sedley ruled High Court judge Mr Justice Eady had " erred in his approach " last May , and allowed Dr Singh 's appeal .
BBC
News science correspondent Pallab Ghosh says that , had Justice Eady 's ruling stood , it would have made it difficult for any scientist or science journalist to question claims made by companies or organisations without opening themselves up to a libel action that would be hard to win .
ANALYSIS Clive Coleman
Legal affairs analyst
In defending a libel action the difference between a statement of verifiable fact and one of opinion can be crucial .
A defendant who has to justify a statement of fact in a case like this would have to prove that the statement was true .
That would involve calling vast amounts of scientific evidence at huge cost .
Defending a statement of opinion , so as long as it is honestly held , is much less onerous and far cheaper .
This judgement strongly endorses the view that scientific controversies should be settled by scientific debate , rather than litigation .
It will make drug companies and organisations providing therapies more cautious in bringing libel actions against those writers and academics who express strong opinion about the efficacy of their drugs and therapies .
Dr Singh described the ruling as " brilliant " , but added that the action had cost £ 200,000 " just to define the meaning of a few words " .
" After two years of battling in this libel case , at last we 've got a good decision .
So instead of battling uphill we 're fighting with the wind behind us , " he said .
" The Court of Appeal 's made a very wise decision , but it just should n't be so horrendously expensive for a journalist or an academic journal or a scientist to defend what they mean .
" That 's why people back off from saying what they really mean . "
The British Chiropractic Association said it was disappointed to lose the appeal but it was " not the end of the road " .
BCA president Richard Brown said : " We are considering whether to seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court and subsequently proceed to trial .
" Our original argument remains that our reputation has been damaged .
The BCA brought this claim only to uphold its good name and protect its reputation , honesty and integrity " .
In the article in April 2008 , Dr Singh suggested there was a lack of evidence for the claims some chiropractors made on treating certain childhood conditions such as colic and asthma .
The BCA alleged that Dr Singh had effectively accused its leaders of knowingly supporting bogus treatments .
The case has become a cause celebre for the science community and led to calls for defamation law to be rewritten so it does not interfere with scientific debates .
TIMELINE : SINGH LIBEL CASE April 2008 : Publishes blog on Guardian website criticising British Chiropractic Association .
It sues for libel May 2009 : High Court rules article 's wording implied BCA was being consciously dishonest February 2010 : Challenges ruling at the Court of Appeal , using defence of fair comment April 2010 : Wins appeal on technical point , that the statements can be regarded as comment
His high - profile supporters include Stephen Fry , Ricky Gervais and Harry Hill , all from the world of entertainment .
Dr Singh said : " The judges are clearly unhappy on how libel laws can impact on discussion , on how this libel suit has quashed debate about chiropractics to a large extent .
" They 're particularly unhappy about the way scientific discussion can be silenced by libel laws .
That 's a real boost to the libel reform campaign . "
Coalition for Libel Reform spokeswoman Tracey Brown said : " This case has brought out of the woodwork the fact that so many other discussions are being killed , from discussions of cardiology to human rights to medicines .
" We 're now pushing ahead for bigger changes to the law so that we have the kind of public interest defence that means it would n't have taken two years and £ 200,000 to find out whether Simon can defend himself . "
British scientific organisation the Royal Institution welcomed the judgement .
Director of programmes Gail Cardew said : " It will encourage scientists and the public to discuss evidence freely without fear of legal threat . "

Should health insurance reform allow direct government subsidies for abortion ?
Yes , it should .
Should we drop the Hyde Amendment , the law that has , since 1976 , barred spending of government money for abortions under Medicaid except in cases of incest and rape , and when the woman 's life is at risk ?
Yes , we should .
But , contrary to what Rep. Bart Stupak and his congressional disciples in the House have been saying , the health insurance reform bill - the Senate bill - does not subsidize abortion .
To repeat , it does not .
Stupak told the Associated Press yesterday that he is more optimistic than he was a week ago about getting this disagreement settled .
" The president says he does n't want to expand or restrict current law ( on abortion ) .
Neither do I , " Stupak said .
" That 's never been our position .
So is there some language that we can agree on that hits both points — we do n't restrict , we do n't expand abortion rights ?
I think we can get there . "
Ensuring that all women - including women without the requisite financial resources - have equal access to abortion would not , of course , be an expansion of " abortion rights . "
What we 've actually seen over the past 37 years - and early on in the case of low - income women - is a narrowing of reproductive rights as laid out in Roe v.
Wade as law after law , including the execrable Hyde Amendment , has been passed to curtail freedom of choice .
The Stupak Amendment would be another step down that same path .
Whatever else it does or does not do , the Senate health reform bill sticks with current law on abortion .
As Timothy Noah pointed out last week in Slate :
Let 's go to Page 2069 through Page 2078 of the Senate - passed bill .
It says , " If a qualified plan provides [ abortion ] coverage ... the issuer of the plan shall not use any amount attributable to [ health reform 's government - funding mechanisms ] for purposes of paying for such services . "
( This is on Page 2072 . )
That seems pretty straightforward .
No government funding for abortions .
( Except in the case of rape , incest , or a threat to the mother 's life — the same exceptions granted under current law . )
If a health insurer selling through the exchanges wishes to offer abortion coverage — the federal government may not require it to do so , and the state where the exchange is located may ( the bill states ) pass a law forbidding it to do so — then the insurer must collect from each enrollee ( regardless of sex or age ) a separate payment to cover abortion .
The insurer must keep this pool of money separate to ensure it wo n't be commingled with so much as a nickel of government subsidy .
( This is on Pages 2072 - 2074 . )
Stupak is right that anyone who enrolls through the exchange in a health plan that covers abortions must pay a nominal sum ( defined on Page 125 of the bill as not less than " $ 1 per enrollee , per month " ) into the specially segregated abortion fund .
But Stupak is wrong to say this applies to " every enrollee . "
If an enrollee objects morally to spending one un-government - subsidized dollar to cover abortion , then he or she can simply choose a different health plan offered through the exchange , one that does n't cover abortions .
( Under the Senate bill , every insurance exchange must offer at least one abortion - free health plan . )
Stupak and his backers in the House , who , if they stick together , could be enough to keep a health care bill from reaching the President 's desk , seem determined to do so if they do n't get their way on something they are wrong about .
To repeat one more time , the Senate health bill does not include subsidies for abortions .
Does not .

BRIEFING
House of Lords , London , Friday , March 5
Thank you .
It is great to be back in London .
And it is great that this time , I got to see more of this wonderful city than just the detention centre at Heathrow Airport .
Thank you Lord Pearson and Lady Cox for your invitation and showing my film ‘ Fitna ’ .
Thank you my friends for inviting me .
Also In This Edition I first have great news .
Last Wednesday city council elections were held in the Netherlands .
And for the first time my party , the Freedom Party , took part in these local elections .
We participated in two cities .
In Almere , one of the largest Dutch cities .
And in The Hague , the third largest city ; home of the government , the parliament and the queen .
And , we did great !
In one fell swoop my party became the largest party in Almere and the second largest party in The Hague .
Great news for the Freedom Party and even better news for the people of these two beautiful cities .
And I have more good news .
Two weeks ago the Dutch government collapsed .
In June we will have parliamentary elections .
And the future for the Freedom Party looks great .
According to some polls we will become the largest party in the Netherlands .
I want to be modest , but who knows , I might even be Prime Minister in a few months time !
Ladies and gentlemen , not far from here stands a statue of the greatest Prime Minister your country ever had .
And I would like to quote him here today : “ Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith .
No stronger retrograde force exists in the World .
It has already spread throughout Central Africa , raising fearless warriors at every step ( … ) the civilization of modern Europe might fall , as fell the civilization of ancient Rome . ”
These words are from none other than Winston Churchill wrote this in his book ‘ The River War ’ from 1899 .
Churchill was right .
Ladies and gentlemen , I do n’t have a problem and my party does not have a problem with Muslims as such .
There are many moderate Muslims .
The majority of Muslims are law - abiding citizens and want to live a peaceful life as you and I do .
I know that .
That is why I always make a clear distinction between the people , the Muslims , and the ideology , between Islam and Muslims .
There are many moderate Muslims , but there is no such thing as a moderate Islam .
Islam strives for world domination .
The Quran commands Muslims to exercise jihad .
The Quran commands Muslims to establish shariah law .
The Quran commands Muslims to impose Islam on the entire world .
As former Turkish Prime Minister Erbakan said : “ The whole of Europe will become Islamic .
We will conquer Rome ” .
End of quote .
Libyan dictator Gaddafi said : “ There are tens of millions of Muslims in the European continent today and their number is on the increase .
This is the clear indication that the European continent will be converted into Islam .
Europe will one day soon be a Muslim continent ” .
End of quote .
Indeed , for once in his life , Gaddafi was telling the truth .
Because , remember : mass immigration and demographics is destiny !
Islam is merely not a religion , it is mainly a totalitarian ideology .
Islam wants to dominate all aspects of life , from the cradle to the grave .
Shariah law is a law that controls every detail of life in a Islamic society .
From civic - and family law to criminal law .
It determines how one should eat , dress and even use the toilet .
Oppression of women is good , drinking alcohol is bad .
I believe that Islam is not compatible with our Western way of life .
Islam is a threat to Western values .
The equality of men and women , the equality of homosexuals and heterosexuals , the separation of church and state , freedom of speech , they are all under pressure because of islamization .
Ladies and gentlemen : Islam and freedom , Islam and democracy are not compatible .
It are opposite values .
No wonder that Winston Churchill called Adolf Hitler ’s ‘ Mein Kampf ’ “ the new Quran of faith and war , turgid , verbose , shapeless , bur pregnant with its message ” .
As you know , Churchill made this comparison , between the Koran and Mein Kampf , in his book ‘ The Second World War ’ , a master piece , for which , he received the Nobel Prize in Literature .
Churchill ’s comparison of the Quran and ‘ Mein Kampf ’ is absolutely spot on .
The core of the Quran is the call to jihad .
Jihad means a lot of things and is Arabic for battle .
Kampf is German for battle .
Jihad and kampf mean exactly the same .
Islam means submission , there cannot be any mistake about its goal .
That ’s a given .
The question is whether we in Europe and you in Britain , with your glorious past , will submit or stand firm for your heritage .
We see Islam taking off in the West at an incredible pace .
Europe is Islamizing rapidly .
A lot of European cities have enormous Islamic concentrations .
Paris , Amsterdam , Brussels and Berlin are just a few examples .
In some parts of these cities , Islamic regulations are already being enforced .
Women ’s rights are being destroyed .
Burqa ’s , headscarves , polygamy , female genital mutilation , honour - killings .
Women have to go to separate swimming - classes , do n’t get a handshake .
In many European cities there is already apartheid .
Jews , in an increasing number , are leaving Europe .
As you undoubtedly all know , better then I do , also in your country the mass immigration and islamization has rapidly increased .
This has put an enormous pressure on your British society .
Look what is happening in for example Birmingham , Leeds , Bradford and here in London .
British politicians who have forgotten about Winston Churchill have now taken the path of least resistance .
They have given up .
They have given in .
Last year , my party has requested the Dutch government to make a cost - benefit analysis of the mass immigration .
But the government refused to give us an answer .
Why ?
Because it is afraid of the truth .
The signs are not good .
A Dutch weekly magazine – Elsevier – calculated costs to exceed 200 billion Euros .
Last year alone , they came with an amount of 13 billion Euros .
More calculations have been made in Europe : According to the Danish national bank , every Danish immigrant from an Islamic country is costing the Danish state more than 300 thousand Euros .
You see the same in Norway and France .
The conclusion that can be drawn from this : Europe is getting more impoverished by the day .
More impoverished thanks to mass immigration .
More impoverished thanks to demographics .
And the leftists are thrilled .
I do n’t know whether it is true , but in several British newspapers I read that Labour opened the door to mass immigration in a deliberate policy to change the social structures of the UK .
Andrew Neather , a former government advisor and speech writer for Tony Blair and Jack Straw , said the aim of Labour ’s immigration strategy was , and I quote , to “ rub the Right ’s nose in diversity and render their arguments out of date ” .
If this is true , this is symptomatic of the Left .
Ladies and gentlemen , make no mistake : The Left is facilitating Islamization .
Leftists , liberals , are cheering for every new shariah bank being created , for every new shariah mortgage , for every new islamic school , for every new shariah court .
Leftists consider Islam as being equal to our own culture .
Shariah law or democracy ?
Islam or freedom ?
It does n’t really matter to them .
But it does matter to us .
The entire leftist elite is guilty of practising cultural relativism .
Universities , churches , trade unions , the media , politicians .
They are all betraying our hard - won liberties .
Why I ask myself , why have the Leftists and liberals stopped to fight for them ?
Once the Leftists stood on the barricades for women ’s rights .
But where are they today ?
Where are they in 2010 ?
They are looking the other way .
Because they are addicted to cultural relativism and dependent on the Muslim vote .
They are dependent on mass - immigration .
Thank heavens Jacqui Smith is n’t in office anymore .
It was a victory for free speech that a UK judge brushed aside her decision to refuse me entry to your country last year .
I hope that the judges in my home country are at least as wise and will acquit me of all charges , later this year in the Netherlands .
Unfortunately , so far they have not done so well .
For they do not want to hear the truth about Islam , nor are they interested to hear the opinion of top class legal experts in the field of freedom of expression .
Last month in a preliminary session the Court refused fifteen of the eighteen expert - witnesses I had requested to be summoned .
Only three expert witnesses are allowed to be heard .
Fortunately , my dear friend and heroic American psychiatrist dr .
Wafa Sultan is one of them .
But their testimony will be heard behind closed doors .
Apparently the truth about Islam must not be told in public , the truth about Islam must remain secret .
Ladies and gentlemen , I ’m being prosecuted for my political beliefs .
We know political prosecution to exist in countries in the Middle East , like Iran and Saudi - Arabia , but never in Europe , never in the Netherlands .
I ’m being prosecuted for comparing the Quran to ‘ Mein Kampf ’ .
Ridiculous .
I wonder if Britain will ever put the beliefs of Winston Churchill on trial …
Ladies and gentlemen , the political trial that is held against me has to stop .
But it is not all about me , not about Geert Wilders .
Free speech is under attack .
Let me give you a few other examples .
As you perhaps know , one of my heroes , the Italian author Oriana Fallaci had to live in fear of extradition to Switzerland because of her anti-Islam book ‘ The Rage and the Pride ’ .
The Dutch cartoonist Nekschot was arrested in his home in Amsterdam by 10 police men because of his anti-Islam drawings .
Here in Britain , the American author Rachel Ehrenfeld was sued by a Saudi businessman for defamation .
In the Netherlands Ayaan Hirsi Ali and in Australia two Christian pastors were sued .
I could go on and on .
Ladies and gentlemen , all throughout the West freedom loving people are facing this ongoing ‘ legal jihad ’ .
This is Islamic ‘ lawfare ’ .
And , ladies and gentlemen , not long ago the Danish cartoonist Westergaard was almost assassinated for his cartoons .
Ladies and gentlemen , we should defend the right to freedom of speech .
With all our strength .
With all our might .
Free speech is the most important of our many liberties .
Free speech is the cornerstone of our modern societies .
Freedom of speech is the breath of our democracy , without freedom of speech our way of life our freedom will be gone .
I believe it is our obligation to preserve the inheritance of the brave young soldiers that stormed the beaches of Normandy .
That liberated Europe from tyranny .
These heroes cannot have died for nothing .
It is our obligation to defend freedom of speech .
As George Orwell said : “ If liberty means anything at all , it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear ” .
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe in another policy , it is time for change .
We must make haste .
We ca n’t wait any longer .
Time is running out .
If I may quote one of my favourite American presidents : Ronald Reagan once said : “ We need to act today , to preserve tomorrow ” .
That is why I propose the following measures , I only mention a few , in order to preserve our freedom : First , we will have to defend freedom of speech .
It is the most important of our liberties .
In Europe and certainly in the Netherlands , we need something like the American First Amendment .
Second , we will have to end and get rid of cultural relativism .
To the cultural relativists , the shariah socialists , I proudly say : Our Western culture is far superior to the Islamic culture .
Do n’t be affraid to say it .
You are not a racist when you say that our own culture is better .
Third , we will have to stop mass immigration from Islamic countries .
Because more Islam means less freedom .
Fourth , we will have to expel criminal immigrants and , following denaturalisation , we will have to expel criminals with a dual nationality .
And there are many of them in my country .
Fifth , we will have to forbid the construction of new mosques .
There is enough Islam in Europe .
Especially since Christians in Turkey , Egypt , Iraq , Iran , Pakistan and Indonesia are mistreated , there should be a mosque building - stop in the West .
And last but not least , we will have to get rid of all those so - called leaders .
I said it before : Fewer Chamberlains , more Churchills .
Let ’s elect real leaders .
Ladies and gentlemen .
To the previous generation , that of my parents , the word ‘ London ’ is synonymous with hope and freedom .
When my country was occupied by the national - socialists the BBC offered a daily glimpse of hope in my country , in the darkness of Nazi tyranny .
Millions of my fellow country men listened to it , underground .
The words ‘ This is London ’ were a symbol for a better world coming soon .
What will be broadcasted forty years from now ?
Will it still be “ This is London ” ?
Or will it be “ This is Londonistan ” ?
Will it bring us hope ?
Or will it signal the values of Mecca and Medina ?
Will Britain offer submission or perseverance ?
Freedom or slavery ?
The choice is yours .
And in the Netherlands the choice is ours .
Ladies and gentlemen , we will never apologize for being free .
We will and should never give in .
And , indeed , as one of your former leaders said :
We will never surrender .
Freedom must prevail , and freedom will prevail .
Thank you very much .
COMMENT LETTER TO THE EDITOR

The Left does n't understand consequences .
They think if it sounds good it must be right .
They can write , and read , but they cannot think .
They graduated from prestigious universities by simply spitting back what their professors told them .
They will destroy civilization for our descendants and for this reason they must be stopped .
Brenda Tannenbaum 9:56 p.m. / Monday , March 15 , 2010 Mr. Wilders stance vs. Islamo - fascism , echoes Winston Churchill 's own against National Socialism , a full decade before WWII made the painful reality evident .
His visionary warnings where dismissed then , just as Mr. Wilders ' are attacked today .
Just as then , there will be hell to pay .
Indioviejo 11:02 a.m. / Tuesday , March 9 , 2010
What an inspiring speech to read .
I wish I had been there to witness this historical event .
The problem we have is with the traditional media leftist bias which pushes moral equivalence when in fact our western culture is superior to this retrograde totalitarian religion .
When the Swiss had their referendum on the mineret ban their media just like all the traditional politically correct told us that the measure did not have a chance .
Gert is speaking for the silent majority of us who are mad that we are not being heard and he gives me hope that Europe will not go silently into the night and that this repressive third attempt by Islam will fail again .
Peter G 10:53 p.m. / Monday , March 8 , 2010 Finally a real leader in Europe with guts , and a brave heart .
Thank you and I hope more will follow your example .
I do n’t want America to be alone as detailed in Mark Steyn ’s book .
Godspeed my friend .
Jeff Swanson , California USA 8:42 p.m. / Monday , March 8 , 2010 Incredible .
A man still left in Europe .
The comparison of Jihad and Kampf was insightful and brilliant .
I heartily applaud him , standing .
[ do not publish my email address ]
Fred B. Georgia , USA 5:06 p.m. / Monday , March 8 , 2010 Down with radical Islam !
Long live Freedom !
David 4:50 p.m. / Monday , March 8 , 2010
It 's not fair to say that all the left have supported the Islamists .
Groups like the left - leaning Hands Off the People of Iran , for instance , have done a lot of work in exposing the mullah regime in Iran - often making very similar points to Geert Wilders .
If Europe is to stand up to the real threats to freedom that Mr Wilders addresses so eloquently , we must surely unite left and right on this issue .
Remember that during WW11 Churchill made alliances with the left to defeat the Nazi common enemy .
Mike Brown 12:11 p.m. / Monday , March 8 , 2010 Finally a man who doesnt bow to this political correctness garbage .
If the world does not stand up to the barbarian muslims we will all be praying to the east !
don 2:31 a.m. / Monday , March 8 , 2010
Unlike our current USA president , Mr. Wilders succinctly addresses the threat of Islam to freedom - loving souls throughout the world .
Geert has a residence , of refuge , if need be ... here in Bay Point , CA .
Gary Callihan 12:58 a.m. / Monday , March 8 , 2010 " Tolerance of the intolerant is suicide " And as Wilders points out , that is what we are doing .
Allowing Islam to dictate to western culture .
Our culture is superior and most of all it is ours .
James Coyne , Columbia Mo. USA 11:28 p.m. / Sunday , March 7 , 2010 Clearly the far Left uses Islam to triangulate against a societal / political paradigm .
How is it that most everything supposedly deeply cherished by the left is quickly forgotten in most every way to appease Sharia law , a throwback mentality that is completely anathema to Western Liberal values ?
This is n't about humanitarianism .
This is about disrupting society to gain more political power .
Such a strategy reveals the pernicious and subversive nature of the radical left .

DETROIT -- Phoenix Coyotes center Robert Lang is continually amazed by former Detroit Red Wings teammate Pavel Datsyuk 's ability to strip unsuspecting opponents of the puck .
" I think I see him do that more than anybody in the league , " Lang said .
" He sneaks up on guys from behind .
He 's quicker and stronger than people give him credit for . "
Datsyuk did n't sneak up on anybody Tuesday , when , as expected , he was named a finalist for the Selke Trophy as the NHL 's top defensive forward .
Datsyuk has won the award the past two years , partly because of his ability to steal the puck .
He led the league 132 takeaways this season , 49 more than runner - up Ryan Kesler of Vancouver , who also is a finalist , along with Pittsburgh 's Jordan Staal .
" He 's so good at waiting until the last moment to lift someone 's stick , " Red Wings captain Nicklas Lidstrom said .
" Players do n't know he 's right behind them and he waits until he can get that puck .
" We see him on the offensive side , how good he is hanging onto the puck , but he 's just as good on the defensive side , too , the way he can angle players off and take plays off the puck . "
Datsyuk has led the league in takeaways in three of the past four seasons .
Teammate Henrik Zetterberg , also one of the top defensive forwards in the game , said of Datsyuk : " He 's amazing .
When you sit on the bench , you just start laughing sometimes because he 's doing stuff you 're not supposed to do .
" I think he deserves ( the Selke ) .
It 'll be fun to see him win it again . "
The winner will be announced June 23 at the NHL Awards Show in Las Vegas .
Datsyuk can become only the second player to win the Selke in three or more consecutive seasons , joining Montreal 's Bob Gainey , who won it four years in a row from 1977 - 78 to 1990 - 81 , when the trophy first was introduced .
Datsyuk was n't as productive offensively with 70 points -- 27 fewer than his total from each of the previous two seasons .
But Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said Datsyuk continued to excel without the puck because of his work ethic and determination .
" He 's an exceptional two - way player , and his trophies prove that , " Babcock said .
" Pavel 's an elite player , period .
One of the best players , I believe , in the world .
I 've had the opportunity to coach a lot of really good players , and to me he has those instincts and that skill set that allow him to be very successful . "
Rookie Justin Abdelkader said Datsyuk 's commitment to play both ends of the rink sets an example for younger players .
" When he 's committed to defense , how is anyone to say they can't be committed , too ? , " Abdelkader said .
" It sends a message to everyone else .
He does n't have to say anything .
It 's how he plays on the ice and shows it . "
Datsyuk also is expected to be finalist for the Lady Byng Trophy when those nominees are revealed Wednesday .
He has won the award for sportsmanship , combined with a high level of play , three consecutive years .
It is 1966 .
The Beatles ' Revolver has just been released , and the most popular group in the world have been introducing their listeners to , among other things , the effects of LSD .
Specifically , in the song She Said , She Said and , most unambiguously , in the sonic dreamscape of Tomorrow Never Knows .
Nothing like it has ever been heard before in the popular arena .
Unless you count the unearthly music created by the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop for their new , hugely successful show , Doctor Who .
But there have been problems with that show : its star , William Hartnell , is in poor health , and relations with the new production team are not at their best .
The show must go on , but the lead actor has to be replaced .
At around the same time John Lennon is turning his blown mind into permanent song , an idea of simple genius is hit upon : the doctor can regenerate , which in practical terms means that any actor of sufficient charisma and talent can take on the role .
But for the audience to assent to this , it has to be taken seriously , the implications of what such a change might mean to a creature such as the doctor taken on board .
An internal memo describing the transformative process – now made available on the BBC archive website – puts it like this :
" The metaphysical change which takes place over 500 or so years is a horrifying experience – an experience in which he relives some of the most unendurable moments of his long life , including the galactic war .
It is as if he has had the LSD drug and instead of experiencing the kicks , he has the hell and dank horror which can be its effect . "
Although the memo has all the hallmarks of having been written in haste – never mind the repetition of " experience " / " experiencing " , the previous paragraph , equally brief , uses the words " horror " or " horrifying " three times in two lines – it seems as if the author of the memo knows whereof he speaks .
If he has not had a bad trip , he knows or has read about someone who has had one .
Or has certainly been following the sensationalist literature on the subject .
But transformation was certainly in the air – or on the air , in the case of Hartnell 's metamorphosis into Patrick Troughton .
Is it any accident , I wonder , that LSD had , vicariously or not , such a regenerative effect on the two most popular British cultural phenomena of the time , to the extent that people are still listening to the Beatles today , and millions are still going to be tuning into Doctor Who next Saturday ?
It is tempting to think that it is the case .
Doctor
Who always was pretty trippy – it's not just that the mise - en - scène generously allows for a certain expansion of the mind at the point of creation , but at the point of reception , too .
Many a student , I suspect , during one of those breaks from their studies that they very occasionally allow themselves , has relaxed to an old Doctor Who video or DVD while under the influence of psychotropic drugs ( I freely admit that I have , and can still recall , from the fringes of my consciousness , someone asking where I was , and hearing the reply , " he 's on Planet Zog " , which at the time I found rather funny ) .
As to whether any of the show 's writers or creators dreamed up any of its zanier flights of fancy while under the influence of anything stronger or more illegal than you could get in the Television Centre canteen , that would be to traduce the powers of the imagination , and unless the BBC archives available to us become even more frank than they are already , must remain a matter of speculation ; but drugs must have had something to do with the change that turned the Britain of the 1950s – the most boring country on earth , as David Hare described it in his memoirs – into the Britain of the 1960s : one of the most interesting , if not the most .
This is not to minimise the dangers of using hallucinogens as a means of producing or appreciating art ( the stoned do appreciate a lot of rubbish ) .
To take the most visible example among countless invisible ones , Syd Barrett would n't have destroyed himself without LSD – but then we would n't have The Piper at the Gates of Dawn either .
No great loss , you say ?
Listen to it again .
It 's the best thing Pink Floyd ever did , in not only my humble opinion .
But when it comes to composing high art or literature the effects of the pharmacopoeia are , almost without exception , pernicious .
Hunter S Thompson could get away with it ; and his example inspired no one to anything good that I can recall .
But when it comes to producing popular culture , a dash of the psychedelic can be truly inspirational , and something in our readiness to be amazed connects to this , whether we 're under the influence or not .
You do n't have to partake of the drugs in order to enjoy their effects second hand , as millions of clear - headed Doctor Who ( or indeed Beatles ) fans can attest .
This week 's episode , I gather , involves Winston Churchill hiring Daleks to fight the Nazi menace , and Spitfires in space .
I 'm not saying anyone was off their head when they came up with that idea .
But now that memo is in the public arena , I can't help thinking that they should have been .
Court begins hearing civil suit brought against Israeli government over death of US activist killed by Israeli army bulldozer in Gaza AP
A British witness told a court today about how he had watched an Israeli military bulldozer run over and kill the American activist Rachel Corrie while she was trying to stop Palestinians ' homes being demolished in Gaza .
Richard Purssell , who was also a volunteer activist in Rafah at the time , seven years ago , described the " shocking and dramatic event " in an Israeli court in Haifa on the first day of a civil suit brought by Corrie 's family against the Israeli state .
Twenty - three - year - old Corrie , from Olympia , Washington , in the US , went to Gaza for peace activism reasons at a time when there was intense conflict between the Israeli military and the Palestinians .
The Corrie family lawyer , Hussein Abu Hussein , said he would argue that her death was due either to gross negligence by the Israeli military or that it was intended .
If the Israeli state were found responsible , the family would press for damages .
Purssell , a Briton , now working as a landscape gardener , said he volunteered with the International Solidarity Movement ( ISM ) to witness events in the occupied Palestinian territories for himself .
In Rafah he had been hoping to prevent the Israeli military from demolishing Palestinian homes .
The organisation was strictly non violent , he said .
" Our role was to support Palestinian non-violent resistance . "
On the day of her death , 16 March 2003 , Corrie was with seven other activists , including Purssell , in Rafah , close to the Israeli - guarded border with Egypt .
They saw an Israeli military armoured Caterpillar D9 bulldozer approaching the house of a Palestinian doctor .
Purssell described how the bulldozer approached at a fast walking pace , its blade down and gathering a pile of soil in its path .
When the bulldozer was 20 metres from the house Corrie , who like the others was wearing an orange fluorescent jacket , climbed on to the soil in front of it and stood " looking into the cab of the bulldozer " .
" The bulldozer continued to move forward , " Purssell said .
" Rachel turned to come back down the slope .
The earth is still moving and as she nears the bottom of the pile something happened which causes her to fall forward .
The bulldozer continued to move forward and Rachel disappeared from view under the moving earth . "
The bulldozer continued forward four metres as the activists began to run forward and shout at the driver .
" It passed the point where Rachel fell , it stopped and reversed back along the track it first made .
Rachel was lying on the earth , " Purssell said .
" She was still breathing . "
Corrie was severely injured and died shortly afterwards .
The Israeli military says it bears no responsibility for Corrie 's death .
A month after her death the military said an investigation had determined its troops were not to blame ; the driver of the bulldozer had not seen her and had not intentionally run her over .
It accused Corrie and the ISM of behaviour that was " illegal , irresponsible and dangerous " .
Hussein will argue at the Haifa district court that witness evidence shows that the soldiers did see Corrie at the scene , with other activists well before the incident , and that they could have arrested her or removed her from the area before there was any risk of injury .
Before the hearing began , Craig Corrie , Rachel 's father , said the family had been on a " seven - year search for justice in Rachel 's name " .
He added : " I think when the truth comes out about Rachel the truth will not wound Israel , the truth is the start of making us heal . "
Cindy Corrie , Rachel 's mother , said the family was still waiting for the credible , transparent investigation Israel first promised regarding her daughter 's death .
" I just want to say to Rachel that our family is here today trying to just do right by her and I hope that she will be very proud of the effort we are making , " she said .
She said the family had met the staff of US vice - president Joe Biden on Tuesday to talk about the case .
Three other witnesses , two more Britons and an American , who were all at the scene in Rafah when Corrie was killed will give evidence at the Israeli court .
It is not clear if any Israeli military officials will speak .
The hearing is scheduled to run for at least two weeks .
Lehman Head Bryan Marsal has warned that Wall Street had not learned its lesson in the credit crisis and that another megabank bankruptcy is likely .
Marsal made the remarks while in Berlin for a bankruptcy conference in an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt , which I have translated below .
A link to the full German text is provided at the bottom of this post .
His comments serve as a reminder that the megabanks are still too large and complex , and , therefore pose a risk to the entire global banking system .
Text of the interview Handelsblatt : you are handling the largest bankruptcy in human history .
Can anything like this happen again ?
Bryan Marsal :
It is even likely that a case like Lehman ’s will repeat itself – in any event , as long as nothing fundamental changes in financial regulation and in financial institutions .
Wall Street has not really learned a lot from the situation .
There is still too much leverage in the market , and credit default swaps remain completely unregulated .
Even with regulators and in the companies little has been done after the global catastrophe .
HB : But financial regulators around the world are now pulling in the reins … Marsal : Oh , really ?
That ’s just for show .
The regulators are overworked and underpaid .
Someone who earns $ 80,000 a year cannot seriously compete with someone who gets $ 400,000 for finding ways to get around the system .
And so far no one from the regulators at the SEC , at the FDIC or our government has asked how the Lehman collapse could have been avoided and what countermeasures could be taken to prevent a recurrence .
HB : So David loses to Goliath ?
Marsal : I would n’t put it that way .
In Canada , for example , you have to put up at least 25 percent equity to finance your own home .
The banks finance no more than three quarters of the money .
If we had such a rule in the U.S. , there would never have been the massive mortgage - speculation in the years from 2005 to 2007 .
HB : What should have been done ?
Marsal :
You see , Lehman was not too big to go bust , rather too complex .
An orderly bankruptcy with the assistance of the U.S. government would have saved investors losses in the order of 75 to 100 billion U.S. dollars .
A similar global meltdown could be prevented only if there were global regulations for companies that are also as complex and global as Lehman was .
Lehman saw itself as an American institution , but worked in 40 states and had more than 900 subsidiaries .
Consequently , we have to deal with 80 different types of insolvency proceedings in 20 different jurisdictions .
There is simply a lack of an overarching coordination of the regulatory bodies in the international financial markets .
Banks are growing globally , but die locally , that ’s the problem .
HB : And no one anticipated this ?
Marsal : The Treasury Department miscalculated .
Nobody there had counted on the global consequences of the Lehman collapse , and therefore no one had taken a well - prepared liquidation of the company into consideration .
HB : What do you mean ?
Marsal : Banks in trouble cannot be saved in the sense of a ongoing concern (? ) forecast .
We thus need some kind of global emergency parachute .
If banks want to grow beyond national borders , regulators need to agree in advance on a single procedure in the event of bankruptcy .
In the absence of such agreement between individual states , banks should not receive any authorization for cross - border expansion .
So , here is the man overseeing the largest bankruptcy in history telling us that , more than one year on , US regulators have n’t even asked for his professional opinion as to what went wrong and how we can stop a repeat .
That ’s pretty damning .
It certainly speaks to the inability of regulation alone to prevent another crisis .
You must break up the banks and setup a resolution mechanism for their likely failure , because Lehman ’s CEO feels one of these banks will fail in the future .
Moreover , there is absolutely no international agreement on what needs to be done to regulate these cross - border megabanks .
Marsal ’s worry of another crisis seems apt in this environment .
Marsal is winding Lehman down much as Drexel was liquidated nearly 20 years ago after its catastrophic failure .
So , he is simply administering the disposal of assets .
The article mentions that the German banks are loaded with Lehman debt , $ 80 billion worth of claims .
That tells me that German banks are probably also very exposed in Greece and Spain as well – one reason the Germans should look to a non-Lehman - like end to the European sovereign debt crisis .

Lehman - Chef warnt vor weiteren großen Bankpleiten – Handelsblatt
Update 1225 EDT :
While the focus of this story was regulation of too - big - to - fail institutions , a Canadian reader pointed out that some of Mr Marsal ’s statements were inaccurate regarding mortgage lending in Canada .
Yes , 20 % down is required for a conventional mortgage .
However , in practice , most people put much less down .
For example at Toronto - Dominion ’s website it reads :
The size of a down payment can vary .
Depending on the type of mortgage , down payments generally range from 5 % to 20 % of the purchase price .
To obtain a conventional mortgage , home buyers are required to put down at least 20 % of the purchase price or appraised value ( whichever is less ) as a down payment .
If you do n’t have the necessary time or resources to save a full 20 % down payment , you can choose a high - ratio mortgage and buy a home with as little as a 5 % down payment .
This option is called a high - ratio mortgage and it requires you to purchase default insurance .
Whether you choose a conventional or a high - ratio mortgage , one thing is almost always certain : the larger your down payment , the more you save in the long run .
A larger down payment —
Reduces the amount of your monthly principal and interest payment
Reduces the total amount of interest you pay over the life of your mortgage Your TD Canada Trust mortgage specialist can show you how much you could save , and show you many more money - saving strategies .
Moreover , I know that TD also offers up to 5 % cash back ( see here ) .
So , effectively , you can get 100 % of your mortgage in Canada financed by the bank – and many do .
At the heart of all this is a question which is , I am glad to say , becoming fashionable in Tory political debate .
The way we look at our own lives and our own society should be intergenerational .
The present comes out of the past and looks into the future .
What is good only for one generation at one moment is almost certainly bad for all of us .
Our refusal to allow enough new houses is an attack by the present generation on the next , a vote of no -confidence in the future for which the social and financial costs are already proving punitively high .
So I wish all the best not only to Mr and Mrs Fidler , but also to young Harry Fidler , aged eight , who spent his earliest years behind hay - bales .
Why should n't he one day be king of the castle his father built ?

Was it the crowds ( insane ) , the heat ( manageable ) , or the rumor that some lady had thrown up near the buffet an hour into the event ( just gross , yet credible ) ?
Whatever the case this year I found myself not in the whiskey groove at the ordinarily smashing Whiskies of the World San Francisco event .
It was probably the crowds that did it , literally shoulder to shoulder as people muscled their way through a far - too - small ballroom en route to well over 100 artisan spirits .
Plenty of good stuff was being poured — I know , because I ’ve tried a lot of it in the past — but the scene was so crazy that really enjoying the experience was tough .
Still , some favorites were certainly discoverable .
My tops of the night : Ardmore ’s 30 Year Old single malt , a powerful companion to its Traditional Cask , which I ’ve written about here a few times before .
Other favorites I ’ve had before , including Glenmorangie Lasanta , and Tomintoul ’s 27 and 31 Year Old Scotches .

South Korea is moving to battle online gaming addiction by forcing underage gamers off the internet .
A new policy announced by the Ministry of Culture , Sports and Tourism will literally force underage gamers off the internet once midnight rolls around .
It is part of a twofold initiative to fight teen gaming addiction .
Popular MMOGs like Maple Story and Barameui Nara will all have this system implemented by the second half of the year , and the program is intended to eventually encompass the 19 MMOGs that make up 79 percent of the Korean online gaming consumption .
In addition , the system will also force a reduced , slower performance when it detects underage gamers have been playing for too long .
Using the registration , the game will be able to differentiate between underage and above - age players , but there are also plans for ways to stop underage gamers from using their parents ' resident registration numbers to keep gaming , though no details on that plan have been released .
The pressure for action has been stepped up recently due to a number of reports of gamers dying of exhaustion after playing for too long , as well as the shocking story of a three - month old girl dying due to starvation and neglect .
While critics feel the measures may not be enough to simply prevent underage gamers from simply bypassing them , there is still a push within the country for strong measures to help prevent these problems .

DAKAR , Senegal — Officials and human rights groups in Nigeria sharply increased the count of the dead after a weekend of vicious ethnic violence , saying Monday that as many as 500 people — many of them women and children — may have been killed near the city of Jos , long a center of tensions between Christians and Muslims .
The dead were Christians and members of an ethnic group that had been feuding with the Hausa - Fulani , Muslim herders whom witnesses and police officials identified as the attackers .
Officials said the attack was in reprisal for violence in January , when dozens of Muslims were slaughtered in and around Jos , including more than 150 in one village .
Early Sunday , the attackers set upon the villagers with machetes , killing women and children in their homes and ensnaring the men who tried to flee in fishnets and animal traps , then massacring them , according to a Nigerian rights group whose investigators went to the area .
Some homes were set on fire .
The latest attacks were “ a sort of vengeance from the Hausa - Fulani , ” said the Rev. Emmanuel Joel , of the Christian Association of Nigeria in Jos .
After the January attacks , “ the military watched over the city , and neglected the villages , ” he said .
Frustrated transit riders will soon get a chance to voice their complaints in person , now that Amalgamated Transit Union Local 113 has announced the details of a series of town hall meetings to address the strained relationship between passengers and workers .
Saying his members are “ open to criticism , ” union president Bob Kinnear adopted a more conciliatory tone than before , while announcing three meetings where riders will be able to publicly air their grievances .
The forums , billed “ Let ’s Talk : TTC Riders and Workers , ” will be held Sunday afternoons in various parts of the city and moderated by public figures not affiliated with the TTC or the union .
John
Tory will host the first event on April 11 .
The audience will be able to ask questions and be polled instantly , through hand - held electronic voting devices , to gauge which issues are most relevant to them .
The union is following through on a February announcement , at the height of a period of bad customer relations , that it intended to engage with customers .
Reading a prepared statement , Kinnear said he wanted the meetings to be “ a platform for a new beginning of positive relationships between transit users and workers . ”
“ We are tired of the negative and unproductive ‘us vs. them ’ climate that is distracting the city from the very serious issues facing public transit . ”
Kinnear ’s softer demeanour was a marked change for the fiery union head , who last month lashed out at the public and media after riders captured on camera a series of embarrassing gaffes involving TTC workers .
“ Stop the video stalking of drivers when they stop for a washroom break , ” he said then .
Rider discontent over fare hikes and token shortages came to a head earlier this year when a TTC fare collector was photographed sleeping on the job .
A spate of bad publicity followed , including video footage of a bus driver taking a long coffee and washroom break while en route and the suspension of another driver who failed a breathalyzer .
Kinnear said the union ’s meetings have nothing to do with the TTC ’s recently struck customer service advisory panel , from which he claimed the union had been excluded .
“ We were very , very concerned with the direction of the panel , ” Kinnear said , alleging that it is “ politically motivated . ”
“ That ’s just not accurate , ” said TTC vice - chair and city councillor Joe Mihevc , who says he personally invited Kinnear to participate in the panel , which also includes a transit worker .
Still , Mihevc said the union ’s initiative is positive and can only help the “ reweaving of the relationship between the TTC and the riding public . ”
“ It ’s big enough an issue that a lot of different kinds of conversations can happen , ” he said .
“ At the end of the day we ’re going to have a great public transit system if the transit workers and the public understand each other better . ”

The meetings , slated to last two hours , will be broadcast live on Rogers Cable 10 and streamed on the union ’s websit , wemovetoronto.ca .
All venues can accommodate more than 300 people .
Kinnear said the union will cover the costs and provide free shuttle buses to the events from nearby subway stations .
Kinnear and four front - line workers will be on stage with the moderator .
Other TTC workers will act as greeters and ushers at the meetings , but will not be allowed to ask questions , Kinnear said .

We are more likely to graduate from high school and college than the boys in our cohort , and we enter professional and graduate school at a comparable rate , too .
We look forward to full and busy lives made possible in part by the progress made by our mothers and grandmothers .
We are heirs to a legacy built by the women 's libbers who came before us and the suffragettes who came before them .
And yet , if you ask the average young American woman if she is a feminist , the answer is n't often a resounding " yes " .
The answer is usually , " I 'm not a feminist , but … "
What follows will be the profession of a feminist view , like her belief in equal pay for equal work or in a woman 's right to choose .
But , she will add , this does n't make her a feminist .
In an age when feminist beliefs are almost a given for young women , the word " feminist " has become quite the opposite and many are shunning the label .
It 's hardly surprising .
After all , feminism has a pretty dreadful reputation .
In her landmark book Backlash , Susan Faludi painstakingly chronicled over a century of scare tactics designed to deter women from embracing the ideas of feminism .
Fortunately , those tactics were ultimately unsuccessful : most women of my generation embrace feminist ideas .
What the backlash has succeeded in doing is making feminists , and the idea of being a feminist , unappealing .
Faludi's book was written in 1991 but almost 20 years later , too little has changed .
In the popular imagination , feminists are still the ugly , angry extremists who killed chivalry and who seek not gender equality , but world domination .
Calling yourself a feminist carries with it the risk of having any one of these labels slapped on your forehead .
It 's also unsurprising that women of my generation feel that the feminist movement has n't made room for them : for a long time , it did n't .
But thankfully , feminism has now recognised that young women 's voices matter , and that young women 's leadership is valuable .
The website that I write for , Feministing , is devoted to giving young feminist women a platform , and it 's not the only one .
There are thousands of young women out there who proudly wear that label , and I 'm grateful every day for the hard work that they do : none of them would deny that being a feminist is hard work .
Feminism demands a complete overhaul of how we think , how we behave , how we talk , where we work , what media we consume , how we vote and how we raise our families .
For women and for men , feminism is a dramatic shift away from the way things have always been .
That 's why it 's so thrilling – and so threatening .
Unfortunately , despite the enormous strides we have made towards gender equality , that overhaul is far from complete .
In a country where only 17 % of Congress is female , where women – with or without children – make 77 % what men make a decade after finishing their education and where only 6 % of rapists will serve jail time , we can't afford " not a feminist , but … " – a disclaimer that signals to the world that we 're willing to settle for an incomplete overhaul .
" I 'm not a feminist , but … " is a way of telling the world that we do n't pose too much of a threat .
It 's a way of saying that we do n't plan to rock the boat too much , that we will play nice .
And yet , feminists are people who dare to imagine a world in which women are 50 % of Congress , where women are paid 100 % of what their male colleagues earn and where every person who violates another human being is reported , prosecuted and convicted .
It 's tempting to hide behind this disclaimer , this shield .
But it is feminism which got us where we are today and without action and leadership from unabashed young feminists , we wo n't get much further .
So step out from behind your shield and say it : " I am a feminist . "
No ifs , ands or buts .

A report in the Times said doctors have called for an investigation into what they describe as subliminal tobacco advertising on Ferrari's Formula
One cars .
It is claimed the red , white and black bar code on Ferrari 's cars and overalls was aimed at linking viewers with the Marlboro brand .
Philip Morris , the maker of Marlboro , backs Ferrari but is not able to have any direct branding because of the EU ban on tobacco advertising .
The ten - year contract , which was signed in 2001 , is believed to be worth around US $ 1 billion but Ferrari have always refused to disclose the figure .
John Britton , a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and director of its tobacco advisory group , told the Times : " The bar code looks like the bottom half of a packet of Marlboro cigarettes .
I was stunned when I saw it .
This is pushing at the limits .
If you look at how the bar code has evolved over the last four years , it looks like creeping branding . "
A spokesman for Ferrari told the newspaper : " The bar code is part of the livery of the car .
It is not part of a subliminal advertising campaign . "
A spokesman for Philip Morris said the deal complied with the law .
Ferrari is the only F1 team with a tobacco brand in its formal title - Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro .
Its official logo also features a bar code and its drivers wear overalls bearing the bar code next to the Ferrari logo .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A team from Berkeley 's Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences department has figured out how to get a robot to fold previously unseen towels of different sizes .
Their approach solves a key problem in robotics -- how to deal with flexible , or " deformable , " objects .
Who would n't want a robot that could make your bed or do the laundry ?
Well , a team of Berkeley researchers has brought us one important step closer by , for the first time , enabling an autonomous robot to reliably fold piles of previously unseen towels .
Robots that can do things like assembling cars have been around for decades .
The towel - folding robot , though , is doing something very new , according to the leaders of the Berkeley team , doctoral student Jeremy Maitin - Shepard and Assistant Professor Pieter Abbeel of Berkeley 's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences .
Robots like the car - assembly ones are designed to work in highly structured settings , which allows them to perform a wide variety of tasks with mind - boggling precision and repeatability — but only in carefully controlled environments , Maitin - Shepard and Abbeel explain .
Outside of such settings , their capabilities are much more limited .
Automation of household tasks like laundry folding is somewhat compelling in itself .
But more significantly , according to Maitin - Shepard , the task involves one that 's proved a challenge for robots : perceiving and manipulating " deformable objects " - things that are flexible , not rigid , so their shape is n't predictable .
A towel is deformable ; a mug or a computer is n't .
A video — posted on this page — tells the story best .
It shows a robot built by the Menlo Park robotics company Willow Garage and running an algorithm developed by the Berkeley team , faced with a heap of towels it 's never " seen " before .
The towels are of different sizes , colors and materials .
The robot picks one up and turns it slowly , first with one arm and then with the other .
It uses a pair of high - resolution cameras to scan the towel to estimate its shape .
Once it finds two adjacent corners , it can start folding .
On a flat surface , it completes the folds — smoothing the towel after each fold , and making a neat stack .
" Existing work on robotic laundry and towel folding has shown that starting from a known configuration , the actual folding can be performed using standard techniques in robotic manufacturing , " says Maitin - Shepard .
But there 's been a bottleneck : getting a towel picked up from a pile where its configuration is unknown and arbitrary , and turning it into a known , predictable shape .
That 's because existing computer - vision techniques , which were primarily developed for rigid objects , are n't robust enough to handle possible variations in three - dimensional shape , appearance and texture that can occur with deformable objects , the researchers say .
Solving that problem helps a robot fold towels .
But more significantly , it addresses a key issue in the development of robotics .
" Many important problems in robotics and computer vision involve deformable objects , " says Abbeel , " and the challenges posed by robotic towel - folding reflect important challenges inherent in robotic perception and manipulation for deformable objects . "
The team 's technical innovation is a new computer vision - based approach for detecting the key points on the cloth for the robot to grasp , an approach that is highly effective because it depends only on geometric cues that can be identified reliably even in the presence of changes in appearance and texture .
The approach has proven highly reliable .
The robot succeeded in all 50 trials that were attempted on previously unseen towels with wide variations in appearance , material and size , according to the team 's report on its research , which is being presented in May at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation 2010 in Anchorage .
Their paper is posted online ( PDF ) .
The system was implemented on a prototype version of the PR2 , a mobile robotic platform that was developed by Willow Garage , using the open - source Robot Operating System ( ROS ) software framework .
Two undergraduates , Marco Cusumano - Towner , a junior in EECS , and Jinna Lei , a senior math major , assisted on the project .

It was to be a celebration , but a federal agency in charge of offshore drilling has postponed next week ’s annual luncheon in Houston , which was to extol the safety record of offshore oil drilling .
A new posting on the website of the U.S. Interior Department ’s Minerals Management Service , or MMS , noted that the agency is busy and the unfolding tragedy that has cost lives and oil might conflict with the May 3 luncheon .
“ The ongoing situation with the Transocean Deepwater Horizon drilling accident has caused the MMS to dedicate considerable resources to the successful resolution of this event , which will conflict with holding this ceremony next week , ” the posting said .
Last year , BP America , operator of the deep - water rig that exploded and sank last week , was among the luncheon 's winners , cited for “ outstanding dedication and leadership in promoting improved medical care and evacuation capabilities for offshore facilities . ”
The Minerals Management Service manages oil and gas drilling and production in federal waters and then collects and distributes royalties from any extracted minerals .

Two recent computational studies show that expression relationships between genes change with age – for example , some genes have expression levels that are highly correlated in early adulthood but not in old age .
Both studies propose new methods for identifying gene groups with this behaviour , and the second also makes a compelling case that many related genes lose coexpression with age .
Crucially , the correlation between a pair of genes may change with age even when the average expression levels of both genes do not – so these new coexpression methods are complementary to traditional differential expression analyses of microarray data .
Gillis et al. developed a new framework for identifying pairs of genes differentially coexpressed with age that is based on Haar wavelets , and tested it on a large set of human expression data mined from the handy GEMMA database .
Unlike other methods that can interpret data coming from only two groups ( e.g. young mice vs. old ) , the new wavelet method is designed to handle multiple ordered groups – such as animals of many different ages .
The authors do n’t discuss the biological implications of their results in any detail , instead promising these will be explored in a later paper .
Southworth et al. showed that coexpression patterns of groups of related genes become less coherent as animals age .
Using several different methods for grouping genes together ( e.g. assigning genes to the same group if they share a function , or if they are targets of the same transcription factor ) , they calculated intra-group correlation in 16 - and 24 - month - old mice using data from the AGEMAP study .
They identified a surprisingly large number of groups with lower correlation in old mice .
One of these is the targets of NF - κB – a transcription factor that , when knocked down , can reverse skin aging .
Only a few groups ( including one enriched for DNA damage genes ) showed higher correlation in old mice .
Also , the authors found that genes showing decreases in correlation are n’t randomly located on the chromosome – instead , they form several clusters .
What are the causes and consequences of these changes in gene group correlation ?
Previous single - cell studies have shown that transcriptional noise , or cell - to - cell variation in the expression levels of individual genes , increases with age .
Clearly transcriptional noise is going to affect coexpression to some degree : any increase in a gene ’s noise level will automatically reduce its calculated coexpression with other genes .
But changes in coexpression can also occur without any corresponding change in noise .
These changes may reflect cellular processes that are active or suppressed at different times of life , and many or all such changes ( such as a ramped - up DNA damage response in old age ) may be adaptive .
Further analyses are needed to tease out which age - related coexpression differences result from noise , and which ones are telling us something new .

Polonium Polonium is a radioactive , extremely rare semi-metal .
It is reactive , silvery - gray , it dissolves in dilute acids , but it is only slightly soluble in alkalis .
it is fairly volatile : about half of a sample of it will evaporate within 3 days ( unless it is kept in a sealed container ) .
Applications Polonium was once used in textile mills ( to eliminate static charges ) and by the manufacturers of photographic plates ( in brushes to remove the accumulated dust ) .
It is used as a source of alfa-radiation for research and , alloyed with beryllium it can act as a portable source of neutrons , which normally only access to a nuclear reactor can provide .
Polonium in the environment Polonium is a very rare element in nature .
it is found in uranium ores , but none extract it form these ores .
Polonium is produced in about 100 g / year by bombarding bismuth with neutrons in a nuclear reactor .
Health effects of polonium Polonium is studied in a few nuclear research laboratories where its high radioactivity as an alpha-emitter requires special handling techniques and precautions .
Polonium - 210 is the only component of cigarette smoke that has produced cancer by itself in laboratory animals by inhalation - tumors appeared already at a polonium level five times lower than those of a normal heavy smoker .
Lung cancer rates among men kept climbing from a rarity in 1930 ( 4/100,000 per year ) to the No. 1 cancer killer in 1980 ( 72/100,000 ) in spite of an almost 20 percent reduction in smoking .
But during the same period , the level of polonium - 210 in American tobacco had tripled .
This coincided with the increase in the use of phosphate fertilizers by tobacco growers - calcium phosphate ore accumulates uranium and slowly releases radon gas .
As radon decays , its electrically charged daughter products attach themselves to dust particles , which adhere to the sticky hairs on the underside of tobacco leaves .
This leaves a deposit of radioactive polonium and lead on the leaves .
Then , the intense localized heat in the burning tip of a cigarette volatilizes the radioactive metals .
While cigarette filters can trap chemical carcinogens , they are ineffective against radioactive vapors .
The lungs of a chronic smoker end up with a radioactive lining in a concentration much higher than from residential radon .
These particles emit radiation .
Smoking two packs of cigarettes a day imparts a radiation dose by alpha particles of about 1,300 millirem per year .
For comparison , the annual radiation dose to the average American from inhaled radon is 200 mrem .
However , the radiation dose at the radon " action level " of 4 pCi/L is roughly equivalent to smoking 10 cigarettes a day .
In addition , polunium - 210 is soluble and is circulated through the body to every tissue and cell in levels much higher than from residential radon .
The proof is that it can be found in the blood and urine of smokers .
The circulating polonium - 210 causes genetic damage and early death from diseases reminiscent of early radiological pioneers : liver and bladder cancer , stomach ulcer , leukemia , cirrhosis of liver , and cardiovascular diseases .
The Surgeon General C. Everett Koop stated that radioactivity , rather than tar , accounts for at least 90 % of all smoking - related lung cancers .
The Center for Disease Control concluded " Americans are exposed to far more radiation from tobacco smoke than from any other source . "
Cigarette smoking accounts for 30 % of all cancer deaths .
Only poor diet rivals tobacco smoke as a cause of cancer in the U.S. , causing a comparable number of fatalities each year .
However , the National Cancer Institute , with an annual budget of $ 500 million , has no active funding for research of radiation from smoking or residential radon as a cause of lung cancer , presumably , to protect the public from undue fears of radiation .
Environmental effects of polonium
The environmental and biochemical forces which may tend to reconcentrate these toxic materials in living cells are not well known .
Although polonium occurs naturally , it has become much more available for entering into water , food , living cells and tissue since the mining boom which began shortly after the Second World War .

PRINCETON , NJ -- Americans are about evenly divided on the merits of giving the federal government new powers to regulate large banks and major financial institutions ; however , they offer greater support when the issue is more specifically framed as regulating " Wall Street banks . "
When Wall Street is not mentioned , net public support ( percentage in favor minus percentage opposed ) for banking reform legislation is +3 points , but when it is mentioned , net support is +14 .
Gallup measured support for enhanced federal regulation of banking using both wordings in its April 17 - 18 Daily tracking .
A random half - sample of respondents was asked the " Wall Street " wording ; the other half was asked about banks and major financial institutions , generally .
On both questions , Democrats are more likely than Republicans to support banking reform .
Seven in 10 Democrats favor the proposed new federal regulatory powers , regardless of the wording .
By contrast , Republicans show greater support for reform when " Wall Street " is invoked than when it is not ( 35 % vs. 22 % ) .
Democrats Enjoy Slight Political Edge
Connecticut Sen. Chris
Dodd is crafting a major financial regulatory reform bill that seeks to prevent another financial meltdown ; the bill is expected to come to the Senate floor within the next week .
Dodd is reportedly angry that his bill has yet to earn any Republican support -- Republicans say the bill does not close all the loopholes needed to prevent further financial bailouts -- suggesting it could be headed for an acrimonious party - line vote .
Gallup 's new polling suggests the Democrats may hold a slight advantage in the looming public relations battle over Senate Bill 3217 , given that , by 42 % to 34 % , Americans favor congressional Democrats over congressional Republicans to handle " this type of financial regulation . "
The Democrats ' advantage stems mainly from the slight preference political independents have for that party ( 34 % vs. 25 % ) .
However , the largest segment of independents -- 41 % -- has no party preference on the issue .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,024 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted April 17 - 18 , 2010 , as part of Gallup Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Two of the questions were asked of a random half sample of respondents on the Gallup Daily tracking survey for two nights .
Question 1 , asked of Form A , is based on interviews with 484 national adults .
Question 2 , asked of Form B , is based on interviews with 540 national adults .
Results for both forms have an associated margin of error of ±5 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on landline telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Dong Fangxiao ( right ) was 14 - years - old when she won the bronze medal
China 's gymnastics authorities say they are ' pained ' by the decision to strip the women 's team of their Olympic bronze medal from the Sydney Games .
Investigations found gymnast Dong Fangxiao was only 14 years old - two years too young - at the 2000 Games .
The Chinese Gymnastics Association said " We will learn a lesson and ... prevent a similar incident from happening . "
In a statement the association said it agreed with the International Olympic Committee 's decision .
The United States women 's team will now take the bronze medal .
The International Gymnastics Federation ( FIG ) carried out the investigation and subsequently recommended the IOC take the medal back .
The IOC executive board upheld the request and formally stripped the medal on the first day of a two - day meeting in Dubai .
Dong was also stripped of her sixth - place result in the individual floor exercises and seventh place in the vault .
Age falsification has been a problem in gymnastics since the 1980s , when the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15 to help protect still - developing athletes from serious injuries .
The FIG raised the minimum age to its current 16 in 1997 .
The International Gymnastics Federation had previously cleared five Chinese gymnasts suspected of being underage at the Beijing Olympics in 2008 , after Chinese officials provided original passports , ID cards and family registers showing all of the gymnasts were old enough to compete .
But the FIG had said following that investigation it was not satisfied with " the explanations and evidence provided to date " for Dong and a second gymnast , Yang Yun from the 2000 Olympic team .
However , FIG investigators did not find sufficient evidence to prove Yang , who also won a bronze medal on uneven bars in 2000 , was underage so she received only a warning .
Democrats say they think the debate gives them an attractive political issue .
It allows them to position themselves against Wall Street and corporate money in politics while railing against what they view as the Supreme Court ’s pro-business stance just as a new vacancy has opened on the court .
Democrats in Congress , led in the Senate by Charles E. Schumer of New York and in the House by Chris Van Hollen of Maryland , could announce details of the plan as early as this week .
They are trying to get a Republican in each chamber to sign on as a co-sponsor but plan to move ahead even without bipartisan support , the officials said .
In an interview Monday , Mr. Schumer said : “ What we ’re trying to do first is make sure everything we do is within the constitutional mandate set by the court .
And second , we ’re trying to make it a bill that can get broad bipartisan support . ”
In reviewing the Supreme Court ’s decision , lawyers for the administration and Congressional Democrats soon realized that the majority ’s strong language left them little room to try to ban corporate money altogether , according to people involved in the discussions .
They have focused instead on forcing public disclosure of political backers as a way to bring transparency to the process and , perhaps , to discourage excessive corporate involvement .
“ What we ’ve been trying to do , ” said one Congressional official who has worked on the plan , “ is to set up a really robust disclosure mechanism . ”
German troops in Afghanistan call on Angela Merkel to explain why they 're at war
Under pressure : German troops are calling on Chancellor Angela Merkel to tell them why they 're at war in Afghanistan
German soldiers are wearing their hearts on their sleeves - in the form of a badge that protests their country 's involvement in the war in Afghanistan .
Some troops have taken to wearing the cloth accessory that states - ironically - ' I fight for Merkel ' in a bid to persuade the German Chancellor Angela Merkel to explain exactly what they are fighting and dying for .
Four more troops were killed , and five badly injured , in Afghanistan last week .
Seven soldiers have died there so far this month , bringing the total to 43 in all since they were first deployed eight years ago .
Unable to engage the Taliban directly on the ground , frustrated by their government ’s inability to acknowledge they are even engaged in a war and angered by the lack of popular support for their mission , the badges are a low - key mutiny that has sent shock waves through the top brass of the Bundeswehr .
Soldiers were warned this week that it is illegal to sew the cloth patches on to their uniforms .
But that has n’t stopped them from buying the badges in their hundreds , in desert beige or NATO green , at the ISAF camp at Mazar - e - Sharif .
' They want the Chancellor , their ultimate boss , to finally find the clear words to put the war against the Taliban into black and white , ' Bild Zeitung , Germany ’s biggest daily paper , said today .
Chancellor Merkel is to make a statement to parliament tomorrow .
Her spokesman said she wants to make clear her ' high - esteem ' for the work of the German soldiers in Afghanistan in the light of the recent casualties .
But she will be speaking in the Reichstag after being put under pressure from U.S. General Stanley McChrystal , who arrived in Germany today with a brief from the White House to get the Germans to do more in Afghanistan .
Germany has the third largest presence in Afghanistan after the U.S. and Britain .
The German parliament approved the dispatch of a further 850 soldiers in February when it extended the mandate for the military mission .
Yet the political will for German troops to engage the enemy head - on remains lacking .
Cracks are growing in the parties that supported their engagement there up until now .
Ottmar Schreiner , a left - wing member of the opposition Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) , said his party has ' growing doubts ' about German involvement in Afghanistan .
He said : ' If things have n't improved in Afghanistan by next year then I do n't see where a majority for a new extension of the mandate is going to come from . '
The trouble for Mrs Merkel is that German involvement is deeply unpopular with some 80 per cent of the public , who want the troops to come home .
Germany ’s disastrous wars of the last century have left its public with a deep pacifistic streak .
The German press has been swift to condemn the government for its indecisiveness .
The Financial Times Deutschland said : ' With every dead German soldier in Afghanistan , the calls for an immediate withdrawal grow louder .
This reflex shows that the German public is still not clear about the character of the mission .
' The politicians are largely to blame .
Since the beginning of the mission eight years ago they suppressed a realistic description of the situation ...
Deaths , injuries , battles and heavy weaponry -- none of these suit the picture that was painted back then . '
The left - wing Berliner Zeitung said : ' Why are German soldiers in Afghanistan at all ?
As the chancellor and her government are still sticking to the military mission there it is their duty to explain it .
But she has failed to do so .
' This can be explained by her basic attitude - it is only worth talking about problems when they become virulent .
' In the case of Afghanistan this is particularly catastrophic .
Because the government has failed to make its case in what is the biggest foreign policy and security policy challenge in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany . '
Our first question – does eating breakfast help you lose weight ?
– will be answered as researchers have answered it for some time now : “ not necessarily ” .
According to the members of the American Society for Nutrition and their investigations surrounding meal frequency and weight loss , it ’s hard to prove that breakfast ( or any meal for that matter ) can boost metabolism since eating habits are hard to study .
They actually comment that there ’s no evidence linking meal types and / or meal frequency to the number of calories burnt daily , so there ’s no proof backing up the existence of a metabolism boosting breakfast .
Dietitians comment the same .
Nutritionist Jill Weisenberger explains that many people misunderstand the benefits of eating breakfast because of this myth .
According to her own breakfast metabolism study , breakfast helps with weight management , but not with calorie - burning !
Other studies back her up , stating that breakfast is , indeed , related with lower body weight , but not with enhancing metabolism .
So , if you ’re hoping to eat breakfast to kick start metabolism solely , we ’re sad to say that it wo n’t work .
Are you asking yourself , how to boost metabolism at breakfast then , Should I skip breakfast ?
I Love You Phillip Morris is a good film apparently flummoxed by a core conceit that makes some people uncomfortable .
The decision to keep it hidden , however , should be even more of a concern .

For as many people out there who own a car , there is seemingly an equally large group of people who want to steal them .
The funny thing is that car thieves rarely pull a Gone in 60 Seconds and steal expensive , rare autos .
Year after year some aging model year of the Honda Accord tops the list as the most frequent car stolen in the U.S. , followed by such everyman - mobiles as the Civic Toyota Camry and Ford F - 150 .
Ubiquity rather than desirability seems to be the common denominator among these top stolen vehicles Follow the jump for our latest infographic that explores the facts and figures of stealing cars .
And remember not to be one of the 15 percent of people who leave their keys in the ignition . [ Source : Auto Insurance for Autoblog.com ] [ Source : Auto Insurance for Autoblog.com ]

GM recall - 1.3 million Chevrolets and Pontiacs
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors has recalled 1.3 million Chevrolet and Pontiac models in North America for power steering failures that are tied to 14 crashes and one injury in the United States , the company said Tuesday .
The recall affects 2005 - 2010 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2007 - 2010 Pontiac G5 models sold in the United States , 2005 - 2006 Pontiac Pursuit vehicles sold in Canada , and 2005 - 2006 Pontiac G4 models sold in Mexico .
Detroit - based GM told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the recall Monday after concluding its own investigation first launched in January 2009 .
The NHTSA opened a separate investigation on 905,000 U.S. Cobalt models in January 2010 after receiving more than 1,100 complaints on power steering failures , 14 crashes and an injury .
GM vice president of quality Jamie Hresko said the investigation revealed that the problem develops over time , and is more likely to occur in vehicles whose warranty has expired .
GM spokesman Alan Adler told CNNMoney that the condition tends to impact vehicles that have been driven 20,000 to 30,000 miles .
While the company is developing a solution to fix the problem , Hresko said drivers can maintain control of the vehicle even after losing the power steering function .
" Recalling these vehicles is the right thing to do for our customers ' peace of mind , " he said .
" While greater steering effort under 15 mph may be required , if the customer experiences loss of power steering assist , it is important to note that the vehicle can still be safely controlled because the customer can still steer the vehicle . "
He noted that when the power steering feature fails , a chime will sound and the " Power Steering " message will display to alert drivers .

Advertisement A UK village which raised £ 37,000 to offer 200 homes the super - fast broadband that BT could not deliver has launched its network .
Rutland Telecom will offer the residents of Lyddington speeds of up to 40 M bps ( megabits per second ) .
Other telecom firms had said it was not economical to provide fast services to the village .
Getting fast broadband to rural areas is back in the spotlight as the government shelves its funding plans .
It is estimated that around 2.5 million homes in the UK cannot get broadband speeds of more than 2 M bps .
The Rutland Telecom scheme was a joint effort between villagers fed up with slow broadband speeds and a local ICT firm that was reselling BT 's broadband .
Street cabinet
They discovered that there was nothing to stop them becoming a telco .
" We found that any company could do , on a smaller scale , what Carphone Warehouse has done and take over BT 's network , " said Dr David Lewis , managing director of Rutland Telecom .
HAVE YOUR SAY
High speed internet connections should already be the norm in the UK Geoffrey Marshall They asked Openreach , the BT spin - off that has responsibility for the UK 's telephone network , to supply fibre - optic cable to a street cabinet in the village .
It was a slow process and required the intervention of regulator Ofcom but two years later the telco is up and running and already has 50 customers .
" For the first time in UK telecommunications history the telephone lines of customers are completely cut off from the local BT exchange , " said Rutland Telecom director Mark Melluish .
BT said it was " delighted to help Rutland Telecom " although it added that it hoped it would allow other service providers access to its new network .
Public funds Lyddington is one of many rural areas with slow broadband " Otherwise there is the risk of a local monopoly developing , which is never good for consumers , " said BT Group Strategy Director Olivia Garfield .
Rutland Telecom has been approached by 40 other rural community groups to see if a similar solution is possible in their area .
It is on the verge of launching similar schemes in neighbouring Leicestershire and one in Wales .
The government has pledged to offer all homes a minimum speed of 2 M bps ( megabits per second ) by 2012 .
But critics say these speeds are far too slow for the ever - increasing demands of web users .
There are concerns that up to one third of the country will not be served by next - generation broadband - offering speeds of over 25 Mbps .
For commercial firms such as BT and Virgin Media fibre rollouts in rural areas are not cost - effective .
In their place community solutions are springing up and it is estimated that there are 40 such schemes currently laying fibre or planning to do so .
Daniel Heery is involved in laying fibre to 1,000 homes in Alston village in Cumbria .
The network will offer speeds of up to 100 M bps when it is completed later this year .
He welcomed the privately - funded Rutland scheme .
" Different approaches will work in different areas and we will have a patchwork quilt of different technologies , " he said .
The endgame for Mr Heery is to offer fibre all the way to homes but he acknowledged that he relied on public funds for this .
In the North Yorkshire village of Newton - on - Rawcliffe , the solution to slow broadband has come via fibre supplied to the local school .
The 140 villagers will benefit from the fibre link via a wireless connection .
The fibre has been supplied by NYnet , one of Europe 's largest public - sector funded broadband infrastructures .
The unassuming street cabinet that has taken over BT 's network Rural divide But public money , often supplied by regional development agencies , is fast drying up , according to Mr Lewis .
The government had proposed to raise £ 170 m a year via a broadband tax , which would have seen all households with a landline phone charged an extra £ 6 a year .
The money would have been used to fund broadband to rural areas but the Tories opposed the tax and it was shelved in last - ditch negotiations to get the Finance Bill through parliament before the general election .
The Country Land and Business Association ( CLA ) has been one of the most vocal critics of the lack of government investment in broadband .
It welcomed the Rutland Telecom launch but called for the next government to reassess the need for publicly - funded broadband rollouts .
" Without that money the rural / urban digital divide will extend and that will have a significantly adverse impact on the economy , " said CLA 's Dr Charles Trotman .
Comedian and technology enthusiast Stephen Fry went to school in the neighbouring town of Uppingham and welcomed the Rutland Telecom launch .
" It has always been a frustration that fast , reliable broadband service has always been hardest for those who most benefit - those in the countryside , " he said .

Dearly loved friends and relations , I have the honor of welcoming you all to this ceremony , in which we will wed Matt and Michelle to each other .
They asked me to say a few words to set the proper mood and tone for their wedding .
I thought for quite some time about what I would say , discarding metaphors and quotes of love , before finally settling on a topic near to their hearts – Today I 'm going to say a few words about zombies .
Zombies .
The shambling ghouls of black and white Saturday matinees and the quick , ravenous monsters of modern horror are all suffering from the same disease – disconnection – from the world around them and from each other .
And are n't we all there sometimes ?
Do n't we shuffle to work , monosyllabic , until we get our caffeine , and then go through the motions of work and house as if completely unaware of other people ?
Do n't we set our sights on one desire after another , rushing from experience to experience without actually stopping to enjoy any of it ?
Have n't you found yourself staring into space , wishing for just a little more brains ?
Matt and Michelle were there too and they 've decided to take the only vaccine that works – they 've decided to get married .
By which I mean they 've decided to get connected — unashamedly , unhesitatingly connected — to each other .
In this they refuse to become numb themselves , they promise to give each other attention , consideration , and kindness – emotions zombies most certainly do not share .
They refuse to feed on the heart and mind of the other , agreeing instead to grow those things together and share them equally .
And they vow not to allow the other to become a zombie when they are n't looking – slipping into apathy , numbness , and a maddening hunger .
They do these things with the shotguns of their love strapped strongly to their backs and the truncheons of their humor held firmly in their hands .
Together , they will defend their humanity and their home with all the wit , grace , and power of any spunky heroine or over - sized hero .
Together they are an example of what is possible when two people set their sights on the same star .
They cut through our 21st century cynicism and prove that , in fact , zombification is not inevitable — that friendship , love , and desire , when held with both hands , are the only weapons any of us need to stay human .
With the zombies held at bay by their mutual promises , Michelle and Matt are ready to face the other monsters of life – defending against the Frankenstein coworkers , the Soul Vampires of false friends , and the Mummy of age itself .
The adventure they are about to embark on has all the magic of any Hollywood movie and all the terror of true Lovecraftian horror – dread Cthulhu has nothing on balancing family Christmases .
But the truest fact is that as long as they stick together , connected to each other , the zombies of life , real and imagined , apathetic and disastrous , cannot harm them .
That said , let 's get married , shall we ?

“ Everything I know about marriage I learned in my cancer clinic . ”
I ’ve been known to say this to my friends , maybe more than once , maybe even causing some of them to grind their teeth and grumble about Robin and Her Infernal Life Lessons .
I can’t help myself .
I ’ve worked as a breast cancer doctor for 20 years , I ’ve watched thousands of couples cope with every conceivable ( and sometimes unimaginable ) kind of crisis , and I ’ve seen all kinds of marriages , including those that rise like a beacon out of the scorched - earth terror that is a cancer clinic .
It ’s a privilege to witness these couples , but the downside is I find myself muttering under my breath when my single female friends show me their ads for online dating .
“ Must like long walks on beach at sunset , cats , ” they write , or “ French food , kayaking , travel . ”
Or a perennial favorite : “ Looking for fishing buddy ; must be good with bait . ”
These ads make me want to climb onto my cancer doctor soapbox and proclaim , “ Finding friends with fine fishing poles may be great in the short term .
But what you really want to look for is somebody who will hold your purse in the cancer clinic . ”
It ’s one of the biggest take - home lessons from my years as an oncologist :
When you ’re a single woman picturing the guy of your dreams , what matters a heck of lot more than how he handles a kayak is how he handles things when you ’re sick .
And one shining example of this is how a guy deals with your purse .
I became acquainted with what I ’ve come to call great “ purse partners ” at a cancer clinic in Waltham .
Every day these husbands drove their wives in for their radiation treatments , and every day these couples sat side by side in the waiting room , without much fuss and without much chitchat .
Each wife , when her name was called , would stand , take a breath , and hand her purse over to her husband .
Then she ’d disappear into the recesses of the radiation room , leaving behind a stony - faced man holding what was typically a white vinyl pocketbook .
On his lap .
The guy -- usually retired from the trades , a grandfather a dozen times over , a Sox fan since date of conception -- sat there silently with that purse .
He did n’t read , he did n’t talk , he just sat there with the knowledge that 20 feet away technologists were preparing to program an unimaginably complicated X - ray machine and aim it at the mother of his kids .
I ’d walk by and catch him staring into space , holding hard onto the pocketbook , his big gnarled knuckles clamped around the clasp , and think , “ What a prince . ”
I ’ve worked at cancer clinics all around Boston since then , and I ’ve seen purse partners from every walk of life , every age and stage .
Of course , not every great guy accompanies his wife to her oncology appointment every day -- some husbands are home holding down the fort , or out earning a paycheck and paying the health insurance premiums -- but I continue to have a soft spot for the pocketbook guy .
Men like him make me want to rewrite dating ads from scratch .
WANTED : A partner for richer or poorer and for better or worse and absolutely , positively in sickness and in health .
A partner for fishing and French food and beach walks and kayak trips , but also for phone calls from physicians with biopsy results .
A guy who knows that while much of marriage is a 50 - 50 give - and - take , sometimes it ’s more like 80 - 20 , and that ’s OK , even when the 80 - 20 phase goes on and on .
A man who truly does n’t care what somebody ’s breast looks like after cancer surgery , or at least will never reveal that he ’s given it a moment ’s thought .
A guy who ’s got some comfort level with secretions and knows the value of a cool , damp washcloth .
A partner who knows to remove the computer mouse from a woman ’s hand when she types phrases like “ breast cancer death sentence ” in a Google search .
And , most of all , a partner who will sit in a cancer clinic waiting room and hold hard onto the purse on his lap .
Robin Schoenthaler is a radiation oncologist at the MGH Department of Radiation Oncology at Emerson Hospital in Concord .

The suicide rate among war veterans is extraordinary , new data reveals .
Thirty try to commit suicide each day , on average , reports the Army Times .
Eighteen succeed , roughly five of whom receive medical care from Veterans Affairs , rated one of the best health programs in the country .
“ Of the more than 30,000 suicides in this country each year , fully 20 percent of them are acts by veterans , ” said VA Secretary Eric Shinseki at a VA - sponsored suicide prevention conference in January , Inter Press Service reported .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Times noted that “ In general , VA officials said , women attempt suicide more often , but men are more likely to succeed in the attempt . ”
The report cites access to health care and age — younger veterans are less likely to try — as two major factors in the suicide rate , and notes that the VA is seeking to strengthen its suicide prevention programs .
According to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans , “ Roughly 56 percent of all homeless veterans are African American or Hispanic , despite only accounting for 12.8 percent and 15.4 percent of the U.S. population respectively . ”
The struggle among veterans to return to everyday life has been documented over the years .
The Associated Press reported in November 2007 that one in four homeless people across the nation is likely to be a veteran , even though veterans constitute a mere 11 percent of overall adults in the United States .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ And homelessness is not just a problem among middle - age and elderly veterans , ” AP added .
“ Younger veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan are trickling into shelters and soup kitchens seeking services , treatment or help with finding a job . ”
Homelessness among women who served in Afghanistan and Iraq is on the rise .
The Boston Globe reported last year that “ number of female service members who have become homeless after leaving the military has jumped dramatically in recent years . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
One in ten homeless veterans under 45 years of age is a woman , statistics showed in July of 2009 .
“ Some of the first homeless vets that walked into our office were single moms , ” Paul Rieckhoff , Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America ’s executive director and founder , told the Globe .

“ When people think of homeless vets , they donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t think of a Hispanic mother and her kids .
The new generation of veterans is made up of far more women .

The Four Fours Problem
Solutions from 0 to 116 , not including 113 which is probably not findable by the rules given .
This puzzle is most commonly formulated as follows :
" Given no more than 4 instances of the digit " 4 " , represent all integers using a finite number of mathematical symbols and operators in common use . "
Notes on the Rules :
You cannot use representations for other numbers , eg : use of π in sin( π / 2 ) = 1
Cannot use ... to represent an infinite number of operations eg : sqrt( sqrt( sqrt ( ... 4 ) ) ) = 1
Obviously negative integers can be represented if a positive number can .
It can be proved that not all integers can be represented .
Subset of acceptable symbols and operators :
+ ,- addition subtraction
* ,/ multiplication , division
sqrt , ^ square root , power
! factorial , eg : n! = n * ( n - 1 ) * ( n - 2 ) * ... * 2 * 1
. decimal point , eg : .4
′ repeating decimal , eg : .4 ′ = .444444444 ...
With other rules , other answers are possible .
Some variations allow you to use any number of 4s up to 4 .
Others allow more obscure mathematical operators ( gamma functions , for example ) .
It can be easily demonstrated that , even by the conservative ruleset that I describe above , some numbers can be generated an infinite number of different ways .
The presence of unary operators means that there are an infinite number of different patterns to search for the answers to these problems , which makes computer solutions an interesting problem , which will never have a perfect solution .
I found the following answers the old - fashioned way , by hand search and logic .
Though some people put a premium on simple formulations , I have in several places listed answers that were for some reason amusing to me , or surprisingly complex .
My answer to 73 is a good example of amusing complexity , as is 27 .
Since all the answers are integers , I started the search by generating a list of integers that could be build with one or two 4s .
These became useful building blocks in finding the larger numbers .
Since it is possible to create an infinite number of integers from even a single four ( for example , 4 ! = 24 . 4 !! = 620448401733239439360000 , and so forth ) .
I listed only the smaller integers in my reference table , knowing that these were most likely to be useful .
For your convenience , I present a table of useful 1 - and 2 - 4 combinations .
0 59 1 60 2 61 3 62 4 63 5 64 6 65 7 66 8 67 9 68 10 69 11 70 12 71 13 72 14 73 15 74 16 75 17 76 18 77 19 78 20 79 21 80 22 81 23 82 24 83 25 84 26 85 27 86 28 87 29 88 30 89 31 90 32 91 33 92 34 93 35 94 36 95 37 96 38 97 39 98 40 99 41 100 42 101 43 102 44 103 45 104 46 105 47 106 48 107 49 108 50 109 51 110 52 111 53 112 54 113 55 114 56 115 57 116 58
A note to math teachers : I have gotten abusive e-mails from math teachers who feel that this page is essentially a cheat sheet , giving away the answers to a puzzle they would like to give as homework .
Frankly , this is a widely known puzzle that I first heard in the Reagan administration and it was n't new then .
Not only are solutions widely known , but software that allows the automated generation of solutions has also been released into the public domain ( not that I have used any such software above ) .
What I 'm trying to say is it ’s time to find new assignments .
Assigning the four fours problem in a math class is at this point like asking student to predict the end of the vietnam war in current events class — it might have been a great question in 1970 but it does n’t test what you want it to anymore .

In 1967 , just a few months after Star Trek debuted on television , the show ’s creator - Gene Roddenberry - used this very letterhead for all business correspondence .
Gene Roddenberry , 1967 | Submitted by Dale Macy
It is often assumed that the science - based worldview implies that life on this planet is a meaningless accident in a universe that is indifferent to our existence .
Humans struggle to find purpose within this purely naturalistic understanding of reality , and so they supplement it with beliefs in supernatural processes and entities .
However , recent advances in our understanding of evolution are revealing a bigger picture that can , by itself , give meaning to life .
This new worldview locates humanity within a much larger evolutionary process that appears to offer us a meaningful role to play .
This new understanding of evolution is founded on the recognition that evolution is headed somewhere – it has a trajectory .
In particular , evolution on Earth has repeatedly gathered small - scale entities into cooperative organisations on a progressively larger and larger scale .
Self - replicating molecular processes were organised into the first simple cells .
Communities of these simple , prokaryotic cells formed the more complex eukaryotic cell .
Collections of these formed multicellular organisms , and organisms were organised into cooperative societies .
A similar sequence appears to have unfolded in human evolution : from family groups , to bands , to tribes , to agricultural communities and city states , to nations , and so on .
This trajectory has applied regardless of whether evolution proceeds by gene - based natural selection or cultural processes .
It is driven by the potential at all levels of organisation for cooperative teams united by common goals to be more successful than isolated individuals .
Cooperation trumps selfishness
Mainstream biology has been slow to accept that evolution moves towards increasing cooperation .
The view has been that selfishness , rather than cooperation , is favoured by evolution .
But this objection has been overcome in the past two decades by a large body of research on the evolution of cooperation .
In short , this research shows that complex cooperation will emerge among self - interested individuals if they are organised so that they benefit from their cooperative acts – and if free riders and other non-cooperators are restrained or punished .
Crucially , this removes any conflict between self - interest and cooperation .
( Readers interested in a more detailed discussion of why biologists have been so slow to accept that there is a direction to evolution should read my pre-press article for the journal Foundations of Science . )
Where will evolution go from here ?
Extrapolating the trajectory into the future is reasonably straightforward , at least initially .
The next major transition on Earth would be the emergence of a sustainable and cooperative global society .
As with cooperatives at all other levels , the global society would curb internal conflict and destructive competition , including war and pollution .
Past transitions demonstrate how this might be organised .
Universal trajectory
Extrapolating the trajectory further would see the continued expansion of the scale of cooperative organisation out into the solar system and beyond .
Wherever possible , this expansion would be likely to occur through cooperative linkage with other living processes , rather than by " empire building " .
The possibility of life arising elsewhere seems high , and while the details of evolution on other planets are likely to differ , the general form of the evolutionary trajectory would be universal .
If the trajectory continued in this way , the scale of cooperative organisation would expand throughout the universe , comprised of living processes and intelligence from multiple origins .
As it increased in intelligence and scale , its command over matter , energy and other resources would also expand , as would its power to achieve whatever objectives it chose .
What might organised life and intelligence do with this increasing power ?
One possible answer was developed as an attempt to solve the " fine - tuning problem " – the enigma of why the fundamental laws and parameters of the universe seem to be fine - tuned to support the emergence of life , with even slight changes leading to a universe in which life is unlikely to emerge .
Supposing the trajectory of evolution eventually produces life and intelligence with sufficient power and knowledge to reproduce the universe itself ?
This intelligent universe would fine - tune " offspring " universes so that they are even more conducive to the emergence and development of life and intelligence .
And so on .
According to this scenario , our universe itself is embedded in larger evolutionary processes that shape universes .
And life ( including humanity ) has a function and purpose within these larger processes in the same sense that our eyes have a purpose within the evolutionary processes that have shaped humanity .
Intentional evolution
Not all organisms that evolve to humanity 's current stage will go on to participate in these large - scale evolutionary processes .
Up to our stage , evolution has been driven along its trajectory by competition and selection .
But these pressures weaken as a global society begins to emerge , because this society will not be in direct competition with other global societies .
From this point on , evolution will continue to advance only if the emerging global society decides to advance the evolutionary process intentionally .
The society must awaken to the possibility that it is living in the midst of a directional evolutionary process , realise that the continued success of the process depends on its intentional actions , and then commit to actively move the process forward .
Organisms that complete this transition to intentional evolution will drive the further development of life and intelligence in the universe .
Those that do not will be failed evolutionary experiments .
They will be eggs that never hatched .
Humanity is fast approaching the threshold of this critical evolutionary transition .
John Stewart is a core member of the Evolution , Complexity and Cognition Research Group of the Free University of Brussels , and the author of Evolution 's Arrow and The Evolutionary Manifesto .
This is a condensed version of his paper " The meaning of life in a developing universe " which is in press for a special issue of the journal Foundations of Science

Cosmopolitan Magazine has been around since 1886 so it has seen quite a great deal of change over that time .
The evolution of The Cosmopolitan Magazine into what is known today as Cosmo shows just how dramatic that change has been .
In its early days , The Cosmopolitan was billed as a woman ’s fashion magazine that included articles on the home , family , and cooking , but also included articles like “ Some Examples of Recent Art ” and “ The Progress of Science . ”
Later it became more focused as a showcase for new fiction and published works by authors like Upton Sinclair , Sinclair Lewis , Kurt Vonnegut , Willa Cather , and H. G. Wells .
Typically , each issue would have five to eight short - stories , a full novelette , a full short novel , and some article on fashion and health .
During this time , the cover art was almost exclusively illustrated — even when the covers featured celebrities .
With the introduction of television , there was a drastic decline in the demand for fiction - based magazines .
In response to the waning sales there was a radical shift in the direction of Cosmopolitan .
In the mid sixties , Helen Gurley Brown stepped in as editor in chief .
She brought with her the message of sexual freedom for single women , and started replacing the cover illustrations with photos of young models in minimal clothing .
Sales increased as a result .
Since then the magazine has become more sexually centered .
It still features many articles on having pleasurable sex and maintain fulfilling relationships .
There is a much greater emphasis on how women can make themselves more desirable to men .
One look at the website reveals the tone of the magazine .
These are the first three articles listed :
“ 4 Traits Men Find Irresistible ”
“ What Men Secretly Think of your Hair and Makeup ”
“ What You Should Do if He Cheats ”
The late Kurt Vonnegut ( who had multiple short stories featured in Cosmopolitan in the fifties ) had this to say about the magazine : “ One monthly that bought several of my stories , Cosmopolitan , now survives as a harrowingly explicit sex manual . ”
Indeed , browsing through the cover art of the past few years gives one the impression that there are an infinite number of sex positions .
It is hard to feel sexually liberated while reading a magazine that talks about the vagina ( or Hoo - Ha ) like it ’s something you can buy at a pet store .
They have also been criticized for perpetuating a nearly impossible standard of beauty and for retouching models to make them appear thinner .
Today Cosmopolitan retains almost no reminants of its origins .
It is fascinating to see how it has shifted with the culture and how our culture has changed because of it .

A British scientific expedition has discovered the world 's deepest undersea volcanic vents , known as ' black smokers ' , 3.1 miles ( 5000 metres ) deep in the Cayman Trough in the Caribbean .
Using a deep - diving vehicle remotely controlled from the Royal Research Ship James Cook , the scientists found slender spires made of copper and iron ores on the seafloor , erupting water hot enough to melt lead , nearly half a mile deeper than anyone has seen before .
Deep - sea vents are undersea springs where superheated water erupts from the ocean floor .
They were first seen in the Pacific three decades ago , but most are found between one and two miles deep .
Scientists are fascinated by deep - sea vents because the scalding water that gushes from them nourishes lush colonies of deep - sea creatures , which has forced scientists to rewrite the rules of biology .
Studying the life - forms that thrive in such unlikely havens is providing insights into patterns of marine life around the world , the possibility of life on other planets , and even how life on Earth began .
The expedition to the Cayman Trough is being run by Drs Doug Connelly , Jon Copley , Bramley Murton , Kate Stansfield and Professor Paul Tyler , all from Southampton , UK .
They used a robot submarine called Autosub6000 , developed by engineers at the National Oceanography Centre ( NOC ) in Southampton , to survey the seafloor of the Cayman Trough in unprecedented detail .
The team then launched another deep - sea vehicle called HyBIS , developed by team member Murton and Berkshire - based engineering company Hydro - Lek Ltd , to film the world 's deepest vents for the first time .
" Seeing the world 's deepest black - smoker vents looming out of the darkness was awe - inspiring , " says Copley , a marine biologist at the University of Southampton 's School of Ocean and Earth Science ( SOES ) based at the NOC and leader of the overall research programme .
" Superheated water was gushing out of their two - storey high mineral spires , more than three miles deep beneath the waves . "
He added : " We are proud to show what British underwater technology can achieve in exploring this frontier -- the UK subsea technology sector is worth £ 4 billion per year and employs 40 000 people , which puts it on a par with our space industry . "
The Cayman Trough is the world 's deepest undersea volcanic rift , running across the seafloor of the Caribbean .
The pressure three miles deep at the bottom of the Trough -- 500 times normal atmospheric pressure -- is equivalent to the weight of a large family car pushing down on every square inch of the creatures that live there , and on the undersea vehicles that the scientists used to reveal this extreme environment .
The researchers will now compare the marine life in the abyss of the Cayman Trough with that known from other deep - sea vents , to understand the web of life throughout the deep ocean .
The team will also study the chemistry of the hot water gushing from the vents , and the geology of the undersea volcanoes where these vents are found , to understand the fundamental geological and geochemical processes that shape our world .
" We hope our discovery will yield new insights into biogeochemically important elements in one of the most extreme naturally occurring environments on our planet , " says geochemist Doug Connelly of the NOC , who is the Principal Scientist of the expedition .

" It was like wandering across the surface of another world , " says geologist Bramley Murton of the NOC , who piloted the HyBIS underwater vehicle around the world 's deepest volcanic vents for the first time .
" The rainbow hues of the mineral spires and the fluorescent blues of the microbial mats covering them were like nothing I had ever seen before . "
The expedition will continue to explore the depths of the Cayman Trough until 20th April .
In addition to the scientists from Southampton , the team aboard the ship includes researchers from the University of Durham in the UK , the University of North Carolina Wilmington and the University of Texas in the US , and the University of Bergen in Norway .
The expedition members are also working with colleagues ashore at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Duke University in the US to analyse the deep - sea vents .
The expedition is part of a research project funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council to study the world 's deepest undersea volcanoes .
The research team will return to the Cayman Trough for a second expedition using the UK 's deep - diving remotely - operated vehicle Isis , once a research ship is scheduled for the next phase of their project .

Sanchez runs a Blogger Academy out of her living room .
( Claudia Daut / Reuters )
HAVANA , Cuba —
As an educational institution , Cuba ’s Blogger Academy suffers from a few notable deficiencies .
Its six - month course does n’t grant an accredited degree , and its single , cramped classroom — the living room of founder Yoani Sanchez — is n’t even hooked up to the internet .
Then there ’s the possibility that the next knock on the door might be the police .
They have n’t shut down the Blogger Academy yet , but on this web - starved island — the least - connected country in the hemisphere — this classroom is a place where the digital revolution really feels like one .
At least the 30 - odd students squeezed onto benches and chairs in Sanchez ’s 14th - floor Havana apartment see it that way .
They ’re taking a risk to come here twice a week to learn how to use Twitter , or write code in Wordpress for their own blogs .
That ’s not because those software programs are illegal in Cuba , but because Sanchez , 34 , is considered dangerous company .
Sanchez remains largely unknown on the island , where her award - winning blog , Generation Y , is blocked .
But she has a huge following among Cubans living abroad , and she has used her literary talents and the power of the internet to become a potent symbol of opposition to a one - party socialist system run by men in their 70s and 80s .
With the Blogger Academy , where the instructors are volunteers and tuition is free , Sanchez is drafting others to the digital cause .
“ Today we 're going to talk about Twitter , ” Sanchez began on a recent afternoon , quieting the room .
The students ranged in age from early 20s to mid-50s .
One ’s man late father had been a leader of the Cuban Revolution .
Given the Castro government ’s record of infiltrating opposition groups , it was also likely a few of the students were there to take notes on their classmates , not their coursework .
No one seemed too worried about that , though , and the atmosphere was friendly , almost festive .
Sanchez used a projector to cast an image of her laptop screen onto the wall , displaying web pages she ’d saved from the last time she was able to use the internet .
Like most Cubans , she is n’t allowed to have an internet connection at home but can pay to go online at hotels and cyber cafes .
“ Who can tell me the difference between tags and categories ? ” she asked the class .
There were other classes that day on journalism ethics , photography , and Wikipedia .
A nearby table was stacked with photocopied handouts of articles with titles like “ Can Journalism be Participatory ? ” and a Twitter manifesto called “ The revolution in 140 characters . ”
Students huddled to share the room ’s few laptop computers .
At most journalism schools , it would be ordinary subject matter .
But on an island where the media is almost entirely state - controlled and less than 1 percent of the population has an internet connection , it seemed like the first tremors of a paradigm shift .
Cuban authorities , meanwhile , see it as little more than a new phase of an old fight .
They view Sanchez ’s rapid rise to international fame as part of the broader U.S. - funded campaign to foment anti-Castro activity on the island .
Sanchez insists she funds the academy and supports other bloggers with the money she ’s earned by publishing articles and a book abroad .
“ We ’re not trying to challenge or subvert the government , ” Sanchez said in an interview .
“ This is n’t a political party .
There ’s no boss here , and no director .
No one is telling us what to write , or what type of criticisms we can make .
We ’re just trying to create a virtual world that reflects the variety of views that Cubans really have — but are now suffocated and hidden by government controls . ”
Rosa Miriam Elizalde , the editor of the pro-government website Cubadebate , said she views Sanchez as a figure who has been hyped up for a specific political purpose — to attack Cuba .
Elizalde said there was nothing wrong with the material taught at the Blogger Academy , but she said Sanchez ’s goals were hardly apolitical .
“ You ca n’t criticize learning , ” Elizalde said .
“ But you can criticize the intention behind her efforts , which are taking place in a framework of a U.S. policy of subversion and aggression . ”
Elizalde also questions the international support Sanchez receives to run her blog , which is translated into 18 languages .
“ We ’re not talking about some blogger in Sweden , ” Elizalde said .
“ We ’re talking about a blogger in Cuba , which the United States has been waging economic and political warfare against for the past 50 years .
And this is just the latest form of that warfare . ”
Several of the academy ’s students say they ’ve faced more than criticism in recent months , receiving threats and other forms of harassment from the government .
A few said their computers and cell phones had been confiscated by state police .
“ There are people who think I ’m doing something wrong by coming here , but I do n’t think so , ” said Regina Coyula , 53 , a housewife and former Cuban state security agent who now writes a blog , Mala Letra ( Bad Handwriting ) , launched with Sanchez ’s help .
“ I think I ’m giving a voice to a lot of people who think like I do , whose views are n’t reflected in the official media , ” said Coyula .
“ We ’re people who want change , and we want the current government to be an instrument of change . ”
Sanchez said the academy 's graduates are developing the skills to shape Cuba ’s future media organizations .
Blogger Orlando Luis Pardo described their one - room school with a quote from famous Cuban novelist Jose Lezama Lima , likening it to “ building a cathedral in the air . ”
“ Somehow this is the image that I have , ” Pardo said .
“ Something very big and very beautiful that we are trying to build , and very fragile also , that could crumble to the ground at any time . ”
“ We hope not , ” he said , “ but it ’s something very fragile . ”
( CNN ) --
The Obama administration will fight to preserve the law establishing an annual National Day of Prayer , the Justice Department confirmed Thursday .
A federal judge declared the law unconstitutional last week .
The Justice Department 's official filing of a " notice to appeal " Thursday came as no surprise , after White House spokesman Matt Lehrich said following the ruling that President Obama intends to recognize this year 's National Day of Prayer , which is May 6 .
U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb in Wisconsin ruled on April 15 that the 1952 law creating the National Day of Prayer violates the ban on government - backed religion .
The ruling produced predictable reactions , with most religious groups sharply criticizing it and groups backing a strict separation of church and state applauding it .
The injunction against the National Day of Prayer would not take effect until the appeals have been exhausted .
The case is Freedom From Religion v. President Barack Obama , White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , and Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle .
The opposition movement claims the Parliament has been dissolved and over 100 are dead at the hands of Kyrgyz police .
The government claims the amount is around 40 .
Reportedly , the main cause for the opposition is the corrupt , dictatorial government ’s high taxation blocking the marketplace and skyrocketing utility bills .
Al Jazeera ’s Robin Forestier - Walker , reporting from Bishkek , said Kyrgyzstan President Kurmanbek Bakiyev , the country ’s president , has now fled the capital and relocated to the country ’s south ( 5:43 ) :
7 Apr 2010 | InfoShop News
Leaders of an opposition movement to the Kyrgyzstan government have “ seized internal security headquarters and a state TV channel after fatal clashes with government forces … saying they now controlled the Central Asian nation that hosts a U.S. base key to the Afghan war , ” Peter Leonard reports at the Associated Press ( A.P. ) .
“ Opposition leaders have called for the closure of the Manas air base , saying it could put their country at risk if the United States goes to war with Iran , ” Mr Leonard reports .
The Obama Administration “ angered the Kyrgyz opposition last summer by courting Mr. Bakiyev in an ultimately successful attempt to reverse his decision to close the base , angering the opposition , ” Clifford Levy reports at The New York Times ( NYT ) .
Though , “ American officials said that as of Wednesday evening the base was functioning normally ” , this revolution “ posed a potential embarrassment ” for the Administration , he adds , as the U.S. embassy in the Kyrgyz capital expressed in a statement it was “ deeply concerned ” .
Columbia Law Professor Scott Horton at Harper ’s writes today : “ The United States has curried favor with powerful political figures intent on rent seeking ….
The U.S. proclivity for “ sweet deals ” with those in power will complicate things in time of transition . ”
Temir Sariyev , an opposition party leader , told the A.P. , “ [ T ] he prime minister has submitted his resignation , and the entire government is also resigning ” .
Mr. Sariyev “ earlier announced a coalition of opposition politicians had agreed on a new prime minister as well as a new interior minister and new security chief ” .
The A.P. could not confirm these claims .
Keneshbek Duishebayev , referred to by the A.P. as an “ opposition leader ” , was seen by a staff reporter sitting in the office of the National Security Agency , reporting , “ [ He ] issued orders on the phone to people Duishebayev said were security agents .
He also gave orders to a uniformed special forces commando . ”
Prof. Scott Horton at Harper ’s adds : “ Kyrgyz felt their concerns about out - of - control corruption by the leadership were validated when Italian criminal - justice authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of a close business associate of President Bakiyev ’s son , Maksim , in connection with a fraud investigation .
Then both the president and the opposition convened a kurultai — invoking the ancient Kyrgyz tradition of spontaneous plebiscite to decide important issues , ” adding later [ emphasis added ] :
The developments in Kyrgyzstan are being followed warily in Washington , Berlin , and London because of the Manas air base developed by the United States and used by the NATO allies .
It forms a key supply terminal in their northern logistical support network , supporting military operations in Afghanistan .
The protesters are focused on the same facts .
By and large , the crowds in Bishkek show no signs of being anti-U.S. or anti-Russian , but they are concerned about the corrupt relationship that has developed between the United States military and their leaders .
Both former president Askar Akayev and the current incumbent Kurmanbek Bakiyev developed “ special relationships ” with the U.S. logistical supply point — as members of their immediate families garnered sweetheart deals from the Pentagon that supported the base operations .
Kyrgyz political figures often sneer at American government officials who preach transparency and anti-corruption tactics and then cut the most obviously corrupt deals in the country .
Prof. Horton was told by Columbia University Professor Alex Cooley , “ who has studied the politics of the Manas air base ” [ emphasis added ] :
The United States has founded its engagement with the Kyrgyz government on providing lucrative contacts –for fuel and other Manas - related services –worth hundreds of millions of dollars to entities controlled by the Bakiyev ruling family .
In the event that the government collapses , its successor will deem these contracts improper and will either terminate or renegotiate them .
In fact , in the aftermath of the Tulip Revolution , then interim president Bakiyev publicly denounced the airbase deals that the United States had cut with the deposed Akayev family and demanded a huge increase in base - related rent .
The larger lesson for the Defense Department should be clear : placating authoritarian regimes with private contracts and pay - offs does not guarantee long - term stability of relations ; in volatile political climates like Kyrgyzstan , it may , in fact , sow the seeds for discontent and political challenges to the regime .
The protests “ appeared to be a revolution ” that “ erupted when thousands of protesters … seized government buildings in Bishkek ” — the Kyrgyz capital — “ and clashed with police , who opened fire , killing dozens and wounding hundreds ” , Mr. Leonard reports , adding [ emphasis added ] :
Since coming to power in 2005 on a wave of street protests known as the Tulip Revolution , Bakiyev had ensured a measure of stability , but many observers say he has done so at the expense of democratic standards while enriching himself and his family .
He faced the same accusations of corruption and cronyism that led to the ouster of his predecessor .
Over the past two years , Kyrgyz authorities have clamped down on free media , and opposition activists say they have routinely been subjected to physical intimidation and targeted by politically motivated criminal investigations … .
The anti-government forces have been in disarray until recently , but widespread anger over a 200 percent hike in electricity and heating gas bills has helped them come together and galvanize support .…
The Independent reports [ emphasis added ] :
Police used tear gas and fired rubber bullets , but were nevertheless overrun by protesters .
In many cases , whole battalions of riot police were forced to flee in terror , as youths wielding stones and weapons gave pursuit .
Some police officers were captured and set upon .
By late afternoon , some of the protesters had managed to seize weaponry and even armoured vehicles from the police , and began attacking government buildings … .
Around 1,000 protesters broke into the prosecutor - general ’s office and burnt it to the ground .
Government soldiers fired automatic weapons into the crowd to push back the masses from the government ’s headquarters , though it was unclear at that point whether Mr Bakiyev was still inside ….
Galina Skripkina , a senior opposition official , said Mr. Bakiyev had flown from the capital to the southern city of Osh .
The government had agreed to resign but a deal had not been signed , Ms. Skripkina told Reuters .
Mr. Bakiyev did not make any public appearances or statements at any point during the day … .
Ten opposition leaders who had been arrested by Kyrgyz security forces earlier in the week were freed yesterday , and declared that they would form a new government .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon called for the protection of “ all human rights ” , including “ free speech and freedom of the media ” , Al Jazeera English reported Saturday , adding [ emphasis added ] :
The Kyrgyz authorities have recently cracked down on independent media , seizing equipment in a raid on a television station , effectively taking it off the air , and closing down an opposition newspaper .
In March , the courts banned two newspapers close to the Kyrgyz opposition and fined them $ 111,000 for having attacked the honour of Kurmanbek Bakiyev , the Kyrgyz president .
Two prominent journalists were killed in the region late last year and several independent media websites and radio stations have not been accessible in Kyrgyzstan since early March … .
Advocacy groups have accused the West of putting oil and security above democracy in its contacts with Central Asia , a region lying on vast energy reserves and serving as a transit route for supplies headed for NATO troops in Afghanistan .
“ We are deeply disturbed by the actions of Kyrgyz authorities to systematically unplug their citizens from independent and opposition news sources , ” the U.S. - based Committee to Protect Journalists , said a statement .
Kyrgyzstan is a former U.S.S.R. territory of nearly 5.5 million people .
It ’s Tulip Revolution is one of many so - called “ color revolution ” movements in the former Soviet republics .
Justin Raimondo , editorial director of Antiwar.com , wrote in 2006 that the “ color revolutions in Ukraine , Kyrgyzstan , Georgia , Belarus , and Lebanon as examples of what [ then - president George W. Bush ] had earlier referred to as a U.S. - led ‘ global democratic revolution ‘ ” [ emphasis added ] :
The “ color revolutions ” are meant to “ extend the reach of American military power , via NATO and more directly ” , according to Mr. Raimondo , in order “ to encircle the Russians and the Chinese , keeping both in check and extending the far frontiers of the rising American empire deep into Central Asia ” .
There are genuine grievances by the Kyrgyz people , but it ’s difficult to assume such revolt can occur in such a vital location in U.S. geopolitics without Washington meddling .
But , let ’s say the U.S. simply removed military backing for the Kyrgyz government for this revolution to be successful .
Beltway technocrats have too much at stake to not have some control over Kyrgyzstan ’s government to tyrannically control the Kyrzyg people who do n’t want to be exploited for the imperialists ’ interests .
The Kyrgyz opposition movement will most likely be made well aware , if they have n’t been alerted already , that the U.S. base in Manas stays , with the immunity to defend the territory by any means necessary , or the president returns with U.S. military backing — and / or the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe , which has participated in fighting off the protesters to this point .
If not the recently deposed president , a new movement will be backed to ‘ win the hearts and minds ’ of the Kyrgyz people to overthrow the opposition for a government the imperial powers can puppeteer .
UPDATE #1 : Deirdre Tynan and Kadyr Toktogulov of The Wall Street Journal write ( via CNN ) : “ The U.S. military base outside the Kyrgyz capital is vital to the expanding American war effort in Afghanistan .
Most of the U.S. troops deploying to Afghanistan first pass through Manas , which also handles the majority of the American fuel , food and ammunition shipments to the war zone .
“ Last month alone , more than 50,000 U.S. and coalition troops passed through Manas en route to Afghanistan , according to military officials at the base .
More than 200,000 troops have deployed to Afghanistan through Manas since last October . ”
Ivan Eland of The Independent Institute discusses the U.S. government ’s pivotal air base and potential Kyrgyz concerns about a U.S. military offensive against Iran with RT ( 4:44 ) :
Reuters has posted a good deal of basic facts on the small impoverished country .
UPDATE # 2 : Owen Matthews at Newsweek makes a great point on collective sentiments of people toward foreign governments [ emphasis added ] :
Bakiyev ’s ouster may make the West think again about its support for corrupt and unpopular regimes in the region .
“ Over the last few years , the West and the E.U. have posited a tradeoff between stability and governance , ” Cooley says .
But Wednesday ’s events in Bishkek show “ that ’s a false trade - off . ”
In other words , repression and corruption weaken , rather than strengthen , regimes — and when they collapse , people remember who supported the hated despot .
By that token , Russia , surprisingly enough , comes off looking better than the U.S. Moscow has been strongly critical of the Bakiyev regime for at least a year , ever since Bakiyev took a $ 300 million tranche of Kremlin aid money that came with the categorical ( if secret ) proviso that the Kyrgyz must kick the U.S. out of the Manas airbase in return .
Instead , Bakiyev took the Russian money , doubled down on the Americans for more rent , and , in the process , made a sworn enemy of Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
But breaks down the U.S. bribes ( err… “ rent ” ) to the Kyrgyz government to show why the new government will most likely latch on to the government that “ people remember … supported the hated despot ” [ emphasis added ] :
But though Russia has been the most prominent international critic of the Bakiyevs , Moscow ’s opportunities for leveraging that into soft and hard power are limited .
U.S. rent on the Manas base , which was hiked last July from $ 17.1 million a year to $ 60 million , plus an additional $ 117 million for economic development , upgrading the airport , and fighting drug trafficking in the country , makes up a significant chunk of the nation ’s income .
And it ’s unlikely that the incoming opposition leaders , who include former foreign minister Roza Otunbayeva and veteran activist Temir Sariyev , will take an anti-U.S. stance .
Indeed the U.S. Embassy criticized the imprisonment of Sariyev and his supporters over the last year , and the U.S. government - funded Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty ’s Kyrgyz service remains the most trusted source of news for most Kyrgyz people , despite repeated government attempts to jam it .
The root causes are , we agree with Mr. Matthews , local .
But U.S. bribery buys the control of those local problems , even if indirectly .
A U.S. - Russia proxy - bidding war is more likely than democratic revolution .

Why You Can't Work at Work [ The Big Think via BoingBoing ]
The Wall Street reform bill may eventually pass in the Senate but not before it faces a filibuster Monday , according to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell .
Fox News ’ Chris Wallace pressed Sen. McConnell ( R - KY ) Sunday on whether he would have the 41 senators needed to filibuster the bill when it comes up for a floor vote Monday .
“ It ’s my expectation we will not go forward with the partisan bill , ” answered McConnell .

“ We do n’t have a bipartisan compromise yet but I think there is a good chance we ’re going to get it .
What I ’d like to see is an opportunity to prevent the Democrats from doing to the financial services industry what they just did to the health care of this country , ” said McConnell .
“ And Ironically , Chris , my view is very similar to that bastion of conservatism and tool of Wall Street , The Washington Post editorial page , which said this morning that this bill needs to be improved . ”
“ The fifty billion dollar bailout fund needs to come out , ” continued McConnell .
“ We need to have a system in there under which the creditors can expect that they ’re going to be treated fairly somewhat similar to the bankruptcy laws and we need to have enhanced capital requirements .
None of that is currently in the bill that the Majority Leader would try to have us take up on Monday , which came out of committee on a strictly party - line vote . ”
To pass the bill as is , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid would need the support of at least one Republican senator .
The Hill reports that eyes are trained on Maine ’s two moderate senators , Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins .
Neither one has so far declared they would support the bill .
Last week , Sen. Reid ( D - NM ) dared Republicans to block financial reform , assuming the American people support Congress taking on Wall Street .

The Washington Post editorial mentioned by McConnell ends with these words :
“ Based on our reading of the bill that emerged from Mr. Dodd ’s committee , a bipartisan compromise on these points is well within reach .
That is , unless Democrats and Republicans are more interested in scoring political points than fashioning policy . ”

Coffee Table Book Helen McCarthy ( foreword by Katsuhiro Otomo Abrams ComicArts ( NA / UK ) Oct. 1 , 2009 ( NA / UK )
The inside cover of The Art of Osamu Tezuka depicts the schematics of famous manga character Astro Boy , with notes pointing out each of the functions of his robotic body .
It is fitting , then , that the following 260 pages of Helen McCarthy 's new coffee table - style book represent a " schematic " of the life of Osamu Tezuka , easily the most influential artist in anime and manga history .
" Osamu Tezuka is not the founder of Japanese animation , " reminds Katsuhiro Otomo ( Akira , Domu ) in the book 's foreword , but he most certainly was the single greatest influence on its evolution .
The manga artist - turned animator created countless unforgettable characters ( including the titular characters of Astro Boy and Black Jack ) and revolutionized the post - war animation industry .
Thus , for fans looking to the past for evidence of where anime evolved from , all roads lead to Tezuka .
The Art of Osamu Tezuka is at once a celebration and an analysis of this star - studded career , debunking myths about the artist 's influence while emphasizing the all - important changes that he did make to Japan 's anime and manga culture .
The first chapter depicts Tezuka 's young life before his debut as a major comic artist , beginning ( delightfully ) with a photograph of the boy at only one year old .
This unique window into Tezuka 's early life shows fascinating insight into later works in his career , though McCarthy 's assumptions regarding childhood influences on his art are certainly debatable .
Most interesting of all , though , are the doodles from Tezuka 's elementary school days , which include some characters ( like Hyōtan - tsugi ) who appear frequently in his adult works .
The stage is set for a battle between the Ontario government and pharmacists over drug reforms introduced Wednesday by Health Minster Deb Matthews .
The government says Ontarians could see their pharmacists fulfill services that doctors and nurses have mostly performed until now .
But pharmacists warn they ca n’t afford to do that and some may have to reduce hours or close , increasing wait times for prescriptions , because looming drug price cuts will cripple their bottom line .
“ Pharmacists will fight hard to stop this cut , on behalf of the thousands of patients we treat every day , ” said Ben Shenouda , a community pharmacist in Brampton and president of the Independent Pharmacists Association of Ontario .
In a luncheon speech to the Canadian Club , Matthews detailed a new vision of health care designed to stretch scarce health care dollars across more patients by forcing down the price of generic drugs .
Matthews noted that Ontario pays 50 times as much as the U.S. Veteran 's Administration for a popular blood pressure medication called amlodipine .
“ That is simply not fair , ” she told a crowd of 500 people at the Royal York .
“ It 's not getting the best value for Ontario 's dollars . ”
While pharmacists would earn less for the medicines they dispense , the government — which spends billions annually on drugs for seniors and welfare recipients — plans to compensate for the lost income by paying druggists a fee for doing more one - on - one work with patients , such as counselling on chronic diseases like diabetes , or giving injections like flu shots , as is done in other jurisdictions .
“ We ’re paying too much for our drugs , ” Premier Dalton McGuinty said Tuesday while touring a family health clinic in Peterborough .
Under the reforms — which have some pharmacists warning they will lose money and perhaps close — the government is looking to eliminate much of the $ 750 million annually in “ professional allowances ” generic drug companies pay pharmacies to secure shelf space for their products , saying those fees make the medicines more expensive than they would otherwise be .
Sources said those allowances will be eliminated for taxpayer - funded prescriptions to social assistance recipients and seniors , while adjustments will be made to the allowances for drugs paid out for prescriptions to private customers or company drug plans .
“ We have an important conversation ongoing with our pharmacies and our pharmacists , ” McGuinty acknowledged .
“ We think our pharmacists can do more for us .
We ’d like to pay them for their professional services in a way they ’ve never been paid in the past .
Some of the savings that we want to generate from paying less for drugs we intend to put into professional duties for pharmacists . ”
But pharmacists maintain losing the “ professional allowances ” will be damaging .
“ The massive funding cuts , estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year , will put community health care services at risk , and directly contradict the government ’s promises to make new health services more convenient and accessible through pharmacies , ” the Community Pharmacy Coalition said in a statement Wednesday .
“ Pharmacists in Ontario fear their ability to be available to their patients will be severely reduced . ”
For months , tense talks have taken place with Ontario ’s pharmacists in an effort to get them to ban the “ professional allowances ” voluntarily .
McGuinty ’s government paved the way for the reforms with December ’s passage of a law enabling pharmacists to widen their scope of practice and also to clear a path for “ remote dispensing ” of prescription medicines through pharmacy technicians or automated machines with video and audio links to accredited pharmacists .
Health care costs must come down because they threaten to dominate the provincial budget , eating up 32 cents of every dollar 20 years ago , 46 cents now and a forecast 70 cents within 12 years , crowding out spending for education and other priorities , McGuinty said .

“ There ’s more demand coming in the system every single day , ” he explained .
“ Baby boomers start to retire next year .
They ’re a huge complement of the population and we ’ve got to be sure we have the capacity to meet their needs . ”
Despite the health care cost crunch , Matthews , who has been critical of hospitals paying their CEOs too much , held a briefing and news conference on the drug reforms at a posh downtown hotel , despite plentiful space and media facilities at Queen ’s Park .
It ’s the second time the McGuinty government has taken aim at generic drug prices .
Several years ago , former health minister George Smitherman shepherded a law that capped the “ professional allowances ” at 20 per cent of the value of generic drugs sold .

Photo : Official Avatar Movie photostream via FlickrHe ’s made the highest grossing film on the planet , but Hollywood mega - director James Cameron is now promoting “ Avatar ” as the most successful environmental film of all time , too .
Really .
“ There is no studio anywhere in the world who would say an environmental message would make $ 3 billion … I ca n’t think of any other really commercially successful ones , can you ? ” he said during an interview at a Santa Monica fundraiser last Monday for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council .
“ ‘ WALL - E ’ , maybe ? ” replied his wife , actress Suzy Amis Cameron .
It was Amis Cameron who asked an astonished , grateful NRDC if they would like her husband to appear at a quickly arranged fundraiser starring Cameron and his sci- fi blockbuster , which features a mother tree deity .
The film is nominated in nine Oscar categories , after all , including best director and best picture .
Hooking up with NRDC was , if you think about , perfectly natural .
Talking to a graduate film student at the event , Cameron warmed to his message that he ’s the greatest enviro director , comparing his work to “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” which he called boring with bar charts .
“ If it was n’t Al Gore , nobody would have listened , ” he said , but then ruefully admitted he made four semi-successful documentaries about the ocean before plunging into “ Avatar . ”
“ I wanted to do a film that had a deeply embedded environmental message … but do it in the form of a science fiction action adventure , ” Cameron told local public radio host Elvis Mitchell .
“ My feeling was if we have to go four light years away to another planet to appreciate what we have here on earth , that ’s okay . ”
He wanted , he said , to pack such an emotional wallop that by the time the film ’s giant , sheltering tree is felled , everyone in the theater would feel moral outrage .
Further , after the triumph of nature ’s creatures over evil military contractors , he wanted the audience to feel hopeful enough to do something .
“ Avatar ” may be the most explicitly environmental film of Cameron ’s oeuvre , but he insists he ’s been making them all his life , from a high school work entitled “ The Extinction Syndrome ” to his obsession with nuclear war fears à la the “ Terminator ” series .
Cameron ’s environmental zeal started early .
Though he spent his childhood in a Canadian farm town , he earned his scuba certification in a landlocked swimming pool .
When he was 17 , his family moved to inland southern California , but he homed in on the beach , surfing off Huntington and Laguna , then switching to scuba diving .
In recent years he has done group submersible dives , exploring and noting the slow degradation of coral reefs .
Oceanic influences infuse “ Avatar ’s ” phosphorescent lighting and dreamlike landscapes .
The giant , whirly creatures that shrivel up when Sully taps them were based on sea worms .
He had a team of the planet ’s best designers , Cameron said , but every time they invented something spectacular , they found Mother Nature had done something better .
Cameron seems pretty well positioned to take on right - wing climate deniers , having made “ The Terminator ” for Fox when Rush Limbaugh was a California cow town radio host .
At the NRDC event , he refused to debate about Fox News commentators , however , noting he works for a different division , though he confirmed studio executives asked him to “ tone down the tree - hugger crap . ”
He refused , but art imitated studio life when Jake Sully , the contract soldier who is the main character , says he hopes “ all the tree - hugger crap ” he ’s being exposed to “ wo n’t be on the final . ”
Tree hugging is not , Cameron acknowledged , in the moviemaking industry ’s genetic makeup , it being a carbon - intensive process .
But , he insists , his family ’s use of hybrid vehicles , fluorescent bulbs , and other sustainable products is his way of making a difference .
Okay sure , that should even things out .
It might have been an NRDC event , but the mobs were vintage Hollywood , even if there were high schoolers and Amazon River activists mixed in with the “ Aliens ” fans and wannabe filmmakers .
One man ’s daughter had attended a birthday party for one of Cameron ’s ’ kids and said he ’d have his child slip a copy of his documentary on soil to Cameron ’s child to pass on to him .
Have your girl call my girl .
We ’ll do lunch .
I joined the mob , testing Cameron ’s green chops :
Wind power ( he ’s a huge fan ) , clean coal ( it does n’t exist ) , the failure of Obama and other world leaders at Copenhagen ( agreed ) , cap - and - trade , he was acquainted with them all , even a bit directa - torial in his opinions .
But he gave as good as he got .
When I noted that acid rain was still spreading despite cap - and - trade , he retorted that it ’s not spreading as fast as it would have .
He asked what a better solution might be .
Tough new regulations ?
Fine , “ I ’m willing to engage or indulge real ideas , ” he said .
“ But if we do n’t do something , we ’re all going to die !
What ’s it going to take , a big fucking disaster with all kinds of people dying ?
We need to change our priorities fast . ”
Cameron said he has been overwhelmed with requests from environmental groups , and will probably do more events , since his wife told him , “ Maybe more than an opportunity , maybe there ’s a duty to try to use this film for whatever good can be brought to bear . ”
He added , “ The environmental message maybe got lost earlier in all the talk about 3 - D … It ’s time to start having that conversation more . ”
The amount of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico from an oil rig disaster is five times as large as had been believed , the Coast Guard said Wednesday night .
Another leak has been found near the site where the British Petroleum rig exploded and sank last week , Coast Guard Petty Officer Erik Swanson said .
The total amount of oil leaking into the gulf is 5,000 barrels a day — not the 1,000 barrels that had been estimated earlier , he said .
“ We discovered it and we are going to attack it as much as possible now that we know that it ’s there , ” he said .
But Doug Suttles , a BP chief operating officer , disputed the larger estimate , the Associated Press reported .
Rear Adm .
Mary Landry told the Associated Press that President Obama has been briefed about the larger estimate and she said that the government has offered to have the Department of Defense help contain the spill from the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig .
Eleven workers are missing and presumed dead in the incident .
Officials predict the oil could reach the Louisiana coast by Friday , somewhere near the Mississippi Delta .
The nonprofit environmental group SkyTruth warned that the growing disaster “ could soon surpass the sorry benchmark 20 years ago set by the 11 million gallon Exxon Valdez spill . ”
Based on an analysis of radar satellite images of the spill , SkyTruth calculated that at least 6 million gallons had already entered the gulf — at a rate of about 20,000 barrels a day .
( An oil barrel is 42 gallons . )
Sky Truth posted its estimates on its website , SkyTruth.org , before the Coast Guard announced its new leak estimates .
Crews continued to fight the spill , which was 600 miles in circumference and about 23 miles offshore .
BP leased the rig and is responsible for the cleanup .
After days of sucking up the oil - water sheen with special ships and barges and spraying chemical dispersants from planes , crews set a controlled burn Wednesday to rid the sea of some of the oil .
Crews set ablaze a modest amount of oil that was ringed by a flame - retardant boom , said Daren Beaudo , a BP spokesman .
If that succeeds , the oil company could set more fires to burn off more oil .
BP ’s Suttles said crews were making every effort to keep the oil offshore .
But anticipating the worst , they had put down more than 100,000 feet of protective boom intermittently along stretches near the shoreline , from the mouth of the Mississippi River east to Mobile Bay , Ala .
“ It ’s premature to say this is catastrophic , ” Landry said earlier in the day .
“ I will say this is very serious . ”
Robot submarines struggled in vain to shut off the wellhead , which is about a mile undersea , while BP engineers worked to construct an experimental collection system for the oil and finalize plans to drill a new well that could stop the leaking .
Those solutions may not be realized for weeks .
And as the days have passed , people along the gulf , from Texas to Florida , have become increasingly concerned about the effect on both the environment and economy .
Exactly where the slick will make landfall depends on how big the leak will grow and on wind and tides .
The worry is most acute in south Louisiana , where the oil is closest .
The seafood harvested in the gulf and in the brackish maze of waterways inland is more than a big industry — it is a defining element of the culture , and a crucial tourist draw .
At stake , local fishermen said , is the fate of Louisiana ’s $ 1.6 - billion seafood industry — and a way of life .
“ I ’ve got no backup , ” shrimper Rob Canty said Wednesday morning as he applied a layer of primer to his dock - bound boat , the Isaac James , in the fishing town of Venice .
“ This is all I ever did — shrimp , crab , oysters .
If shrimping was bad , we ’d go crabbing .
If crabbing was bad , we ’d go oystering .
Now we might not have anything to fall back on . ”
Dave Cvitanovich , who operates a couple of oyster boats out of Empire , La. , was worried about changes in the taste of his catch .
So was his cousin Tommy Cvitanovich , owner of beloved Drago ’s Seafood Restaurant in suburban Metairie .
“ My livelihood is in oysters , ” Tommy Cvitanovich said .
Ralph Portier , a professor at Louisiana State University who teaches aquatic marine toxicology , said earlier Wednesday that much was unknown , but it was unlikely that the slick would destroy the entire seafood industry .
According to BP officials , the oil is light , sweet crude , as opposed to the heavy crude that poured into the waters off Alaska during the Exxon Valdez spill .
That in itself is good news , because light crude is more biodegradable .
But Portier warned that the oil , if it reached the shore , might still have serious consequences , tainting shrimp , oysters , fish and crabs in the short run , and disrupting breeding to create more long - term problems .
“ What if the entire wetlands is compromised over the next five months ? ” he said .
“ It ’s going to shut down lifestyles .
It ’s going to shut down fisheries .
It ’s going to shut down businesses . ”
In Venice , Canty and other fishermen were worried about the fate of the inland shrimping season , which was set to open in about three weeks .
Canty was also worried that government officials might prohibit him from fishing if the oil got too close .
That happened a couple of years ago , he said , after a big oil spill in the Mississippi , depriving him of income for weeks .
When he gets a better idea of where the slick is moving , he said , he and his two - man crew may pick an untainted part of the gulf and move there .
“ Any day now we might have to pull out , ” the 31 - year - old said .
“ I got a boat note ; I got a house note .
My deckhands have families .
I ca n’t just sit around . ”
Also worried are the charter captains who take big spenders out on the open water to fish for tuna , snapper , shark and barracuda .
They already have been hit hard by the recession .
“ If this knocks me out for the summer , I ’m in trouble , ” said Peace Marvel , 43 , owner of Peacekeeper Charters .
Even though the oil industry was to blame for their trouble , it was difficult to find a fisherman resentful of the other big business in this part of Louisiana .
Marvel noted that there was a symbiotic relationship between his business and big oil ; the rigs and platforms create artificial reefs that make for some of the best fishing in the world .
“ I mean , I fished around the Horizon two days before it exploded , ” he said .
“ A lot of good yellowfin around there . ”
Some callers to WWL , New Orleans ’ popular talk radio station , were harsher Wednesday .
One suggested a boycott of BP to spur it to take more action .
Another , echoing post - Hurricane Katrina sentiment , wondered why the state and federal government were n’t doing more .
“ For decades they did n’t give a crap about us , ” host Bob DelGiorno said in agreement .
“ And they still do n’t . ”

One of the quickest ways to stretch your retirement budget is to shrink your housing costs .
Moving into a smaller house , condo , or apartment can also reduce your taxes , utility bills , and home maintenance costs .
Here are other reasons to consider downsizing in retirement :
Boost your nest egg .
Cutting your housing costs is a quick way to increase your retirement savings .
" Having less money locked up in your housing frees up more money to invest or just for your lifestyle , " says Kathy Hankard , a certified financial planner for Fiscal Fitness in Verona , Wisc .
" If you 're deciding just by the numbers , it 's pretty much a no - brainer to downsize . "
For example , if you moved from a $ 300,000 home with a paid - off mortgage into a $ 150,000 condo , you could add $ 100,000 or more to your nest egg , after transaction costs .
Lower your cost of living .
For retirees who still have a mortgage or pay rent , moving into more compact quarters in your current town or relocating to a low - cost locale can lower one of your biggest monthly expenses .
Ideally the smaller space would also cost less to heat , furnish , and maintain .
Slimming housing costs will produce far greater results than skipping coffee and clipping coupons .
Aim for a town that balances a low cost of living with amenities such as high - quality health care and plenty of fun , affordable activities .
Reduce taxes .
Inexpensive housing has the added bonus of smaller property tax bills .
" I have clients who have saved a couple of thousand dollars per year because they have moved from an urban area with a high property tax to an area with a lower property tax and that does n't assess seniors for school taxes , " says Micah Porter , a certified financial planner and president of Minerva Planning Group in Atlanta , Ga .
Taxes can vary considerably by location .
Alaska , Florida , Nevada , South Dakota , Texas , Washington , and Wyoming have no state income tax .
New Hampshire and Tennessee tax dividend and interest income only .
" If you anticipate earning income in retirement , being able to forgo that state income tax could save you thousands of dollars as well , " says Porter .
Five states levy no sales tax : Alaska , Delaware , Montana , New Hampshire , and Oregon .
Also look for state and local tax breaks specifically for seniors who reach certain ages .
Less upkeep .
Ron and Jean Mirabile , both 67 , traded in a three - story townhouse with a basement in Cromwell , Conn. , for a three - bedroom apartment with a lake view in Port Charlotte , Fla .
The couple was looking for a change of scenery and housing that required less upkeep when they retired in 2008 .
" If something breaks , I call the office and the maintenance man comes and fixes it , " says Jean , a former proofreader .
Ron , a retired dentist who makes wooden fishing lures as a hobby , no longer needs to travel to fish .
" I can take one pole and lure and go out in the backyard and fish for bass , " he says .
" The best things in Florida are free :
The weather , the beach , and the scenery . "
Slash utility bills .
Cozier quarters may also result in lower heating and cooling expenses and a smaller homeowner 's insurance bill .
" A smaller space should save you money on utilities , " says Porter .
Ask for copies of the previous owner or tenant 's utility bills to determine approximate monthly expenses .
Increase flexibility .
Some retirees go back to renting in retirement .
" Renting makes a lot of sense because there is more flexibility , " says Hankard .
" Most people would rather do other things with their time and money , unless they are really in love with their home . "
Renters can try out a few retirement locations .
Sometimes priorities also shift throughout retirement .
For example , immediately upon retirement , you might want to move to the Sunbelt or travel .
But after a few years , you might want to move closer to your children and grandchildren .
More amenities .
First - time home buyers are often concerned about space for children and living in a good school district .
But retirees need to think about whether their home will continue to be convenient as they age .
" As you get older those stairs are not going to be your friend , " cautions Julie Schatz , a certified financial planner for Investor 's Capital Management in Menlo Park , Calif .
Seniors may want to consider a single - level home and proximity to family and friends who can help with household tasks .
If you have any type of health problem , it is essential to live near a medical facility .
Critics of Israeli policy and sympathizers with Palestinians have been subjected to intimidation at Columbia University .
( Angela Radulescu )
What Said , one of the 20th century ’s most important literary theorists , considered a trivial gesture of jubilation following the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon was , for pro-Israeli groups like the Anti-Defamation League ( ADL ) , an act of violence and evidence of political extremism .
In February 2001 Said was disinvited from a conference on Freud he was to have spoken at in Vienna .
The stone - throwing fracas created by the ADL and other groups was the first salvo in a series of Mideast - related convulsions at American universities , and particularly at Columbia , where Said had attainted the vaunted rank of University Professor .
The latest iteration of this saga concerns one of Said ’s students , Professor Joseph Massad , who is labeled “ controversial , ” perhaps as frequently as any contemporary American scholar .
Specifically , a student group at Columbia called Campus Media Watch ( CMW ) , backed by the pro-Israeli media monitor the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ( CAMERA ) , recently violated university regulations while urging students to “ report ” on allegedly biased utterances by Massad and other professors , according to faculty members and students .
According to documents , news reports and interviews with students and professors familiar with the incidents , documents and news reports , Columbia senior Daniel Hertz falsely claimed this semester to be a registered student in the class “ Palestinian and Israeli politics and societies . ”
Hertz criticized the content of the class on CMW ’s website , and urged other students to report on any perceived bias in Massad ’s teaching .
Hertz ’ father , Eli E. Hertz , is a prominent pro-Israeli businessman and activist , who among other roles , serves as the chairman of CAMERA ’s board and sits on the Executive Council of the powerful Washington - based pro-Israel lobby group the America - Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
If the university administration does not take a firm stand in the case , professors and students argue , the incident could hamper freedom of expression in the classroom .
The apparent attempt to eavesdrop on Massad ’s classroom also coincides with a resolution denouncing the professor introduced in the New York City Council ( Res 0050 - 2010 , 3 March 2010 ) .
For Columbia faculty members , the case also raises the specter of a six - year - old dispute concerning Massad , who was granted tenure last year after top Columbia officials rejected claims that he intimidated students in lectures .
Massad was branded as an extremist in a film , Columbia Unbecoming , which was produced by another pro-Israeli pressure group , The David Project .
“ Extremely upbeat and congenial ”
The incident began in January when Hertz began attending Massad ’s class without registering , and wrote an anonymous blog post on CMW ’s website , under a section titled “ class watch ” ( “ CMW Class Watch : Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies , ” 21 January 2010 ) .
Hertz founded CMW in the fall of 2009 after completing a summer internship with CAMERA .
Hertz also identifies himself as a CAMERA campus fellow .
“ Professor Massad initially caught me off guard , ” Hertz wrote in his report on the class .
“ Extremely upbeat and congenial , it did not seem as though he could be someone guilty of delegitimizing the State of Israel , which is a common claim against Professor Massad ’s work . ”
He goes on to note that the syllabus for the class includes not only the works of Edward Said ( The Question of Palestine ) , Columbia professor Rashid Khalidi ( Palestinian identity ) and Massad ’s own book The Persistence of the Palestinian Question , but also the writings of the founder of modern Zionism , Theodor Herzl , and those of Israeli Jewish critic Shlomo Sand ( The Invention of the Jewish People ) .
“ A majority of the listed authors are among Israel ’s greatest detractors , ” Hertz wrote .
“ And while many are in fact Israeli , some of them , especially Shlomo Sand , have written pieces that many have considered virulently anti-Semitic . ”
Hertz ’ article ends by urging other students to report on this and other classes : “ If you are taking this class or any other Middle Eastern related classes and would like to tell us about your experiences , please let us know by emailing us . ”
Massad told The Electronic Intifada that he noticed the blog post , and immediately notified Sudipta Kaviraj , the chair of his department ( Middle East and Asian Languages and Cultures — MEALAC ) .
“ We wanted to be a lot more alert this time , given what had happened , ” Massad said , referring to the 2003 - 2004 dispute that followed the publication of the film .
Kaviraj forwarded this initial complaint to Columbia ’s Vice President Nicholas Dirks and Provost Claude Steele , Massad said .
“ In the meantime people are asking me — people who had seen the blog — ‘ do you know who it is in your class ? ’ and I said , ‘ no and I do n’t want to know , ’ because I do n’t want to be unconsciously biased against this student if he ’s a registered student in my class , ” Massad said .
Although he was blogging anonymously , Hertz then gave an interview to the Columbia Spectator , the daily student newspaper , in which he claimed he was taking Massad ’s class .
The Spectator revealed that “ Hertz blogs about what he says are inaccuracies in [ Massad ’s ] lectures ” ( “ Media Watch to promote dialogue , members say , ” 10 February 2010 ) .
After reading this in the Specator , Massad said , “ I look up on the roster , and I see he ’s not registered in my class . ”
Massad said he checked with his two teaching assistants , who confirmed that Hertz was not registered for the class , and was not attending a discussion section .
It was then that he decided to check university regulations to make sure he was within faculty rights to ask Hertz to leave the class , he said .
At the same time , the professor said , “ my former chair and current chair contacted several student deans and the provost ’s office , informing them of these developments and that professor Massad is planning to ask an unregistered student to leave the class , and they said he would be fully in his right , in fact this man has no right to be in this class . ”
Massad also said Hertz repeatedly disobeyed instructions for all students to register for the course .
“ From the start of the semester , for the first four or five classes , I asked , is anyone still unregistered ?
He never raised his hand , ” Massad said .
“ We also had to coordinate registering students for two discussion sections .
I asked , is anyone still not registered for the discussion sections ; no one raised his or her hand .
I announced that I did not allow auditors in the class , either registered or unregistered auditors .
I said this several times but to no avail . ”
The day after the Spectator article appeared , Massad pointed to Hertz at the beginning of his lecture and asked what his name was and whether he was registered for the class .
According to Massad , his teaching assistant , and students in the class , it was 11 February , well after the 29 January deadline to register for classes .
Massad recalled Hertz sitting in the front of the classroom with his laptop open and his iPhone on , “ possibly recording my voice , ” and once the students had “ settled down , ” asking him if he had registered for the class .
When Hertz then said that he only wanted to audit the class , Massad recalled answering , “ Even if you wanted to audit the class you would have had to get my permission , and nonetheless you would have had to register as an auditor , and I would not have allowed that . ”
He then said he informed Hertz that he was in violation of university regulations , at which point Hertz , recalled Massad , asked “ Do you want me to leave ? ” Massad answered , “ Yes , please . ”
Massad said he again informed the department ’s chair “ for procedural purposes ” and also wrote to Columbia ’s provost , Claude Steele , and other officials , and opened an official grievance procedure with the university .
Kaviraj and former MEALAC chairman Sheldon Pollock also met with Steele , supporting Massad ’s claims , he said .
Massad also said he met with Jeri Henry , the senior assistant dean of judicial affairs , as a part of the grievance procedure .
Kaviraj , Henry , Vice President Nicholas Dirks and other Columbia administration officials declined repeated requests for comment on the matter .
“ A spy ”
In April , with the grievance procedure coming to a culmination , Hertz wrote an opinion article in the Spectator in which he again accused Massad of bias and intimidation ( “ Intimidation 101 , ” 18 April 2010 ) .
In the article Hertz repeated his claim that he was still weighing whether or not to take the class when he was asked to leave , even though the registration deadline had passed almost two weeks earlier .
In the article he did admit however that “ Massad had the right to ask me to leave the classroom for not being registered . ”
He also alleged that after he left the class , he was informed , presumably by another student , that Massad denounced him in front of the class as a “ Jewish spy . ”
However , Massad , his two teaching assistants and a student enrolled in the class said that this claim was false .
Based on these interviews , it appears Massad likely called Hertz a spy for an off - campus organization , but made no reference to his ethnic or religious background .
“ He absolutely did n’t use that phrase , ” said Golnar Nikpur , one of the teaching assistants .
“ He used it as a teaching moment , ” she said , saying Massad stressed that students should be free to express their views in class .
“ He did n’t dwell too much on Daniel Hertz in general , ” she added .
Elazar Elhanan , the other teaching assistant ( also a grandson of the Israeli general Matitiyahu Peled , a veteran of the 1967 war who joined the Israeli peace movement in the 1970s ) , said that Massad “ explained to the class that it ’s a violation of the university code . ”
“ I think he used the word ‘ spy , ’ but he did n’t say ‘ Jewish spy , ’ ” Elhanan said of the incident .
“ It was a bit unpleasant but it was n’t what Hertz quoted him as saying . ”
Columbia senior Shaina Low , who is enrolled in the class , also confirmed this account , saying , “ he never used the word ‘ Jewish . ’ ”
She quoted Massad as identifying Hertz as “ a spy in the class [ who ] wants you to spy for him too . ”
Rebutting Hertz ’ claim in his op - ed that Massad also went on a “ paranoid rant ” denouncing him , Low said “ the exchange lasted three minutes . ”
After repeated phone and email inquiries , Daniel Hertz declined to be interviewed for this article .
Even Hertz concedes that Massad ’s classroom manner is usually “ extremely upbeat and congenial , ” and Massad ’s other students and assistants also say that he promotes an open debate in class in which all viewpoints are heard , including those of students who identify as strongly pro-Israel .
Nikpur , the teaching assistant , said given the past reported controversy about Massad ’s teaching , she was “ surprised ” at “ how friendly the class has been . ”
She added : “ Eighty percent of the comments come from the students who identify as Zionists .
They take up a lot more of the class time … I have truly never seen anything that even approximates intimidation . ”
Shaina Low concurred .
“ The Jewish students who disagree [ with Massad ] are the most outspoken , and he never answers in a rude or condescending way . ”
Low added : “ He always allows students to ask questions .
I do n’t think he ’s intimidating at all …
He does n’t present himself as someone who is going to attack people . ”
After his removal from the class , Hertz however continued to pursue Massad .
When the professor gave a public lecture at the Columbia Law School on 24 February , Hertz was there , Massad recalled , typing copious notes on his laptop .
“ A hunting expedition ”
Rosalind Morris , a professor in Columbia ’s anthropology department , said that Massad may not be the only professor targeted for surveillance or “ reportage . ”
“ There are a number of faculty on campus who , although they have n’t undertaken the kind of systematic chasing - down that Joseph has , feel that such students have been present in their classes , ” she said .
“ There have been a couple of cases where I asked people to identify themselves and explain their presence . ”
Elaborating on the presence of such unannounced visitors in her own classes , Morris said : “ When someone shows up in class , does n’t ask permission , one notices .
When that person takes notes relentlessly , one is a little bit suspicious .
There is no proof that this is evidence of spying , but it is unusual [ even ] for students who are enrolled in class to take meticulous notes constantly . ”
Morris also said groups like Campus Media Watch are using monitoring tactics to stifle debate and infringe on the classroom as a safe space for discussion of even the most controversial subjects .
“ The general sense of being surveilled intrudes upon the sense of freedom in the classroom .
In smaller classes it intrudes on the nature of the relations among students who are supposed to be in a free and enabled seminar circumstance where they can speak without fear . ”
Such monitoring , she said , “ really inhibits the kind of discourse that goes on in the classroom .
Topics are taken off the table . ”
Moreover , Morris said MEALAC professors and their associates are systematically targeted by groups like CMW .
“ These faculty members have a priori been determined to be worthy as targets .
This is a kind of hunting expedition . ”
She also argued that CMW and related groups are not interested in fostering engagement and dialogue .
“ Under those circumstances there ’s no authentic listening or engagement with the class , ” she said .
The ostensible aim of this eavesdropping , she said , is to record statements that when removed from context could be construed as inflammatory .
“ What people are looking for is decontextualizable statements that can do a certain work in a kind of spun media shtick about Columbia , ” she said .
Shaina Low , the student in Massad ’s class , said it was “ ironic ” that Hertz accused the professor of intimidation , arguing that the situation is the reverse .
“ I think they ’re trying to intimidate the professors and the groups on campus from saying anything or holding any events that might be critical of Israel , ” she said .
“ It creates a bad atmosphere .
No one wants to attend a class where the professor feels he ’s constantly being watched , ” she added .
Indeed , there is evidence that Hertz ’ presence , once revealed , unsettled some students .
After Hertz ’ removal from the class , Nikpur noted , students voiced concerns in a discussion session about the presence of an unregistered observer affiliated with an outside group .
“ Students were surprised and dismayed , ” she said .
“ They thought it was unfair that this student would take up their class time , or that he did n’t want certain kinds of voices in the classroom . ”
Sarah Alexander , a member of Just Peace , a student group at Columbia Hillel affiliated with the moderate pro-Israeli lobby J Street , said she had had contact with CMW and agreed that the group ’s reportage tactics did not foster dialogue .
“ On one hand people have the right to say whatever they want on the Internet , ” she said .
“ But going to a class just to report back on what they said is counter to the goal of the classroom . ”
Alexander and other student activists also said that CMW members are frequently seen at Middle East - related events on campus , especially those organized by other student groups .
For example , Hertz and another CMW member were seen in mid-April taking notes at a student - sponsored public lecture with Professor Rashid Khalidi concerning Israeli policies in Jerusalem .
Rahim Kurwa , a graduate student active in Columbia ’s Students for Justice in Palestine ( SJP ) , said CMW “ is effective at trying to intimidate people . ”
Their presence at events spurs “ a lot of talk ” inside the pro-Palestinian camp , he said .
Activists debate , “ Should we kick them out ?
Should we tell them off ? ”
Kurwa said SJP has so far resisted the temptation to respond with its own “ James Bond-ish ” espionage missions .
Such methods , he said , threaten to reduce the debate on the issues “ to a juvenile conflict between student groups . ”
Aside from Hertz , two other CMW representatives , Vice President Zahava Mandelbaum and Campus Relations officer Hunter Rees , did not return repeated emails and phone calls seeking comment for this article .
Outside influence
In his complaint to the provost about Daniel Hertz and Campus Media Watch , Massad said he specifically noted Hertz ’ status as a campus fellow of Boston - based CAMERA .
It is unclear what type of support CAMERA provides to CMW .
A CAMERA representative reached by phone refused to answer questions .
Nevertheless , the links between the two groups appear significant .
CAMERA ’s website says the organization “ provides one - on - one assistance to students who encounter Middle East distortions in campus publications , flyers , rallies and classroom teaching . ”
CMW , with its stated goal of combating “ bias ” in the media , appears to be modeled after CAMERA .
Despite its name , however , most activities listed on its website are unrelated to media , and are rather related to all discussion of the Middle East in any setting , including the classroom .
CMW ’s mission statement says it is “ devoted to promoting accurate and balanced coverage of the Middle East on campus ” ( “ About , ” Campus Media Watch ) .
Likewise , CAMERA asserts it is “ devoted to promoting accurate and balanced coverage of Israel and the Middle East ” ( “ About CAMERA ” ) .
CMW ’s website links to major pro-Israel groups with family ties to Hertz .
Hertz ’ father , Eli E. Hertz , is the author of the website Myths and Facts which also sees itself as correcting biased information about the Middle East .
Eli Hertz , according to the bio on his websites , is president and CEO of the Hertz Technology Group , a general computing and network services company ( “ About , ” MythsAndFacts.org ) .
The profile also lists involvement in several major American pro-Israel organizations .
In addition to his high - level involvement in CAMERA and AIPAC , Hertz is also identified as executive vice president of the Israel - America Chamber of Commerce and Industry , and a trustee of the influential Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
His bio also implies that Hertz is , in fact , Israeli : “ Prior to his arrival in the US in 1974 , Hertz served nearly seven years in the Israeli Defense Force as a paratrooper and was honorably discharged at the rank of Captain . ”
Eli Hertz has also authored several publications , often arguing that it is legal for Israel to maintain control of the occupied West Bank .
He also self - published a 253 - page rebuttal to the 2004 ruling of the International Court of Justice in the Hague which pronounced Israel ’s wall in the occupied West Bank illegal .
He also writes opinion columns for the right - wing Israeli settler - run news website Arutz Sheva ( “ Making Jerusalem a Battleground , ” 29 March 2010 ) .
Public records also indicate that the elder Hertz is a frequent donor to political campaigns , mostly for pro-Israel democrats .
Records available on OpenSecrets.org show that in the 2008 cycle , Hertz gave $ 1,000 to Hillary Clinton ’s presidential campaign , but once Barack Obama secured the Democratic nomination , Hertz gave $ 3,000 each to the Republican National Committee and the McCain - Palin campaign .
As a Columbia student , Daniel Hertz appears to have taken after his father , pursuing computer science and adopting the “ media watchdog ” approach to pro-Israel activism .
Hertz also cites his father ’s writing in his own articles on the CMW website .
Eli Hertz was unavailable for comment , and a message left at his residence on Long Island was not immediately returned .
Daniel Hertz designed CMW ’s website , which even the group ’s critics note is professional in appearance , certainly above average for a student group that only came into existence two semesters ago .
Outside of his activism , acquaintances describe Hetrz as a “ nice ” and “ friendly ” college student who usually goes by the name Danny .
In addition to the CMW site , Hertz also maintains a personal website ( dannyhertz.com ) where he posts screwball videos satirizing the behavior of his roommates .
CAMERA however is neither the first nor the only outside group to get involved in Columbia ’s campus politics , nor the first to take aim at Joseph Massad .
Between 2003 and 2005 , Massad was the target of an apparent bid to deny him tenure , backed by groups including The David Project and also a CMW forerunner , Campus Watch , which specialized in blacklisting professors with pro-Palestinian and anti-war views .
It is not clear if any formal ties exist between CMW and Campus Watch .
Campus Watch ’s director , Winfield Myers , did not respond to an email seeking comment .
In 2009 , in accordance with university procedures and without a public announcement , Columbia granted Massad tenure , a fact which , when leaked to the public , seems to have reignited discussion of what is usually referred to as “ the controversy ” concerning Massad and his teaching and scholarship .
The decision provoked a fresh volley of vitriol from the right - wing blogosphere .
That summer , a group of 14 Columbia professors from outside the liberal arts sphere , including faculty in the schools of Medicine , Business , Journalism and Public Health , but not one from the School of Arts and Sciences , which granted Massad tenure , wrote a letter to Provost Steele containing a litany of procedural objections to the decision ( “ Profs Protesting Massad Tenure Case to Meet with Provost , campus - watch.org , 18 September 2009 ) .
None of the 14 responded to emails seeking comment for this article .
On 3 March of this year , a resolution was introduced in the New York City Council “ Denouncing the decision to tenure Joseph Massad at Columbia University . ”
The measure was referred to a committee the same day and no further action was taken .
Given Columbia ’s embattled history , these outside measures and others have made Massad and other MEALAC professors wary of any potential attempts to discredit them , no matter how small .
“ I do n’t think anyone is asking for a strange kind of total immunity to listening or oversight , ” Professor Rosalind Morris argued .
“ But this instrumental , unverifiable [ action by CMW ] , its part [ in ] harassment campaigns , feeds into petitions , in this case as dovetailed with this grotesque and spurious gesture in the New York City Council . ”
She added : “ It ’s created an environment in which faculty are constantly watching their Ps and Qs on issues that people like Campus Media Watch claim should be the subject of balanced coverage , which is a cover - word for an ideologically conservative position . ”
Student of Said
In Massad ’s view , the attacks on him are a continuation of attacks on Columbia ’s preeminent scholar , Edward Said , which intensified in the last years of the late critic ’s life .
“ I am attacked for a variety of reasons , ” Massad said .
“ One , because I am at Columbia .
Two , because I am a student of Edward Said ’s and three that my critique continues in the tradition of Edward ’s critiques . ”
“ The attacks on me are a continuation of the attacks on Edward , ” he said , sitting in his office across the street from New York ’s Riverside Church , the grand gothic building where Martin Luther King Jr. denounced the Vietnam war in April 1967 .
Massad retold the story of the “ controversy ” that erupted over the photo of Said hurling the stone along the Lebanese - Israeli border .
Said was visiting southern Lebanon , where the Israeli military had recently left , ending 18 years of occupation .
After visiting the now - empty al - Khiam prison , where Lebanese and Palestinians were tortured for years by Israel ’s armed forces and their Lebanese proxies , Said visited the village of Kafr Kila , along the border with Israel .
It was there that the infamous photograph was taken of Said tossing a rock into the no-man ’s land , the photo that was denounced by the ADL and the Zionist Organization of America .
“ There were many people [ at the border , ] all of them … elated by the absence of Israeli troops , ” Said wrote at the time .
“ For a moment , I joined in : the spirit of the place infected everyone with the same impulse , to make a symbolic gesture of joy that the occupation had ended . ”
He further wrote , “ one stone tossed into an empty place scarcely warrants a second thought . ”
In 2002 , a year before Said ’s death , in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US , as the second Palestinian intifada raged and the US prepared to go to war on Iraq , Campus Watch was founded .
Said died in 2003 , before the release of Columbia Unbecoming .
“ Within a year of [ Said ’s ] death the attacks quadrupled , ” Massad remembered .
Then as now , Massad says his own critics have overstated their case .
“ They thought when Edward died that they had gotten rid of him .
So they tried to do the impossible to make sure I could not stay here , and they could n’t .
And so their failure was total .
They went berserk . ”
“ It ’s an inability to realize that they ’ve lost the war . ”

There ’s a major shakeup to report at Digg today : Jay Adelson is stepping down as CEO , effective immediately .
Adelson will be replaced by Kevin Rose , who founded the site back in 2004 and has to much extent remained the face of the company through his role as co-host of online video show Diggnation .
In a statement to be released shortly , Adelson says that “ the entrepreneurial calling is strong , and I am ready to incubate some new business ideas over the next twelve months .
As the economy exits a very deep recession , I believe that it is an excellent time for new companies to develop . ”
While we do n’t yet know what those ideas might be , the news comes in the midst of a major overhaul at Digg .
I talked to Adelson in - depth about the new Digg last month , who described his company ’s plans to reinvent itself as an aggregator of what people are sharing around the web .
Since then , the company has moved swiftly into mobile , unveiling both iPhone and Android apps in recent weeks .
Now , execution of the company ’s ambitious game plan falls squarely on Rose , who says of the shakeup that he is “ excited to be taking on the role of Chairman and acting CEO , driving Digg forward on our promise to enable social curation of the world 's content and the conversation around it . ”
Nonetheless , this news comes as a huge surprise given the timing .
We ’re hearing that the company held an all - hands morning moments ago to share the news with employees .
More to come …
Jay Adelson Statement
Got some news .
After five years , forty million users , and an amazing ride , I 've decided to step down as CEO of Digg .
With the new Digg getting ready to launch , Digg Ads doing well , our sales force growing , our hiring ramping , and the company maturing well beyond its startup phase , I feel that now is the right time .
The entrepreneurial calling is strong , and I am ready to incubate some new business ideas over the next twelve months .
As the economy exits a very deep recession , I believe that it is an excellent time for new companies to develop .
Of course , I will continue to serve as an adviser to Digg .
In the interim , Kevin has agreed to step in as Chairman and CEO .
I 'd like to thank Kevin , the Digg staff and the Digg community for their support , insight and , most of all , their loyalty in turning Digg into the force that it is today .
Kevin Rose Statement
I want to be the first to thank Jay for the last five years of amazing work .
You 've been a great friend and mentor , we would n't be where we are today if it was n't for you .
While I 'll miss working w/ Jay day - to - day I am excited to be taking on the role of Chairman and acting CEO , driving Digg forward on our promise to enable social curation of the world 's content and the conversation around it .
We 've been super busy on the product side getting ready for the upcoming Digg redesign and delivering our mobile apps for the iPhone and Android .
Thank you very much for your on - going support of Digg , I 'm truly excited about the next five years , big things coming !
Last year , printer comparison website Printer.com did an experiment to determine if choosing a different default typeface could help cut printing costs .
After testing several common fonts available for Microsoft Office , the site determined that Century Gothic actually saved the most ink or toner , enough to save a significant amount of money even in light use cases .
The savings were enough to convince the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay to switch to Century Gothic for the bulk of its printing needs .
The school 's IT department has asked staff and faculty to use Century Gothic whenever possible for printed documents .
It is also setting up the e-mail system and computer labs to use Century Gothic as the default font .
" The feedback we 've gotten so far has been positive , " Diane Blohowiak , coordinator of information - technology user support , told the Associated Press .
" Century Gothic is very readable . "
( We 'll set aside aesthetic arguments for the sake of this article , but it 's worth noting that Century Gothic 's designer does n't recommend the typeface for general text use . )
The school spends about $ 100,000 in ink every year , and Blohowiak believes that the change can save the university between $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 .
While the monetary savings are significant — ink generally costs more than paper , according to Blohowiak 's research — some of the savings could be offset by greater paper usage .
While Century Gothic 's thin outlines use less ink than Times or Arial , the letters themselves are wider , and could result in some documents requiring more paper .
Another toner - friendly solution might come from a Dutch design company , which came up with the concept of an " Ecofont . "
The original Ecofont was a modified version of Bitstream 's Vera Sans typeface , with tiny holes punched out of the strokes of the letters .
Printed at common sizes below 12 points , the holes are generally too small to notice and use less ink to print .
Printer.com 's research showed that the original Ecofont itself saved almost as much ink as Century Gothic .
Ecofont saves toner by punching tiny holes in each letter , which is n't noticeable at common text sizes .
However , the designers have taken the idea one step further , and developed Ecofont software that will punch tiny holes in the type of any document you print , using whatever typeface you prefer .
A narrower typeface which uses less paper can be combined with the ink savings of Ecofont for a combined savings of ink and paper ( and extra green points , too ) .
Perhaps the best solution , however , is to just avoid hitting the print button altogether unless it is absolutely necessary .
Much of our data exists in electronic form , and there is increasingly little reason to print those documents on paper .
Mobile devices like smartphones , netbooks , or Apple 's iPad can give on - the - go document access , and cloud services like Google Docs mean that the most up - to - date version is always available to anyone with network access .
And thanks to special font families designed for the screen ( such as Microsoft 's recent collection of ClearType fonts ) , onscreen reading is easier on the eyes than ever .
Between the idea
And the reality
...
Falls the shadow .
Thus TS Eliot , writing in 1925 , predicted how most advertising executives would feel most of the time .
But perhaps particularly those working in politics .
Advertising deals with stuff that is ( at least ) at one remove from reality .
And the live debates have proved that more than anything I 've seen before .
Prior to the live debates , everything looked relatively straightforward .
Tory would bash Labour , Labour would bash
Tory slightly less cruelly , and the Lib Dems would try to bash both of them , but get ignored like a six - year - old sibling trying to get in on a pair of 10 - year - olds ' pillow fight .
Richard Huntington , working on the Labour account at Saatchis , emailed me 10 days ago to say : " We are yet to witness a defining piece of work from any of the parties .
We may yet though . "
At the time I thought he just meant that a magnificent piece of mud-slinging was about to come out – after all , Hague in a Thatcher wig was a defining piece of work .
But then Clegg , as the Guardian put it , seized his moment .
And what really interested me was that the debates brought some reality to what had previously been a sort of shadow debate , happening on the poster sites .
The debates have been a huge surprise .
First , that we watched them at all .
All the pundits were predicting death by boredom .
And more people watched a TV programme called Young Butcher of the Year ( a sort of " Butcher Idol " , if you can imagine that ) than watched a live debate between the candidates for the next chancellor of the exchequer .
Second , that Cameron has fared so badly .
It was his initiative in the first place , but as Bell Pottinger chairman Peter Bingle claimed , the televised debates may well have cost the Conservative party the election : " Whichever adviser or guru advised David Cameron to take part made a terrible mistake . "
If you want some real science go to the highly addictive Slapometer site , where Cameron polled an impressive and doubtless rather painful 50 % of the total slaps given to all three leaders .
On both debates .
He really has struggled .
We all expected him to be cool and razzle - dazzley – like Tom Cruise being interviewed by Jonathan Ross .
But he came across as Jonathan Ross being interviewed by Jonathan Ross .
And we all expected Brown to look like a breed of Highland cattle plop - plopping mournful excrement .
He 's done a lot better than that , although last night , in HD , you could see the pancake thick on his face .
There were some extraordinary moments last night .
Cameron saying : " A politician should n't say ' lies ' very often . "
Nobody else seems to have commented on that so far , so maybe I was hallucinating .
But the combination of childishness and evasiveness was too good not to be true , I thought .
And Gordon saying he had n't authorised the pensioner - scaring leaflets .
There spake a man who accepts responsibility as readily as a child in a game of pass - the - parcel .
Although Cameron 's accusation of scaremongering was like Nick Griffin accusing someone of racism .
What about his scarey posters of tombstones ?
Or , even more frighteningly , his posters of Gordon smiling ?
I loved Clegg 's dig at Cam 's alliance with climate change deniers , antisemites and homophobes .
Cameron 's face at that point would make a good 48 - sheet poster for the Lib Dems .
But the reality was that Clegg 's performances have brought him to the forefront of the picture .
So I found myself looking at his marketing to see how he was approaching it all .
One agency called The Assembly has done a PEB for him about broken promises ( which I thought was very good , but which could have done with more examples ) , while another agency called Iris was doing a spoof of Brown and Cameron and a host of other " Labservative " leaders .
Assembly 's work had more substance , but Iris 's approach seems to be the one which has initially worked .
By lumping his two opponents together , and poking fun at them , Clegg has won hearts and minds nationwide .
Why two agencies ?
Lack of funds .
While the Tories can ( and usually do ) fire agencies with all the aplomb of billionaires switching mistresses , Clegg is forced to accept hand - outs from anybody willing to help .
But his message has nevertheless come shining through .
He 's nicked Cameron 's position of " change " – and anyway if Cameron wanted change , he 's got it .
Eighteen months ago , he was 26 points ahead in the polls .
So , how have the other parties responded to the two - horse race turning into a three - legged race ( with all that that implies ) ?
Labour has released a film with Eddie Izzard .
He reminds us that the Tories are Thatcher 's children and advises us to : " Be afraid .
Be very afraid . "
The bit I did n't like was where he talked about meeting lots of people on his marathons who backed up his belief that Britain was doing all right .
Yes , it 's more credible than Cameron meeting a 40 - year - old black man who does n't want any more immigration .
But insisting that you keep meeting people who agree with you , has always been a sure sign of madness .
They also made a film purporting to come from the future and portraying a society damaged by Conservative rule .
As a complete contrast to that , the Tories kicked off a Twitter feed purporting to come from 2015 and – well , you 've guessed the rest , have n't you ?
Do they really think we 're gonna fall for stuff like this ?
Sadly , they do .
The Tories also produced a very bland PEB , whose only highlight was David Cameron screaming " When will shopkeepers stop selling alcohol to kids ?
And will you turn that bloody music down ? "
( I 'm exaggerating slightly .
I have to .
It was too boring for words . )
Then they ran a couple of posters that are so boring it 's barely worth discussing them .
All of which backed up the live debate statistics on aggression .
Brown went on the offensive 21 times last night , Clegg 14 times and Cameron only 11 times .
The Tories really are hamstrung by the fear of being seen as bullies .
At last , something good has come out of political correctness .
Although , give them credit .
They 're trying to be aggressive .
One of the posters read : " Let 's stop Labour 's jobs tax . "
A spokesman said : " These posters are part of our positive campaign to show the public why David Cameron and the Conservatives have the right values . "
Positive ?
Only in the context of political advertising could a poster that attacks your opponent and offers no alternative be termed positive .
But advertising has been the loser in this election .
Mud - slinging billboards have n't had a tenth of the impact of the live debates .
As I said at the beginning of this , that 's one of the problems with advertising .
It 's always been about selling " the " sizzle , not the sausage " .
I 've always suspected that this showed a lack of trust in the probity of the sausage .
And in the long history of political advertising , and politics generally , that may well have been valid .
But with Clegg , maybe , finally , there really is some beef .
Apple this week slashed hundreds — and in some cases thousands — of dollars from the cost of its Mac Developer Program annual subscription , which now carries a flat fee of $ 99 per year .
Previously , developers had to pay between $ 499 for the " Select " tier and $ 3,499 for the " Premier " categorization .
The newly revamped Mac Developer Program is modeled after Apple 's wildly successful iPhone Developer program , and offers technical resources , support and more .
Developers who subscribe receive pre-release versions of forthcoming software for Mac OS X , including the operating system itself .
" Receiving pre-release Mac OS X software is an exclusive benefit for all Mac Developer Program members , " the official developer site reads , " and allows developers to begin incorporating the latest technologies into their development process , test for compatibility , and report bugs . "
Subscribers also gain access to the Apple Developer Forums , where they can discuss development topics with Mac developers and Apple engineers .
The program also offers exclusive development videos from Apple engineers and experts .
Xcode tools are still available as a free download , but access to pre-release software and Apple 's technical support are available only with the $ 99 annual subscription .
With more than 140,000 applications available for download on the iPhone App Store , developers have embraced Apple 's mobile platform with the iPhone OS .
The coming release of the iPad , based on the iPhone OS , has generated even more interest in the mobile operating system .
From Sen. Bernie Sanders -- Sanders vs. Gregg :
Sharply contrasting views of the role of Wall Street in American society were staked out in a Senate floor debate over a major overhaul of financial regulations .
In an exchange that extended over two days , Senators Bernie Sanders and Judd Gregg clashed over their competing visions of big banks and federal regulation of the financial industry .
The progressive independent and a conservative Republican from neighboring states that share a border shaped by the Connecticut River debated how best to avoid the kind of financial fallout that plunged the economy into a severe recession in the fall of 2008 .
Sanders Op - Ed : Real Wall Street Reform :
In my view , the real and transformational financial reform we need must include the following elements :
Break Up Huge Banks
The four major U.S. banks – Bank of America , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase and Well - Fargo – issue two - thirds of the credit cards in this country , write half the mortgages and collectively hold $ 7.4 trillion in assets , about 52 percent of the nation ’s estimated total output last year .
Incredibly , despite all of them being bailed out during the Wall Street meltdown because they were “ too big to fail , ” three of them ( Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , and Wells Fargo ) are now bigger than before the bailout .
But this is an issue which goes beyond the danger of “ too big to fail ” and future taxpayer liability .
We must break up these behemoths because of the incredible economic power they exert on the economy through their concentration of ownership and enormous competitive advantages .
Financial Institutions Must be Integrated Into the Real Economy
At a time when we are in the midst of a major recession , it is insane that our largest financial institutions continue to trade trillions in esoteric financial instruments which makes Wall Street the largest gambling casino in the world .
We need to create a financial system which invests in the real economy , and helps create millions of new jobs by providing small and medium businesses with the credit they desperately need .
We also need investments to rebuild our manufacturing sector , transform our energy system and create modern transportation and infrastructure systems .
We do n’t need banks pushing home mortgages on people who ca n’t afford them .
We do n’t need huge amounts being “ bet ” on whether housing securities go up or down or what the price of oil will be six months from now .
National Usury Legislation Major financial institutions have , in many ways , become nothing less than loan - sharking operations .
Today , millions of Americans who pay their bills on time are now forced to pay 25 or 30 percent interest rates .
That is not only obscene but , according to every major religion , immoral .
Banks cannot be allowed to engage in usury and charge outrageous interest rates .
We must cap interest rates for private banks at the same level as we do for credit unions – 15 percent except under exceptional circumstances .
Transparency at the Federal Reserve The Federal Reserve cannot continue to operate in almost total secrecy .
During the bailout , large financial institutions received trillions of dollars in zero or near - zero interest loans .
Who received those loans and under what terms ?
The Fed is n’t telling .
Did some of them turn around and , in a mammoth welfare scam , invest that Fed money in government treasury bonds at 3 percent or 4 percent interest rates ?
The Fed refuses to say .
It ’s time we had transparency at the Fed so that the American people know what our central bank is doing .
BOSTON , April 13 ( UPI ) -- Rep. Barney Frank says he was just trying to read and mind his own business on a flight to Boston amid snarky comments about healthcare reform .
Frank , who helped lead the controversial legislation through Congress , was the object of some reportedly snide remarks from two doctors who were also on the plane .

" They wanted to talk to me , but I apologized and said I like to read and watch on planes , " Frank told the Boston Globe Tuesday .
" They began to talk louder . "
Frank said while he stayed out of the fray , his partner , Jimmy Ready , handled the back - and - forth with the two female ophthalmologists , who became increasingly riled when Ready accused them of being " bitchy . "
Another passenger on Monday 's Los Angeles - to - Boston flight said Frank was minding his own business while the doctors had been drinking and getting a bit loud .
The high - altitude debate settled down after a bit and the rest of the flight was uneventful , the Globe reported .
Editor 's note : Bill Donohue is president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights and author of four books , including " Secular Sabotage : How Liberals are Destroying Religion and Culture in America . "
New York ( CNN ) --
The rash of stories about priestly sexual abuse in Europe , especially in Ireland and Germany , has put many Catholics on the defensive .
They should not be .
While sexual molestation of any kind is always indefensible , the politics surrounding this story is also indefensible .
Employers from every walk of life , in both the U.S. and Europe , have long handled cases of alleged sex abuse by employees as an internal matter .
Rarely have employers called the cops , and none was required to do so .
Though this is starting to change , any discussion of employee sexual abuse that took place 30 and 40 years ago must acknowledge this reality .
Thus it hardly comes as a surprise that Cardinal Sean Brady in Ireland did not summon the authorities about a case involving a priest in the 1970s .
What is surprising is why some are now indicting him , acting as if his response was the exception to the rule .
Selective indignation at the Catholic Church is not confined to Brady .
Why , for example , are the psychologists and psychiatrists who pledged to " fix " abusers treated so lightly ?
After all , employers from the corporate world to the Catholic Church were told over and over again that therapy works and to give the offender a second chance .
Indeed , the zeitgeist of the day was that rehabilitation not only works , it is virtuous .
That such advice was wildly oversold can now be agreed upon by almost everyone , and that is precisely why it smacks of politics to deny how strongly held the rehabilitative ideal was .
Had the Catholic Church simply tossed the offenders out , it would have been branded as heartless .
There is also much noise about Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger -- now the pope -- approving the transfer of a priest out of his archdiocese in Germany for therapy .
That happened 30 years ago .
Again , he did exactly what virtually every other leader , clerical or secular , did .
Anyone who maintains that in North America or Europe it was common practice for employers outside the Catholic Church to file a police report about suspected wrongdoing by their employees needs to put up or shut up :
Where is the evidence ?
Beyond that issue , the focus on sexual abuse in the Catholic Church is far out of proportion to the attention given by the media to the sexual molestation of minors when committed by non-Catholic clergymen .
According to a report by the New York Times in October , the Brooklyn district attorney 's office had filed charges in 26 cases of sexual abuse involving members of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community .
Just this month , Rabbi Baruch Lebovits was found guilty on eight counts of sexually abusing a Brooklyn boy .
Yet the Times , which has run several stories on the decades - old cases in Ireland and Germany , never reported it .
And none of it merits the kind of attention given to priests .
Catholics are n't fooled .
Public school teachers accused of sex abuse are either transferred to another school district -- it 's so common that it is called " passing the trash " -- or they are assigned to what , in New York , they call a " rubber room " ( these are places where teachers draw full salary and benefits doing makeshift administrative work ) .
Both the teachers unions and state law allow this outrage to continue .
Maybe if the media concentrated on this problem , solutions would follow .
But the politics of the day being what they are , do n't bet on it .
It 's a lot sexier to nail the Catholic Church .
The hyper - concentration on the Catholic Church is not by accident .
The Church preaches an ethic of sexual restraint -- a profoundly countercultural idea -- so when a priest fails , it 's tempting to highlight it .
Human nature being what it is , that 's understandable .
But it 's also immoral .
Quite frankly , if sexual abuse is wrong , it should not matter what the identity of the abuser is .
Selective justice is the highest form of injustice .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bill Donohue .
The Acer Liquid A1 just started shipping in the UK , and right on cue we 've got a video unboxing .
Turns out the box housing the 1GHz Snapdragon - powered Android set is fairly interesting itself , with a magnetic hinged design that opens to reveal the charger , manuals , and bundled 2 GB SanDisk microSD card and SD adapter .
As for the phone , do n't hold out for an Android 2.0 surprise -- it 's running Android 1.6 with Acer 's custom Spinlets UI skin on top , which equals a frowny - face from us .
Hopefully Acer manages to update things if this guy ever comes to the States , but for now we 'll just let you head past the break and check the video for yourselves -- we 're sorry about the terrible Owl City soundtrack , but we had nothing to do with it .

In the Orion Nebula , dense clumps of material are detected by Planck ( left ) that go completely unnoticed by telescopes operating at visible wavelengths ( right )
The gaseous and dusty fabric of our galaxy is illuminated in new images captured by Europe 's Planck telescope .
The pictures reveal features of the Milky Way that are unseen by most other space observatories , say scientists .
Remarkably , these images are just byproducts for Planck , which must filter out much of the light it detects to get at its primary target .
That target is a relic radiation emitted in the first few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang .
This so - called Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) fills the entire sky and retains fundamental information about the age , contents and structure of the cosmos .
On one level , therefore , Monday 's release represents " rejected " data - although Planck scientists stress there will be many researchers for whom this information will still hold high value .
" For the primary CMB , we want to remove all the galactic emission - but it's an important part of the science case for Planck that you can also learn a lot about the galaxy from that data , " Planck team - member Professor George Efstathiou told BBC News .
Cold clumps
The pictures illustrate " the stuff " that sits between the stars - the great clouds of dust and gas that billow about in space , aggregating in some places to form stars and dispersing in others as they are pushed about by the pressure of starlight .
In one picture of the Orion Nebula , Planck 's instruments see concentrated fronts of material where stars are actively forming .
In a second image of a far more sedate region of space in the Perseus Constellation , the structure and distribution of this material looks much more diffuse .
PLANCK SPACE TELESCOPE
Planck is surveying the famous Cosmic Microwave Background
This ancient light 's origins date to 380,000 years after the Big Bang
It informs scientists about the age , contents and shape of the cosmos Planck 's measurements will be finer than any previous satellite
The observatory makes its map by rotating and scanning the sky Planck 's mission goal is to scan the sky at least four times
Planck telescope 's first glimpse
Planck achieves ultra-cold state Planck 's super - sensitive instruments work at a range of very long wavelengths , in the radio part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
Scientists probe these different wavelengths to highlight particular features .
At the lowest frequencies , the telescope sees the emission given off by electrons accelerating through the magnetic fields of our galaxy .
At intermediate wavelengths , the light detected by Planck is dominated by gas that has been excited by newly formed stars .
And at the highest frequencies in its range , the observatory maps the emission coming from the coldest clumps of dust that trace the matter falling in on itself to form new stars .
All of this information provides useful insight on the complex processes that go into sculpting our galaxy .
" The two highest frequency channels on Planck are really there to study dust ; they were put on to allow galactic science .
Those are the primary channels for detecting cold star - forming core regions , " said Professor Efstathiou .
" We do n't know that much about dust emission from the galaxy because , at these wavelengths , the atmosphere is opaque .
They are absorbed by water vapour .
That 's why you go into space with a mission like Planck . "
Big prize Planck 's chief objective , however , is to map the Cosmic Microwave Background .
This only becomes apparent when all the " contaminating " light that beautifully illuminates the latest pictures is stripped out .
Planck should complete its first all - sky survey of the CMB within weeks .
Recently agreed funding should see the telescope eventually acquire at least four - times coverage .
The project team will then need time to analyse all the data and assess its significance .
A formal release of CMB maps and scientific papers is expected at the end of 2012 .
Past pioneers in the study of the Cosmic Microwave Background have earned a clutch of Nobel Prizes , and there is great hope that the super - sensitivity of Planck will advance the field considerably .
Planck is a mission of the European Space Agency .
It was launched on 14 May last year .
Its observing station is sited 1.5 million km from Earth on its " night side " .
The Perseus region appears less active to Planck ( left ) but still busy compared with telescopes insensitive to emission from interstellar material ( right )

What 's Behind the Honeybee Decline ?
Perhaps Not What You 've Heard
Rachel Carson ‘s Silent Spring is widely recognized as the founding document of the environmentalist movement .
Less widely recognized , but equally important , is why .
For 40 years before the book was published in 1962 , scientists concerned about toxic contamination had been trying to draw a solid link between pesticides and public health .
The link eluded them .
What these scientists were routinely unable to do - either for lack of evidence or literary eloquence - Carson eventually did .
Meticulously , and with narrative grace , she connected the dots between pesticides and a host of health problems ( bearing on all forms of life ) , thereby sparking an intense political response that continues to this day .
The environmental movement thus began with a bang : a general environmental problem ( toxicity ) was shown to have a specific and readily verifiable environmental cause ( certain pesticides ) that stood head and shoulders above other possible explanations .
To be sure , there was controversy - most notably on the issue of DDT and malaria - but the court of public opinion was generally convinced that Carson , who died of cancer in 1964 , had made her case against organophosphate and chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides .
Carson ’s accomplishment , for all its impact , bequeathed to the environmentalist movement a daunting legacy .
The ecological ills that Carson identified became a poignant cautionary tale for an agricultural system hooked on chemicals .
As such , an unintended consequence of Silent Spring was to encourage the emerging environmentalist movement to rely heavily on the power of relatively simple cautionary tales to engage grassroots action .?
Ever since Carson , when an environmental problem has been identified , no matter how complex the underlying ecological factors , it ’s often packaged as a morality lesson highlighting the impact of a single , human - driven environmental sin .
But this standard approach to environmental problems , while translating seamlessly into short press releases , can backfire in ways that gradually weaken the movement .
Ultimately , it ignores the central point that ecology is as messy as it is beautiful , and that establishing bull ’s eye causation is often like throwing a dart into a cyclone .
The allure of singular causation is hard to resist .
When , in 1987 , a barge from New York holding 3,000 tons of trash floated up and down the East Coast without finding a landfill able to take the garbage , environmentalists deemed it a cautionary tale about the nation ’s maxed - out landfills .?
When , in 2000 , the first weeds resistant to genetically engineered ( herbicide - resistant ) crops appeared , environmentalists turned it into a cautionary tale about the decline in diversity of cultivated plant breeds .
And when , most recently , H1N1 swept the globe , environmentalists rushed to tell a cautionary tale about the inherent dangers of factory farms .
Such reductions to a single cause are satisfying .
They stoke a sense of outrage and inspire a quest for justice .
They also make it clear who is at fault .
But in each of the above cases , the cautionary tale never quite captured the deeper causes .
Future assessments showed landfill space to be far from a premium ; a recent report from the Dutch Center for Genetic Resources has revealed that seed biodiversity has actually increased since the advent of GE seeds ; and the H1N1 virus ’s origin has yet to be positively linked to factory farming .
In fact , the USDA goes so far as to note that free - range swine , by virtue of being outdoors and exposed to wildlife , are more susceptible to certain pathogens than confined pigs .
These misfires matter .
Every time a cautionary tale fails to demonstrably confirm the identified cause , the environmental movement comes off as rashly leaping before looking , placing politics ahead of science .
And now it appears another cautionary tale may be veering off its mark .
It involves the rapid decline of honeybees in the United States - a depressing phenomenon called “ colony collapse disorder . ”
Since 2006 , when American farmers and beekeepers began to lament drastic declines in hive populations , environmentalists have been packaging CCD as a cautionary tale confirming our excessive reliance on - once again - harmful pesticides .
As it became clear that this decline was indeed real ( 40 - 50 percent in the US since 2004 ) , environmental interests began to construct the narrative .
Democratic Underground explained , “ Imidacloprid Pesticide Most Likely Cause of Honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder . ”
Grist helped out : “ So there ’s this insecticide called clothianidin that seems likely to be implicated in colony collapse disorder , ” offering as evidence the claim that “ over in Germany the introduction of clothianidin coincided with a sudden bee die - off . ”
Environment 360 led with the headline “ Behind Mass Die-Offs , Pesticides Lurk as Culprit . ”
And Mother Earth News joined the chorus , adding , “ Colony Collapse : Are Potent Pesticides Killing Honeybees ? ” ?
As recently as March 2010 , media reports have continued to stress the pesticide connection as the leading causative factor behind the nation ’s declining bee population .
To date , no scientific evidence directly supporting this conclusion has emerged .
Of course , this could change .
The problem here is not that pesticides are a suggested cause of CCD - this seems perfectly reasonable to assume .
Rather , it ’s that they have been routinely favored - and sometimes politicized - as the singular or most likely cause when , as it turns out , there are a number of supplementary explanations that bear on the phenomenon .
These explanations are neither as simple nor as damning of our behavior as the pesticide explanation .
A January 2010 congressional report on CCD shows why .
Particularly compelling is the impact of the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus ( IAPV ) , which scientists have known about since the 1970s .
This virus , which is transmitted by a Varooa mite , was identified by the USDA in 2007 as “ a marker of CCD . ”
Although the USDA did not go so far as to call IAPV the cause of CCD , the congressional report did note that “ research indicates there is a strong correlation of the appearance of IAPV and CCD together . ”
The report also stresses the likelihood of a pathogen - perhaps the fungus Nosema ceranae - being a contributing factor , “ given that some bee colonies have recovered once their bee boxes were irradiated . ”
It briefly mentions a range of other factors , including the impact of feed supplements made with GE crops , changes in nectar flow as a result of climate change , and the growing gossamer of phone transmission lines , but adds , “ these possible factors have not been substantiated by evidence examined by the key researchers of this issue . ”
The report had something to say about pesticides as well .
As environmentalists rightly - if too exclusively - pointed out , the new class of insecticide known as neonicotinoids was indeed being taken up by bees , along with a variety of fungicides and herbicides .
Although not absorbed in lethal doses , these agents did raise concerns about “ possible chronic problems caused by long - term exposure . ”
The report also recognized that the Organic Consumers Association claimed that collapses were not happening on organic bee operations .
But it went on to mention that “ there is conflicting information about the effect of these pesticides on honey bees , ” adding that these chemicals had been discontinued in Europe while colony losses continued unabated .
In the end , the congressional report placed the pesticide possibility in a broader and more complicated context , one rarely provided by anti-pesticide advocates , and one that makes the standard cautionary tale about pesticides leading to CCD that much harder to accept .
Media reports are beginning to catch on .
In The Economist , a British apiary professor , speaking on the cause of CCD , was recently quoted as saying , “ People want it to be genetically modified crops , pollution , mobile phone masts and pesticides . ”
But , he added , it ’s “ almost certainly none of these . ”
The BBC reported that CCD is actually a cyclical event rather than an anomalous tragedy .
An Australian entomologist quoted in the article explained , “ Researchers around the world are running around trying to find a cause of the disorder - and there ’s absolutely no proof that there ’s a disorder there . ”
Perhaps most compellingly , an article in the recent issue of Conservation reports that , while indeed bee populations have declined in the U.S. since 2004 , the global population of managed bees has , since the 1960s , risen by 50 percent while honey production has gone up 100 percent .?
“ U.S. bee losses , ” writes Nathanael Johnson , “ have been dwarfed by increases in places such as China , Argentina , and Turkey - countries which now dominate the honey supply . ”
Additionally , “ the production of pollinator - dependent crops has quadrupled . ”
None of this additional information has kept the keepers of the cautionary tale from capitalizing on the possible pesticide connection .
For example , several environmental groups are bringing charges against Bayer CropScience to prevent the sale of two pesticides - popularly known as Movento and Ultor - on the grounds that they harm honeybees .
Perhaps these agents should be kept off the market .
I honestly do n’t know .
But I do know that if the means and ends are not consistent - that is , if dubious pretenses are deployed to promote positive environmental outcomes - a short - term victory will come at the expense of the environmental movement ’s long - term viability .
Carson , for her part , would have surely persevered to find the truth , ensuring that the changes she initiated derived from science more than suggestion .
The recession may have bought us a year or two by restraining worldwide demand for power , but the UK must be prepared now to fight for its share of finite energy resources in the future - and the battle will be intense .
The developing world 's thirst for fuel will dominate the global agenda , with wide - ranging implications for Britain .
It is no wonder that set against this backdrop , the ' nuclear option ' has moved strongly back into vogue .
In their hearts , nobody wants atomic power stations in an ideal world .
In reality however the lack of reliable low carbon alternatives is pushing nuclear energy , for a long time the awkward , guilty secret of the power industry , firmly into centre stage .
For the past 30 years , the UK has been relatively insulated from the global market and concerns over energy security .
We turned on the North Sea ' taps ' and transformed our economic fortunes ; from the 1970s the UK Continental Shelf provided plentiful supplies of oil and gas for both domestic consumption and export .
Taken together with our long history as a coal producer , this meant the country was awash with fossil fuel energy , not only to heat our homes , but to burn cheaply in power stations to light them too .
Unfortunately , this energy utopia could not last .
A number of factors have conspired to place UK energy policy in crisis - some unforeseen , others entirely avoidable .
The authorities were complacent - North Sea production peaked in 2001 , and by the middle of the decade we became a net gas importer as supplies dwindled .
The energy infrastructure , most notably gas storage , has not been planned to cope with this new reality .
Added to this , we ' sweated the assets ' by letting our power stations age and degrade , all the while providing us with cheap electricity that could not last .
In January , the latest symptom of this lack of planning manifested as the UK 's energy network operator issued four gas system balancing alerts in a matter of days , cut off supply to almost 100 industrial users , called for emergency imports and asked power companies to turn off gas power stations in favour of coal .
While this showed that the system worked , prior to 2010 only one such alert had ever been issued .
In fairness , we experienced a severe cold snap with record gas demand as a result .
However , if we think this is a problem now , we haven not seen nothing yet .
Gas has left coal and nuclear far behind as our main source of power generation - from less than 40 per cent of supply a few years ago , to between 50 and 60 per cent now .
In the next decade this will rise further , perhaps to 75 per cent or more .
The system coped this year because we could switch on coal - fired plant - but by 2015 many of these will have to close as a result of the EU 's Large Combustion Plant Directive ( LCPD ) , which aims to cut power station emissions .
In the meantime , they have to run on restricted hours .
Furthermore , our nuclear reactors are ageing and unreliable .
Their share of generation has dropped from more than a quarter to around 15 per cent , and will continue to fall over the decade .
Renewables will play an increasingly important role , with exceptionally ambitious government targets for new wind power , in addition to commitments to huge cuts in carbon emissions .
Neither nuclear , nor wind , will fill the energy gap that is looming by 2015 .
All roads lead to a yawning energy gap .
Coal is the dirty outcast - until clean coal technology is proven on a large scale - and that is at least a decade away .
So - what is cheap to build and run , clean ( er ) and able to fill the gap by 2015 ?
Gas .
Lots of it .
Power companies are falling over themselves to build new gas stations - often on the sites of old coal plants on their last legs ( Cockenzie and Tilbury to name but two ) .
The problems are obvious .
As global gas demand mushrooms , we will be hugely reliant on one imported fuel source for our energy needs .
It will come by pipeline from Russia and the former Soviet Bloc via Europe - and we are at the end of the line .
If Ukraine does n't pay for Russian gas , will we be cut off as a result ?
We also increasingly rely on liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) imports by ship from the Middle East , but that is a global market - the UK will have to pay top dollar to attract these cargoes .
Norway is a safer source of supply , but also sends its gas to the continent .
Nor is gas clean enough to meet our emissions objectives .
The dilemma of future energy supply in the UK is a menu of imperfect options .
Gas is cheap and easy , but on the other hand the supply sources are far from guaranteed , it burns off CO2 , and we are in great danger of becoming completely reliant on one fuel .
Unabated coal is an emissions ' car crash ' that is being regulated out of the picture - clean coal is a nascent technology and years away from economic production on the scale needed .
Renewables , primarily wind , are being developed at a furious rate with generous subsidies .
Yet reliability is a major issue - the intermittency of supply inevitably means that flexible back - up ( fossil fuel ) will be exceptionally expensive .
Step forward nuclear .
With the UK signing up to low carbon legislation both here and at European / global levels , atomic power is virtually impossible to ignore .
Ironic then , that until 2005 that is exactly what government policy did .
Emboldened by cheap and plentiful fossil fuel - sourced power from ageing power stations , policy froze out nuclear as an ongoing option .
The key Government energy White Paper in 2003 noted that there was a lack of replacement nuclear on the slate , but argued that " its current economics make it an unattractive option for new , carbon - free generating capacity " .
Firm statements like this over time led to the erosion of the nuclear skills base - why go to university to learn about atomic power stations that your country has written off ?
The tide started to turn in late 2005 .
First , the government 's Chief Scientific Adviser ( Sir David King ) - and then the prime minister - spoke in favour of a reappraisal of nuclear .
In 2006 , the resulting White Paper confirmed that a new generation of ' nukes ' was on the agenda as part of a future mix of energy supplies - but the private sector would have to cover the cost of investment , decommissioning and waste storage .
Greenpeace was furious , and won a court action ruling that the subsequent consultation process was lacking .
The government consulted again , and came to the same conclusion .
At the end of May 2008 , a series of coincidental power station outages - including at Sizewell B , the newest atomic reactor - caused ' brown outs ' ( managed power cuts ) to hundreds of thousands of people .
This brought into sharp relief the problems caused by the lack of investment in infrastructure over the preceding 20 years , and did little to dampen the government 's new - found ardour for the atom - plans were announced for a new generation of eight plants in July of the same year .
Then , in September , the state sold its controlling stake in British Energy ( operator of most of the UK's existing nuclear build ) to EDF , the French state - owned utility , for £ 12.4 billion .
The government expects EDF and Areva , its French industrial partner , to deliver 4 of the 10 ( now ) planned stations .
In 2010 , it is clear that nuclear is right at the heart of the UK energy agenda , and we are moving mountains in order to clear the path for new build .
The National Policy Statement of 2009 , for example , incorporates radical legislation to reduce the planning lead time to as short as one year - the government appreciates that it simply does not have the luxury of time .
Sites for the new planned stations have been identified , and energy companies have been falling over themselves to buy up land .
There are two questions - should we build nuclear , and can we do so in time ?
The answers are linked , and complicated .
Nuclear ticks many boxes : it is low carbon , provides reliable baseload power , and boasts stable sources of supply .
Carbon targets and energy independence means that a future built mainly around conventional fossil fuels is untenable .
In many commentators ' minds , cleaner fossil fuels would provide the ' sandwich filling ' between worthy but unpredictable renewables , and controversial yet reliable atomic power .
Nuclear 's detractors would argue that the emissions and social cost of atomic energy is measured in hundreds of thousands of years , and the lack of a permanent solution for waste storage is undeniably the biggest argument against a new generation of reactors .
The other aspect is cost - nuclear has never been built on time , on budget - and never without public subsidy .
In this last respect , atomic and renewable energy have more in common than one might expect .
The global community wants cleaner energy and a halt to global warming .
Yet no government can afford to let the lights go out , and that is what may be at stake .
That is why , while there are around 450 nuclear power stations currently operating globally , plans now exist for a doubling of this total .
China alone plans 130 reactors to add to the 11 currently generating ; South Africa has two but plans a further 30 .
And as recently as February , President Obama announced his support for new build in the United States , with the prospect of Federal loan guarantees .
Nuclear is coming , so can it be delivered in time to fill the UK 's impending energy gap ?
With the first shortages predicted by 2015 , it is already inevitable that this demand must be filled by a ' dash for gas ' , as touched upon earlier .
The first new nuclear plant is slated for commissioning by the end of 2017 , according to EDF Energy .
This 7 year timescale from the drawing board to active service is highly ambitious , and unrealistic according to experts such as Dieter Helm , Professor of Energy Policy at Oxford University , who believes that we will be lucky to see new plants by 2020 .
Deloitte estimate that 50 GW of new or refurbished generation will be required by then - roughly two thirds of current capacity ; the decisions that the government is making now to fast - track nuclear power should have been made a decade ago .
The example of Finland is instructive .
The Olkiluoto project could be described as the rebirth of new European nuclear power - if so the labour is proving to be exceptionally painful .
Originally due to start supplying power in 2009 , the latest estimate for completion is 2012 - a full 13 years from conception of the plans .
Amid a series of production halts due to regulatory concerns over safety and build quality , the costs have doubled from 3 billion to 6 billion .
What is more , the reactor design ( by Areva ) is the one favoured by EDF to build their UK reactors .
Optimists argue z someone had to be first , and that all subsequent projects will learn from the mistakes in Finland .
A policy package should comprise a Low Carbon Obligation to replace the RO , a minimum ' floor ' price for the carbon market , and an exemption from the Climate Change Levy for atomic power .
In addition , the liberalised wholesale markets must be reformed , at least to include a capacity payments scheme whereby power producers are paid by the consumer for having plants available .
OFGEM has gone as far as to raise the possibility of a central buying agency for power - but this is surely a step too far that would indicate total policy failure .
The market can deliver with a few ' tweaks ' here and there , together with the right messages over investment .
Last but not least , if we are to build nuclear stations in time , we must address the skills gap , and resource the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Health & Safety Executive sufficiently that all the cogs of the planning wheel keep turning safely - this is no easy task given the extent to which nuclear skill sets have withered on the vine .
In conclusion , nuclear has a central role to play as a ' necessary evil ' within a low carbon future energy mix .
We should plan for a third generation of nuclear fission reactors , but make them our last .
The government however needs to do a lot - and fast .
The policy impetus in the last two or three years has been impressive , but we are making up for a lost decade or more .

Since her appointment as Darpa chief last June , Regina Dugan has kept a low profile , at least compared to long - serving predecessor Tony Tether .
Now , a year after taking the top job at Darpa , Dugan 's finally talking .
In a statement last week [.pdf ] to the House Armed Service Committee 's panel on terrorism , unconventional threats and capabilities , Dugan outlined her vision for the future of the Pentagon 's blue - sky research arm , with everything from plant - based vaccines to biomimetics making the short list .
But none of it 's possible , she told the panel , without more investment in American universities and industry to cultivate the techies of the future .
Or as Dugan herself put it , Darpa needs more troops for its " elite army of futuristic technogeeks . "
The agency first took note of America 's looming shortage in computing , science and tech experts in January , when the agency requested proposals that would attract more teens to careers in the field .
The agency then suggested tactics like career days , mentorships and more scholarship money to get the job done .
Dugan , however , is touting flashier options .
" Box O ' Radar , " for one , would give kids the chance to build and test their own radar devices .
Or , she told the panel , we could turn teens into app - making machines .
" Additional ideas included the development of an application ' marketplace ' devoted to STEM [ science , technology , engineering , mathematics ] that would post challenges such as ' apps to teach electronics ' or ' apps to teach radar ' or just ' coolest app with a practical use , ' " she said .
" Prizes might range from iPods to scholarships . "
The geek - recruitment schemes were just a few of the ideas tossed around at Darpa 's recent Industry Summit – a meeting between Darpa managers and 120 American industry heads that Dugan said was meant " to engage the leadership of US industry . "
Dugan might be most concerned about the disengagement between her agency and American colleges .
Between 2001 and 2008 , Darpa 's funding to research schools was cut in half .
Less funding meant fewer graduate students : Combined with a 43 percent decrease in computing and science enrollment among undergrads , that 's a geek shortage in the making .
But Dugan , a former Darpa program manager and the co-founder of a niche investment firm , is hoping to rectify the problem .
" Last September I traveled to five universities – Texas A&M , Caltech , UCLA , Stanford and Berkeley – to meet faculty , deans , and presidents , graduate students and undergraduates , " she said .
" We asked for their renewed commitment ... for university leaders to clear obstacles and encourage their best and brightest to serve in government . "

An Ohio judge recently ordered four teenage sexual assault victims to take polygraph tests .
As if suggesting that the girls may be lying is n't bad enough , the tests are pointless , since their attackers have already been found guilty .
According to the Associated Press , in four separate cases Cuyahoga Juvenile Court Judge Alison Floyd ordered the girls ( and their attackers ) to submit to polygraph tests , after she found the teen boys delinquent ( the equivalent of " guilty " in the juvenile system ) .
Since the court does n't pay for the examination of victims , the victims ' families would be responsible for the cost of the tests .
All of the girls have ignored Judge Floyd 's order , but in a statement sent to the newspaper The Plain Dealer , the mother of one 16 - year - old victim said her daughter was still upset by the request .
She explains :
I believe even more damage was done by the judge letting the perpetrator know she was ordering the victim to take the polygraph .
He apparently took this to mean the judge did not believe her and he used this to tell their peers that the judge did not believe her and was ordering her take a lie detector test .

Thankfully , prosecutors are siding with the girls .
Briefs were filed by prosecutors in two cases asking that the judge stop ordering rape victims to take polygraph tests , and in another motion Assistant County Prosecutor Nicole Ellis wrote :
It is clear that the court is attempting to re-investigate the case after the child was found delinquent ...
The legislature enacted the rape shield statute to protect victims from undue harassment , a tendency in sexual assault cases to try the victims rather than the defendant .

An attorney representing one of the boys says Judge Floyd , not the defense team , proposed testing the girls and the judge has n't responded to several requests for an explanation .
Obviously women occasionally make false rape accusations , but Judge Floyd 's request is still baffling .
Why submit the girls to polygraph tests , which are unreliable even when the subject is n't reliving a traumatic assault , when there was enough evidence to convince her to convict the boys ?
( And she 'd already done so , to boot . )
The only thing Floyd has accomplished is discouraging other victims from coming forward by sending the message that even if your attacker is convicted , no one will ever really believe you .

Judge Orders Polygraphs For Rape Victims [ CBS News ]
Cuyahoga Juvenile Court Judge Alison Floyd Orders Sex Assault Victims To Take Polygraph Tests [ The Plain Dealer ]
( Health.com ) --
The fast - food industry has long been under fire for selling high - fat , high - calorie meals that have been linked to weight gain and diabetes , but the financial health of the industry continues to attract investors -- including some of the leading insurance companies in the U.S. , a new study reports .
According to Harvard Medical School researchers , 11 large companies that offer life , disability , or health insurance owned about $ 1.9 billion in stock in the five largest fast - food companies as of June 2009 .
The fast - food companies included McDonald's , Burger King , and Yum !
Brands ( the parent company of KFC and Taco Bell ) .
Companies from both North America and Europe were among the insurers , including the U.S. - based Massachusetts Mutual , Northwestern Mutual , and Prudential Financial .
The researchers say insurance companies should sell their fast - food stock or use their influence as shareholders to make fast food healthier , by pressuring big restaurant chains to cut portion sizes or improve nutrition , for instance .
There 's a " potential disconnect " between the mission of insurance companies and the often - unhealthy food churned out by companies like McDonald 's , they write .
" The insurance industry cares about making money , and it does n't really care how , " says the senior author of the study , J. Wesley Boyd , M.D. , an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School , in Boston .
" They will invest in products that contribute to significant morbidity and mortality if doing so is going to make money . "
Boyd and his colleagues used a database that draws on financial filings and news reports to estimate the fast - food investments of the 11 companies .
Their findings appear in the American Journal of Public Health .
7 health insurance horror stories
Massachusetts Mutual and Northwestern Mutual -- which both offer life , disability , and long - term care insurance -- owned $ 367 million and $ 422 million in fast - food stock , respectively , much of it in McDonald 's , the authors report .
Prudential , which offers life insurance and long - term disability coverage , held $ 356 million in fast - food stock , according to the study .
Insurance companies disputed these figures .
Andrea Austin , the assistant director of corporate relations for Northwestern Mutual , in Milwaukee , says the company 's investment in fast - food companies is only about $ 250 million , and was at the time the study was conducted .
That amounts to about one - fifth of 1 percent of the company 's portfolio , she adds .
Austin also disagrees that the company 's fast - food investments represent a disconnect with its mission .
" We have to determine what 's going to give our policy owners value , " she says .
" We have to make sure we fulfill our obligations to them , and to do that we invest in a wide variety of industries .
It 's that diversification that enables us to return value to them . "
In an e-mail , MassMutual spokesman Mark Cybulski called the study 's findings " absolutely incorrect " and said that as of December 31 , the company 's holdings of fast - food - related stock amounted to just $ 1.4 million , which represents less than one - hundredth of 1 percent of the company 's $ 86.6 billion in cash and total invested assets .
Austin says she has " no idea " why the figures differ and says that Northwestern Mutual does n't use subsidiaries .
Theresa Miller , the vice president of global communications for Prudential Financial , said in an e-mail that she could not discuss the specifics of the company 's portfolios .
But she noted that the investments in the report are within index funds , and that " a large portion " are managed on behalf of third - party clients .
MassMutual , Northwestern , and Sun Life ( another insurer mentioned in the report ) have contested Boyd 's findings in the past .
Last year Boyd led a similar analysis , published as a letter to the editor in the New England Journal of Medicine , that found that seven insurance companies held some $ 4.5 billion in tobacco - company stock .
Then , too , Cybulski said that MassMutual 's holdings were just a fraction of what Boyd and his colleagues claimed .
According to Boyd , the discrepancy in his figures and those cited by MassMutual may be due in part to two factors :
Insurance companies may invest in fast - food stocks through subsidiaries over which they have limited oversight ( and therefore may not consider them direct investments ) , and some of the investments may be in index funds , a type of mutual fund tied to the collective performance of a large group of stocks , such as the S&P 500 , which may include those of fast - food companies .
The database used in his analysis provides only the aggregate of a company 's holdings , Boyd says .
Austin says she has " no idea " why the figures differ and says that Northwestern Mutual does n't use subsidiaries .
Boyd and his co-authors emphasize that fast food -- unlike cigarette smoking -- can be safe in moderation .
15 ways smoking ruins your looks
However , a growing body of research has linked frequent fast - food consumption to weight gain , obesity , and type 2 diabetes .
As a result , the study notes , several cities and towns have restricted fast - food restaurants via zoning laws .
And under the health - care legislation passed by Congress in March , chain restaurants will have to post calorie information on their menus , as is already required in New York City .
In their 2009 paper on tobacco , Boyd and his colleagues suggested that insurance companies profit twice over by investing in tobacco stocks , since they can charge higher premiums to smokers and also profit if the stock rises .
A similar dynamic may be at work with fast food , according to Boyd .
" They can charge you more for life insurance if you have these negative health outcomes that people have as a result of eating fast food , " he says .
But investing in unhealthy industries such as fast food and tobacco is n't necessarily a win-win for insurers over the long term , especially for health insurers , says Sara N. Bleich , Ph.D. , an assistant professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , in Baltimore , Maryland .
" Health insurance companies get profits if they invest in tobacco and fast food , [ but ] these are some of the top drivers of mortality in the country , " says Bleich , who researches obesity policy but was not involved in the current study .
25 diet - busting foods you should never eat
" They are essentially killing off their consumer base , so it 's not a sustainable model in the long - term .
Long - term goals should be consistent with health , because that ensures a large population from which to draw consumers . "
Robert Zirkelbach , the press secretary for America 's Health Insurance Plans , a national association representing health insurers whose Web site lists three of the companies named in the study , declined to comment on the specifics of the study .
" Our industry is strongly committed to prevention and wellness , " Zirkelbach said in a statement .
America 's Top 10 healthiest fast food restaurants
" Health insurance companies are doing things across the country that are working to address obesity , to promote prevention , and to encourage people to live healthier lifestyles . "
Gigi Kellett , the director of the anti-tobacco campaign of Corporate Accountability International , a Boston - based watchdog group , says that both tobacco and fast food are inappropriate investments for insurance companies .
" Tobacco remains the leading cause of preventable death around the world , and there is growing research that diet - related diseases could soon surpass tobacco , " she says .
" It 's irresponsible for insurance companies to invest in companies that make people sick . "
Corporate Accountability International recently launched a " Retire Ronald " campaign to pressure McDonald 's to discontinue the Ronald McDonald clown character and rein in its marketing to children , Kellett adds .
For her part , Bleich says that while health insurance companies , specifically , should be encouraged to divest their fast - food investments , encouraging self - regulation and competition in the fast - food industry may be a more effective way to make the industry healthier .

Maybe I 'm jaded .
But having been in the nonprofit technology since 1993 , I 've seen a predictable pattern of cycles with new tools and technology .
It closely follows Gartner 's Technology Hype Cycle
Technology Trigger
Inflated Expectations
Trough of Disillusionment
Slope of Enlightenment
Plateau of Productivity
With nonprofits , the Trough of Disillusionment comes when we start to understand the real challenges in implementing a new technology and stop looking at as a panacea that will solve all our problems .
Or be bailout for our nonprofit .
The Haiti crisis demonstrated that text to give fundraising can be a powerful tool , particularly as an " early responder " fundraising technique in disaster .
But will the dramatic text fundraising that we saw the Red Cross experience translate to every non-profit that wants to add it to their tool bag ?
I like the way that Allison Fine reflected on this question last week .
How does she feel about text to give ?
Trepidatious .
Geoff Livingston has written a good piece on Mashable that throws a little cold water SMS / Text To Give Campaigns by pointing out the challenges and limitations .
The reality is that there are challenges - cost , vendors , and other limitations .
The technology is n't cheap to set up .
In fact , according to the post it can be expensive , anywhere from $ 3,000 - 10,000 .
And , just like other technology tools , like online credit card transactions , nonprofits end up paying a transaction fee of 5 - 10 % back to the vendor .
So , deciding to incorporate a SMS campaign should include a traditional nonprofit technology ROI analysis that analyzes the benefits , value , and financial analysis .
It may not make sense for your nonprofit to get mobile
The set up cost is out of reach for many smaller / mid - sized nonprofits , and especially since the vendors require a minimum budget of $ 500,000 to have the right to purchase service .
Geoff also points out that text donations are limited to small donations and organizations do n't get the donor contact information , thus closing the door to ongoing engagement and relationship building not to mention potentially missing out on an important ROI - the lifetime value of a donor .
Geoff goes onto make a point that I find myself making over and over about the need to link the use of the tools to an overall communications and engagement strategy .
He also encourages nonprofits to look at other ways to incorporate the use of mobile technology as part of a communications strategy or program delivery .
( The place to look for lots of ideas and advice is MobileActive .
Allison Fine makes another good point : " It seems to me that relationship building with a first engagement being a cell phone number is going to be inherently difficult . "
Geoff ends his piece with a point about looking at other options which may be the only choice for the smaller nonprofits .
Recently , AppMakr rolled out its service that lets anyone create a iPhone app for less than $ 200 .
In fact , I created one for Beth 's Blog !
But be careful , I was asked a lot of questions about my blog 's audience size and reach and only after looking over my stats ( subscribers , page views , Twitter followers ) was my app accepted .
For me , the most interesting piece is looking to the future .
When will we see a Network for Good for text fundraising campaigns ?
What are some of the best practices for incorporating mobile into your communications and engagement tool box ?
ATHENS —
The commissioner for monetary affairs at the European Union , Olli Rehn , said on Monday that austerity measures announced by the Greek government to stave off a mounting fiscal crisis were “ in the right direction ” but not adequate to reduce a bloated budget deficit by 4 percent this year and tackle a debt crisis threatening the euro zone .
After talks with government and central bank officials in Athens , Mr. Rehn reassured Greece of the European Commission ’s support for its efforts to revive the reeling economy , but he stopped short of offering an emergency aid package .
He also called for additional austerity measures , in addition to the wage freezes and tax increases already announced by the Socialist government in Greece , but he did not specify what form these measures should take .
“ I want to encourage the government to announce additional measures , ” he said .
“ Either you control your debt , or your debt will control your economy , ” he added .
“ This is a crucial moment for your country , ” Mr. Rehn said .
“ Do not take these measures to please Brussels or other European partners but for the future of your country , for your schools and hospitals . ”
The U.S. Constitution is widely believed to have been written to limit the powers of the federal government and protect the rights of its citizens .
Inexplicably , this belief is held even by those who acknowledge that the constitutional convention was called for the express purpose of expanding the powers of the federal government , supposedly because the government under the Articles of Confederation was too weak .
That this was the purpose of the convention is not a disputed fact .
Nevertheless , most people who care at all about the Constitution continue to believe and promote the  Constitution as protector of rights  myth .
To the extent that the Constitution enumerates certain powers for the federal government , with all other powers assumed to be excluded , it does set some limits on government .
When one includes the first ten amendments of the Constitution , it also protects certain rights .
Indeed , the ninth amendment makes the very important point that the specific protections of certain rights does not in any way deny the existence of others , while the tenth amendment makes explicit the implied limitation to enumerated powers in the Constitution itself .
At first glance , the so - called  Bill of Rights  seems to confine government power within an airtight bottle , rendering it incapable of becoming a violator of rights instead of protector of them .
However , this theory does not hold up well under closer examination .
To begin with , the Constitution itself does not protect a single right other than habeas corpus , and that comes with a built - in exception .
What the Constitution does do is grant powers , and not just to a representative body , as the Articles of Confederation did , but to three separate branches .
That leaves it up to the Bill of Rights to serve the purpose of protecting our rights .
Generally , those ten amendments protect our rights under extraordinary circumstances , but not under ordinary circumstances .
More specifically , the Bill of Rights provides protections for the individual during situations of direct conflict with the federal government , such as when one is accused or convicted of a crime , when one is sued , on the occasion of troops being stationed in residential areas , or when one speaks out against the government or petitions it for redress of grievances .
The Anti-Federalist Pa ... Best Price : $ 1.48 Buy New $ 4.89 ( as of 04:45 EST - Details )
Make no mistake , these protections are vital and have provided protections for the people against government abuse of power many times in U.S. history .
However , they have proven ineffective against the slow , deliberate growth of government power under ordinary circumstances , when the specific conditions described in those amendments do not exist .
This is primarily due to the absence of protection , either in the Constitution or in any subsequent amendment , of the most important right of all : property .
By property ,  I do not mean exclusively or even primarily land ownership , although land ownership is one form of property .
By property ,  I mean all that an individual rightfully owns , including his mind , body , labor , and the fruits of his labor .
It is specifically the right to the fruits of ones labor that the Constitution fails entirely to protect .
In fact , it makes no attempt to do so whatsoever .
In the Constitution itself , the word property  appears only once , and that is in reference to property owned by the federal government ( an inauspicious start ) .
Nowhere does it make any mention of property owned by the citizens .
The Politically Incorr ... Thomas E. Woods Jr. Best Price : $ 1.51 Buy New $ 8.71 ( as of 06:15 EST - Details )
The document does grant the federal government the power to tax to pay the Debts and provide for the common defense and the general welfare of the United States . 
This is a strikingly unlimited scope for which the federal government may tax its citizens .
Arguments that taxes may only be collected to underwrite the subsequently enumerated powers have been struck down .
Sadly , those decisions have probably been correct .
While the power of the Congress to pass laws is explicitly limited to those necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers ,  no such language binds the power to tax .
The fact that the explicit limitation exists for lawmaking ( which Congress ignores anyway ) but not for taxation lends further weight to the argument that the Constitution grants Congress unlimited power to tax its citizens .
One can certainly make the argument that in 1789 , the term general welfare would have been interpreted much differently than it is today .
Indeed , one might assume that the term general welfare meant the general protection of each individuals rights .
Perhaps that is what many of the founders believed at the convention .
However , it is clear that Alexander Hamilton and his Federalists , the driving force behind calling the convention , had far different ideas about what the term general welfare meant .
Remember that for Hamilton , the purpose of government was not the protection of rights , but the realization of national greatness .
This could only be achieved at the expense of individual rights , primarily property rights .
So , the Constitution itself grants Congress unlimited power to tax and does not even mention , much less protect , the individual right to keep the fruits of ones labor .
Certainly the Bill of Rights addresses this deficiency , doesnt it ?
It does not .
Like the Constitution itself , the Bill of Rights is virtually silent on the central right of property .
Out of all ten amendments , the word property  appears in only one of them :
Lies the Government To ... Andrew P. Napolitano Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 4.46 ( as of 12:15 EST - Details )
 No person shall be held to answer for a capital , or otherwise infamous crime , unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury , except in cases arising in the land or naval forces , or in the Militia , when in actual service in time of War or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself , nor be deprived of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation . 
Unlike the congressional power to tax granted in the Constitution , the constitutional protections codified in the Fifth Amendment are severely limited to specific , extraordinary circumstances .
The entire Fifth Amendment is set in the context of criminal law , granting certain protections to the accused and / or convicted .
The phrase due process of law is a specific legal term that refers to those accused of a crime being given notice of the charges , opportunity to face their accusers , call witnesses in their defense , etc .
This was obviously the intent of this protection of property , rather than a general protection of property rights against taxation .
Even if one discards the clear intention of this clause of the Fifth Amendment and interprets due process of law more broadly , the amendment offers no more protection of property than if one interprets the clause narrowly .
Since the power to tax is an enumerated power , Congress would be following due process of law simply by levying the tax in the first place .
The last clause of the Fifth Amendment , regarding property taken  for public use ,  is similarly limited to extraordinary circumstances .
This clause undoubtedly refers to eminent domain , which is a grievous abuse of property rights , but certainly not one that affects a large percentage of the population .
Even here , no right is protected .
The clause merely requires the government to give the victim just compensation . 
There is no mention of the primary component of the right of property , consent .
A Return to Common Sense Thomas Mullen Best Price : $ 8.07 ( as of 10:47 EST - Details )
Furthermore , there is no mention of how just compensation is to be determined , although history has shown that the government itself determines what compensation is just arbitrarily .
In a free society , the value of property is determined by the price at which the owner is willing to exchange it .
However , since there is no requirement here of the owners consent , no such price determination can occur .
As for the remaining protections of property in the Constitution and Bill of Rights , there are none .
These two phrases , protecting property under only the most extraordinary circumstances are the length and breadth of the Constitutions involvement with this most fundamental right .
It is this deficiency that has allowed the federal government to grow into the monster that it is , concerned with virtually nothing but the redistribution of wealth .
If you believe the official myth about the Constitution , this might seem shocking .
After all , the document was drafted by the same people that had seceded from their nation and fought a long and bloody war primarily to defend their right to keep the fruits of their labor .
How could they draft a document to recreate their government , which they said only existed to secure their rights , and not only fail to secure the most important right , but actually empower their government to violate it with impunity ?
Certainly this was historys most colossal error .
However , when you consider the political platform of the Federalists , which included corporate welfare , monetary inflation , deficit spending , government debt , and militarism , all designed to maintain the wealth and power of a privileged elite at the expense of the rest of the citizenry , the unlimited power to tax and lack of protection of property seem less like error and more like deliberate intention .
Whenever the subject of  constitutional rights  ( a problematic term itself ) comes up , people reflexively refer to the right of free speech .
This is an important right , and one defended across the political spectrum .
However , free speech , freedom of the press , and the other rights protected by the Bill of Rights , without property rights , are inconsequential  the mere window dressing of liberty .
It is property that enables one to determine the course of ones own life .
Without it , the right to life is no right at all , but rather a privilege granted by those who own your labor .
George W. Bush was an enthusiastic supporter of the right of  free speech . 
During a town hall meeting , an average American who opposed Bushs policies rose and began hurling insults at the president , eliciting boos from the Bush - friendly audience .
Bush reprimanded the crowd , reminding them that this man had a right to speak his mind , even if they did not like what he had to say .
It was not the only time that he stood up for free speech .
This was no accident .
A government that has the unlimited power to seize the property of its citizens can afford to be magnanimous when it comes to free speech .
Yet , for the citizen who no longer owns the fruits of his own labor , the right to complain makes him no less a slave .

Can you really make a comparison between Google ’s new HTC - Nexus - One and Apple ’s iPhone - 3GS ?
Apple iPhone fans can’t await Apple ’s new iPhone 4G
The HTC Nexus One was introduced recently to rave reviews .
Some claim HTC could add more features to the Nexus One , which at present , are not working on Apple ’s iPhone 3GS .
“ Comparing the two smartphones is not fair . ”
First watch the video , which has been brought to us by PhoneArena .
This video compares the HTC Nexus One vs. iPhone 3GS
“ … so you can get a good idea of their similarities and differences , … ”
Apple iPhone 3GS and HTC Nexus One : Side by Side
The opinions still differ , some love their new HTC Nexus One phone and other would never swap their iPhone with any Android phone .
Image credits and more information to this comparison via PhoneArena
When Apple will release the iPhone 4G , will it kick and will it pass on the HTC Nexus One ?
Engadget has uncovered some new features on Apple ’s new iPhone OS 3.2
CoreGraphics to PDF API for sure , printer API is being prototyped
Spell checker in text fields and web views using AppleSpell multiple languages grammar checking ( English - only so far ) address book integration user added words SDK access Included dictionaries : Apple Dictionary , New Oxford American Dictionary , Oxford American Writer ’s Thesaurus , Shogakukan Daijisen , Shogakukan Progressive English - Japanese Japanese - English Dictionary , and Shogakukan Ruigo Reikai Jiten ( may also be used for a Dictionary app perhaps ? )
USB
Host support or expanded Bluetooth support PTP support for transferring images MobileStorageMounter ( perhaps used for PTP ; perhaps used to mount external USB storage ? )
Hardware keyboard : USBKeyboardLayouts.plist
Much richer text API including low - level access to font data and highlevel support for drawing formatted text
Support for querying attached screens and choosing which screen a window draws on ( App Store approved ? )
The beginnings of file upload in Safari
Location - sensitive ads are being prototyped in integrated Maps application ( and applications that use the maps framework )
Ability for applications to modify the standard cut / copy / paste menu
“ Handwriting keyboard ” is being prototyped .
via “ Confirmed : iPhone OS 3.2 has support for video calling , file downloads , and SMS ( update : handwriting keyboard ? ) ” ( Engadget )
What is your opinion will Apple fall behind Google , as shown with their latest coup the iPad , where people expected more features .
Rumour roundup about Apple ’s iPhone 4G new features
image via iphone - 4g - rumeurs
It is unbelievable that the iPad Ca n’t Play Flash Video .
Also , the possibility that the iPhone OS 3.2 is iPad-only makes it easier for the iPhone fan to wait a little while longer for more impressive features .
There is one big advantage that the Google ’s Android OS has against Apple ’s iPhone OS … Google ’s Android OS is open source .
Making the source available to all programmers and would be software developers , will lead to more developers , more inspiration and more features .
A very smart move in our humble opinion .
South Park has a track record of causing controversy Islamists have warned the creators of TV show South Park they could face violent retribution for depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a bear suit .
A posting on the website of the US - based group , Revolution Muslim , told Matt Stone and Trey Parker they would " probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh " .
The Dutch film - maker was shot and stabbed to death in 2004 by an Islamist angered by his film about Muslim women .
A subsequent episode of the cartoon bleeped out references to Muhammad .
Drug- snorting Buddha
The posting gave details about a home Stone and Parker reportedly co-own .
It also listed the addresses of their production office in California and the New York office of South Park 's broadcaster , Comedy Central .
" We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show , " warned the posting , written in the name of Abu Talhah Al - Amrikee .
" This is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them , " it added .
Mr al - Amrikee later told the Associated Press the posting was not an incitement to violence .
It had been published to raise awareness of the issue and to see that it did not happen again , he added .
This is not a threat , but a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them
Abu Talhah Al - Amrikee A Comedy Central spokesman said the network had no comment .
In the 200th episode of South Park , broadcast in the US and UK last week , Muhammad appeared several times inside a bear suit .
Figures from other religions were also depicted , including a drug- snorting Buddha and Jesus watching pornography .
Wednesday 's 201st episode saw any spoken references to Muhammad bleeped out , while a prominent banner stating " censored " was used in the programme .
The images of the prophet in a bear outfit were substituted with Santa Claus in the same costume .
Speaking in an interview with the Boing Boing website before the 200th show aired , the South Park team defended the scenes .
" We 'd be so hypocritical against our own message , our own thoughts , if we said , ' okay , well let 's not make fun of them because they wo n't hurt us , ' " said Parker .
" It matters to me when we talk about Muhammad that I can say we did this ... and I can stand behind that , " Stone added .
" I do n't think it 's going to change the world , but this is how it 's got to be for our show . "
In 2006 , Comedy Central banned Stone and Parker from showing an image of Muhammad in an episode that was intended to be part of a comment on the controversy caused by the publication of caricatures of the prophet by a Danish newspaper .
An earlier episode , Super - Best Friends ( 2001 ) , contained an image of Muhammad but passed without comment .
" It was before the Danish cartoon controversy , so it somehow is fine , " Stone told Boing Boing .
" Then , after that , now that 's the new normal .
We lost .
Something that was okay is now not okay . "
Muslims consider any physical representation of their prophet to be blasphemous .
The caricatures published in Denmark sparked mass protests worldwide .

At 2 AM on Saturday a 14 - year old black rhino carcass was found that in the Kwantu Game Reserve , which is only about 80 km from Port Elizabeth .
The rhino had been killed , then both of its ’ horns had been removed and the body and had been partially covered with sticks .
This particular rhino was a female with a one - year old weaning calf that rangers are trying to find in order to assess whether or not it needs continued weaning .
Rhino calves normally wean for eighteen months , so it is important that the calf be found sooner rather than later in order to increase its chances of survival .
An investigation into the killing is currently underway , and all game reserves in the area are on high alert in case more attacks are planned .

This being Easter Monday , what better way to celebrate than a column devoted to describing the flavour of assorted novelty snacks ?
It 's what Christ himself would 've wanted .
Although I suspect even the messiah himself might prefer crucifixion to the horror of tasting Walkers BBQ kangaroo crisps .
The moment the first sliver of fried potato hit his tongue , delivering its payload of marsupial flavouring , he 'd moan " forgive them father , for they know not what they do " through a mouthful of wet crumbs .
Last year 's " Do us a Flavour " campaign , in which the company launched six temporary new varieties , was eventually won by the hideous " Builder 's Breakfast " , which tasted like a fried egg in an envelope .
This year , they 're celebrating the World Cup by launching 15 – yes , 15 – new flavours , each ostensibly representing a different nation .
I was alerted to this exciting development by an email from Walker 's PR agency – I 'm presumably on their radar after reviewing the " Do Us a Flavour " varieties last year .
On that occasion , I went out and bought the crisps myself .
This time I 'd get them for free .
Following a brief phone call , a courier delivered a mock suitcase full of crisps to my door .
So you can view everything that follows as essentially free publicity for Walkers , albeit the kind of publicity that explicitly states that their new crisps taste revolting .
Well , most of them .
A couple of them are quite interesting , as you 'll see in a moment :
Japanese chicken teriyaki
The first ones I tried , and not a good start .
There 's no identifiable teriyaki element – just a whiff of chicken stock .
They should 've tried tackling a sushi - themed salmon - and - wasabi flavour .
Instead they 've created something that tastes about as authentically Japanese as Lenny Henry .
Cowards .
Scottish haggis
After a bad start , another step down .
These tasted of nothing , yet somehow managed to make that " nothing " deeply unpleasant .
It 's like a small piece of fried potato failing to recall a repressed abuse memory while sitting on your tongue .
Argentinian flame - grilled steak
At last a vague stab at accuracy : there 's a faint whiff of steak , although identifying the " flame - grilled " aspect would require a leap of the imagination so vast you might as well use it to imagine something more exciting , like sex with a movie star or a holiday on Venus .
Still : the Argentinians take the lead .
English roast beef and yorkshire pudding
Did Rio Ferdinand create this himself ?
The beef hits you first : not dreadful , but quickly overpowered by the oleaginous " yorkshire pudding " element .
The result is a mixture of cold Sunday roast and stale grease : like inhaling from a pub dustbin on Monday morning .
Also , it 's surely not wise to use the word " roast " in any product that notionally represents the England World Cup squad .
It 's not looking good for our boys .
German bratwurst sausage
Ah .
These actually taste like sausages .
Not suitable for vegetarians either .
Glancing at the ingredients reveals no pork , although they do contain the downright sinister " poultry extract " .
What exactly is " poultry extract " ?
And how is it " extracted " ?
Walkers must tell us .
Preferably in the form of a televised re-enactment starring Gary Lineker .
Dutch edam / Welsh rarebit
Yeah , whatever : these are both just " cheese flavour " .
The former is mild , but still tastes more like " real " cheese than edam itself does .
The rarebit offering tastes like a flattened Wotsit with a splash of Worcestershire sauce .
Perhaps that 's a traditional Welsh dish too .
South African sweet chutney
South African what ?
They 've made this one up , surely .
It 's actually OK - ish : a bit like spicy ketchup flavour .
Italian spaghetti bolognese / Brazilian salsa
Tomato time .
These both taste like scratch 'n ' sniff pizza aroma : a lame committee meeting of watered - down herbs .
The " Brazilian salsa " has a slightly more sugary feel , but otherwise I could n't tell the difference .
My face was openly sobbing by this point , mind .
Spanish chicken paella
It would 've been fun to annoyed the Spanish by releasing " maltreated donkey " or " slaughtered bull " flavours instead , but no : chicken paella it is .
Amazingly , these actually taste like rice .
And slightly like chicken .
But they do n't taste like chicken paella : more like chicken fried rice .
Maybe Walkers were expecting China to qualify .
Irish stew
No .
French garlic baguette
Garlic Bread diluted by a factor of approximately 10,000 .
So weak and ineffectual , it 's almost homeopathic .
They missed a trick : a novelty " snail " or " frog 's legs " flavour would at least have grim curiosity value , much like . . .
Australian BBQ kangaroo
See ?
You want to know what these taste like , do n't you ?
A : watery barbecue sauce with a dim hint of meat .
There 's no actual kangaroo in them , so the " kangaroo " is delivered entirely by your subconscious .
They could call it " boiled pilot 's leg " and the effect would be similar .
American cheeseburger
By far the most interesting entry , if only for the sake of accuracy : these precisely capture that instantly recognizable McDonald 's aroma .
Not Burger King .
Not Wendy's .
McDonald's .
If they were an official McDonald 's product , you 'd begrudgingly admire their authenticity .
Instead , you 're left wondering whether Walkers will get sued .
So that 's the lot .
If these crisps are in any way representative of their associated national squads , the World Cup itself will be an underwhelming kickaround which the US will eventually win on points .
Presumably the company 's crisp technicians are already working on a series of stunt flavours to honour the 2012 Olympics .
Here 's hoping they steer clear of yet more bastardised takes on national dishes and go for topicality instead .
How about American tea party flavour ?
Iranian uranium ?
Chinese dissident ?
Give it your best shot , Walkers , and with any luck you 'll start a war .

The city 's auditor general should probe the Toronto Transit Commission 's books to judge whether taxpayers are getting good value , says Toronto Board of Trade president Carol Wilding .
Both transit costs and fares are going up too much , Wilding told members of the city budget committee Monday .
The taxpayer subsidy for transit including Wheel - Trans is likely to top $ 500 million in 2010 , while fares increased 25 cents a ride on Jan.
3 .
" Torontonians do n't feel they 're getting value for money from the TTC , " Wilding said in a presentation on the city 's proposed $ 9.2 billion budget for 2010 .
The board wants Toronto 's auditor general to analyze transit spending , not because financial shenanigans are suspected , but to provide an impartial assessment , she said .
" That 's what they 're there for , so call on them .
That 's a resource .
Let 's understand what 's going on . "
Wilding said the city could also implement a strict hiring freeze and curb discretionary purchases , but she focused on transit costs in a sometimes testy exchange with city councillors who sit on the budget committee .
Councillor Joe Mihevc , who is also vice - chair of the TTC , tried to get Wilding to agree that transit costs grew because service was increased outside rush hour .
A Warden Ave. bus running on Sunday night has fewer passengers , earning less fare revenue , than a packed Bathurst bus in a weekday rush hour , Mihevc said .
" The reason why it is not as efficient is because we 've actually expanded the hours of service in areas of the city and on routes that do n't make as much return from people paying in the fare box , " he said .
Mihevc said in an interview that he was taken aback by the request for the auditor general to probe the TTC .
" This is the first I 've heard from the board of trade that they want the TTC 's books audited , " he said .
" Frankly , I 'm feeling like this is gang - up - and - pile - on - the - TTC month . "
The auditor general develops his own work plan every year and a two - thirds vote of council is required to unilaterally add to it .
Mihevc said transit groups in North America have a high regard for the TTC .
" Yes , we 've have increased expenses .
The union wage rate has gone up if you count benefits as well , fuel prices have gone up , we 've increased ridership , which means increased costs .

" We 've introduced a massive amount of new service , more than at any time since the 1970s , primarily in off - peak hours .
It creates the comprehensive transit system within the city that you need .
It 's an investment . "
City council can ask the auditor general to probe any aspect of the city 's services and finances , but such a request is not binding .
Why work when I can get £ 42,000 in benefits a year AND drive a Mercedes ?
The Davey family 's £ 815 - a - week state handouts pay for a four - bedroom home , top - of - the - range mod cons and two vehicles including a Mercedes people carrier .
Father - of - seven
Peter gave up work because he could make more living on benefits .
Yet he and his wife Claire are still not happy with their lot .
With an eighth child on the way , they are demanding a bigger house , courtesy of the taxpayer .
The Davey family claim £ 42,000 a year in welfare benefits
' It 's really hard , ' said Mrs Davey , 29 , who is seven months pregnant .
' We can't afford holidays and I do n't want my kids living on a council estate and struggling like I have .
' The price of living is going up but benefits are going down .
My carer 's allowance is only going up by 80 p this year and petrol is so expensive now , I 'm worried how we 'll cope .
' We 're still waiting for somewhere bigger . '
Mrs Davey has never had a full - time job while her 35 - year - old husband gave up his post in administration nine years ago after realising they would be better off living off the state .
At their semi on the Isle of Anglesey , the family have a 42in flatscreen television in the living room with Sky TV at £ 50 a month , a Wii games console , three Nintendo DS machines and a computer - not to mention four mobile phones .
With their income of more than £ 42,000 a year , they run an 11 - seater minibus and the seven - seat automatic Mercedes .
But according to the Daveys they have nothing to be thankful for .
' It does n't bother me that taxpayers are paying for me to have a large family , ' added Mrs Davey .
' We could n't afford to care for our children without benefits , but as long as they have everything they need , I do n't think I 'm selfish .
' Most of the parents at our kids ' school are on benefits . '
She added : ' I do n't feel bad about being subsidised by people who are working .
I 'm just working with the system that 's there .
' If the government wants to give me money , I 'm happy to take it .
We get what we 're entitled to .
I do n't put in anything because I do n't pay taxes , but if I could work I would . '
The couple met in a pub 13 years ago .
A year later , at the age of 17 , Mrs Davey gave birth to Jessica , now 12 .
The full feature appears in this week 's Closer magazine , on sale now .
She was followed by Jade , ten , Jamie - Anne , eight , Harriet , six , Adele , four , the couple 's only son Tie , three , and Mercedes , two .
' It cost too much to carry on working as we were actually better off unemployed , ' said Mr Davey .
In addition to income support , housing benefit , child tax credits and a council tax discount , the couple receive carer 's allowance and disability living allowance for Tie , who suffers from a severe skin disorder .
Despite filing for bankruptcy 18 months ago after racking up £ 20,000 of debt on mail order catalogues they still insist on splashing out on four presents per child at birthdays and last Christmas spent £ 2,000 on gifts alone .
' Santa is always generous in our house , ' said Mrs Davey , who once applied to join the police but was turned down .
She insists her husband would do any job 'as long as we could still afford the lifestyle we have now ' .
Mrs Davey , who spends £ 160 a week at Tesco , says she does not intend to stop at eight children .
Her target is 14 .
And she adds : ' I 've always wanted a big family - no one can tell me how many kids I can have whether I 'm working or not . '

“ We have felt intimidated and restricted from enjoying our own properties , enjoying any social activities with friends outdoors for fear of police presence and possible citations based on previous experiences . ”

“ My yard is not their toilet , our streets are not their bar , our yards are not their dumpster .
We are not campus , we are a residential area . ”
Nearly 50 students attended a University City City Council meeting on Monday night to express frustration over the increasing frequency of University City Police Department ’s enforcement of noise violations .
The students were responding to a rapid rise in citations and arrests of Wash .
U. students in recent months as a result of a newly enacted zero - tolerance policy for noise complaints — a policy under which University City police issue a summons whenever they respond to a reported disturbance .
The majority of the noise violations are concentrated in the area north of campus on Kingsbury Boulevard , Washington Avenue and Kingsland Avenue .
These streets are shared with University City residents who are not affiliated with the University .
According to Joseph von Kaenel , a resident of the Ames Place neighborhood since 1972 , student disruptions have always been a problem in the neighborhood but the issue has come to a head in recent years because student behavior has become increasingly disruptive .
“ The situation has gotten worse because there has not been sufficiently rigorous law enforcement , ” von Kaenel said .
At the council meeting , seven students presented personal testimony describing occasions when they felt their rights were violated by the police department since the policy was enacted in March .
Neighbors countered these stories with their own anecdotes of how they are constantly kept up by noise at all hours of the night .
Seniors Wyatt Crane and Andrew Weisberg decided to mobilize students to make their voices heard and to strike a compromise with the city over what they feel is an extreme zero - tolerance policy .
The students asked the city to appoint a committee of permanent residents and students to review the policy and deal with ongoing relations .
Prior to the meeting , Crane and Weisberg stressed to students in attendance that their stance was not to attack the positions or responsibilities of the mayor ’s office , the police department or residents .
“ Our position is simply that the zero - tolerance policy bound these officers ’ hands and did n’t let them use the discretion they should have been able to use , ” Weisberg said .
“ This is not about bashing UCPD , this is not about bashing the mayor ’s office .
This is simply showing that we are an organized group , and we should be respected as such , and we should have a voice at the table . ”
The students said that while they should be held accountable for unruly and disruptive behavior , they have been issued citations for behavior that was not disorderly .
Emily Dunn , a junior , spoke at the meeting and said that she and her friends were playing Wiffle ball in the lawn of a Washington Avenue apartment at 2 p.m. when the police came and asked them to stop playing because of noise .
The police officers searched for suspicious behavior for half an hour before recommending that the group of students disband .
“ Although they did acknowledge that there was no illegal behavior going on , [ the police ] did encourage us to disperse from the area and perhaps relocate indoors silently somewhere , ” Dunn said .
“ We obliged , and as a result , in the past few weeks with beautiful weather outside , we have felt intimidated and restricted from enjoying our own properties , enjoying any social activities with friends outdoors for fear of police presence and possible citations based on previous experiences . ”
Dunn added that the zero - tolerance policy has impacted not only students ’ social lives but also their “ personal privacy . ”
Senior Aaron Bodansky said that he and two friends were stopped by a detective on the way to the Delmar Loop for “ laughing too loudly ” on Melville Avenue at 10 p.m. on a Friday .
The detective , according to Bodansky , asked the students to put their hands behind their backs and sit on the sidewalk .
The detective then called in two backup police cars and performed full background checks on all of the students .
“ I felt threatened .
It was scary , I was n’t able to talk , I was detained for an excessive amount of time , ” Bodansky said at the council meeting .
“ I just wanted to share this with you because I did n’t feel like I had done anything out of line and I felt that the police response due to this new policy has made it very uncomfortable for me to be walking my neighborhood at night . ”
But Kingsbury resident Mondi Ghasedi said at the meeting that even laughing and talking on cell phones echo , and disturb her and other residents .
“ Walking up the street laughing might not seem like anything to you , but our entire subdivision is composed of brick buildings , ” Ghasedi said .
“ It echoes .
You might as well be in my bedroom screaming next to my bed . ”
Since its implementation , Ghasedi said , the zero - tolerance policy has been effective in reducing the noise in the area .
“ For the first time ever on a warm night I have actually slept through a night on Thursday , Friday or Saturday , ” Ghasedi said .
“ The only thing our police officers are doing is enforcing the law . ”
Ghasedi said that when she moved into her home 10 years ago , graduate students filled most of the neighboring occupancies .
Now , she says , students urinate on her lawn and vandalize her property .
“ My yard is not their toilet , our streets are not their bar , our yards are not their dumpster , ” she said .
“ We are not a campus ; we are a residential area . ”
It is unclear whether the police incidents that students shared at the meeting were the intentions of the zero - tolerance policy or if these represent aberrant , extreme instances .
During the meeting , neither city officials nor Ames Place residents addressed the incidents raised by students , but noted that the police should be commended for doing their job .
After the meeting , however , University City Mayor Joe Adams said that college students are targeted because they fit a profile of individuals with whom problems have been reported in the past .
To convey this point , Adams relayed an anecdote of President Barack Obama being stopped by airport security and extensively searched before he was president “ just by looking different . ”
“ It does n’t make it right or wrong , I ’m not saying that , ” Adams said .
“ But that ’s just the nature of the beast . ”
Cheryl Adelstein , director of community relations at the University , said that although disorderly behavior has been on the increase this year , the perpetrators actually represent only a small portion of the student body .
She said she receives two to 10 complaints from neighborhood residents every weekend .
“ The levels of vandalism and disrespect seem to be increasing , and I think the residents could n’t tolerate it anymore , ” Adelstein said .
“ Ultimately I think dialogue needs to happen between the students , police department and the citizens of the neighborhood . ”
Although there was no clear resolution by the end of the meeting , the city government expressed openness to dialogue with the students and to the idea of the proposed council .
But they stood firm in their position to ensure peace and quiet for the residents .
“ I want to thank the police force , police chief and Washington University for enforcing the policy , ” Councilman Terry Crow said .
“ I still believe that the residents have the right to enjoy the peace and quiet of their homes , to raise their kids and to enjoy you as neighbors and to enjoy peace and quiet . ”

There 's something so terribly wrong about this :
Oxford High School , a school in Calhoun County , Ala. , prom dress codes are strictly enforced .
Some say too strictly .
This year , the Anniston Star reports that 25 students were disciplined for violating the prom dress code .
The strangest part of the story , though , is that the students were allowed to stay at the prom , but the following week , they had to choose the option of receiving corporal punishment ( by paddling ) or a three - day suspension .
Keep in mind , these are seniors in high school .
While I would n't be wearing the dress in the video , I would n't view it as too short or too low cut for a prom , but that 's almost beside the point .
Dress code or not , if any school principal laid a finger on my high school daughter -- or a paddle , for that matter -- I would yank her out of that school so fast heads would spin .
Yes , I know they get around it by saying there 's a choice for a 3 - day suspension , but I also know that a 3 - day suspension can really screw up grades and standing records , especially in one 's senior year .
My high school sophomore daughter would be mortified at being punished for what she chose to wear to a school dance .
What message does paddling send to students , anyway ?
I do n't see a deterrent effect when 25 kids are cited and punished for clothes their parents let them wear to a formal occasion despite the long - standing paddling policy .
It just seems ... bizarre .
In a day and age where schools seek parental involvement , what message is intended for parents when their son or daughter is paddled or suspended for choosing to wear something which received approval , whether tacit or outright ?
As a parent , I 'm not going to be inclined to jump into the midst of a maelstrom of volunteerism at a school where the principal just paddled ( or suspended ) my almost - adult child .
I have n't even touched on the more obvious reasons why this arcane and stupid policy should die , like the obvious weirdness of administering physical blows to a student who is months away from living in an adult world where we do n't " paddle " one another .
Or the idea of using violence to teach lessons .
Or even just the vaguely kinky sexual undertones .
Or the fact that the principal is white and the student they interviewed was black .
Yes , I know it 's Alabama .
That 's no excuse .
People who are raised in Alabama do have to live in society like the rest of us .
The idea of paddling any of these kids leaves me feeling a little creeped out and slimed .
The male pirates of Lost Planet 2 multiplayer are generally covered head - to - toe in protective body armor .
The females ?
Not so much .
Someone 's going to lose an underboob .
I mean , I could understand the desire to show a little bit of skin .
Otherwise you wind up with fully - armored females that only look slightly different from fully - armored males , and that 's no fun .
Still , nothing good can come of going into combat wearing only bikini bottoms and a shirt that barely conceals your nipples .

And yes , that goes for men as well .
Cover up those nipples !
Some might say Jon Brumit overpaid when he stumped up $ 100 ( £ 65 ) for a whole house .
Drive through Detroit neighbourhoods once clogged with the cars that made the city the envy of America and there are homes to be had for a single dollar .
You find these houses among boarded - up , burnt - out and rotting buildings lining deserted streets , places where the population is shrinking so fast entire blocks are being demolished to make way for urban farms .
" I was living in Chicago and a friend told me that houses in Detroit could be had for $ 500 , " said Brumit , a financially strapped artist who thought he had little prospect of owning his own property .
" I said if you hear of anything just a little cheaper let me know .
Within a week he emails me a photo of a house for $ 100 .
I thought that 's just crazy .
Why not ?
It 's a way to cut our expenses way down and kind of open up a lot of time for creative projects because we 're not working to pay the rent . "
Houses on sale for a few dollars are something of an urban legend in the US on the back of the mortgage crisis that drove millions of people from their homes .
But in Detroit it is no myth .
One in five houses now stand empty in the city that launched the automobile age , forged America 's middle - class and blessed the world with Motown .
Detroit has been in decline for decades ; its falling population is now well below a million – half of its 1950 peak .
But the recent mortgage crisis and the fall of the big car makers into bankruptcy has pushed the town into a realm unique among big cities in America .
A third of the population are unemployed .
Property prices have fallen 80 % or more in large parts of Detroit over the last three years .
The average price of a home sold in the city last year has been put at $ 7,500 ( £ 4,900 ) .
The recent financial crash forced wholesale foreclosures among people unable to pay their mortgages or who walked away from houses that fell to a fraction of the value of the loans they had taken out on them .
Banks are selling off properties in the worst neighbourhoods , which are usually surrounded by empty and wrecked housing , for a few dollars each .
But even better houses can be had at a fraction of their former value .
Technically , Brumit paid $ 95 for the land and $ 5 for the house on Lawley Street – which fitted what estate agents euphemistically call an opportunity .
Brumit said : " It had a big hole in the roof from the fire department putting out the last of two arson attempts .
Both previous owners tried to set it on fire to get out of the mortgages .
So there 's a big hole about 24ft long and the plumbing had almost entirely been ripped out and most of the electrics too .
It was basically a smoke damaged , structurally intact shell with a snowdrift in the attic . "
Setting fire to houses to claim the insurance and kill off the mortgage is not uncommon in Detroit ; a blackened , wooden corpse of a house sits at the bottom of Brumit 's street .
But it is more common for owners to just walk away from their homes and mortgages .
On the opposite side of Lawley Street Jim Feltner and his workers were clearing out a property seized by a bank .
" I used to be a building contractor .
I was buying up places and doing them up .
Now I empty out foreclosures .
I do one or two of these a day all over the city , " he said .
" I 've been in Detroit 40 years and I 've watched the peak up to $ 100,000 for houses that right now are n't worth more than $ 20,000 tops .
I own a bunch of properties .
I have 10 rentals and I can't get nothing for them , and they 're beautiful homes . "
Feltner 's workers are dragging clothes , boots and furniture out of the bedrooms and living room , and dumping them in the front yard until a skip arrives .
Kicked to one side is a box of 1970s Motown records .
A teddy bear lies spreadeagled on the floor .
" You could get about five grand for this place , " said Feltner .
" Nice house once you clean it out .
All the plumbing and electricals are in it .
Roof do n't leak . "
Brumit said a man called Jesse lived there .
" Jesse had mentioned that he was probably going to get out of there because he knew he could buy a place for so much less than he owed .
That 's a drag .
You do n't want to see people leaving , " he said .
The house next door is abandoned .
On the next street , one third of the properties are boarded up .
It 's a story replicated across Detroit .
Joan Wilson , an estate agent in the north - west of the city , whose firm is offering a three - bedroom house on Albany street for $ 1 , says that more than half of the houses she sells are foreclosures in the tens of thousands of dollars .
" The vast majority of people that call to enquire , almost the first thing out of their mouth is that they want to buy a foreclosure .
I have had telephone calls from people looking online that live , for example , in England or California , who 've never set foot in the area .
They 're calling about one specific house they see online .
I tell them they need to look at the neighbourhood .
Is it the only house standing within a mile ? "
But what is blight to some is proving an opportunity to remake parts of the city for others living there .
The Old Redford part of Detroit has suffered its share of desolation .
The police station , high school and community centre are closed .
Yet the area is being revitalised , led by John George , a resident who began by boarding up an abandoned house used by drug dealers 21 years ago and who now heads the community group Blight Busters .
They are pulling down housing that cannot be saved and creating community gardens with fresh vegetables free for anyone to pick .
" There 's longstanding nuisance houses , been around seven , eight , nine years .
We will go in without a permit and demolish them without permission , " said George .
" If you , as an owner , are going to leave something like that to fester in my neighbourhood , obviously you either do n't care or are n't in a position to take responsibility for your property , so we 're going to take care of it for you . "
Blight Busters has torn down more than 200 houses , including recently an entire block of abandoned housing in Old Redford .
" We need to right - size this community , which means removing whole blocks , and building farms , larger gardens , putting in windmills .
We want to downsize – right - size – Detroit , " George said .
Houses that can be rescued are done up with grants from foundations .
" Detroit has some of the nicest housing stock in the country .
Brick , marble , hardwood floors , leaded glass .
These houses were built for kings , " George added .
" We gave a $ 90,000 house to a lady who was living in a car .
She had four children .
It did n't cost her a dime .
We had over a thousand people apply for it .
It 's probably worth $ 35,000 now . "
Old Redford is seeing piecemeal renewal .
One abandoned block of shops has been converted to an arts centre and music venue with cafes .
One of the few remaining cinemas in Detroit – and one that 's among the last in the US with an original pipe organ – has been revived and is showing Breakfast at Tiffany's .
Brumit calculates that he has spent $ 1,500 to buy and do up his house , principally by scavenging demolition sites .
He will move in with his wife and four - month - old child once it is complete , probably in the summer .
He said : " The Americans we know got ripped off by the American dream .
But [ the renovation ] is the most like moving out of the country that we can actually do .
We 're the minority in terms of ethnicity and this is a rich environment … there 's 30 % open space in the city and that does n't include the buildings that should be torn down .
You 're in a city riding your bike around and you hear birds and stuff .
It 's incredible . "
I hate reading the ads that marketing companies post over some urinals .
I would much rather have something else to look at — like a skyline view .
Here ’s a round - up of 13 of the world ’s best ( urinal ) views .
Probably the most dramatic is the view inside the headquarters of Frankfurt ’s Commerzbank .
It just screams “ power . ”
This shot of the urinal in Hong Kong ’s Felix Hotel is blurry , but still noteworthy .
Who said the best views had to be from skyscrapers ?
This view from Ecuador ’s eco-friendly Black Sheep Inn is pretty breathtaking .
This is from the Forty One , which I believe is in NYC . is in Sydney , Australia .
There are no buildings to obstruct a wide field of vision looking out from Melbourne ’s Sofitel Hotel ( here ’s another view ) .
Aboard the Norwegian Star , the sunsets are awesome .
The views on this Croatian ferry are pretty cool , too .
The views from Tokyo ’s Mandarin Oriental are good , ( though people like to stand around in the facilities ) .
Personally , I really enjoy this rustic view from South Africa ’s Kaapsche Hoop , ( and here ’s the actual view of the waterfalls that you can see through that window ) .
Though the door reads “ urinal , ” I do n’t think it is , technically .
Nevertheless , the view is just too good to pass up .
This is from the water ’s edge in Belize ( and do n’t miss the view looking down ) .
Seems kinda pointless , huh ?
How Obama keeps busy on Air Force One
WEST WING MORNING BRIEFING
By Michael D. Shear
The president 's official schedule for today is pretty thin .
He takes off from LAX at 8:40 a.m. Pacific time to return home from his Los Angeles fundraising trip .
He lands at Andrews Air Force Base at 4:05 p.m. Eastern time .
That 's it .
That 's the schedule .
So it got us to wondering : what , exactly , does the president do on Air Force One during long , boring flights across the country ?
Unlike the rest of us , he 's not crammed in a middle seat in coach .
And , unlike regular folk , he can does n't have to turn off all electronic equipment when he 's taking off .
But he still has to fill six long hours in the air .
According to Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton , here 's how he fills it :
* Receiving briefings from staff about events that he will participate in when he lands .
( There are actually a couple of conference rooms , complete with swivel chairs , in the plane . )
* Reading issue briefings and other various materials .
( No word from Burton on whether those " other various materials " might include People Magazine . )
* Reading newspapers or surfing the web for news .
( Meanwhile , the small tail section of the plane reserved for the press has no Internet access .
How fair is that ? )
* Calls staff and world leaders .
( The president 's BlackBerry does n't work up in the air , but the plane has several old - fashioned - looking phones that do .
Burton recalls the recent phone call to Chinese President
Hu that took an extra half hour to complete after Obama landed . )
* Occasionally watching movies or television shows .
( Air Force One has a decent library of the latest movies , and a satellite dish to watch live television .
Burton says the president has been known to switch on " Treme , " a new HBO show about the rebuilding of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina . )
* Has lately been playing cards ( spades ) on long or late flights .
( Spades .
Right .
Good thing Burton clarified that , since the president is known as a pretty good poker player as well . )
In the past , we 've challenged you to show us what science class would look like if it were taught by Hollywood .
This week , we asked you to imagine an even more monumentally horrifying scenario for the future : a world where the internet was in charge of the entire curriculum .
The winner is below , but first the runners up ...

We are truly living in interesting times .
Religious skepticism has captured the interest of major local newspapers .
Almost every week , articles expressing skepticism about the core tenets of Christianity are getting published in our dailies , sparking much debate .
In his article ‘ Did Jesus Really Resurrect ’ published on Sunday April 4th 2010 in the Sunday Monitor , Robert Kalumba writes :
It ’s these inconsistencies in the resurrection story told by the gospels that have raised the question of whether Jesus really rose from the dead .
Some argue that the different story variations , whereas they raise some eyebrows , if read carefully only enhance the fact that the son of man actually rose from the dead .
They argue that the gospels differ on the actual events but tell a similar story all through – that Jesus resurrected .
However , some point at the inaccuracies that spread even to Jesus ’ ascendency to heaven and argue that they are more than “ small variations ” in the resurrection story .
According to Mark 16 ; 14 - 19 , Jesus ascended to heaven while He and the disciples were seated at a table in Jerusalem .
But the Gospel of Matthew does n’t mention Jesus ’ ascension to heaven at all .
Now for such an event to fail to get mention in a gospel that talks about Jesus ’ life is kind of odd .
Same goes for the gospel according to John .
No mention of such an event whatsoever .
According to the gospel of Luke , Jesus actually ascended to heaven on the same day of His resurrection ( Luke24 ; 50 - 51 ) but John claims he ascended 40 days after his resurrection and not at a table as stated by the Gospel of Matthew , but from the Mount of Olives !
These are some serious contradictions .
If the gospels ca n’t get it right on Jesus ’ story , should we believe the accuracy of His resurrection ?
Meanwhile Kevin O’Connor , on Sunday , March 14th 2010 , in his article ‘ Missionaries brought already damaged goods to Uganda ’ , also in the Sunday Monitor , wrote :
Darwin described the processes of evolution and natural selection which , by inference , drove a “ cart and horses through ” ( i.e. showed as nonsense ) important parts of the Bible ’s Old Testament , such as Adam and Eve.
Kevin ’s conversion :
This triumph of science and reason over religious superstition meant that 20 years later , when Father Lourdel and Brother Amans arrived here , the missionaries were bringing already damaged goods to Uganda .
115 years after Father Lourdel , Roving Eye , arrived in Uganda .
At that time , I was an agnostic ( someone who is not sure whether there is a God or not ) .
Uganda , however , converted me from an agnostic into an atheist ( someone who believes there is no God ) .
Where was God : Uganda is the most church - going country I have ever lived in , yet also the most corrupt .
In other words , going to church and the influence of Christian prayer and preaching seem to do little to reduce corrupt “ eating ” .
The Rwandan Genocide took place a few months before my arrival .
So where was God during this genocide and during the Nazi Holocaust , the 2006 Asian Tsunami , the Haitian and Chilean earthquakes etc ?
Asleep ?
Gone for lunch ?
On holiday ?
Otherwise engaged ?
Wow .
Are these stories actually running in Ugandan news media ?
Yes .
It is indeed encouraging to see that we are moving into an era where religious skepticism is not only being tolerated , but is growing in popularity , and creating an atmosphere of healthy debate .
Cool !
There been some rumors of a Palm buyout over the years , but now it appears that Lenovo and even HTC may be putting in a bid to buy the company .
Palm ’s stock has risen over 12 % as of this morning .
An unnamed Chinese newspaper is said to be the source of this rumor .
HTC has not confirmed or denied the rumor , however Palm ’s CEO Jon Rubinstein said , “ If there is a reasonable acquisition proposal , the Board will consider . ”
Palm is currently worth less than a tenth of HTC ’s value and HTC should be able to acquire the company just for cash .
Palm also has over 1,650 patents , as well as WebOS .

Police say a 22 - year - old man has been killed trying to ride a wheelie bin down a hill on the New South Wales central coast .
Officers say the man was lying on the bin with a 19 - year - old on top of him when they hit a gutter at Umina Beach overnight .
He was thrown into a tree and died of massive head injuries .
The other man has been taken to hospital with broken ribs and internal injuries .
" They travelled a distance of about 300 metres before they lost control and collided with the curb , " said Acting Police Inspector Bruce Coates .
" Both people were thrown from the bin .
The 22 - year - old man struck his head on a tree .
" Friends and witnesses tried to assist with life support at the scene .
However , he was pronounced deceased at Gosford Hospital . "
Inspector Coates says they were part of a group that was riding stolen wheelie bins at Umina Beach .
" A group of young people just decided they would take some rubbish bins and have a bit of a ride down this hill , " he said .
" This was the second bin to travel down on the night .
A gentlemen went down on a bin by himself immediately prior to this and he made the ride without being injured . "
Inspector Coates say the man who died had been drinking .
" This is something that perhaps could have been avoided , young people doing something they should n't have been doing , " he said .
" It is a tragedy .
It 's a terrible thing for the families and the people involved .
Obviously riding rubbish bins down public streets is not something you should be doing . "
The most intense flashes of lightning can do more than just light up the sky : Lightning sometimes acts as a natural particle accelerator , firing beams of electrons at high speeds toward space , a new study says .
To start the accelerator , a powerful lightning strike needs to coincide with a burst of cosmic rays — high - energy particles coming from space .
( See recent pictures of lightning created in the ash plume of an Iceland volcano . )
When cosmic rays enter our atmosphere , they strip electrons off air molecules .
If a strong lightning bolt happens at the same time , it acts as an electric field , triggering an electron " avalanche " that launches the stray particles skyward in a narrow beam .
Particle Accelerators Form Every Ten Minutes ?
Scientists have speculated since 1925 that thunderstorms might create such natural particle accelerators .
But until now , no one had managed to detect them .
" The beam of particles is very narrow , and the likelihood of a satellite being in the right place at the right time to spot such a thing is very slim , " explained Martin Füllekrug , a lightning researcher from the University of Bath in the U.K .
Instead , Füllekrug and colleagues used ground - based instruments in thunderstorm - prone southern France to look for transient airglows , or sprites .
These fast - moving bursts of light have been linked to strong lightning bolts .
Near some sprites , the team also found radio waves in 310 - mile - wide ( 500 - kilometer - wide ) bands — and these radio waves were most likely being emitted by high - speed particle beams .
The readings indicated that natural accelerators were being created high in the storm , about 25 miles ( 40 kilometers ) above Earth 's surface .
Around one in every thousand lightning flashes might create the phenomenon , added Füllekrug , who presented his findings last week at the 2010 Royal Astronomical Society 's National Astronomy Meeting in Glasgow .
Fullekrug estimates that a thunderstorm somewhere on Earth is producing a natural particle accelerator every five to ten minutes .
The particle beams pose no danger to people on the ground , and they stop at the edge of Earth 's atmosphere , he noted , so they should n't affect astronauts .
But it 's possible the beams could impact low orbiting satellites on rare occassions .
Lightning no Match for the LHC
The energy levels detected in the natural particle accelerators were typically around 10,000 electron volts ( eV ) with a maximum of around 30 million eV .
By contrast , human - made accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) can fire beams of particles at energies as high as seven trillion eV .
( Related : " Large Hadron Collider Smashes Protons , Sets Record . " )
Atom smashers such as the LHC also fire beams in a vacuum , since air molecules tend to bump particles off their proscribed paths .
The lightning - triggered beams somehow occur in the gases of our atmosphere , offering scientists a rare opportunity to study how such beams stay stable outside a vacuum .
" Natural particle accelerators are particularly interesting , because they are the only places where electron avalanches in a gas can be observed .
We can't do this kind of experiment in a lab or man-made particle accelerator , " Füllekrug said .
" However , natural particle acclerators certainly can't replace man-made ones , as there are many experiments that can still only be carried out in a man-made accelerator like the LHC . "
HPD Crime Data - Murder
Thursday , January 1 , 2009 through Thursday , December 31 , 2009
Click on the red icons for crime details .
Mexico is bracing itself for communications chaos tomorrow , with some 24 m mobile phone lines due to be disconnected as part of a government crackdown on organised crime .
The government announced today that only around 71 % of the 83.5 m mobile lines in Mexico had been logged with a new register , and that the disconnection of the rest was set to begin .
The register was designed to help combat the use of mobiles in crimes such as kidnapping and phone extortions threatening violence unless the victim hands over some cash .
But confusion and organisational disarray have marred the plan .
Despite plenty of coverage of the issue in the press in the last few weeks , many Mexicans were unaware of an obligation to submit their data before the deadline of midnight on Saturday , or they simply failed to get around to registering .
Some mobile phone owners also refused to send the required text message with their personal information on the grounds that they saw the register as an affront to their civil liberties .
" I did n't register mine because I do n't trust the government , " said one student , César Correa as he hurried along a Mexico City avenue .
" They say it is for our security but I believe it is a measure to control society . "
Others pointed out that criminals could easily get around the new controls , either by using stolen phones or registering their own using different identities .
" It is pointless , " said a hospital porter , Gerardo Morales , who nevertheless submitted his data for fear of being left without communication .
" Protesting against it is pointless , too . "
As the deadline approached , Facebook and Twitter communities encouraged each other to register their phones with the data of public figures ranging from the president , Felipe Calderón , to the world 's richest man , Carlos Slim , who owns the biggest mobile company .
A month ago , the daily newspaper Reforma received confirmation for several phones it registered using the data of the national head of public security , Genaro García Luna .
Héctor Osuna , the head of the telecommunications regulator , insisted the information would be used for no purpose other than safeguarding user security .
" We will be the only ones who have access to the information , " he said on the main breakfast TV show today .
Actually disconnecting the phones is the responsibility of the mobile phone companies , and these may prove reluctant to carry out a government order that means they suddenly lose millions of customers .
Slim 's company América Móvil unsuccessfully lobbied for an extension of the deadline .
And last week Móvistar , a subsidiary of the Spanish telecoms giant Telefónica , threatened to ignore the government 's order altogether .
The white - necked laughingthrush ( Garrulax strepitans ) is a species of passerine bird in the family Leiothrichidae , native to Laos , Myanmar , Thailand , and the Chinese province of Yunnan .
It is about 32 cm ( 13 in ) long and has a chestnut - coloured crown , a brownish - black face and throat , and a rather diffuse white collar separating these from the body .
Typically birds of forest and woodland , laughingthrushes are difficult to observe in the dense vegetation they prefer .
They are noisy birds , and their characteristic laughing calls are often the best indication that these birds are present .
This white - necked laughingthrush was photographed in Mae Wong National Park , in Thailand 's Nakhon Sawan Province .

Porsche Reveals High - Performance 918 Spyder Concept Highly Efficient and Ultra-Fast Plug-in Hybrid Super Sports Car Unveiled in Geneva
Today , on the eve of the Geneva Motor Show , Porsche unveiled an ultra-efficient , low - emission , mid-engine super sports car featuring hybrid and electric drive technology .
The 918 Spyder concept combines high - tech racing features with electric - mobility to offer a fascinating range of qualities .
For example , it is planned to provide an emission level of just 70 grams of CO2 per kilometer on fuel consumption of only three liters / 100 kilometers ( equal to approximately 78 mpg U.S. ) , which is truly outstanding , even for an ultra -compact city car .
This car , however , is intended to offer the performance of a super sports car with acceleration from a standstill to 100 km/h in just under 3.2 seconds , top speed of 320 km/h ( 198 mph ) , and a lap time on the Nordschleife of N ̧rburgring in less than 7:30 minutes , faster than even the Porsche Carrera GT .
The 918 Spyder is one of three Porsche models with hybrid drive making their world debut at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show .
This trio ñ made up of Porscheís new Cayenne S Hybrid SUV with parallel full - hybrid drive , the 911 GT3 R Hybrid race car with electric drive on the front axle and a flywheel mass battery , and the two - seater high - performance 918 Spyder mid-engined sports car with plug - in hybrid technology ñ clearly demonstrates not only the great bandwidth of this new drive technology , but also the innovative power of Porsche as a genuine pioneer in hybrid drive .
The highly - innovative 918 Spyder concept car combines Porscheís Intelligent Performance philosophy with the high - technology from motorsport , with classic but modern design to make a truly convincing statement .
Innovative powertrain combines race - bred V8 engine with electric drive
This open two - seater is powered by a high - revving V8 developing more than 500 horsepower and a maximum engine speed of 9,200 rpm ñ as well as electric motors on the front and rear axle with overall mechanical output of 218 horsepower ( 160 kW ) .
The V8 combustion engine is the next step in the evolution of the highly successful 3.4 - liter power unit already featured in the RS Spyder racing car and positioned mid-ship , in front of the rear axle , giving the car excellent balance and the right set - up for supreme performance on the race track .
Power is transmitted to the wheels by a seven - speed Porsche - Doppelkupplungsgetriebe ( PDK ) transmission that feeds the power of the electric drive system to the rear axle .
The front - wheel electric drive powers the wheels through a fixed transmission ratio .
The energy reservoir is a fluid - cooled lithium - ion battery positioned behind the passenger cell .
The big advantage of a plug - in hybrid is that the battery can be charged on the regular electrical network .
A further point is that the carís kinetic energy is converted into electrical energy fed into the battery when applying the brakes , thus providing additional energy for fast and dynamic acceleration .
Driverís choice of four distinct driving modes
A button on the steering wheel allows the driver to choose among four different running modes :
The E - Drive mode is for running the car under electric power alone , with a range of up to 25 km or 16 miles .
In the Hybrid mode , the 918 Spyder uses both the electric motors and the combustion engine as a function of driving conditions and requirements , offering a range from particularly fuel - efficient all the way to extra-powerful .
The Sport Hybrid mode uses both drive systems , but with the focus on performance .
Most of the drive power goes to the rear wheels , with Torque Vectoring serving to additionally improve the carís driving dynamics .
In the Race Hybrid mode the drive systems are focused on pure performance with the highest standard of driving dynamics on the track , running at the limit to their power and dynamic output .
With the battery sufficiently charged , a push - to - pass button feeds in additional electrical power ( E - Boost ) , when overtaking or for even better performance .
With the hybrid drive system offering this wide range of individual modes and applications , the 918 Spyder is able either to achieve lap times comparable to those of a thoroughbred racing car , or the extremely low emissions and high fuel economy figures of a plug - in hybrid .
Advanced body structure and design offer more than just good looks
Like the drivetrain , the lightweight body structure of the Porsche 918 Spyder also bears out the carís DNA carried over directly from motorsport :
The modular structure with its monocoque bodyshell made of carbon - fiber - reinforced plastic ( CFP ) and liberal use of magnesium and aluminum not only reduce weight to below 1,490 kg , or 3,285 lb , but also ensure supreme driving precision thanks to a high level of torsional stiffness .
Reminiscent of highly successful , legendary racing cars such as the Porsche 917 and the current Porsche RS Spyder , the 918 Spyder , with its design concept so typical of Porsche arouses powerful emotions .
The combination of racing car dimensions , clearly structured design with perfectly balanced surfaces , and innovative details throughout , creates an ideal synthesis of form and function ñ following Porscheís design DNA .
The smooth balance of tradition and progress gives the car a powerful stance on the road .
Variable aerodynamics , typical of Porsche , ensures both visionary and traditional highlights especially around the rear spoiler .
The striking rear hoods extending out of the headrests , in turn , not only fulfill an aerodynamic function on the 918 Spyder , but also accommodate retractable air intakes with a ram air function .
High - tech interior provides glimpse into the future
The driver and passenger are not only embedded in contoured sports bucket seats but also form part of the cockpit , which provides a synthesis of efficient functionality and ergonomic high - tech operation .
Additionally , the cockpit offers a glimpse at the potential interior architecture of future Porsche super sports cars .
The three free - standing circular dials for road speed ( left ) , engine speed ( middle ) and energy management ( right ) would appear to come directly from a racing car in the ë60s , bearing out that unique philosophy of driver orientation so characteristic of Porsche .
The center console rises up towards the front in the 918 Spyder and houses a touch screen for intuitive control of the carís functions , serving to reduce the number of visible controls and maintain the principle of direct operation .
The control units relevant to the driver are mainly concentrated on the three - spoke multifunction sports steering wheel , while the variable driving modes are supplemented by a switch enabling the driver to call up various drive programs and serving as the push - to - pass button for E - boosting .
Instrument illumination , finally , varies from green for the consumption - oriented running modes to red for the performance - oriented driving programs .
The Porsche 918 Spyder concept also comes with further innovative functions such as the Range Manager .
After being activated in the Center Display , the Range Manager uses the map in the navigation system to present the remaining range the car is able to cover , naturally allowing the driver to influence that range through the appropriate choice of power and performance .
In cities with environmental alert areas the Range Manager also states whether the driver is able to reach a certain destination on electric power alone .
Applying this information and using further info on the availability and location of special energy filling stations , the driver is then able to choose his personal style of driving as well as the right battery charge and filling strategy .
Offering a unique combination of extremely low fuel consumption , supreme performance and long electric range , the Porsche 918 Spyder concept represents an essential milestone in Porscheís strategy on the way to genuine electric - mobility .

1 ) Des Walker
Few players emerged from the wreckage of England 's Euro 92 campaign with any credit , but Des Walker strode out of it with trademark elegance .
While all around him were losing their heads and reputations , the Nottingham Forest centre - back remained unflappable and confirmed the impression that here was the most gifted English defender of his generation .
He was only 26 and would surely be a linchpin for years to come .
Then he went to Italy , where great defenders tended to get even better , and inexplicably lost it .
At Sampdoria Sven Goran - Eriksson tended to play him at left - back but that cannot explain why his performances for his country dipped deeply , and so quickly .
His England downfall began in a World Cup qualifier at Wembley in April 1993 , when Marc Overmars left him lumbering like a lead - footed oaf and all Walker could muster by way of response was a clumsy tackle that gave Holland a penalty .
That was embarrassing for a player for whom pace had always been a key characteristic , but Overmars was exceptionally fast too so no one was writing Walker off just yet .
He looked alarmingly out of his depth in the next match against Poland , however , floundering in a comically confused way for Dariusz Adamczuk 's goal .
Similar ineptitude followed against Norway and though he did win a couple more caps in worthless matches , his international career was effectively over .
Walker made his last appearance for England at the age of 27 , when centre - backs are usually coming into their prime .
Though he continued to play for Sheffield Wednesday , Terry Venables emphasised just how far Walker had fallen by ignoring him while deploying centre - backs such as Neil Ruddock , John Scales , Colin Cooper , David Unsworth .
And Steve Howey .

Tom Finney deserved better luck .
English football 's most precocious talent in the immediate post - war period , he'd been offered a bank - busting five - figure deal to join Palermo in 1952 , only for the miserable jealous members of the Preston board to flatly refuse the transfer .
A gentleman to his socks , Finney did n't sulk over his lost fortune , instead continuing to give the club stellar service .
But karma never paid him back .
In 1953 , the day before Stanley Matthews finally got his hands on an FA Cup winner 's medal , Arsenal scraped a 3 - 2 win against Burnley on the last day of the league season , pipping Preston to the title on goal average by 0.99 of a goal .
The year after , the Lilywhites lost the lead in the FA Cup final , going down 3 - 2 to West Bromwich Albion .
And a further four years on , Preston found themselves runners - up in the league again , this time behind Wolves .
Finney was eventually forced to retire through injury at the end of the 1959 - 60 season , no medal to show for his efforts , no coffers filled with lire .
He had made Preston one of the must - watch teams of the 1950s , though .
And they crumbled without him .
Only four teams in the First Division conceded fewer goals in 1960 - 61 – their keeper Fred Else was unquestionably the player of the season – but without Finney the attack was blunt , and they could only manage to score 42 themselves .
Newcastle , who went down with Preston in last place , scored nearly twice as many .
The previous season had ended in celebratory fashion , with Finney being waved off into the sunset .
Now a poor Manchester United side came to Deepdale and rattled in four goals , the defence finally buckling under a season 's pressure , the defeat condemning Preston to the Second Division .
They 'd previously been relegated five times in their history , but each time managed to bounce back , usually pretty quickly .
But not this time : this grand club , the first - ever champions of England , have never played top - flight football since .
Karmic retribution for the hopes and dreams cruelly denied the legendary Finney ?
You decide .

3 ) Manchester City
Champions of the big leagues do n't often get relegated simply through gross ineptitude .
The 1978 - 79 scudetto winners Milan went down to Serie B in 1980 , but only because they were sent there for their part in the totonero betting scandal .
Juventus followed them in 2006 , but again it had nothing to do with on - pitch woe ; calciopoli cost them , and in any case they had their title revoked , so they were n't even champions any more .
Marseille went one better in 1993 - 94 – the only domestic and European champions to lose their top - flight status the season after – but again that was down to financial shenanigans , and again Marseille had seen their 1993 domestic pot revoked .
Bad Bernard Tapie , in your box Bernard Tapie .
Falls from grace all , for sure , but nobody was kicking the ball up into their own face in the name of sport , so we 're not counting them .
Only two of the big boys meet our on - pitch criteria .
One is Nuremburg , Bundesliga champions of 1968 and at one time the most successful club in Germany , who went down the season after , infamously eccentric coach Max Merkel deciding his title - winning team was too old and getting shot of nearly all of them in favour of kids .
The few remaining experienced players , meanwhile , could n't be doing with Merkel 's intensive training methods , so stopped bothering .
The Club took the best part of a decade to bounce back , and even then it was only for a while before lower - division ignominy awaited .
But Nuremburg can't hold a candle to the one , the only , Manchester City .
Or Typical Manchester City , to give them their full name .
In 1936 - 37 , the striker Peter Doherty scored 30 goals , Eric Brook 20 , Alec Herd 17 and Fred Tilson 15 as City scored 107 times on the way to their first - ever title .
Cue English football 's one and only full and total Meltdown of the Champions : the next year , they scored more goals than anyone else in the division , 77 , but still went down with a positive goal difference .
They had only failed to score in four league games , but two of those matches came in their final three fixtures ( which , it hardly needs to be said , came between a 6 - 2 win ) .
" The use of the word ' staggering ' may be justified from different angles , " reported the Observer .
That 's our City !

Maybe all good things do have to come to an end .
But that 's no reason to press the self - destruct button .
The fall of ' Le Grand Reims ' was as stupid as it was swift .
In nine seasons between 1953 and 1962 Reims won the French title five times and reached two European Cup finals , all while playing with a panache that spawned the now familiar term ' champagne football ' .
Not only a masterful coach , Albert Batteux , who had become manager at just 30 - years - old , proved a shrewd recruiter , most obviously when he signed Just Fontaine after Raymond Kopa was lured to Real Madrid ( where he spent three triumphant years before rejoining Reims and contributing to yet more success ) .
During his dominant reign
Batteux effectively built three teams , and on the side guided France to third - place at the 1958 World Cup with a squad featuring several of his Reims stars .
But the manager 's superiors were n't worthy of him , and financial foolishness meant their investment in players began to dry up and in 1963 , amid mealy - mouthed excuses , they declined to renew Batteux 's contract after Reims had finished runners - up in the league .
Compounding that folly was the French Football Federation 's ridiculous decision to ban Kopa for six months over an argument with the national team manager , Georges Verriest , ( which had started when Verriest questioned Kopa 's commitment to the team after he pulled out of a match due to his son's illness ) .
In 1964 Reims were relegated .
They 're now in the third tier of French football .
Batteux went on to lead Saint - Etienne to four straight titles between 1967 and 70 , plus two Cups .
PD
Transition is always tricky .
But for a euphoric , fleeting moment in 1994 the Tannadice faithful were convinced they had found an exciting new heir to Jim McLean .
In almost 22 years at the helm McLean had steered the club to unprecedented glories and whoever came after him was always going to have to endure incessant talk of a poisoned chalice , especially as McLean had not really departed , merely moved upstairs to look ominously over the shoulder of the new man .
But from the moment he arrived Ivan Golac exuded an insouciance that quickly proved infectious .
With flowing longish hair and the decidedly unMcLean - esque disposition of a genial hippy ( except on one celebrated occasion ) , the Scottish league 's first overseas manager charmed fans and won over the players with a novel training regime that included sporadic trips to a local cafe for motivational egg - rolls , and rambles in a nearby park " to look at the trees and smell the flowers " .
Results in the league were iffy but that was ignored amid a heroic march to the 1994 Scottish Cup final , where the opponents were all - conquering Rangers , in the middle of their nine - in - a - row run .
Craig Brewster 's winning goal may have been more than slightly shambolic , but it enabled United to finally get their hands on the one trophy that McLean had never won .
" There 's no doubt at all that the manager can hopefully strengthen the team and we can definitely expect greater things from Dundee United , " gushed McLean in a post - match interview .
Less than a year later ' Ivan the Terriffic ' was sacked and United were relegated .

Few people expected Alf Ramsey 's championship side of 1961 - 62 to retain their title – they had , after all , been handed the prize on a plate by a more talented Burnley side who only won twice in their last 13 games – but nobody expected it to turn so sour , so quickly .
The hapless tone of Ipswich 's 1962 - 63 campaign was set on a pre-season tour to Hamburg , when the team was accidentally booked not into a hotel but a brothel near the Reeperbahn .
At one end of the sassy Strasse , the Beatles were performing to audiences of gangsters and prostitutes while whacked out on ridiculously strong speed ; down the other , an incandescent Ramsey was adding to the seedy atmosphere by parping hot jets of sultry steam from his lugs .
Alf 's mood would barely lift all season .
The tactical masterplan which had landed Ipswich their title – withdrawing the wingers to create space for strikers behind confused advancing full backs – was quickly negated by opposing managers .
Bill Nicholson of FA Cup winners Spurs showed the way in the Charity Shield , simply by putting his midfielders on the wingers ; Spurs won 5 - 1 .
Ipswich were in the relegation places come November , having won two of 16 games , by which time Ramsey had accepted the England job .
Ramsey stayed on in an advisory capacity for the rest of the season – which he whiled away by kicking his successor Jackie Milburn around the training ground like an old sock .
( The two had come to blows in a Spurs - Newcastle match during the early 1950s ) .
The reigning champions ended the season safe in 17th , thanks to a late flourish of wins , but Milburn 's authority had been undermined from the off , and he never really recovered , his abject team ending the following season in last spot .
Ipswich certainly had n't outstayed their welcome in the top flight : having won their title as a newly promoted side , it had taken them a mere two years to be dispatched back to the lower reaches .

One afternoon last November , a Portland State University economics student gave a class presentation on what he described as the U.S. military 's flawed reliance on one of its key combat rifles .
As a visual aid , Zachary Bucharest hauled out a duffel bag and withdrew the disassembled parts of a Colt AR - 15 , a semiautomatic version of the military M - 16 .
For the next 15 or 20 minutes , he kept professor John Hall 's class engrossed as he lectured about the weapon 's inferiority to the foreign - made AK - 47 .
PSU policy forbids firearms on campus by anyone except police .
But no one in the economics class -- not even Hall , a tenured professor -- reported the incident to campus security or administrators .
Bucharest 's presentation marked a pivotal moment in a drama that now threatens to scrub the career of a beloved professor and sully the reputation of a promising student leader .
The climactic event came in the closing moments of class Jan. 14 , when Hall denounced Bucharest as a government informant and killer .
He then reported to school police that he suspected Bucharest of carrying a gun on campus .
The professor also sent a letter to the head of Oregon 's FBI asking whether the bureau was bankrolling Bucharest as an agent provocateur .
Campus administrators responded by suspending Hall with pay (
) , saying he dishonored the university and violated Bucharest 's privacy .
They ordered Hall to turn in his office keys and barred him from campus while they investigated .
" Prof .
Hall 's conduct has created an atmosphere of fear and suspicion , " Carol Mack , a vice provost at PSU , wrote (
) to university President Wim Wiewel on Feb. 3 , " and I believe that his presence on campus would only escalate the situation . "
---
Americans have been hypervigilant about safety on college campuses since a student opened fire at
in April 2007 , killing 32 .
Campus safety experts across the nation have followed news accounts of the PSU dust - up , which opened a public discourse about the nature of school security , academic freedom and the constitutional right to bear arms .
" It seems that this professor had a concern , " says security consultant Steven Healy , former director of public safety at Princeton University , " and probably addressed it other than how we would want someone to address the issue . "
Some of Hall 's students have stepped forward to defend him .
They say Bucharest , a 30 - year - old combat veteran with a permit to carry a concealed handgun , was so preoccupied by his past that he spoke often about guns , warfare , explosives , martial arts and the science of bullets penetrating flesh .
Hall 's most ardent supporters have declared his public scolding of Bucharest a heroic act .
They say the professor was only trying to protect students and himself from a combat veteran who seemed to be suffering post - traumatic stress disorder .
And they wonder why Bucharest has been allowed to stay on campus .
PSU 's correspondence on the flap obtained by The Oregonian -- along with interviews of Bucharest and his lawyer , Hall 's attorneys , PSU students and teachers , campus administrators and the head of security -- offer the clearest account yet of how two outsize personalities collided on campus .
Economics professor John Battaile Hall , 57 , has taught for 25 years at PSU .
He 's a popular lecturer in a subject that -- in less - capable hands -- is drier than summer cheatgrass .
He brews homemade beer , holds patents on two wood - burning stoves and was once named teacher of the year in economics .
Zachary P. " Zaki " Bucharest shaves his head and allows a skinny beard to snake down his cheeks and chin .
A 1998 graduate of
, he 's a charming man with a staggering number of friends , a position in student government and an intriguing life story .
Bucharest holds dual Israeli- U.S. citizenship .
He came to PSU in 2006 after serving much of the previous six years in the Israel Defense Forces .
In an interview with The Oregonian , Bucharest said he was trained as a sniper and served in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories .
Bucharest says he looked up to Hall , who made the study of economics fascinating .
Like lots of Hall 's students , he spent many hours in office sessions .
It was during those sessions , Hall would later write , that Bucharest boasted of being a sniper who " killed more than a few people " and " showed me scars on his chest from bullet wounds , relics of his combat experience . "
The young man talked freely about his exploits .
He told classmates about police seizing weapons from his apartment on Northwest Flanders Street -- two Glock pistols and a 12 - gauge pump shotgun -- when a buddy accidentally shot a hole through the ceiling .
And he told friends about destroying a textbook with detonating cord -- and videotaping the episode -- after getting angry with a different professor .
Then came Bucharest 's AR - 15 presentation last fall in which he demonstrated the upper and lower receivers of the semiautomatic weapon .
---
Charles Merten , a lawyer representing Hall , says the professor was surprised to see Bucharest pull out the rifle parts in class and never gave him permission to bring them in .
But Bucharest says
Hall gave him permission on two occasions and later awarded him a B - plus for his presentation .
Bucharest says the weapon was inoperable because he removed the firing pin before bringing it to class .
Fellow students say Bucharest 's bravado ramped up after the AR - 15 presentation , and he began to encourage classmates to buy guns and ammo .
Economics student Daniel Dreier , 26 , found himself drawn into what he would later characterize as Bucharest 's " paramilitary culture . "
He suggested to Bucharest that they buy Hall an AK - 47 as a gift , and students soon talked of pooling up to $ 400 .
But Dreier says he soured on the idea when Bucharest was hesitant to buy the weapon from a gun shop .
On Dec. 4 , during the economic department 's annual holiday party , Bucharest talked with a classmate about how to make a firebomb using the explosive compound RDX .
The classmate , who declined to be named for this story because he fears retribution from PSU administrators , says he felt Bucharest was trying to get him to incriminate himself about radical activities .
" You 're a fed , " he recalls telling Bucharest .
The classmate says Bucharest later threatened to punch him , and Dreier , who was there , backs up that account .
But Bucharest denies making any such threat .
In another incident in January , Bucharest and Dreier ended a night of drinking seated in a parked car just off campus .
Dreier 's girlfriend , 23 - year - old Dana Scheider , had driven downtown to pick him up and joined them for a round or two .
She was behind the wheel , waiting for the alcohol to wear off before driving .
Scheider recalled that Bucharest rested a pistol on his lap and threatened to put a bullet in the car if she drove .
She thought it was Bucharest 's eccentric way of keeping her from driving impaired .
Bucharest denies pulling out a pistol or making any such comment .
By Jan. 12 , Hall had heard reports from students that Bucharest was trying to get them to buy guns and ammo .
Then that day , during an office session , he learned about Bucharest 's firebomb chat .
" He felt the need was urgent to do something , " Merten says .
Hall made no official complaint to PSU about Bucharest , although he spoke in confidence to a campus administrator he wo n't name , Merten says .
---
By the morning of Jan. 14 , according to Merten , Hall was convinced that the best way to protect himself and his students was to call Bucharest out publicly .
First , Merten says , he stopped at the school 's public safety office and asked an officer to come frisk a student he suspected of carrying a firearm on campus .
The director of public safety , Michael D. Soto , says Hall declined to file an official report or provide any information about the student , so his office took no action .
In his comparative economics class that afternoon , Hall glanced at the clock and -- with 15 minutes left in the session -- began to accuse Bucharest of being a government snitch .
The professor put a letter on an overhead projector and began reading portions of it aloud to the roughly 40 students in his class , including Bucharest .
The three - page letter (
) , addressed to Arthur Balizan , the FBI 's special agent in charge for Oregon , made a series of disjointed accusations .
Hall 's letter accuses Bucharest of trying to draw innocent students into crimes and tells Balizan he suspects someone in the FBI office of promoting his work .
" My suspicion is that your office is seeking such manipulated and incriminating information as a way to criminalize and thereby implicate these students ' future careers , as well as reduce their earning potential over the span of their working lives , " Hall wrote to Balizan .
The FBI later reported that Bucharest never had any association with the bureau .
When the professor finished his excoriation that day in class , he took a photo of Bucharest and handed him a ripped manila envelope that contained a copy of the letter .
" Give this to your superiors , " Hall said .
Bucharest , who sat in shocked silence during Hall 's diatribe , recalls muttering three words as he walked out : " It 's a pity . "
Hall later told campus police he suspected Bucharest of carrying a gun .
On his office door , the professor put a photo of Bucharest , along with his name and student identification number .
Bucharest lodged a formal complaint against Hall with PSU administrators and hired Elden Rosenthal , a Portland lawyer .
Five days after Hall 's public accusations against Bucharest , students packed into the classroom to hear three senior PSU administrators talk about Hall 's abrupt departure .
Many of the students voiced outrage that Hall had been sent away while Bucharest stayed at PSU .
Hall 's outburst divided the campus .
" This is a tragic misunderstanding , " says Samantha Alloy , a friend of Bucharest's .
" Professor Hall is a well loved and respected guy , but he made a tragic mistake , whether it was because he was having paranoid delusions or he thought it was in the best interest of students . "
For now , the university finds itself hip deep in complaints .
The administration is investigating Bucharest 's complaints about Hall , and campus security is investigating Hall 's complaint that Bucharest carried firearms on campus .
This week , a handful of students and alumni met with PSU President Wiewel to complain that the administration has n't adequately addressed their complaints .
" We take all concerns regarding safety on campus very seriously , " says PSU spokesman Scott Gallagher .

It has been the setting for many a spaghetti western , but now Hollywood has warned that Spain could be facing high noon over its appalling record of movie piracy , with a future devoid of DVDs .
The unauthorised downloading of films from the internet is so rife , with film - makers complaining that a legal void makes people think movies are free , that Spain could become the first European country to be abandoned by Hollywood studios .
" People are downloading movies in such large quantities that Spain is on the brink of no longer being a viable home entertainment market for us , " Michael Lynton , chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment , told the Los Angeles Times .
Sony 's threat , which affects DVDs but not cinemas , would put Spain on a par with South Korea , which most studios have abandoned because of a similar free - for - all internet culture .
While cinema audiences have declined slowly in Spain , sales and rentals of DVDs have plummeted as high - speed broadband make streaming and downloading easier .
As a result , three out of four video shops in Spain closed in the five years to 2009 .
Spending on DVDs can be as low as 10 % of the level in the UK or Germany .
" It is very sad and very shameful for Spain that we should reach the stage where companies are thinking of leaving , " said Octavio Dapena of the Spanish film rights association Egeda .
" I hope it does n't happen and that Spain reacts in time . "
But Antonio Guisasola , of music rights group Promusicae , said he was nor surprised Hollywood was considering pulling out .
" There has never been a clear message here that downloading is piracy .
The statistics show that 30 % of the Spanish population uses file - sharing sites , against an average of 15 % in the rest of Europe . "
A recent report by the Paris - based TERA consultancy on internet piracy in Europe warned Spain had the highest piracy rate and that spending on DVDs had fallen six times faster than in the UK .
The report estimated that the film and television industry lost about € 900 m ( £ 801 m ) in Spain as a result of piracy in 2008 – almost twice as much as the music business lost .
Internet piracy was causing some 13,000 jobs losses a year in Spain , the report said .
There were 2.4bn unauthorised downloads of music , movies , video games , software and other copyrighted works in Spain– or some 50 per Spaniard – according to Joan Navarro of the Coalition of Creators and the Content Industry .
Oscar - winning Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar's ' Return ' was subject to 4.3 million download attempts over a twelve month period — with 85 % of the downloads coming from Spain , according to his production company .
Spain 's culture minister , Ángeles González - Sinde , today sent a new internet bill to parliament that would allow the government to close down those sites that illegally sell films or music .
" The idea is to act against those websites that try to make money out of other people 's creativity , " a culture ministry source said .
" There is no attempt to impose any control on what internet users themselves do , unlike in France or England . "
Internet activists are already circulating a manifesto against the law .
" Internet should function without interference from politicians acting for those who want to perpetuate outdated business models , " it said .
González - Sinde said that film - makers and other artists needed protecting .
" People who create culture , also create jobs , " she told journalists after a meeting of EU culture ministers in Barcelona .
If you are interested in PDF file analysis we might soon have something for you .
We have developed a nifty little application that can not only parse PDF files but also help you analyze them very quickly .
The main features include :
The ability to view PDF files as content trees as well as hex data .
Decode and display embedded JavaScript .
Refactoring functionality for JavaScript code , for example for variable renaming .
An integrated JavaScript interpreter for malicious script debugging .
An extensible Adobe Reader emulator to simulate arbitrary versions and configurations of Adobe Reader .
Intercept all called functions to log calls or modify arguments and return values .
Automated exploit recognition .
To see it all in action , you can watch a preview video by clicking this link .
There are a few things to explore in the next weeks :
We will improve the PDF parser .
We will add more JavaScript refactoring functions .
We need to figure out how to limit memory to scripts because if your script gets heap - sprayed , the PDF analysis tool will get heap - sprayed too which is uncool .
We will add a plugin API so that you can automatically process large quantities of files .
This should be very useful for everyone who wants to do batch analysis of PDF files .
SACRAMENTO –
At least 12,000 people marched here recently , crowding on to the space in front of the State Capitol to protest corporate greed and the state ’s budget cuts to public education , transportation and health services .
Dozens of buses had brought demonstrators , from San Bernardino to the Oregon border , and brightly colored t- shirts proclaimed their membership in many unions and community and student organizations .
The rally was the culmination of a 48 - day - long , union - organized march from Los Angeles to Sacramento .
Along the way , local marches , demonstrations and meetings showed the depth of anger of ordinary Californians at the cuts forced by the Republicans and the state law requiring a two - thirds majority to pass a state budget or raise taxes .
Many of the union officials at the podium echoed Art Pulaski , Executive Secretary - Treasurer of the California Labor Federation , who proclaimed .
“ The last day of the march is the first day of a revitalized campaign for financial change in California …we want change and we ’re making it happen now . ”
“ Do n’t tell us there is no money when there is more money spent on the prison - industrial complex than on our educational system , ” said San Diego Community College student Jose Rodriguez , one of the people who had marched all the way from Bakersfield .
“ Do n’t tell us when the 300 richest corporations pay no taxes at all . ”
Hundreds of signatures were collected on a petition to change the budget - passing requirement to a simple majority .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
The weird world of quantum mechanics describes the strange , often contradictory , behaviour of small inanimate objects such as atoms .
Researchers have now started looking for ways to detect quantum properties in more complex and larger entities , possibly even living organisms .
A German -Spanish research group , split between the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching and the Institute of Photonic Sciences ( ICFO ) , is using the principles of an iconic quantum mechanics thought experiment - Schrödinger ’s superpositioned cat - to test for quantum properties in objects composed of as many as one billion atoms , possibly including the flu virus .
New research published today , Thursday 11 March , in New Journal of Physics , describes the construction of an experiment to test for superposition states in these larger objects .
Quantum optics is a field well - rehearsed in the process of detecting quantum properties in single atoms and some small molecules but the scale that these researchers wish to work at is unprecedented .
When physicists try to fathom exactly how the tiniest constituents of matter and energy behave , confusing patterns of their ability to do two things at once ( referred to as being in a superposition state ) , and of their ‘ spooky ’ connection ( referred to as entanglement ) to their physically distant sub-atomic brethren , emerge .
It is the ability of these tiny objects to do two things at once that Oriol Romero - Isart and his co-workers are preparing to probe .
With this new technique , the researchers suggest that viruses are one type of object that could be probed .
Albeit speculatively , the researchers hope that their technique might offer a route to experimentally address questions such as the role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics .
In order to test for superposition states , the experiment involves finely tuning lasers to capture larger objects such as viruses in an ‘ optical cavity ’ ( a very tiny space ) , another laser to slow the object down ( and put it into what quantum mechanics call a ‘ ground state ’ ) and then adding a photon ( the basic element of light ) in a specific quantum state to the laser to provoke it into a superposition .
The researchers say , " We hope that this system , apart from providing new quantum technology , will allow us to test quantum mechanics at larger scales , by preparing macroscopic superpositions of objects at the nano and micro scale .
This could then enable us to use more complex microorganisms , and thus test the quantum superposition principle with living organisms by performing quantum optics experiments with them . "

Since millions of American patients face medical debt they did n't know they'd have - and many if not most of them purchased insurance to protect against that debt - it seems logical to me that patients should be fully informed up front of the financial risks they are taking on when they seek medical care .
Doctors and others providers should publish and post in their offices their methods of debt collection and the numbers of patients they sue in an average practice year .
They can put the disclosures of medical debt collection practices right next to the little signs that tell patients they must pay their co-pays prior to receiving medical care .
I shared the idea with my University of Chicago educated son , and he liked it .
He said , " Even Vegas has to disclose the odds of winning . "
True enough .
Even those who love the market economy like to know as much as possible about their financial entanglements before they enter them .
Disclosure .
Disclosure .
Disclosure .
( Much like the old real estate advice - location , location , location . )
Financial .
Debt collection practices .
Health condition outcomes .
So , along with the releases and privacy statements and risk assignment forms I must sign before I am accepted as a patient , providers should also publish their outcomes evidence as well .
How am I to know if a given provider is just good buddies with the referring physicians or if they truly have a success record with the condition for which I require care ?
I 'd feel better about reform that promised those things than I do about a reform measure that simply forces me to purchase the defective financial product sold as private health insurance .
Private health insurance is marketed to me to protect my health and wealth , and yet it may or may not do either .
It 's a crap shoot .
Did you know some medical providers in Pennsylvania go to what 's known as " collectors ' universities " to learn how to collect their medical debt from the families of deceased patients ?
They study two legal documents offered by the collection experts : the " Doctrine of Necessities " and " Collecting from the Deceased . "
Ouch .
Imagine that after your loved one 's for - profit private insurance company fails to pay all the bills when a child or spouse or parent dies .
And Pennsylvania providers are no different than many others around the nation .
Collecting medical debt is big , big business .
So regardless of what this Congress does or what this President celebrates in the Rose Garden framed by the billowing cherry blossoms , I 'll still be slugging it out in the front offices of providers , at the admissions desks in hospitals and at the pharmacy counters to try to secure the care I need and pay for .
Nothing has been done to improve my chances of getting what I bargained for as a patient .
I am to accept on good faith what the providers secure as a legal guarantee from me .
I want a single standard of high quality care through progressive financing .
I want to be able to choose the care that is high quality .
I simply cannot do that unless and until my rights as a patient are protected .
And we are a long way away from that day .
Under an improved Medicare for all system , I would be saved from the terrible loop that is the medical collection system in this nation .
I 'd still want to know health outcomes data , but that would be far easier to obtain and track .
Wow , imagine that .
Should gamblers playing slot machines really be given the legal right to know pay - out odds in a nation that thinks patients have no right to knowledge of results expected from their medical care providers ?
Surely , reputable providers could not object to that sort of patient or citizen empowerment .
But wait .
A lawyer friend of mine from Colorado tells me that hospitals and many doctors could hardly be less cooperative in talking about this topic .
Big surprise .
The day will come when patients will be the center of this debate .
It has not come yet .
This Congress and this administration have never put our interests first , so this effort was flawed from the start .
Because the improvements I need to see as a patient are nowhere to be found in this mess , I understand why people lose interest in the fight .
The disconnect between what we need and what we are getting from this round of health reform effort as patients and as citizens is a chasm too deep .

A March survey from Pew shows just how broad the unemployment pain has been felt .
When you hear of 10 % unemployment , you might imagine 1/10th of Americans experiencing extreme financial stress from the recent recession .
Yet given the unemployment rate 's odd methodology whereby it drops people who stop looking for work out of the data , and the fact that American households usually have more than one person , the real ' pain ' number is 54 % -- over half of American households felt the direct impact of job losses :
Pew Research :
A majority now says that someone in their household has been without a job or looking for work ( 54 % ) ; just 39 % said this in February 2009 .
Only a quarter reports receiving a pay raise or a better job in the past year ( 24 % ) , while almost an equal number say they have been laid off or lost a job ( 21 % ) .
Basically , if your household did n't experience un - or under - employment , then you are in the minority .
Moreover , as shown above , fully 70 % of American households experienced one of the serious financial problems above .
Basically , the vast majority of American households was hit extremely hard .

In the decades since structured programming , many of the advances in software engineering have come out of non-university sources , mostly of four kinds :
Start - up technology companies ( who played a large role , for example , in the development of object technology ) .
Industrial research labs , starting with Xerox PARC and Bell Labs .
Independent ( non-university - based ) author - consultants .
Independent programmer - innovators , who start open - source communities ( and often start their own businesses after a while , joining the first category ) .
Academic research has had its part , honorable but limited .
Why ?
In earlier posts [ 1 ] [ 2 ]
I analyzed one major obstacle to software engineering research : the absence of any obligation of review after major software disasters .
I will come back to that theme , because the irresponsible attitude of politicial authorities hinders progress by depriving researchers of some of their most important potential working examples .
But for university researchers there is another impediment : the near - impossibility of developing serious software .
If you work in theory - oriented parts of computer science , the problem is less significant : as part of a PhD thesis or in preparation of a paper you can develop a software prototype that will support your research all the way to the defense or the publication , and can be left to wither gracefully afterwards .
But software engineering studies issues that arise for large systems , where “ large ” encompasses not only physical size but also project duration , number of users , number of changes .
A software engineering researcher who only ever works on prototypes will be denied the opportunity to study the most significant and challenging problems of the field .
The occasional consulting job is not a substitute for this hands - on experience of building and maintaining large software , which is , or should be , at the core of research in our field .
The bodies that fund research in other sciences understood this long ago for physics and chemistry with their huge labs , for mechanical engineering , for electrical engineering .
But in computer science or any part of it ( and software engineering is generally viewed as a subset of computer science ) the idea that we would actually do something , rather than talk about someone else ’s artifacts , is alien to the funding process .
The result is an absurd situation that blocks progress .
Researchers in experimental physics or mechanical engineering employ technicians : often highly qualified personnel who help researchers set up experiments and process results .
In software engineering the equivalent would be programmers , software engineers , testers , technical writers ; in the environments that I have seen , getting financing for such positions from a research agency is impossible .
If you have requested a programmer position as part of a successful grant request , you can be sure that this item will be the first to go .
Researchers quickly understand the situation and learn not even to bother including such requests .
( I have personally never seen a counter - example .
If you have a different experience , I will be interested to learn who the enlightened agency is . )
The result of this attitude of funding bodies is a catastrophe for software engineering research : the only software we can produce , if we limit ourselves to official guidelines , is demo software .
The meaningful products of software engineering ( large , significant , usable and useful open - source software systems ) are theoretically beyond our reach .
Of course many of us work around the restrictions and do manage to produce working software , but only by spending considerable time away from research on programming and maintenance tasks that would be far more efficiently handled by specialized personnel .
The question indeed is efficiency .
Software engineering researchers should program as part of their normal work : only by writing programs and confronting the reality of software development can we hope to make relevant contributions .
But in the same way that an experimental physicist is helped by professionals for the parts of experimental work that do not carry a research value , a software engineering researcher should not have to spend time on porting the software to other architectures , performing configuration management , upgrading to new releases of the operating system , adapting to new versions of the libraries , building standard user interfaces , and all the other tasks , largely devoid of research potential , that software - based innovation requires .
Until research funding mechanisms integrate the practical needs of software engineering research , we will continue to be stymied in our efforts to produce a substantial effect on the quality of the world ’s software .

Here is an Email from " Voice in the Dark " about IBM and outsourcing .
VID writes ...
Hello Mish
I read your blog every day .
I do not comment much , but I think the MSM and most blogs are missing out on the greatest story not being told .
Large corporations are abandoning the US .
I work for IBM .
Here is a snapshot of IBM 's US headcount :
2005 133,789
2006 127,000
2007 121,000
2008 115,000
2009 105,000
2010 98,000 estimate
These are all good paying jobs that can support a family and pay taxes .
Today , 75 % of the total headcount is overseas .
The overseas revenue is 65 % .
The company reported record profits last year .
IBM decided to stop reporting their US headcount this year .
You know that many companies are moving their resources overseas .
China is the new spot to build development centers .
These incremental loses are adding up .
But the saddest thing is that they are giving away the building blocks for innovation .
I just read a few weeks ago the Applied Material is planning to replace their US research center for a new one in China .
That is another example of what is going on .
And no venture capitalist would attempt to build a solar panel factory from scratch in the US .
The costs and the EPA will prevent that .
Please tell this story .

Goodbye Silicon Valley , hello Xi’an China .
Applied Materials will do new cutting edge research on solar panels in Xi’an .

Two Drivers For Outsourcing
Obama Seeks To End Corporate Tax Breaks
In 2004 , U.S. - based multinational corporations paid about $ 16 billion in U.S. taxes while earning about $ 700 billion offshore , an effective tax rate of about 2.3 percent , according to the administration statement .
The top marginal tax rate for U.S. companies is 35 percent ; drug companies such as Amgen Inc. and technology companies such as Microsoft are among companies that make the biggest use of tax - deferral benefits .
The rules were originally designed to reduce paperwork for companies and the IRS by allowing companies to classify entities within their corporate structure in the most tax - efficient manner without inviting a tax challenge .
Unintended Consequence
Clinton administration officials realized they also had made it easy for multinationals to create entities whose only purpose was to shift profits into low - tax countries and out of reach of the tax authorities , according to a January Government Accountability Office report that found 83 of the 100 biggest companies had subsidiaries in tax havens .
Once the assets were in the haven , the U.S. parent company borrowed from the subsidiary .
The interest payments were deductible in the U.S. and tax - free in the haven , the GAO said .
The nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on Taxation recommended in 2005 that the rules be repealed .
GE , for example , has deferred tax on a cumulative $ 75 billion over the last decade , according to filings .
Palo Alto , California - based Hewlett - Packard Co. has deferred U.S. tax on $ 12.9 billion since 2005 , while Microsoft has accumulated $ 7.5 billion that has never been taxed by the U.S. Even American International Group Inc. , bailed out by the U.S. in 2008 , deferred $ 3.9 billion in taxes on its foreign earnings in the same year .
Shifting Gains To Low Tax Countries
As you work on your taxes this month , here 's something to raise your hackles :
Some of the world 's biggest , most profitable corporations enjoy a far lower tax rate than you do -- that is , if they pay taxes at all .
The most egregious example is General Electric ( GE ) .
Last year the conglomerate generated $ 10.3 billion in pretax income , but ended up owing nothing to Uncle Sam .
In fact , it recorded a tax benefit of $ 1.1 billion .
How did this happen ?
It 's complicated .
GE 's tax return is the largest the IRS deals with each year - - some 24,000 pages if printed out .
Inside you 'll find that GE in effect consists of two divisions : General Electric Capital and everything else .
The everything else -- maker of engines , power plants , TV shows and the like -- would have paid a 22 % tax rate if it was a standalone company .
It 's GE Capital that keeps the overall tax bill so low .
Over the last two years , GE Capital has displayed an uncanny ability to lose lots of money in the U.S. ...
It only makes sense that multinationals " put costs in high - tax countries and profits in low - tax countries , " says Scott Hodge , president of the Tax Foundation .
Those low - tax countries are almost anywhere but the U.S.
" When you add in state taxes , the U.S. has the highest tax burden among industrialized countries , " says Hodge .
In contrast , China 's rate is just 25 % ; Ireland 's is 12.5 % .
Corporations are getting smarter , not just about doing more business in low - tax countries , but in moving their more valuable assets there as well .
That means setting up overseas subsidiaries , then transferring to them ownership of long - lived , often intangible but highly profitable assets , like patents and software .
Who Is Hurt By US Corporate Tax Policy ?
Has anyone else noticed that a lot of WorldNetDaily nutcases are showing up on Sean Hannity 's show these days ?
First it was Jesse Lee Peterson , spouting crazy talk about Obama destroying America .
And then , last night , it was WND 's managing editor , David Kupelian , hawking his new book , How Evil Works : Understanding and Overcoming the Destructive Forces That Are Transforming America .
And just who and what is evil ?
Why , President Obama and the Democrats , of course :
Kupelian : I think we have a terrible problem right now , Sean .
Basically , what we 're looking at is -- let 's say it .
Can we say it on national TV ? --
We 're looking at an attempted socialist coup d'etat in Washington , D.C.
And people are really , freely unhappy about it .
And you know , the thing about Barack Obama -- you know , 53 percent of us voted for him .
Sixty - nine million Americans .
But this is a guy -- I know it sounds crazy , but here 's a guy who has been steeped in Marxist ideology for the past thirty years .
Things proceed as they usually do on Hannity 's show with these " All American Panel " -- with Bob Beckel trying to bring some touch of sanity to the conversation , while Hannity readily agrees to the nutty stuff coming from his far - right guests .
( They all agree at the end that Obama is " the most radical " president in American history . )
Finally , Beckel -- who gets used mostly as a football on these shows , much as Alan Colmes once was -- reaches his limit :
Beckel :
Let me jsut say this .
I 've tried to be a nice guy tonight and be all the rest of that -- let me tell you something .
The idea that the President -- you call the President of the United States a Marxist -- is , as far as I 'm concerned , it 's worse than Joe McCarthy calling people in the State Department a Communist .
And you ought to apologize for it .
Of course , because it 's Fox , no apology is either forthcoming or even considered necessary .
Obviously , Hannity is doing his best to keep up with the competition from Glenn Beck .
So it looks like he 's meeting his wingnuttery quota by calling on his new friends at WND , and its resident nuts are going to become regular fixtures .
How lovely .

Two of his suggestions :
See the Big Picture
...
It 's important not to get too caught up with individual data points or a tiny section in a really big dataset .
We saw this in the recent recovery graph .
Like some pointed out , if we took a step back and looked at a larger time frame , the Obama / Bush contrast does n't look so shocking .
Ask Why
...
This is the most important thing I 've learned : always ask why .
When you see a blip in a graph , you should wonder why it 's there .
If you find some correlation , you should think about whether or not it makes any sense .
If it does make sense , then cool , but if not , dig deeper .
Numbers are great , but you have to remember that when humans are involved , errors are always a possibility .

Web developers need somewhere to host their projects , and when looking for hosting , there are several options .
Shared hosting , where you share a server with lots of other users and have very limited control over the server .
Dedicated hosting , where you have complete control over a server ; a very flexible option , but requires you to manage the whole server , worry about hardware failures and backups , and is typically expensive .
A third option that is in between these two choices is a Virtual Private Server , or VPS .
VPSs not only bridge the gap between shared and dedicated hosting , their virtualized nature provides other advantages such as instant reinstallation of the operating system , quick recovery and backup , and fast and simple hardware upgrades ( the hardware is virtual , after all ) .
Still not sure what a VPS is ?
Read this guide on VPS hosting .
In this article , we cover 10 of the most popular VPS providers , giving details such as where their datacentres are located and what their prices start .
Another UK VPS provider is VPS.NET with a price point that starts at $ 20 for a VPS with 376MB RAM and 10 GB of storage .

Their 64MB instances start at $ 5 a month , and a 256MB instance will only set you back $ 8 .
Debian , Ubuntu or CentOS are the only officially supported OSs , but they ’ll let you install your own , if you want .
They even let you build your own kernel , which is n’t something you can do with most of the other VPS providers .
Linode is a popular VPS provider , and they ’ve recently added a UK - based datacentre so users now have the option of a US or European - situated server .
The cheapest plan starts at just under $ 20 a month and includes 360 MB of RAM and 16GB storage .

The nation ’s labor movement is on target with its point that the risky practices on Wall Street were behind the destruction of 11 million jobs in America .
Labor was equally on target with its demand that Wall Street must pay to create the jobs it destroyed .
The task the country faces now is how to make them pay .
While curbs on outrageous pay for CEOs are helpful they will not do the trick .
What we need to solve the greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression is the most sweeping finance reform since the 1930s so that Wall Street wo n’t be able to go back to business as usual .
Mass support for finance reform is so strong that it is likely some type of regulatory reform bill will be passed .
The task for labor and its allies , however , is how to apply pressure for a bill that will have real teeth .
Wall Street and its GOP backers want to scale back if not scuttle the most important reforms .
There are already some indications that their strategy might be to agree with the Democrats on setting up a Consumer Protection Agency in exchange for watering down other important measures .
One indication that this is what ’s cooking is a recent meeting between some of Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin ’s staff and leaders of groups active in the fight for finance reform .
Durbin ’s staff urged the groups to expand their focus beyond the issue of consumer protection to include things like derivatives .
Durbin ’s staff was saying , in effect , that given the anti-Wall Street mood of the country there is likely to be a few Republicans willing to break a filibuster , even for a good strong bill .
Democrats , if this is the case , may actually have the power to rein in Wall Street .
The question is whether they will use that power .
So far the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress have not clearly indicated which approach they will take :
Will they fight for an aggressive , sweeping finance reform bill and dare the GOP to filibuster it or will they advocate a milder “ bipartisan ” bill .
Paul Krugman , the Nobel Prize winning economist , in a New York Times column today , pointed to some of the shortcomings in the Dodd bill :
“ What the legislation needs are explicit rules , rules that would force action even by regulators who do n’t especially want to do their jobs .
There should , for example , be a preset maximum level of allowable leverage .
There should be hard rules determining when regulators have to seize a troubled financial firm .
There should be no exception rules requiring that complex financial derivatives be traded transparently . ”
National Economic Council Director Larry Summers made a strong defense of the Dodd Bill yesterday , saying it will even eliminate the prospect of future bailouts of banks by the government .
Baseline Scenario ’s Simon Johnson challenged Summers ’ assertions .
“ Larry Summers is incorrect on three important dimensions of the Dodd legislation : it does n’t insist institutions have much more capital requirements , it does n’t restrict proprietary trading activities in any meaningful fashion and it does n’t eliminate the prospect of a bailout , ” he said .
AFL - CIO President Richard Trumka gave labor ’s take on financial reform during an MSNBC interview last week .
“ Wall Street gave $ 145 billion in bonuses last year that are n’t anywhere geared to performance or job creation .
So what we ’re saying is that you destroyed the jobs and now you should pay to create the jobs .
Part of it is a higher tax on carried interest .
Hedge fund people are able to get away with a lower interest rate than what my 85 - year - old mother paid in taxes a few years ago . ”
The AFL - CIO says a tiny tax of three one hundreths of a percent on all financial transactions would yield many billions of dollars that could be used for job creation .
“ I intend to be on Wall Street April 29 with 10 to 12,000 of my friends to take the message straight to the executives , ” he said .

John Roberts has a very thin skin .
The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is peeved that the President criticized the Supreme Court ’s campaign finance decision during the State of the Union :
U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts said Tuesday the scene at President Barack Obama ’s first State of the Union address was “ very troubling ” and that the annual speech to Congress has “ degenerated into a political pep rally . ”
Responding to a University of Alabama law student ’s question about the Senate ’s method of confirming justices , Roberts said senators improperly try to make political points by asking questions they know nominees can’t answer because of judicial ethics rules .
“ I think the process is broken down , ” he said .
I think the campaign finance system is broken down after the Citizens United decision .
Robert Gibbs explained what is really “ very troubling ” :
“ What is troubling is that this decision opened the floodgates for corporations and special interests to pour money into elections — drowning out the voices of average Americans , ” Gibbs said .
“ The president has long been committed to reducing the undue influence of special interests and their lobbyists over government .
That is why he spoke out to condemn the decision and is working with Congress on a legislative response . ”
Glenn Greenwald has an excellent take on Roberts ’ outburst , which concludes :
Supreme Court Justices , in particular , have awesome , unrestrained power .
They are guaranteed life tenure , have no authorities who can sanction them except under the most extreme circumstances , and , with the mere sweep of a pen , can radically alter the lives of huge numbers of people or even transform our political system ( as five of them , including Roberts , just did , to some degree , in Citizens United ) .
The very idea that it ’s terrriby wrong , uncouth , and “ very troubling ” for the President to criticize one of their most significant judicial decisions in a speech while in their majestic presence — not threaten them , or have them arrested , or incite violence against them , but disagree with their conclusions and call for Congressional remedies ( as Art. II , Sec. 3 of the Constitution requires ) — approaches pathological levels of vanity and entitlement .
The particular Obama / Roberts / Alito drama is an unimportant distraction , but what this reflects about the mindset of many judges , including ( perhaps especially ) ones on the Supreme Court and obviously the Chief Justice of that court , is definitely worth considering .
We are often led to believe that judges are imbued with some mystical powers of fairness and justice .
They ’re not .
They ’re political appointees .
For years , John Roberts was groomed for his job by the GOP .
Make no mistake , Roberts is on the Court to push an ideological agenda .
And , that ’s what he is doing .
Obama had every right to criticize the Citizens United decision .
He would have been wrong not to .

It was a beautiful day in Pinellas County , sunny and warm .
I was standing in a secluded parking lot in shorts and flip - flops talking on the phone while I was waiting for Christie to come out of the doctor ’s office ( nothing wrong , she consults on nutrition ) .
I was not really paying attention to anything but was engaged in conversation .
I turned around and suddenly there were 7 people dressed in “ business attire ” walking towards me , now about 10 feet away : Jenny Linson , David Bloomberg , Sue “ David Miscavige is Scientology ” Wilhere , Guillaume “ on no post but from International Management ” Lesevre , Andrew Rinder ( my brother ) , Taryn Rinder ( my daughter ) and Cathy Rinder / Bernadini ( though she uses another name she kept screaming that she is my wife ? ) .
They looked more than a little out of place in their “ power suits ” ( except my brother who was dressed in a polo shirt and looked normal ) .
They started right in — it was just like being in the hole — 7 people surrounding you yelling and screaming “ You are a fucking SP ” , “ Stop doing what you are doing ” , “ You are going to die ” , “ You are trying to destroy Scientology ” , “ You are hurting your family ” , “ You disconnected from your family ” , “ You are killing your mother ” , “ Stay away from Benjamin ” ( this last was a little strange given the statements that I refuse to communicate with anyone in my family ) etc. etc. etc .
The rabble was led by Jenny Linson and Cathy Neal / Rubio / Rinder / Bernardini – doing a perfect imitation of DM frothing at the mouth and yelling obscenities .
Guillaume said virtually nothing .
Bloomberg tried to be Mr. Big and told me several times “ Stop what you are doing . ”
Sue Wilhere said nothing .
My brother who is an OT 8 but not a Sea Org member was the most civil and sensible and actually seemed to want to communicate something other than screaming “ You ’re an SP ” .
My daughter Taryn is a Gold staff member and is indoctrinated into the wonders of Ideal Orgs and I feel some pangs of guilt that I raised her in the SO and that she is now caught in the web of lies .
And of course , lurking in the background were the ever present PIs in sunglasses .
When I told my brother that I would talk to him without the assembled peanut gallery , the screaming only increased with “ Tone 40 ” commands from Jenny to “ Shutup and listen ” and “ you ARE going to hear us ” .
I think he was a little surprised to see what he had gotten himself into .
Little does he know what really goes on – but perhaps he is going to now realize from personal experience that the “ goodness and light ” image that DM tries to portray is n’t quite what it seems .
But , DM could n’t have foreseen that his little ambush squad would approach me when I was on the phone with John Sweeney from the BBC in the midst of a recorded interview !
So , everything the DMbots said was recorded as it went down by the BBC .
Of course , they were under strict orders from DM about what they were to do , so they just barged ahead with their craziness .
That ’s the breaks when people in fear are operating on orders – they cannot make a decision if something changes .
No “ think for yourself ” … .
In fact , when I informed them they were being recorded by the BBC they seemed to take it as a challenge to their manhood ( womanhood ?
bitchhood ? ) as if I was trying to trick them ( cunning SP that I am ) .
So , it was all recorded ( audio only unfortunately ) and they could n’t have done a better job of convincing the BBC of Miscavige ’s insanity and that everything that is said about how people are treated by him and that they will sign perjured affidavits is absolutely , utterly true .
You often hear “ he pulled it in ” – a much overused justification that some ( including DM ) use to explain their overts on others – I could n’t help but think that DM just “ pulled it in . ”
Jenny kept screaming about how I WAS going to listen to them ( I guess she thinks I take orders from her or else she is going to take away my eternity ? ) and I told her and the assembled others to “ Fuck Off ” ( if this ever airs on US TV there will be a LOT of bleeps though they will get the unadulterated version in the UK ) .
I then attempted to get in my car and leave .
A scuffle ensued with Dave Bloomberg , Jenny and Cathy holding the car door open as I tried to close it to drive away and my brother taking my keys out of the ignition as I grabbed his hand and bent his finger back ( until he told me I was going to break it and I let go ) .
It was n’t good odds .
So , I got out of the car to go into the doctor ’s office to call the police .
More scuffling ensued as I tried to make my way 50 feet to the door .
My sunglasses were knocked off and someone trod on them ( my brother later insisted I take his nicer glasses to replace them ) .
By this time , the doctor and her staff had heard the ruckus outside and she came to the door and told me I could come in and nobody else was welcome .
Cathy and Taryn barged their way into the doctor ’s office saying “ he ’s my husband ” and “ he ’s my father ” .
She told them she did n’t care who they were , it was her office and they were n’t welcome ( the rest of the gang were blabbering incoherently at the door ) .
During the scuffles , Cathy had somehow sustained a cut on her arm that was bleeding .
The doctor tried to 8C her out of her reception area and Cathy started yelling at the doctor “ He ’s my husband , and you have my blood on your hands ” .
Pretty bizarre .
That was after she had shouted at Christie in front of the Doctor in her reception area
“ You , you ’re a fucking little bitch . ”
The doctor asked if I wanted her to call the police .
I told her yes , as I wanted the record made then and there as no doubt the Church would try to claim that I hurt Cathy ’s arm and ( of course they waited until there were no other witnesses to approach me 7 on 1 ) .
I have no idea how her arm was grazed , Jenny Linson might have bitten her in the throws of her frothing insanity for all I know .
The doctor locked her doors and she and her staff were too scared to venture outside until the police arrived .
They were literally terrified .
She even called her next patient and canceled the appointment .
More excellent PR area control for Scientology in the Clearwater community !
The doctor also called the paramedics due to the blood on Cathy ’s arm .
The paramedics arrived within a couple of minutes and the Pinellas County Sheriff ’s Department ( 6 cars ) showed up about 5 minutes later .
Of course , the real chickenshit rats scurried away before the Sheriff ’s arrived – Linson , Lesevre and Bloomberg jumped in their cars and drove off as I waved fondly .
But Cathy was stuck in the ambulance , so Sue Wilhere stayed with her .
So did my brother and daughter – the only two civil ones amongst them .
Everyone made statements to the Sheriff ’s , as did the doctor and Christie .
I am sure Sue and Cathy would rather have left , but they were kind of stuck .
Just before the Sheriff ’s arrived , I asked where my car keys were .
The assembled mob said “ they did n’t know . ”
I told them that would really be a problem as soon as the police arrived – and suddenly Sue Wilhere “ found them ” .
Childish is n’t the right word for this sort of behavior .
Now , for anyone who thinks I should have “ pressed charges ” I can assure it would have been a waste of time .
This sort of thing is orchestrated to be 7 on 1 ( not counting PIs ) with no witnesses for a reason .
These people will say anything – even under oath – and would simply claim that I attacked someone first ( not true ) and it would be a long , drawn out procedure that would , in the end , accomplish nothing .
And make no mistake , it was a carefully staged ( if botched ) operation , they waited until I was alone as my brother said they had seen me yesterday ( and all I did was ride my bike with Christie and Shane to the park so they were out stalking in the neighborhood ) .
The police DO have all the statements from the witnesses and they issued a trespass warning to the Church people who did n’t flee .
There was little else they could do .
Do n’t worry , because better than criminal charges that go nowhere – it was all recorded by the BBC as it went down .
And that is far more devastating in the long run .
As for my brother and daughter ( who I did manage to speak to alone for a few minutes ) , I told them they both looked good and I was very happy to see that .
I also told them they do n’t know what is going on and challenged Taryn about the Ideal Orgs and how off policy it is and whether she thinks Miscavige beating people is acceptable .
And with my brother , I asked him if he knew what inurnment is because Miscavige is engaged in it and he is going to destroy the Church through his out ethics .
Of course , under the circumstances they are n’t going to agree with me .
But maybe they will think about it .
My brother asked me for my phone number so he could call me to have dinner , just him and me “ if he can get permission . ”
I gladly gave it to him and told him any time .
But if he is going to ask permission , it ’s never going to happen .
One day I hope he will decide to do it on his own .
If anyone needed current proof that the activities of the Hole are still ongoing , it was played out in full living color today .
It was vintage DM , gang - bang yelling and screaming , attempting to drive in anchor points and intimidate .
Problem is that it occurred in the parking lot of a doctor ’s office in Clearwater .
The doors were n’t barred .
There was no Security Force muscle and there ARE phones with which to call law enforcement .
So , it did n’t work out so well for DM .
In fact , as has become his personal trademark , he delivered himself yet another massive footbullet .
Meanwhile , he sits stewing in massive MWH phenomena , lashing out with wild animal reactions , wondering which of his crimes is going to be exposed next .
And he should be worried .
Stonehenge is impressive , but pales in comparison to the massive stone pillars Mother Nature gave us .
The real stories of how they came to be are as fascinating as the legends that people use to explain unusual rock formations .
England : Brimham Rocks
The Brimham Rocks near Nidderdale , Yorkshire Dales , England are said to have been carved by druids , but they date back to around 320 million years ago when the Yorkshire area formed from sand and other materials washed down from Norway and Scotland , leaving an area known as the Millstone Grit .
Later glaciers carved the land down , leaving the strangely - shaped stones exposed , in the period from roughly 73,000 BC to 10,000 BC .
The rocks now stand at a little less than 30 meters tall .
Some rocks resemble animals or human faces , and have been named for their appearance or for the local legends that grew up around them .
The Brimham Rocks area is owned by the National Trust and is open daily for visitors .

Canada : Flowerpot Island
Flowerpot Island , Ontario gets its name from two rock formations on its eastern shore .
A local legend says that two lovers from warring tribes eloped to the island and were somehow turned to stone .
A profile of a face is visible on one of the stones if you view it at the right angle .
The island is part of The Fathom Five National Marine Park and is a popular tourist destination .

Madagascar : Tsingy de Bemaraha
Tsingy de Bemaraha national park in Madagascar has a forest of limestone pillars .
The word tsingy means " where one can not walk barefoot . "
Water eroded caves and passages through the land , the roofs of which eventually collapsed and left the pillars standing up to 70 meters tall .
The tops of the rocks have a vastly different ecosystem from the valleys , and from the surrounding savannahs .
The stone forest is home to thousands of species not seen outside of Madagascar .

Russia : Man-Pupu - Nyor
Seven rock formations called Man-Pupu - Nyor ( little mountain of the gods ) stand in the Komi Republic , a part of the Ural Mountain area of Russia .
The seven pillars range from 30 to 42 meters tall !
They formed when erosion washed away the mountain that once surrounded them over a period of 200 million years .
Legend says the stones are evil giants who had a spell cast upon them .
The remote location of the pillars makes tourism difficult , but you can get there by helicopter or snowmobile if you are determined .
Northern Ireland : The Giant's Causeway
The Giant 's Causeway is on the northeast coast of Northern Ireland .
Legend says that the giant Finn McCool built the causeway so he could fight his enemy Benandonner in Scotland .
The rock formation looks like a set of mostly hexagonal man made stepping stones , but this is a natural formation of basalt laid down by volcanic activity .
During the Tertiary period some 65 million years ago , this piece of land was near the equator .
Lava tubes pressed up through a chalk layer to form the pillars .
The geometric shapes were caused by crystallization of the basalt as it cooled and cracked .
The causeway is open to the public and can be reached by a shuttle bus .
Devil 's Postpile is a similar formation in California .

Faroe Islands : Drangarnir
Two sea stacks situated between the Faroe islands of Vagar and TindhÃ³lmur are collectively called Drangarnir .
The two rocks are called StÃ³ri Drangur ( large cliff ) and LÃ­tli Drangur ( small cliff ) .
You 'll find them halfway between Scotland and Iceland .
They , along with the rest of the islands , were formed by eruptions of volcanic basalt .
The best view of the stones are from the mountain on Vagar , which has tourist facilities .

Aus Piratenwiki
Vielfalt statt Grabenkämpfe – Offener Brief an die „ Piratinnen "
Zahlreiche Piraten – jedweden Geschlechts – lehnen den Vorstoß der „ Piratinnen “ aus Berlin entschieden ab .
Wurde im Bundestagswahlkampf das Genderthema noch von außen an die Partei herangetragen , so ist es umso überraschender , dass diesmal in einer völlig unkoordinierten und intransparenten Initiative eine Genderdiskussion von den eigenen Leuten gezielt in die Medien gebracht wird .
Die Initiatorinnen der Diskussion nehmen für sich in Anspruch , für die Mehrheit der Frauen innerhalb der Piratenpartei zu sprechen – ohne jemals vorher den Dialog gesucht zu haben .
Es wäre zumindest angebracht gewesen , diese Idee für den Bundesparteitag vorzuschlagen .
Vor allem die Herausgabe einer unautorisierten Pressemitteilung sorgte für einigen Unmut , denn diese Genderfrage ist höchst umstritten .
Geschlechterpolitik ist von Beginn an Thema innerhalb der Partei gewesen , jedoch scheint der Vorstoß der Initiatiorin Lena Simon ohne jede Rücksprache mit den entsprechenden Arbeitsgruppen stattgefunden zu haben .
Außer der PM wurden auch direkte Interviews mit der TAZ und SpON geführt .
Erst mit den Medien zu sprechen halten wir für den falschen Weg !
In den Vorständen der Piraten , seien es Landes - , Bezirks - oder Kreisvorstände , ist der Frauenanteil überdurchschnittlich hoch – gemessen am geschätzten Anteil der weiblichen Piraten der Basis .
Der Vorwurf die Partei sei von Männern an der Basis dominiert ist schwer zu veri- oder falsifizieren , da auf den Beitrittsformularen nicht nach dem Geschlecht gefragt wird .
Vielmehr scheinen alte Klischees den Eindruck zu schaffen , dass eine junge , technologiefreundliche Partei von Männern dominiert sein MUSS .
Doch stellen wir uns die kokette Frage : Ist die „ Nerd " - Partei nicht vielmehr von wenigen , aber engagierten und eben nicht schüchternen Frauen dominiert ?
Denn wird uns nicht ständig vorgeworfen , dass wir sozial unfähige „ Kellerkinder " als Mitglieder hätten ?
Wie sollen die denn die Frauen unterdrücken ?
Die Vorsitzende des Landesverbandes Nordrhein - Westfalen , Birgit Rydlewski , sprach sich explizit gegen die Aussagen der Berliner „ Piratinnen " aus und wies darauf hin , dass Förderung für Schüchterne nicht nur für Frauen gelten solle , sondern für alle Menschen .
Darüber hinaus fühlen sich viele weibliche Piraten durch eine explizit weibliche Gruppierung diskriminiert , da diese den Eindruck vermitteln könnte , dass Frauen nicht in der Lage wären , ihre Meinung gegenüber anderen Parteimitgliedern erfolgreich zu vertreten .
Vielmehr verstehen sich die Frauen in der Piratenpartei als starke Vorbilder , die sich über Engagement und Leistung definieren und nicht über Quoten .
Die Idee einer geschlossenen Mailingliste widerspricht zusätzlich vollkommen dem Anspruch der Piratenpartei nach Transparenz .
In vielen Bereichen sind Frauen weiterhin benachteiligt , man denke nur an die leidige Gehaltssituation , der sich auch die Regierung mit Familienministerin Schröder annehmen will .
Auch ist das Betreuungsangebot für Kinder in Deutschland weiterhin ausbaubedürftig , ebenso wie eine gebührende Anerkennung der Mutterschaft .
Doch sehen wir hierbei die Aufgabe vielfach auch bei den Frauen selbst .
Haben vor allem die Feministinnen der 70er - und 80er - Jahre den Weg für die Gleichberechtigung geebnet , muss diese gesetzlich geschaffene Gleichstellung nun genutzt werden und die Frauen müssen selbst für gleichberechtiges Dasein kämpfen .
Aber das geht nicht über die grundsätzliche Unterscheidung zwischen Mann und Frau .
Wer unterscheidet , diskriminiert und bedient schlicht alte Klischees .
Nur weil meine als Frau geäußerte Meinung nicht anerkannt wird , ist das nicht zwangsläufig auf mein Geschlecht zurückzuführen .
Es sollte möglich sein , Lösungen für Probleme aller Art zu finden , die auf ein Mitglied zukommen könnten .
Sei es beispielsweise die Schüchternheit vor einer Gruppe zu sprechen und Meinungen kund zu tun .
Piraten sind Individuen , die für die Überwindung von Grenzen und Einteilungen jeglicher Art sind .
Sie denken philantropisch und sind daher auch dazu bereit , sich gegenseitig zu stärken , ganz unabhängig von der Herkunft , dem Geschlecht , der sexuellen Orientierung oder auch der ethnischen Abstammung .
Darüber hinaus ist für uns Piraten Emanzipation unabhängig vom Geschlecht .
Vielmehr sehen wir allenthalb unterdrückte Gruppen und Individuuen , die sich nicht zuletzt von der eigenen Sprachlosigkeit etwa , befreien müssen .
Wir hoffen , hiermit einen konstruktiven parteiinternen , piratigen Dialog mit den Initiatorinnen der Piratinnen - Aktion neu beginnen zu können .

Nachdem ich inzwischen gefühlt 500 Blogs und 1000ende Kommentare zu dem Thema gelesen habe fände ich es besser auf die dauer knonkrete Vorschläge aus der Diskussion zu gewinnen .
Wie wäre es mit einer einer Anlaufstelle für alle , die sich ausgegrentz , gemobbt , untergebuttert oder was auch immer finden einzurichten .
Eine Mailadresse oder einen Wikibenutzer , der von mehreren freiwilligen Piraten gepflegt wird und an den sich jeder wenden kann .

Spontan muss ich sagen , dass mir die Idee gut gefällt .
So kann man auf jeden Fall kontruktiv damit umgehen .
Ähnlich wie Vertrauenslehrer an der Schule sollten diese von den Mitgliedern der Partei gewählt werden , denke ich .
Das ganze sollte auch ein ähnliches Konzept haben ( Vertraulichkeit , Unparteilichkeit , Dialogregeln ( wenn es zur Aussprache kommt ) , etc. ) -- Klipper 23:15 , 5 . Mär. 2010 ( CET )
Die Idee finde ich auch gut .
Ich denke nämlich , wie in dem Brief auch angedeuetet , dass die Frauen eher nicht die schüchternen sind ... also das habe ich bisher nicht erlebt ... auch auf dem Parteitag nicht ... also klar gibt es introvertierte Menschen .... aber das sich viele nur über die Mailingliste äußern etc. ist sehr vielsagend wie ich finde .
So einen " Raum " für Leute die sich wenig trauen UNABHÄNGIG vom Geschlecht finde ich sehr gut :-) -- Julia 14:50 , 6 . Mär. 2010 ( CET )

McLaren ’s 2008 world champion , whose career has been guided by his father since he started out in karting at eight years old , told reporters on Tuesday that both felt the moment had come for the relationship to change .
“ We ’ve been discussing it for a while and it ’s only just come out now that we are going to be making some changes , ” the 25 - year - old driver said in a telephone conference call .
“ There ’s no need to rush , but at some stage I will find a new manager . ”
Hamilton , who will be partnered at McLaren by compatriot and champion Jenson Button when the season starts in Bahrain on March 14 , said the decision was more due to his father ’s increasing business interests than any desire to strike out as his own man .
“ He ’s building his sports management business , it ’s growing really fast right now , ” he said .
“ I feel he should focus his full attention on that . ”
Hamilton senior ’s interests include managing Force India reserve driver Paul di Resta and teenage Dutch go - karter Nyck de Vries .
He also has some work in football and is setting up an academy to give aspiring youngsters a taste of Formula One cars .
“ For me , he ’s done his job .
Our goal was always to get to Formula One and be world champion , ” said Hamilton .
“ I could n’t have done it without him . ”
“ He ’s been to every race in my whole life .
I do n’t know anyone who could say their dad has been there every single race , ” he added .
“ Whilst I can drive , there ’s no way in this world I would be here if it was n’t for him -- the decisions he helped me make , the routes that he took and the effort that he put into it . ”
Hamilton said he would still benefit from his father ’s advice but looked forward to being able to just having a beer with him or going on holiday together .
“ It ’s definitely going to feel weird at the first couple of races but I feel positive about it and I think hopefully in the future it will feel really comfortable , ” he added .
The well - known children 's rhyme which begins “ ladybug , ladybug , fly away home , your house is on fire and your children are alone ” is said to have evolved from the practice of burning crops at the end of the season .
Supposedly , farmers would sing to warn the ladybugs to fly away , leaving harmful insect pests behind to be burned in the flames .
In some Christian societies , especially in Europe , the ladybug is linked with the Virgin Mary , also known as Our Lady to devout Catholics .
According to legend , the spots on the ladybug 's back symbolize the Seven Sorrows of Mary , and ladybugs were sent by the Virgin to protect crops .
This explains the origins of the name “ ladybug . ”
Ladybugs are also known as “ lady beetles , ” or “ ladybirds , ” other references to the Virgin .
Many other animals and plants are associated with the Virgin Mary , so she must be a busy lady !
One of the most common superstitions about ladybugs is the idea that killing a ladybug will bring down bad luck .
This would support the idea that ladybug superstitions evolved as a form of protection for the ladybug population , ensuring that the insects could travel unmolested .
Many cultures also link the sight of a ladybug with future luck in love , good weather , a financial windfall , or the granting of wishes .
Having a ladybug land on you is supposedly to be particularly lucky in some cultures , and some people believe that when a ladybug lands on an object , that object will be replaced by a new and improved version .
The most likely explanation for the general view that ladybugs are lucky is their dietary habits .
Ladybugs eat harmful crop pests , so the appearance of ladybugs would have been welcomed by farmers and gardeners .
In agricultural societies , it would have made sense to venerate a beneficial insect , encouraging people to leave ladybugs alone so that they could consume pests such as aphids .
The appearance of a ladybug would also have been viewed as a blessing , which explains the positive associations with ladybugs in many cultures .
Many cultures view ladybugs as lucky , and a great deal of superstition surrounds these small and stylishly outfitted insects .
As often happens with superstition , it is actually a bit difficult to determine why ladybugs came to be viewed as lucky .
One interesting thing about ladybug superstitions is that these superstitions are so universal : usually , superstitions about living things are quite varied , with different cultures attaching different meanings to everything ranging from black cats to mirrors .

I 've had a rather miserable time for a very long time .
I 've had ladybugs come through my window , which is slightly ajar .
One came in yesterday and a new one today .
My situation has n't improved .
I do n't think mine are messages from God .
It 's just very cold outside and they prefer the warmth of my room .
It is mid Winter and to be honest I 'm surprised there are any ladybugs about !
anon938013 March 7 , 2014 I found the comments interesting .
A ladybird did land on my right hand while I was eat my dinner a few months ago , and I 'm thinking it did bring me good luck .
I had volunteered at factory for a few months and I am hopeful I might get a paid job .

I was extremely lonely for a long time when I unexpectedly found a ladybug in the garage early last February ( 2013 ) .
Two or three nights later , I met the man who is now my boyfriend .
Then last October my nephew called me into the living room to identify whether he'd found a ladybug ( it was ) .
I let it crawl on me a little and then I set it on the kitchen counter where it was safe .
A few nights later , my boyfriend and I said " I love you " to each other .
We 're still together .
anon355841 November 19 , 2013 Last Wednesday at 7:33 p.m. , my brother - in - law passed .
While we were waiting in the room at the cancer hospice house for the funeral home to pick up his body , a ladybug landed on me .
Note ; we had been up there for days and never encountered a ladybug or any bug , for that matter .
My wife immediately begin to cheer up .
I 'm almost in tears just reliving the moment .
It was a very tough time for us because we had been taking care of him and saw his suffering but particularly tough for her because she lost her big brother who was just 14 months her elder .
Two years ago , almost to the day and time , she lost her mother .
So this was like pulling the scab off of a healing wound .
Fast forward .
Today was my wife 's first day back to work and while briefly sitting at her desk , which rarely happens , another ladybug landed on her desk .
Again , she said joy filled her heart .
I 'm convinced if God 's eyes is on every little sparrow and ladybug , I know he 's looking over us !
Happy ladybug to you !

We have windows in three different rooms infested with ladybugs .
Our family is going through a rough patch , stressed and arguing , in a new town , in a temporary much too small dingy apartment , looking for a decent neighborhood and house to settle into , but feeling pretty miserable and dejected , not sure we 'll ever find what we want here .
So I hope this is a good sign as some of the other posts read .
Ladybugs have always followed me here and there , but I usually only encounter one at a time .
This is the first time I 've encountered so many , and also this is a pretty bad patch of my life I 'm sure I will always remember .
But I know this too shall pass .
God bless you all .

I came home one evening last week to an infestation of lady bugs at my front door .
As I entered , so did they .
There are too many to count .
Since I live in an RV as we are building a house , I believe there may be some truth to the article 's input of " ... and some people believe that when a ladybug lands on an object , that object will be replaced by a new and improved version . "
They are crawling on walls , ceilings , and everything in our RV .
Two mated on my ceiling .
I believe it is a sign from my spirit guide telling me my depressing reality will change soon .
After all , it is what I pray and ask for the most .

One day I took my little sister to her high school for a car wash fundraiser and as I was waiting for my car to be washed , a ladybug flew on my shoulder .
My mom always told me they brought luck .
Later that evening , we went to a football game and another ladybug flew on me and when the man brought it to my attention , I said wow that was the second one today , so he said , " Really ?
Give me 3 numbers . "
So I laughed and told him three numbers jokingly and it just so happened those numbers came out for the pick three that same day .
All I could think was , " Wow .
I should have played the lottery .
So now I just moved into a new home and just gave birth to a new baby girl and I have ladybugs in my kitchen and in my new baby 's room .
This is amazing and I definitely look at this as God sending his love and blessings to watch over me , my baby and my home !

This is so cool .

A few weeks ago , I was biking down the street near my house when all of a sudden I noticed a ladybug land on my shirt .
St this time of the year lady bugs are not very common around .
so I found it quite interesting .
I then gently let the ladybug crawl onto my finger and dropped it on a long fence beside a bicycle path , only to realize there was another lady bug sitting right where I had laid the one on my finger .
The one that flew on me automatically went on the other ladybug and they started mating .
I found that magical and amazing .
It was at a moment of my life where I was very doubtful about my own spirituality and it kind of put things back in perspective for me .

When my wife and I got married , we were taking our pictures outside our home , and ladybugs swarmed us like we were golden food .
It was incredible .
Now my wife and I are going through a rough patch where she has moved out and I am moving to a different city , but at our first counseling meeting we were talking outside their building afterwards and a lone ladybug landed on her purse .
Weird .
Last night , she came over to get some of her stuff from the house and as I was waiting for her to show up and I went outside for three seconds to throw away something and I come back inside to find a ladybug on my left hand .
At that point I made the decision that when she came over , I was not going to argue with her .
I was going to enjoy every moment with her and cherish what little time we have together anymore .
We had a good time and we watched the newest muppet movie and it was like narrating our lives and what we are going through and all this happened the way it did because of that little ladybug giving me that feeling that everything is going to be all right .
If you read this , please see the message for what it means : even if things are going bad , a greater power is trying to tell you one thing , that everything is going to be all right .
You just have to open your eyes to it .
Please pray for our love to return

I was sitting outside in my back yard .
When I saw a ladybug , she flew up and landed on me .
I then noticed two more ; they kept fluttering around me .
I do believe that they are synchronised with Angels .
I had just talked to my Angels earlier that day , about a job I had applied for a few days before .
As I walked back in to my house , my phone rang .
It was the owner of the place I had applied to work .
He gave me the job .
I have always believed that ladybugs were good luck .
I have always loved to see them , when I do they always put a smile on my face , and make me feel at peace within my self .
Thank God for the beautiful gift of Ladybugs .
Truly a God sent gift .

I do n't really feel lucky though .
I feel blessed !

One month ago i saw a ladybug at the back of my shirt .
I did not kill it .
i have returned it to nature where it belongs .

What does this mean ?
anon104153 August 15 , 2010 I was watching Great Expectations and there was a scene where the boy in the movie sat in the old lady 's garden , then all of sudden the ladybug landed on his hand then flew away .
All of sudden , in the middle of the movie , I felt something on my hand .
I knew it was a bug but I could n't quite see what it was because I had turned all the lights off .
I moved closer to the tv to see what bug it was .
It was ladybug .
Wow !
My bedroom windows and doors were closed and the light was off .
I felt lucky somehow and then curious of what does that mean .
Probably just a coincidence but it was pretty cool .
anon103963 August 14 , 2010 I have ladybugs that visit me every day outside where I sit and read my bible .
They flutter around and some even land on my foot and hands at times they will come and sit beside my feet .
I can even pick them up and hold them and they will flutter away and them come straight back to me .
When I 'm inside i will pass by the window and look out only to see the same color butterfly that always comes around sitting in the same spot where i sit outside all hours through the day .
They flutter in front of the window when i am inside .
I can even go inside stores or everywhere I go seems as if every thing i look at seems to have a butterfly on it : people 's clothing , pictures , designs on toys , dishes etc .
I do n't know exactly why .
I only know God is showing me that he is forever present and with me always even in his beautiful things that he has created .
We just all need to slow down an know that he is forever present in our lives and give him the praise !
We rush through our busy lives and never seem to have time to give a thought at times .
I think that 's just his way of saying here i am .
He loves when we just take a step back at look up and thank him even , if it is to appreciate the beauty he surrounds us with .
No one can look at a butterfly without pausing to stop and think just how awesome they are and how God transformed it from something not so pretty to something beautiful and wonderfully made .
He can do that with us , if we will surrender our lives to him and just let him !

Like the four leaf clover , lucky symbols are identified as such because they are not that prevalent .

Fox cuts away yet again from from a speech on health care reform by President Obama ( watch the full speech here ) , this time to listen in on John " Boring " Boehner standing at a lectern deep in the bowels of the U.S. Capitol .
Watch :
If the fact that Pres. Obama was too good for Fox is any indication , he 's doing pretty well .

Yougov say their internet poll on the debate last night was conducted between 9.27 pm and 9.31 pm .
This may explain why Yougov gave David Cameron a better rating than the other post - debate polls did last night .
For Nick Clegg ended the debate with a very powerful closing speech , probably the best of the evening .
According to the BBC video system Clegg did n't start speaking until 9:29:18 and finished at 9:30:47‬‪ .
So many of those polled by Yougov last night must have voted without seeing his final speech .

All of the computer models of the climate have adopted the flat earth theory of the earth 's energy , as portrayed in Kiehl J. T. and K. E. Trenberth 1997 .
Earth ’s Annual Global Mean Energy Budget .
Bull .
Am. Met. Soc. 78 197-208 .
The attached graph is in all of the Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change , and it is fundamental to all their activities .
It assumes that the earth can be considered to be flat , that the sun shines all day and all night with equal intensity , and that the temperature of the earth 's surface is constant .
All the quantities on the graph are given as correct to the nearer Watt per square meter , but the figures in the paper are shown to possess very high inaccuracy which can never be measured , but always has to be " qualitatively estimated " .
On this occasion it was possible to stretch these inaccuracies to the level needed to provide a " balanced " energy budget .
The total energy entering is made equal to the energy leaving .
In this way it is now possible to calculate the effect of additional greenhouse gases .
If it was not " balanced " and the " balance " varied it would be impossible to calculate .
what are the effects of additional greenhouse gases .
There has now been a change of heart , in the following paperTrenberth , K E , J T Fassulo , and J T Kiehl .
2009 Earth 's Global Energy Budget .
Bull Am. Met. Soc. 90 311-323 .
This paper does a complete reassessment of the figures in the first paper .
Its amended version as a mean between March 2000 and May 2004 is attached .
The earth is now thoroiughly flattened , as if it had been run over by a cosmic steamroller .
Most of the figures have changed .
Those for input and output of radiation are now apparently correct to one place of decimals .
The rest of them are in trouble .
The paper is full of discussions on how they could increase the " qualitative estimates " of uncertainty that might be attached to them , but this time they have found it impossible to extend their estimating ability sufficiently .
So this time it is " unbalanced " to the extent of a warming of 0.9 Watts per square meter a year for the period 2000 to 2004 .
Unfortunately there is no doubt that the earth 's temperature cooled over this period .
This paper is therefore firm proof that the original concepts behind the models are wrong .
It ought to be obvious .
The earth does actually rotate .
The sun does not shine at night .
The temperature is not constant .
Every part of the earth has a different energy input from its output .
There is a correct mathematical treatment .
It would involve the division of the earth 's surface into a large number of tiny increments , and the energy input and output calculated for each one , using the changes in all the factors involved .
There would then have to be a gigantic integration of all these results to give a complete energy budget for the earth .
Only when this is done and repeated over a long period will it be possible to find the influence of increases in greenhouse gases .
The data do not exist for such an exercise and probably never will .
Until then we will have to settle for the methods that have been developed by meteorologists over the past two centuries and hope that these can be extended over time to provide us with a means for assessing the effects of additional greenhouse gases on the climate .
The currently promoted greenhouse theory is dead and its consequences have to be removed at once .

The “ Audi and college girls ” experiment
From HSW :
Apparently girls in China love guys who own an Audi .
I have heard this theory or rumor or reputation .
Whatever you want to call it , Audi , among other luxury brands for some reason became such a popular status symbol of luxury in China .
Most impotently in the eyes of the Chinese girls .
The following story is really about the talks of university girls would strike up a conversation with men that drive a luxury car , in order to find a rich man .
First , one netizen posted the following post …
A while back I read on the forum someone said if you park a nice car in front of a University , guarantee there will be girls coming up to talk to you …
I did not believe it at the time .
Yesterday my opportunity has arrived , I borrowed an Audi A6L from my friend and experimented for myself … of course the car was not mine , it was also not my friends .
He could not afford to buy one .
Xian has so many universities , where should I go first ?
First stop Cuihua road , Caijing University , first parked the car on the side , then got out of the car , leaned against the car and started smoking , I know it looks tacky , but I have no other choice , I am doing an investigation , must sacrifice my image .
Waited for about half an hour , no one came to talk to me , at the most was looking at me from far away …
Caijing University acting noble and virtuous , everyone was so passive .
But I believe everything is achievable with a little trick …
Maybe people think I was a tourist going to Dayianta …
Not going to be discouraged , let ’s continue .
Second stop , Changan highway , recently there has been subway constructions and many people were there .
The MM from Music College , one is prettier than the other .
I did not get out of the car this time , just half opened my door and waiting .
After six or seven minutes , a fashionable girl walked down from the platform bridge , long drifty hair , wearing a tight T - shirt with a multi - folded skirt .
Yes , confirmed she was a pretty girl .
Too bad , she only looked at me for a moment , as if waiting for me to make the first move .
Ha , when thinking about I was investigating , I decided not to make the move .
I waited in front of the music collage for over ten minutes , there were three , four girls coming up to me , some wanted to get a ride , some wanted to go somewhere for fun , some said to go to a bar .
And one of them carried a huge music instrument case , waved at me , panting and said she was too tired , asking me to give her a ride home .
Although I really wanted to take her …
Third stop , Foreign Language University , Parked the car for less than 10 minutes , a decent looking female university student , looked around 20 years old came up to me .
The cigarette was still hanging out of my mouth , that girl came up and said “ hey , Handsome young man ( 帅哥 : [ shuàigē ]
A form of address for a handsome and unrestrained young man ) can I get a ride in your car ?
I have a couple of friends want to go to Xigaoxin , we could not get a bus … ”
I thought about it but left it ; got her number and made up a reason to brush her off .
I parked in front of the Foreign language University for 50 minutes , there were 7 MM came up to me , I talked so much and it made me so thirsty , I drank 3 bottle of jasmine tea .
Did n’t think making up stories was so hard .
But there are so many pretty girls here , however I was not going to stay here for long , going to our next stop …
Fourth stop , Law School , I was just passing through to test my luck , but it looked like there were very few MM here , and also their stomach is bigger than their chest .
So forget it , I moved on !
Fifth stop , Art School , still using the old tactic , after half an hour 4 MM came , all looked good , but not as good as the girls from the Foreign Language University .
…
Last stop , Xian Peihua University : 8:30 pm in front of the school , I was sitting in the car playing music softly and half opened my door .
Kept looking at my watch , 15 minutes has passed , 5 more minutes and I am leaving .
8 40 pm , I saw a girl with a nice body walking towards the car , I realized that I was not going to leave .
The girl got close to the car , lowered her head and looked at me .
She asked me if I was free .
I asked her why .
The girl answered , “ my friends asked me to go to Qinglonghu foot massage , can you take me there ? ”
I thought Qinglonghu is a few steps away , she must have other motives .
I told her to come in .
She sat down and looked at me carefully , said “ you are a Shuàigē ” I was thinking , is every young man handsome to all of these school girls ?
I said let ’s go .
The car started and turned around going towards a cheap hotel in Shajing village .
The girl looked around in the car and said , “ Audi actually is very pretty , especially a new one like this .
But you are still so young and already drive an audi A6L , where is Shuaige getting rich at ? ” I thought , fuck , driving this car really give you “ face ” .
I was not going to tell her I borrowed it from my friend .
I smiled and never answered her questions .
I am not going to talk about what happened later …

A reporter also did an investigation driving an Audi , but he said “ college girls going up and asking for rides ” is just a myth .
The following is his experience .
Reporter and his Audi
March 29 evening 8 : 30 pm , reporter drove a brand new Audi A6L , and another van was following him from far away , there were a couple of camera men in the van .
Reporter drove the Audi to Xian x college , the young reporter imitated the young man in the post , smoking a cigarette , putting his hands in the pocket , leaning against the car , and half open the car door , waiting for girls to come to talk to him .
Time passed by , but on college girl walked to him , he was restless .
After half an hour , reporter saw a tall , fashionable college girl carrying a bag walked towards him .
At this moment the reporter ’s heart was beating faster .
Finally , the girl tilted her head and looked at him but never stopped and walked away .
He started to wait again impatiently , but the college girl targets never appeared .
Finally , 3 student girls passed by , reporter sensed it was obvious that they were looking at him , however they never came up to him to talk to him .
9:30 pm , after one hour , reporter drove the car to another school .
There were many college girls walking in and out , but most of them were couples .
He waited one more hour but no girl ever showed up to talk to him .
Until 10:30 at night , all students went back to their dorms , no college girl tried to strike up a conversation with him like what the legends said .
A Publishing company owner Mr. Liu told the reporter that he has experienced “ college girls knocking on his car windows ” .
Over 30 , Mr. Liu has a business in Xian .
On March 27 , 7 - 8 pm , he drove a Subaru jeep to Nanjiao , parked in front of Xian Peihua University , his friend and him were in the car talking business .
Suddenly , a fashionable college student came and knocked on his car window , Mr. Liu opened the window , the girl said “ Shuaige , can you give me a ride ” Mr. Liu said he was busy .
After that , Mr. Liu signed : University is for higher education , Parents send them to university to study , not to “ Baijin ” ( 拜金 : [ bàijīn ]
To have an obsessive love for money ) .
…

Then on this site , more netizens also tried the experiment and posted their experiences .
busyfish ：
Recently the discussions on the internet talk about University has a lot of girls who “ have an obsession for money ” .
I though Nanning people are very simple , should not have these kinds of things happening here .
However after discussed with friends and thought it was interesting to try , we had nothing to do anyways .
We went to XX University early in the morning , opened up our convertible , and started playing our PSP .
Just when I turned it on , there was a MM , “ classmate !
Our student organization has an emergency , can you drive me there … ”
非伊徳：
After I saw the post , I was excited , immediately drove my Audi A6 and went to the university that rumored with most pretty girls .
I parked my car at a noticeable place , indeed saw may beautiful girls , but they all seem to be in a hurry , as if never saw my car .
I was too scared to go up and talk to them , so after three hours of waiting I lost my patients and left .
蕾丝公子 :
Today I am very handsome , especially handsome , spent 2 hours in front of the mirror and many times almost fascinated myself .
Then I went to X university in Guangxi , saw a white BMW parked in the front , looked like he was waiting for someone .
I went up to talk to the owner “ I am investigating something , can I borrow your car , just to lean on it . ”
The owner did n’t care .
After just a few minutes , indeed a girl student came to talk to me “ Hey , Shuaige .
Can I ride in your car ? ” this kind of words .
I said ok hold on , I go get the car .
The girl was puzzled , when I pushed my moped over , the girl glared at me , turned around and left .

Police have recovered nearly $ 100,000 stolen from a woman ’s handbag at a supermarket car park in western Victoria .
Three people are expected to face Mildura Magistrates Court this afternoon charged over the theft at the Fishers IGA supermarket in Mildura on Sunday .
Detective Senior Sergeant Scott Anderson said police had recovered $ 99,400 in cash , as well as the 34 - year - old victim ’s handbag and personal belongings .
The woman was carrying up to $ 125,000 in her handbag at the time , which she hoped to buy a house with .
‘‘ Some of the money appears to have been spent , but [ the victim ] is very relieved .
She is still distraught but a lot better than she was doing yesterday , ’’ Senior Sergeant Anderson said .
Preamble :
Nerds go farther .
They 're not the biggest boy in the class , nor the richest or most popular , but Fulham have the smarts and could well become the last English team in Europe .
And all because Roy Hodgson is a good coach who has got the best out of good players - you 'll hear no whining or slurring from him about injuries ( despite Clint Dempsey , amongst others , being out tonight ) , resources or " typical Germans " .
On the subject of Germans , we must of course admit that Wolfsburg are favourites tonight : given how frazzled Brede Hangeland was by the movement of Dzeko in the first leg it is almost impossible to see them failing to score at least once , and they 'll probably hit two or three .
Hands up who thinks Fulham will bag enough to go through ?
Teams :
Wolfsburg : Benaglio ; Schafer , Simunek , Josue , Pekarik ; Gentner , Riether , Misimovic , Barzagli ; Dzeko , Grafite
Subs : Lenz , Martins , Hasebe , Johnson , Dejagah , Schindzielorz , Rever
Fulham : Schwarzer ; Kelly , Hangeland , Hughes , Konchesky ; Duff , Murphy , Etuhu , Davies ; Zamora , Gera .
Subs : Uefa 's team - sheet has left this empty , which suggests that Fulham 's non-starters have bunked off to a nearby beer house , or Uefa 's typist has .
Referee : Viktor Kassai ( Hun )
7:46 pm : Sorry , all this talk of great Germans sent me wandering through cyberspace and I had to stop to listen to this fair frau because she radiates quirky goodness .
In other news , the guardian 's fair herr , Jamie Jackson , is in the Wolfsburg Arena and here is what he has to say on the climatic conditions : " Spring evening with a dash of rain here at the stadium , " observes JJ .
" Perfect conditions for Roy 's boys to do their thang . "
7:49 pm : " Nice pithy parenthetical comment on the ref there , " spurts Kenny Smith .
" You reckon Wolfsburg have definitely got him in the bag , eh? Typical Germans . "
Maybe I should have put ( Hung ) , but who knows what sort of interpretation taht could have lead to .
7:52 pm : " Eagerly awaiting your MBM today , " claims Peter Wahlberg , who a certain Scotsman might advise us to treat with great suspicion , what with his name sounding slightly Teutonic an ' all .
" I really enjoy the new ' Fulham the last man standing in Europe ' meme which started floating around even before this week 's disastrous Champions League results .
Though I 'm not sure about the Roy - Hodgson - as - nerd analogy .
I prefer to think of it as the ultimate example of catching more flies with honey than you do with vinegar - and Shaktar , Juve and now Wolfsburg are some very big flies . "
7:55 pm : ITV are interviewing Roy Hodgson on the pitch and either it was recorded many hours ago or German fans do n't arrive for matches until seconds before kick - off , because the stadium is empty , though the sound of someone crooning very loudly in the background can just about be discerned .
Is that you , Jamie ?
Hodgson said nothing interesting , by the way .
Which I guess means I have something in common with one of the Premier League best managers , after all .
8 pm : Here at last are the Fulham subs : Zuberbuhler , Kelly , Nevland , Riise , Smalling , Greening , Dikgacoi ... and the first you 'll notice is that Kelly appears to be on bench now .
There a discrepancy between Uefa 's two team - sheets .
Guess we 'll have to wait till we see the men on the pitch to know whether Baird of Kelly is in fact starting at right back .
Or who knows , maybe Davies will play there again ?
8:03 pm : Well , turns out Baird is starting and Kelly is bench - ridden .
1 min : Fulham get the game in motion .
TOR !
Wolfsburg 0 - 1 Fulham ( Zamora 22 seconds ! )
What a brilliant goal !
Gera played a beautiful disguised pass through to Zamora , who outwitted Josue with a sumptuous flick and then curled the ball past the keeper from 16 yards .
Wunderbar !
Etc and so on .
2 mins :
At this point it 's worth recalling that England have never won the World Cup without a Bobby in the team ...
4 mins : Wolfsburg try to build down the right but Fulham are buoyant and resolute following that early strike and the Germans can't pick a way past them .
The plot thickens ...
5 mins : Ah .
There we see the first signs that Hangeland could be in for a rough evening again , and this time it was Grafite who turned past him all too easily , before blasting over from 20 yards .
6 mins : Dzeko sets off on a dash into the heart of Fulham 's defence and makes good ground towards the box before three defenders eventually get the better of him .
7 mins : Duffs chips a cross to the back post .
Gera does well to meet it but can '\t muster much power - but the keeper makes a meal of it , pushing it around for a corner rather than simply catching it .
8 mins : Etuhu heads wide from a corner .
9 mins : Fulham are impressive on the ball , retaining possession with great composure while simultaneously probing with a degree of menace .
10 mins : Yes , well , that last entry was accurate at the time of going to press ... which was approximately three seconds before Murphy gave the ball away on the edge of his own box , gifting a shooting opporunity to Gentner .
Schwarzer pushed the low 20 - yard shot behind for a corner .
12 mins : A great escape !
Schwarzer spilled a cracking Barzagli volley and Grafite poked in the rebound , but the goal is not awarded because of offside .
The correct decision .
" How did Hodgson resurrect Damien Duff ? " gasps Scott Bassett .
" He 's been scoring again and playing well all - around .
Is he just surrounded by better players or has Hodgson 's man management done wonders for him ? "
Hodgson 's influence has certainly been a factor - he helped bring him on at Blackburn way back when , remember - but also the fact that Duff has been injury - free has helped .
14 mins : Fulham defend that corner better , Etuhu heading clear at the near post .
15 mins : " Help ! " pleas Scott W. " I can't decide which is more fun : watching Liverpool get knocked out , or watching Fulham go through ! "
Follow the Fulham game - when are you next going to see them beat them bother the German champions ?
Whereas you can watch Liverpool get knocked out of Europe for many more years , I suspect ...
17 mins : Another neat move from Fulham culminates with Murphy firing off a shot from 12 yards .
Benaglio holds it at the second attempt .
" Youre right about England 's Bobby - dependency , " confirms Chris Rebbeck .
" Can you also point out that England have never won a world cup without a Fulham player in the team ?
( Cohen ) "
18 mins : Schwarzer flaps at a corner but is rescued by Etuhu , who nods it clear .
Ish .
Wolfsburg come storming back .
This time Hangeland hammers the ball upfield .
" Enjoying the MBM with German TV providing pictures , " brags Olly Bond .
" Their cameraman has just spotted Hugh Grant in the crowd , zoomed in close , for the commentator to describe him as a ' cult actor ' .
Only in Germany ... "
20 mins : Fulham knocking the ball around in their own half , which suits them just fine .
" People have been banging on about Messi all week but I am running out of superlatives to describe Hodgson and the job he has done , " pants Peter Corway .
" This might sound bizarre coming from a United fan but the best game of football I have watched this season based on a team 's performance was Fulham beating us 3 - 0 at Craven Cottage . "
22 mins : Fulham are looking commendably comfortable as they build down the right .
Gera has been prominent in everything they 've done well .
So has Duff , though he curtailed the move with an errant pass that time .
24 mins : Barid gets a few strands of hair to a Riether cross and that 's sufficient to deviate it away from Dzeko , who was lurking ominously at the back post .
26 mins : Misimovic has been effectively subdued so far by Fulham , which is one of the reason why Wolfsburg have n't been able to get up a head of steam yet .
" I do n't think any teams has ever won a World Cup without a Bobby , " suggests Callum Hamilton .
" Bobby Pires , Bobby Carlos , the list goes on . "
Does it really ?
" Although Italy once had Bobby Baggio , Bobby Mancini , and Bobby Donadoni and it did n't do them any good so do n't ask me . "
28 mins : Yikes !
Zamora inadvertently heads a Wolfsburg corner across the face of Fulham 's goal .
Happily for him , no one was able to punish him and it merely rolled out for a corner on the far side , which Fulham duly cleared .
" Forget Bobbies and Fulham , " orders Mark Thorogood .
" Harold Wilson once noted that England only win the World Cup under a Labour government .
Does this mean our chances are scuppered if Cameron and his chums get in ? "
30 mins : Dzeko threads the ball through to Grafite , who had got the jump on Hughes and rounds Schwarzer coolly ... ah , but the reason he'd got the jump on Hughes was that he was offside , so the ref intervenes with his whistle .
32 mins : Another tidy move by Fulham .
Baird joins in too , but cracks his long - range shot well wide .
Meanwhile , continuing our meditation on omens , consider this : England have only ever won the World Cup final when Bobby Dylan has been seriously injured in a motorbike crash the day before .
So Bob , if you 're reading this ... no , on second thoughts , do n't .
34 mins :
As Dzeko is booked for kicking the ball away in frustration after being penalised for a foul on Hangeland , Lorenz - Gunther Kostner decides to make an early subsitution : unsurprinsigly it 's an attacking on , as he throws on Dejagah for a fullback .
35 mins : Murphy stabs a ball through to Gera but Simunek gets there first and then tumbles over to win the freekick .
" I 'm no Tory supporter but surely Cameron can't be bad luck when his party was founded by Bobby Peel ? " tuts Peter Wahlberg .
37 mins : Fulham are the better team here .
They 're compact yet fluent and the home team are really struggling to threaten them .
" Zamora started to perform brilliantly after a small section of Fulham fans abused him at matches and also on blogs , " recalls Peter Corway .
" Keeping in mind that English fans have no problem booing their own players during internationals , Zamora should start up front during the WC .
If he gets booed throughout , he 'll probably singlehandedly win the tournament . "
39 mins : Gah !
Another fine move by Fulham fails to end with a goal because Zamora , after a good burst down the right , pulled the ball back behind Gera , who otherwise would surely have scored from close range .
" We 've also only won the WC ( not toilets ) when it 's been stolen by a dog , " coos John Dove .
" That is not a cue to make some joke about the need to send some Wags to South Africa ... "
40 mins : Gera has a pop from distance .
Gera misses by a distance .
42 mins : I do n't mean to labour the point , but this really is a highly accomplished performance by Fulham so far .
Wolfsburg 's substitution has made no difference to the course of the game , which Fulham are largely dictating .
When the home side get the ball , all they can think of doing now is launch it long into the box , and Fulham are dealing with that predictable threat easily .
44 mins : Somewhat inevitably , that last entry was belied within seconds as Wolfsburg cobbled together a piercing passing move and darn near scored , Hughes ( I think ) intervening at the near post to prevent Grafite converting from close range .
Half - time :
An excellent first period from Fulham , who stand on the verge of their best achievemente yet in what has already been a historic season for them .
I , meanwhile , am on the brink of a slash , so please excuse me ...
The case for Emile Heskey starting at the World Cup is getting weaker every day , is n't it ?
And with Carlton Cole out of form at West Ham , where , in fairness , he may have been hampered in recent weeks by a slight injury , Zamora is clear the man in form .
Surely he at least merits a run-out in the friendly with Mexico ?
" I guess it falls to me to point out the obvious and say that England only win the World Cup in 1966 , " party - poops Mike Hanton .
Or does he ?
" This circumstance might seem impossible to recreate without the invention of time travel but I can't be the only one to think that an armed SAS raid on the International Office for Dates and Times just prior to the World Cup could go a long way towards solving the problem .
Failing that it 's only 1431 in the Islamic calender so just another 565 years to go . "
" I'm writing from the United States " announces Marie Meyer .
I hope this is going to get more interesting .
" I think it is very cruel that
while we are served up endless replays of every PL match , every CL
match , and even some Championship matches ( Cardiff City vs. Swansea is
on at this moment ) , we have n't been able to seen any of Fulham's UEFA
Cup Glory .
I hope either the club produces a detailed commemorative
DVD or , better yet - loads a ton of bootleg footage onto YouTube . "
You can bet your bottom dollar there 'll be a commemorative DVD .
In Harrods , at least .
46 mins : Only 45 minutes to go ...
47 mins : Gentner manoeuvres himself into a crossing position but then directs his delivery straight into Schwarzer 's arm .
Interestingly , the commentators report that Schwarzer did not go into the dressing room at half - time but instead stayed out on the pitch practising shot - stopping with Zuberbuhler .
I 've often wondered why managers do n't let more players do that .
48 mins : Baird booked for time - wasting ... that ;'s rather shameful at this stage .
And not even necessary : Fulham are still the better team , and have been knocking the ball around nicely since the resumption .
49 mins : A pause in play as Davies receives treatment to a minor head wound .
" Tell Marie Meyer that when we are luck enough to draw a Spanish or Italian team then the match is often on the Total Latino Network , " informs civic - minded Adrian Gentry .
" That 's how I watched us honk Juve anyway . "
52 mins : Wolfsburg simply cannot get into this game .
And they 're getting increasingly peeved about that , starting to commit splenetic fouls all over the park .
All of which , of course , plays into Fulham 's hands .
54 mins : Excellent defending by Hughes to deny Dzeko .
The Bosnian twisted and feinted as he made his way deep into the box but the Irishman kept his eye on the ball before stretching out a leg to artfully dispossess the striker .
" I 'm a fan of Bobby Zee , Paul , but you know as well as I do that the presence of Bobby Robson in the England squad that went to the 1958 World Cup falsifies your thesis that we only ever win the World Cup with a Bobby in the team , " carps Scott W. " So we have also failed to win the World Cup with a Bobby in the team .
I know you 're well acquainted with Popper 's falsification thesis , so I wo n't press the matter further . "
56 mins : Wolfsburg are utterly deflated .
They can't summon the vim to pressurise Fulham in the middle at all , allowing the Londonders to stroke the ball around almost at will .
Hodgson can pull up a chaise longue at this point ...
58 mins : Zamora scampers after a ball that was lofted over the top for him to chase .
Benaglio charges out but the striker gets there fractionally first and tries to lift it over the keeper , who had anticipated that turn - of - events and spread himself accordingly .
Good block .
" I 'm following this from the centre of Brazil , " boasts Deirdre Magee .
" I used to have a season ticket in Rufus B's days , I can hardly breathe ! "
60 mins : Misimovic finds himself on the cusp of the Fulham box for practicallty the first time and slips the ball through to Dzeko .
The Bosnian should have shot but , perhaps attesting to how dispirited his side have become , he elects to pass instead .
And it was n't even a good pass , so Fulham are reprieved .
61 mins : Wolfsburg substitution : on comes Obafemi Martins .
62 mins : Dejagah booked for being lippy after Fulham are awarded a throw - in against his wishes .
" To whet your appetite , and fill you with enormous anticipation of wondrous things to come , I will mention that I too am writing from the United States of America ! " warbles Ric Perry .
" As everyone 's probably heard , our streets are paved with gold and our meals are big enough for 3 .
Apparently less well known , if you get your televisual images from DirecTV , you can get all the UEFA Cup , er Europa Vase , matches screened live , in HD , and even in color ( colour ) .
Yup , we 've got it all . "
But no Clint Dempsey to watch tonight , alas .
63 mins : Konchesky booked for time - wasting .
Dear oh dear .
65 mins : Zamora takes down a long ball from Konchesky , holding off Barzagli in the process , and then lays it back to Duff .
Fulham knock it around confidently in the Wolfsburg 's half before Davies attempts to dart past Josue and fails .
67 mins : Puff !
Puff !
Puff !
Fulham have metaphorically sparked up a meerschaum pipe on their chaise longue .
" Nobody has anything to say about Doro Pesch ? " hollers Max Franks incredulously .
" I saw her with Yngwie Malmsteen and Ronnie James Dio in Los Angeles back in 2001 , however much it felt like 1986 all over again .
It was an endless sea of mullets and shirts with the sleeves cut off .
I was far away to get a good look at Doro , but what a hell of a night that was ! "
She is great .
Fur immer .
69 mins : After a Martins long - range effort is blocked , Dejagah attempts to send the ball back into the danger zone but instead balloons it into the stands .
" Come and live in Khartoum , " blurts Mike Ormsby to whom it may concern .
" Every time I turn on the telly , it 's Fulham .
I have written to Mr. Al Jazeera , demanding more Liverpool . "
71 mins : Zamora nicks the ball off Barzagli and barrels his way into the box before his shot is blocked by Simunek .
73 mins : Murphy goes close with curled spoon of a shot from the edge of the area .
" As a Spurs fan , I ca n't imagine Zamora starting for England , " yells John T . " Then again , I ca n't imagine Defoe or Crouch in there , either .
And while we 're on the topic , am I the only one who thinks King should be a shoo - in for the squad ?
It 's pretty clear that Ferdinand and Terry are going to start , and the third - or fourth - string centerback is only going to appear when one of those two picks up two yellows .
And King 's clearly superior to other English options if you 're talking about playing only one game . "
74 mins : Dejagah flings in a corner and Dzeko meets it on the full around the penalty spot , producing a fine one - handed save from Schwarzer .
" Just to get in on the international Fulham fan action , I 'm writing from Argentina , " roars Alastair Lee .
" My colleagues think I am getting excited about a Ham sandwich . "
Why the capital H ? It really must be an exciting sandwich .
76 mins : Oh !
That would have sealed victory !
Zamora clipped an expert pass over to Davies , who found himself one - on - one with the keeper 12 yards from goal .
He took one touch and then spanked it goalwards but the keeper deflected it over with his feet .
" If Fulham play Hamburg in the next rounds and are cast as the home team then the TV graphic will read FUL - HAM , " foresees Matthew Coxon .
78 mins : Dejagah cuts in from the left but then lashes the ball over the bar from 18 yards .
" Can you ask Mike Hanton if the International Office for Dates and Times ( 45 mins ) can get in touch , " enquires Rick Burr .
" At last there might be a way to solve a real cosmic mishap .
The half - time substitution of Dutch winger Bobby Rensenbrink in the World Cup Final of 1974 and his last minute miss in the 1978 final ripped a hole in the space / time continuum that is probably the cause of global warming , the lack of world peace and the poor showing of the Dutch in the Eurovision Song Contest ever since . "
80 mins :
The 2,000 Fulham fans are in fine voice as their team continue to look at ease .
Ten minutes to go .
" A Ham sandwich deserving a capital H must contain loads of ham , " splutters Robin Hazlehurst .
" In fact it must be a Full Ham sandwich , which is I suppose quite exciting at the moment . "
82 mins : A brilliant move by Fulham so nearly rewarded with a goal !
Zamora slipped the ball wide to the overlapping Konchesky , who fired it across goal .
Murphy met and slammed it towards the net but Barzagli cleared off the line !
Murphy latched on to the rebound but spanked that into the sidenetting from an acute angle .
84 mins : Incredible !
Wolfsburg hit another hopeful long diagonal ball towards Dzeko and this time he was able to get on the end of it .
He shot across Schwarzer from 15 yards and it came back off the post to Grafite , who snapped it towards goal only for Hangeland to clear off the line !
86 mins : Fulham substitution : Riise on for Davies .
Nevland came on for Gera a few minutes ago too , by the way .
87 mins : Another long diagnonal ball and again Dzeko gets to it , but this time his shot is weak and straight at Schwarzer .
89 mins : Fulham are toying with the German champions now .
Flicking the ball around mid-way for larks .
90 mins :
Yet another long ball into the Fulham box from Wolfsburg .
This time Schwarzer decides to come and punch it clear .
" Unfortunately I can't ask the International Office on Dates and Times to get in touch as I made them up , " admits Mike Hanton .
" Also I 'd quite like to keep that hole in the space - time continuum as I suspect its the only thing allowing my beloved Bolton to remain in the Premier League . "
90+2 mins : " Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , Roy , " chant the Fulham fans .
It 's may not be poetry but it 's surprisingly catchy .
90+3 mins : Martins hauls down Zamora just outside the Wolfsburg box , to the left .
Freekick .
Full - time : Fulham are into the Europa League semi-final ( where they 'll meet hamburg ) after comfortably beating the German champions home and away , following previous victories over both the holders and Juventus .
Nothing needs to be added .
If such a plan were enacted , a $ 2.75 slice in NYC , for instance , would jump 50 ¢ to $ 3.25 .
Science Daily recently reported that researchers have recommended the use of surcharges ( taxes and fees ) on unhealthy food items like pizza and soda to help offset the nearly $ 150 billion a year the U.S. government spends on health care issues related to obesity .
Doctors Mitchell H. Katz and Rajiv Bhatia published an article titled " Food Surcharges and Subsidies : Putting Your Money Where Your Mouth Is " on Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
The two suggest that raising the cost of or specially taxing food items that are high in saturated fats and sugar will have consumers thinking twice before making unhealthy meal choices .
Their recommendation is an 18 % tax on such items .
On a $ 2.75 slice ( an average price point for slices in NYC ) , that would translate to a 50 ¢ surcharge .
On a large pepperoni pizza from Domino 's ( $ 13.05 ) , that 's an extra $ 2.35 .
This tax would be similar to the cigarette tax that some states have in place in an attempt to reduce smoking .
For example , New York State places a tax of $ 2.75 on a pack of smokes , whereas homes of Big Tobacco charges far less .
Virginia only taxes 30 ¢ a pack ; South Carolina , 7 ¢ .
I wonder if pizza - producing states like New York would similarly tax less for pies if some such bill goes through .
But the bigger question is whether states should tax " unhealthy " foods to reduce obesity - related medical expenses or just mind their own beeswax .
Should n't it be up to individuals to decide how they want to consume their ideal ( or even not - so - ideal ) daily caloric intake ?
And what about the inclusion of pizza in public school and other government institutions ' cafeterias ?
Should pizza be generalized as an " unhealthy food " when there are endless possibilities and variations ?

Knowledge about species and extinction rates is " very poor "
Biodiversity 's ' point of no return '
The world needs a " barometer of life " to prevent ecosystems and species being lost forever , scientists have warned .
Existing schemes , they said , did not include enough species from groups such as fungi and invertebrates to provide a detailed picture of what is at risk .
Writing in the journal Science , the researchers said the barometer would increase the number of species being assessed from almost 48,000 to 160,000 .
The data would help identify areas in need of urgent action , they added .
The article was penned by four leading figures in conservation , including Harvard University 's Edward O Wilson and Simon Stuart , chairman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature 's ( IUCN ) Species Survival Commission ( SSC ) .
" Knowledge about species and extinction rates remains very poor , and species disappear before we know they existed , " they wrote .
To date , about 1.9 m species have been described and given scientific names , but the actual number may exceed 10 m .
" As scientists are better able to assess the conservation status of the species that compose an ecosystem , the more they will understand the health of that ecosystem , " they continued .
" It is time to accelerate taxanomy and scientific natural history , two of the most vital but neglected disciplines of biology . "
Broader coverage Currently , the most authoritative data on the status of at - risk species is the IUCN Red List , which has been assessing the conservation status of species around the globe for more than 40 years .
The status of animals such as tigers is well researched and documented Dr Stuart , who oversees the compilation of the Red List , said it provided a good insight to the health of certain ecosystems , such as forests .
" But it is very weak in its coverage of freshwater , marine and arid land species , " he told BBC News .
" There are a lot of additional species that we have to bring into the Red List . "
At the moment , it evaluates almost 48,000 species , but it is acknowledged that there is a bias towards higher vertebrates , which include mammals , birds and reptiles .
" The barometer would broaden the reach of the Red List to make it representative of all life , that 's what it 's all about , " Dr Stuart explained .
The authors hope that broadening the taxanomic base of the Red List and increasing the database to 160,000 species would deliver practical benefits .
" A representative barometer would provide a solid basis for informing decisions globally , " the authors suggested .
" For example , on conservation planning , resource allocation , environmental impact assessments , monitoring biodiversity trends ... and enabling countries to develop national - level biodiversity indicators . "
' Not acceptable '
The authors , all of whom are leading figures in their field , decided to join forces in order to voice their concerns that the rate of progress was too slow .
" The amount that we are investing at the moment in the Red List to broaden its coverage means that it would take about 20 years to get there , " Dr Stuart observed .
" At a time when everything on the planet is deteriorating , having to wait 20 years before we can measure everything properly is not acceptable . "
However , the scientists acknowledge that a three - fold increase in the number of species regularly monitored by a global network of biologists would come at a price - an estimated US $ 60 m ( £ 39 m ) .
But they argued : " The barometer would , from an economic perspective , be one of the best investments for the good of humanity . "

Dans les murs de l'Hôtel de Ville , on s'apprête à détruire et à combler un des monuments les plus discrets , les plus utiles et les plus grandioses de la capitale , un chef - d 'œuvre bicentenaire : le réseau d'eau courante brute , dont on ne perçoit que le gazouillis au sortir des bouches de trottoir , conçu il y a plus de deux cents ans .
Un patrimoine matériel unique , original , dont la mise en œuvre en " réseau " est au fondement théorique du concept scientifique tant usité aujourd ' hui – la réticulation – , si bien qu'il est aussi patrimoine immatériel mondial .
La décision est imminente et le lobby de l'eau potable fait pression : ce vieux réseau fuit de partout ; il n'est d'aucune utilité ; l'autre réseau — celui d'eau potable constitué sous la préfecture d'Haussmann — y suppléerait .
Le montage est lucratif .
Paris est en effet la seule capitale à disposer de deux réseaux de distribution d'eau : l'un , basse pression , brute ( non potable ) , conçu sous Napoléon Ier ; l'autre , haute pression , potable , conçu sous Napoléon III .
LES EAUX DE L'OURCQ
Le premier est tiré de l'Ourcq , affluent de la Marne , dont le canal , propriété de la Ville , arrive au grand bassin de La Villette , port fluvial qui débarque tout au long du XIXe siècle sucre de betterave , huiles végétales , céréales pour nourrir les Parisiens , qui évacue cendres , tinettes , boues .
Il continue avec le canal Saint - Martin pour embellir ces nouveaux quartiers , populaires et ouvriers , symétriques des Champs - Elysées , et pour renflouer le bassin stratégique de l'Arsenal .
A ces splendeurs ombragées et charmantes qu'il n'est pas question de toucher , s'ajoutent trois grandes branches tirées du réservoir de La Villette , premières galeries techniques , imaginées par le concepteur du canal , Pierre - Simon Girard , pour permettre de visualiser les fuites d'eau et de réparer ; placées en console elles composent le tout premier réseau d'égout souterrain visitable .
Douze fontaines monumentales dessinées par les meilleurs architectes — Percier , Fontaine , — font jaillir l'eau qui doit atteindre le troisième étage des immeubles .
Napoléon
Ier a décrété que " l 'eau coulera dans toutes les fontaines le jour et la nuit , de manière à pourvoir non seulement aux services particuliers , mais encore à rafraîchir l'atmosphère et les rues …
Ce sera un beau réveil pour Paris " .
Paris poussiéreux , sale , cachectique , boueux , devient ainsi la plus belle ville du monde .
Cette eau courante , riante et aérée , tirée des confins , lave les boulevards , verdit ses avenues et ses parcs , vêt et profile ses rues — caniveaux latéraux et non ruisseau central — et alimente gratuitement les citadins en eau claire .
DES ARGUMENTS CONTRADICTOIRES
Le parti pris actuel est rétrograde à plus d'un titre : le réseau constitué au cours des années 1820 - 1850 n'a jamais été entretenu , il fuit et dégrade ou sinistre nos infrastructures souterraines .
Sans qu'aucune enquête sérieuse n'ait été faite .
C'est évidemment tricher .
Les fuites sont par définition ponctuelles , facilement réparables dans les galeries techniques ou lors des " autorisations de voirie " qui ouvrent les tranchées .
Mais si le réseau n'a pas été réparé en deux siècles , c'est bien la preuve que les conduites souterraines ont beaucoup de résistance et qu'elles méritent d'être inscrites au tableau d'honneur du développement durable .
Autre argument : pour des économies d'échelle , on réduit de moitié le coût de la distribution d'eau potable puisqu'on abandonne le réseau le plus obsolète .
Ce n'est pas vrai : le réseau de l'Ourcq conduit une eau quasiment gratuite , claire mais non potable pour arroser parcs , jardins et voirie : une eau qui nourrit le sol urbain aride et qui chasse la saleté viaire au moindre coût .
Abandonner cette eau claire , c'est la remplacer par des volumes à peu près équivalents d'eau potable , traitée , dix fois plus coûteuse .
C'est refaire les chasses d'eau qui nous ruinent : pour chaque pipi , on ajoute six litres d'eau potable pour l'évacuer , soit vingt fois le volume .
Pourquoi user l'eau potable quand l'eau claire suffit ?
Le gâchis a fait réfléchir plus d'un promoteur écologue : filtrer , recycler , clarifier ces eaux usées sur place et les réintroduire dans le circuit est la meilleure solution prise à Tokyo , Abou Dhabi , Houston …
Adoption locale du canal de l'Ourcq et du système séparatif de distribution spécifique à Paris .
UN MONUMENT HISTORIQUE ET TECHNIQUE
Cette infrastructure a nécessité des prouesses techniques et scientifiques qui devraient lui valoir d'être classer au rang du patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco .
Le service des eaux de la Ville de Paris y a constitué sa culture technique : les Girard , Gényès , Darcy , Belgrand , ces ingénieurs y ont résolu de grandes questions quant aux infiltrations , aux pertes de charge , aux dimensionnements des ouvrages .
La profondeur de la tranchée , la pose des conduites , les types de diamètres , bref la technologie de la distribution de l'eau courante aujourd ' hui uniforme est née ici et a assis pour longtemps l'autorité de la technologie française .
Nouvel équipement urbain , cette infrastructure hydraulique engendre le service public auquel nous restons attaché .
Elle provoque une nouvelle manière de penser la rue , l'hygiène , l'urbanisme et l'ingénierie .
La pression et le débit exigeaient des conduites en fonte d'une grande fiabilité .
On les a d'abord coulées sur place aussi incroyable que cela paraisse , puis en usine , acheminées par convoi , posées profondément pour éviter les chocs , recouvertes de sable , dont les propriétés isotropes viennent d'être découvertes .
Les branchements fréquents obligeaient à travailler sur les bords de la rue .
La mise en œuvre et les interventions pour branchement réservaient la pose dans l'espace le moins coûteux , l'espace commun des riverains , qui devenait de fait un espace public .
La sortie des bouches d'eau imposait une légère élévation au - dessus du sol , une bouche pour laisser couler , une pente et un caniveau pour l'écoulement , une partition d'un côté à l'autre de l'espace desservi , un avaloir pour absorber les eaux usées .
Pour toutes ces références , pour ces centaines de kilomètres de conduites anciennes et mémorables , les ingénieurs et les administrateurs de la ville ont mis au point un nouveau profil de chaussée : trottoir en léger dévers , contenant le réseau , revêtu d'asphalte et piqué de candélabres pour éclairer au gaz , réservé au piéton , inaccessible au cheval ou à la voiture ; chaussée légèrement bombée et pavée pour écouler l'eau pluviale dans les caniveaux .
En sauvegardant le piéton des dangers de la chaussée , elle invente un bien commun humanitaire .
Très vite cette infrastructure discrète et imperméable , qui exige peu pour entretenir une grande propreté publique , est copiée à Saint - Petersbourg , Berlin , Vienne ...
L'original est parisien ; le modèle universel .
UN PATRIMOINE IMMATÉRIEL : LE PREMIER RÉSEAU
La réalisation de cette distribution se complique à mesure de la demande sociale .
La circulation dans les trois conduites maîtresses est quotidiennement interrompue par les nouveaux branchements de conduites secondaires et tertiaires .
Le débit varie trop brutalement , les tuyaux éclatent .
Le système arborescent traditionnel est obsolète .
Les ingénieurs interpellent alors la science , la mécanique céleste de Laplace , la mécanique des fluides de d'Alembert , consultent les savants , mettent en rapport la section du tuyau — son diamètre ( D ) — avec le débit d'eau ( Q ) et la perte d'énergie due au frottement sur la paroi interne ( J ) .
La solution la plus économique est de relier les branches comme un réseau maillé : le terme ancien ( rêt ) est réhabilité par le géographe militaire d'Allent ( 1799 ) .
L'ingénieur en chef Mallet , directeur du Service , formule l'équation des réseaux en 1829 : J = kQ2D - 5 . L'ingénieur Gényès construit alors les premiers abaques pour normaliser la distribution d'eau dans la capitale .
Le succès est immédiat .
Dès lors la technologie est appliquée à Londres , Berlin , etc.
L'équation universelle sert pour la distribution de tous les fluides dans la ville , le gaz , la chaleur , l'électricité , la circulation , l'information .
A l'origine d'un immense développement culturel , Internet , la conduite des eaux de l'Ourcq mérite la protection universelle .
Faut - il abandonner ce réseau si original et si précieux à notre mémoire pour cause avouée d'obsolescence ?
L'abandonner reviendrait à le détruire inéluctablement : les conduites rouillent , les courants vagabonds attaquent et sectionnent , les pelleteuses arrachent , les racines cisaillent — comme si nous connaissions avec certitude un site archéologique médiéval remarquable et que nous le laissions sans surveillance entre les mains de fouilleurs sans scrupule ou de chercheurs de trésor .
Les conduites d'eau de l'Ourcq contribuent au patrimoine industriel , bien plus fragile à l'usure du temps et de la nature que les monuments aériens .
Un patrimoine humanitaire à sauvegarder pour témoigner des sources de notre urbanité .
Non pas un abandon mais un entretien , une conservation voire une reconnaissance .
Pourquoi ne pas faire ressurgir les fontaines pour décorer places , marchés , promenades ?
Le changement climatique annoncé exigera beaucoup de fraîcheur estivale : eau cachée n'est point gâchée .

Le Monde
To those who suggest , as many do , that my brain does n’t seem to function very effectively at times , I know exactly what ’s wrong with me .
And I blame my parents .
Never during my upbringing did I hear the words that so many millions of children dread :
“ You ’re going to take piano lessons , and you ’re going to like them . ”
My parents never played any instruments , and the only music in my house was TV - show theme songs .
Sure , there were music classes in my Northern California schools , but with no encouragement or curiosity , I missed the boat .
So what does any of that have to do with my limited brainpower ?
A lot , judging by a growing body of research , and by some conversations I had recently at Santa Monica High .
All of which I bring up in connection with layoff notices received by 10 music teachers in the Santa Monica - Malibu Unified School District .
Measure A on the May ballot would add $ 198 per parcel each year to local property taxes to make up for state funding cuts , which have cost the district $ 10 million in each of the last two years .
In the short run , the money would be used to save 70 teaching jobs district - wide , including the 10 music positions .
It would also keep class sizes from shooting up .
But it needs two - thirds support for passage , which will be no cinch in tough times .
All of which takes me back to April 14 , when David Robertson , a Santa Monica High alum ( 1976 ) , returned to campus , made a pitch for Measure A and was treated like a returning hero .
Robertson , one of the brightest conductors in the world of classical music , was in town to lead his St. Louis Symphony Orchestra in a Disney Hall performance that night .
But he stopped by SaMo High first to hang with members of the school ’s premier orchestra and hear them play Tchaikovsky ’s Symphony No. 4 and Bernstein ’s Overture to “ Candide . ”
Robertson was impressed , but not surprised .
He told the students that in all his worldly travels , he ’s never seen a public music program as good as the one in the Santa Monica - Malibu Unified School District , where he sang in first grade , began studying trumpet in fourth grade and played in an orchestra by 6th grade .
“ No other program compares , ” Robertson said .
In the audience , teachers and parents told me about students of all income levels who have prospered in the program and gone on to great universities , some studying music and some not .
Also in the audience was a friend of mine , L.A. Philharmonic violinist Robert Gupta , a New Yorker , who , amazingly , joined the orchestra in 2007 at the age of 19 .
And here ’s where the brainpower angle comes in .
High school music instruction is n’t threatened in Santa Monica just yet , but the elementary school program could take a big hit , which reminded me of Gupta ’s theory on how studying music at an early age can develop the brain .
And by the way , he ’s no slouch on the subject .
Gupta graduated from college with a pre-med biology degree at 17 and two years later also had a master ’s in music .
“ The corpus callosum is enlarged ” when you study music , he explained to me at Santa Monica High , saying the expansion of that pathway increases communication between the two hemispheres of the brain .
We were backstage by then and Robertson chimed in , saying the visual , audio and motor skills learned in music build brainpower .
“ Any time you learn , what you ’re doing is building a network that will fire automatically , ” said the conductor , explaining how a musician travels along a C - major scale without rethinking every step in the process .
This kind of development is particularly helpful at an early age , said Gupta , because a child ’s brain has many more neurons and is far more active than an adult ’s .
That ’s why it ’s easier to learn music , or language , as a kid , particularly if the brain gets lots of exercise .
UCLA professor James Catterall , whose specialty is the connection between artistic learning and academic and social development , suggests that learning music , in addition to developing the parts of the brain that are tied to emotion and empathy , can activate neuro - pathways and facilitate learning in other areas .
More specifically , said Catterall , who happens to be a cellist , singing and playing instruments over the course of several years “ can lead to better spatial reasoning skills , ” and the benefits can “ spill over somewhat to things like mathematics and language . ”
And yet across the country , if not on L.A. 's Westside , music and other arts instruction are often whacked or cut disproportionately when budgets are squeezed .
They ’re seen as appropriate luxuries in good times , but otherwise superfluous and expendable , despite evidence to the contrary .
In Santa Monica and Malibu , lots of kids will have access to private music lessons regardless of what happens in the public schools .
But many others wo n’t .
And when you chip away at the foundation of a great community tradition , Robertson said , you diminish the experience for everyone at every level .
“ Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy , ” Beethoven said .
But I think I ’ll give the last words to Nietzsche :
“ Without music , the world would be a mistake . ”

Proton sets sights on Ariane - led dual launch market
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : February 12 , 2010
International Launch Services announced this week it will place a commercial European - owned , U.S. - built satellite on the same Proton rocket as a Russian - built payload in 2011 , potentially making the workhorse booster more competitive with the market - leading Ariane 5 launcher .
Artist 's concept of the SES 3 communications satellite .

The SES 3 communications satellite will join Kazakhstan 's Kazsat 2 spacecraft on a single launch in late 2010 or early 2011 , ILS announced Thursday .
Built by Orbital Sciences Corp. of Dulles , Va. , SES 3 will help replace aging satellites providing communications services to the United States and Caribbean .
Based in nearby Reston , Va. , ILS is now marketing the Proton rocket for tandem launches of Orbital - built satellites under a program called Proton Duo .
Orbital specializes in small and medium - class communications satellites weighing less than 7,000 pounds .
" We embarked on a program with Orbital Sciences to configure two of their Star buses to have a dual capability .
We have trademarked that Proton Duo .
That is a unique configuration that is only launching two Orbital Sciences satellites at a time , " said Frank McKenna , ILS president .
The Proton rocket and Breeze M upper stage are capable of launching more than 13,500 pounds of cargo to a typical geosynchronous transfer orbit , the destination for most communications satellites .
But many commercial broadcasting spacecraft are smaller , leaving much of the Proton 's capacity unused .
The Proton Duo program reduces the rocket 's price in the international launch market and puts the Proton in direct competition with Arianespace , the commercial firm overseeing the Ariane 5 and commercial Soyuz rockets .
" It 's a good arrangement because now Proton heavy - lift capability is used for launching two small satellites at an average cost - per - kilogram at 20 percent less than what is available on competing alternatives , either Ariane 5 or their introductory offer of Soyuz from Kourou , " McKenna said .
Cost savings also come from increased production of Proton vehicles by Khrunichev .
The Russian contractor is now building between 12 and 14 Proton rockets annually .
At least eight commercial Proton flights and four or five Russian government missions are planned for 2010 .
A launch in early 2011 could move up to this year , and there may be an extra Proton vehicle available for a new mission late this year , according to McKenna .
Credit : ILS
Arianespace almost exclusively launches two satellites at a time on the cryogenic Ariane 5 ECA rocket , which can haul 10 metric tons , or 22,000 pounds , to geosynchronous transfer orbit .
Jean - Yves Le Gall , Arianespace chairman and CEO , said he was not concerned about Proton 's entry into the dual launch market , citing the Ariane 5's superb reliability record over 35 missions since 2002 .
" What I observe is that up to a few months ago , [ ILS ] used to say that the dual launch was not viable .
I noticed that now they move to dual launch .
It clearly shows that our ideas are not so bad , " Le Gall told Spaceflight Now on Friday .
The pairing of SES 3 and Kazsat 2 is a separate dual launch configuration of a commercial and Russian - sponsored payload , and not part of the Proton Duo service .
Kazsat 2 will relay television and other communications signals across Kazakhstan , but the spacecraft was manufactured by Khrunichev under an arrangement with the Russian government .
" What is designated as SES 3 will now be launched in a configuration as a co-passenger with Kazsat 2 , " McKenna said .
" So that 's not two Orbital satellites married together .
It 's one Orbital and one Khrunichev satellite . "
In the past , Russian payloads and ILS commercial satellites were launched on different rockets .
In an interview on Friday , McKenna said ILS and Orbital are in " serious discussions " with several satellite operators , and the first Proton Duo mission could be finalized in the first half of 2010 .
Khrunichev first demonstrated the tandem launch configuration when it delivered two Russian communications satellites to space in February 2009 .
The Proton has launched lightweight communications satellites as the sole passenger before , including Thursday night 's flight that placed the 5,400 - pound Intelsat 16 spacecraft directly in a geosynchronous orbit 23,000 miles above Earth .
The direct injection allows communications satellites to preserve precious fuel that would otherwise be burned to raise the craft 's orbit .
Intelsat 16 is designed to live for up to 15 years , but it carries another propellant to survive 25 years , Intelsat officials said .
McKenna said satellite operators he has polled would trade the extra fuel and satellite life for lower prices .
" We are getting demand for pairing and lower launch costs , " McKenna told Spaceflight Now .
Sure , you could just sit tight and wait until mega ISO camera sensors give all of our cameras flawless night vision , but what if you have a Micro Four Thirds camera right now ?
Then this lens will do just fine .
Advertisement
Noktor 's HyperPrime 50 mm has something I 've only seen one other time in a consumer lens : an aperture diameter larger than its focal length .
In performance terms , this means that the lens lets in twice as much light as an already dead - fast ƒ 1.4 lens , letting you crank down your camera 's ISO settings to capture a cleaner picture .
In photographic terms , this means that you 'll only be able to focus on a paper - thin plane , giving your photos — assuming you 're focusing on something close by — an extreme depth of field effect .

The lens ships in April for $ 750 , but given the extraordinary aperture size , reasonably high price and relatively unknown manufacturer , and full manual operation — that 's right , no auto focus — it 's probably best for you Micro Four Thirdsers to wait until this thing proves its prowess .

Bruins
What Torey Krug had to say about free agency and the possibility of staying with the Bruins
For generations , physicians were taught that “ the dose makes the poison , ” a “ fact ” first espoused by the Swiss alchemist Paracelsus ( 1493 - 1541 ) .
Indeed , many current physicians insist that this holds true for modern pharmaceutical drugs : i.e. , the dosage determines whether a medicine is toxic or a cure .
Now Dr. Pete Myers — founder , CEO and chief scientist at Environmental Health Sciences ( EHS ) , a Charlottesville , Va. , public - health advocacy group — is arguing that Paracelsus ’ determination is all wrong when it comes to hormone disrupters , such as bisphenol A ( BPA ) .
These endocrine disrupters are unbelievably widespread ( 90 percent of Americans carry traces of BPA in their body ) .
Myers believes that even tiny doses of these chemicals “ may well explain the mysterious rash of modern ailments — attention - deficit disorders , thyroid problems , obesity , precocious puberty in girls , hormonally influenced cancers that have gone from rare to commonplace ” .
In recent decades , testosterone levels have declined and estrogen levels increased in men .
Why ?
Research published in the British journal New Scientist has shown that two plastic softeners called phthalates , also in our bodies , said to be inconsequential when used separately , can effectively decrease the production of testosterone when combined .
FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg has announced that over the next 18 - 24 months , $ 30 million of stimulus money will be spent to study BPA ’s effects on human health .
In the meantime , Hamburg ’s agency has failed to act on ANH - USA ’s petition to consider the effects on children of dental sealants and composite fillings containing BPA .
The FDA remains silent about this subject .

Study links violent video games to violent thought , action
A study in the March issue of Psychological Bulletin , a journal of the American Psychological Association , shows that playing violent video games increases violent thinking , attitudes and behaviors among players .
And it does nothing to promote positive social behaviors .
Psychologist Craig Anderson of Iowa State University and his team analyzed existing studies of 130,000 people from the U.S. , Europe and Japan .
His findings held for players in Western and Eastern cultures , for male and female players and for players of various ages .
They also contradict some earlier studies , whose findings the current authors say are tainted by " selection bias " -- the method by which they selected studies to analyze .
The new study notes that while violence in movies and TV shows has long been examined for its potential impact on viewers ' proclivity for violence , video gaming , a much newer phenomenon , has not yet been so fully explored .
In its review of data , the new research found that exposure to violent video games was associated with aggressive behavior , aggressive cognition and aggressive " affect . "
It desensitizes users and is associated with lack of empathy and a lack of " prosocial " behavior .
In an accompanying commentary , Christopher Ferguson and John Kilburn of the department of behavioral applied science and criminal justice at Texas A&M International University note flaws in Anderson 's analysis , including what they say is his own selection bias .
Ferguson -- whose earlier research is the main object of Anderson 's criticism -- points out that , even with what he views as a bias in Anderson 's selection of studies , Anderson found only a weak connection between violent video gaming and violent thoughts and deeds .
Finally , Ferguson notes that violent crime in the U.S. and other developed nations where video games are played has decreased over the decades during which video gaming has grown in popularity .
The commentary concludes :
Although it is certainly true that few researchers suggest that VVGs [ violent video games ] are the sole cause of violence , this does not mean they cannot be wrong about VVGs having any meaningful effect at all .
Psychology , too often , has lost its ability to put the weak ( if any ) effects found for VVGs on aggression into a proper perspective .
In doing so , it does more to misinform than inform public debates on this issue .
Michael D. Gallagher , president of the Entertainment Software Association , responded in a prepared statement :
Numerous authorities , including the U.S. Surgeon General , the Federal Trade Commission , the Federal Communications Commission and numerous courts have thoroughly and critically examined the social science research and found that it does not establish any causal link between violent content and violent behavior .
Most recently in 2008 , Drs. Cheryl K. Olson and Lawrence Kutner , co-founders and directors of the Harvard Medical School Center for Mental Health and Media , conducted a study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice on the effects of video games on young teenagers .
In contrast to previous research , they studied real children and families in real situations .
In their authoritative analysis , Grand Theft Childhood , they found that ' the strong link between video game violence and real world violence , and the conclusion that video games lead to social isolation and poor interpersonal skills , are drawn from bad or irrelevant research , muddleheaded thinking and unfounded , simplistic news reports . '
But the new study 's authors , confident in their findings , say it 's time to move toward a fix :
Concerning public policy , we believe that debates can and should finally move beyond the simple question of whether violent video game play is a causal risk factor for aggressive behavior .
Instead , we believe the public policy debate should move to questions concerning how best to deal with this risk factor .
Public education about this risk factor -- and about how parents , schools , and society at large can deal with it -- could be very useful .
" Video games are neither inherently good nor inherently bad , " the study says .
" But people learn .
And content matters . "
Do your kids play violent video games ?
Do you think those games affect the way they think or act ?

Southern Avenger Jack Hunter : Slaves to ‘ Settled ’ History
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPCDPhLoA5U&feature=player_embedded
Southern Avenger Jack Hunter : Liberals , and quite a few mainstream conservatives , believe that any questioning of official Civil War history is not even to be permitted .
The controversy over declarations honoring Confederate soldiers opens the question which facts from the Civil War are permissible , and makes yet another argument for getting the government as far away from the public school system as possible .
Part of the reason for the lack of civility when it comes to discussions about the civil war is due to how the war is taught in school .
The recent debate over the moral high - ground led me to dig deeper into the history of the war–deeper than what I was taught in school .
A little research led to several “ that was n’t in my history book ” moments .
Ron Paul had pointed out several times the Civil War might have been avoided if slaves were bought by the federal government to free them .
PAUL : No , I do n’t think he was one of our greatest presidents .
I mean , he was determined to fight a bloody civil war , which many have argued could have been avoided .
For 1/100th the cost of the war , plus 600 thousand lives , enough money would have been available to buy up all the slaves and free them .
So , I do n’t see that is a good part of our history .
I dug a little deeper and learned something new : what Paul was referring to is called compensation emancipation .
President Lincoln did propose compensated emancipation for slaves in six Union slave states .
In the proposal Lincoln sent to the Union states , slaves had the cost at $ 400 per slave , $ 300 in compensation to the slave owner , and $ 100 for deportation and colonization .
Not only did Lincoln propose compensated emancipation , on April 16 , 1862 , it was enacted , at least in the District of Columbia .
After the Civil War started , President Abraham Lincoln signed the The District of Columbia Emancipation Act , which ended slavery in the Capital and compensated former owners loyal to the Union $ 300 per slave .
At the moment , I ’m not so sure about Paul ’s view that Lincoln was “ ‘ determined to fight a bloody civil war , ” because Lincoln supported a version of compensated emancipation ; I ca n’t say I see Lincoln as a great President , though , because Lincoln held a ‘ ship ’em back to Africa ’ attitude .
At the moment , I say I ’m not sure because I have no way of knowing what other facts were buried in Civil War history .
The unpopular and obscured facts from Civil War history I ’ve stumbled upon feels akin to finding out you ’re adopted , because the country I thought I came from turns out not to exist .
GEORGE PAPANDREOU may have spoken too soon .
On April 6th , just three days after the Greek prime minister claimed “ the worst is over , ” the yield on Greek ten - year government bonds leapt from 6.5 % to above 7 % .
Yields remain at alarming levels .
On April 7th the spread over their German equivalents stood at more than four percentage points , the highest since Greece joined the euro in 2001 .
The D - word ( default ) is increasingly on the lips of analysts .
The cost of insuring Greece 's bonds surpassed that of Iceland 's this week ; Greek banks have asked to tap a government liquidity scheme .
Far from coming to an end , the Greek debt crisis seems scarcely to have begun .
On the face of it , this week 's renewed bond - market jitters were caused by growing doubts that an emergency - aid package patched together by European Union leaders last month offers Greece much help .
Under the terms of the EU deal , any short - term support would have to be approved by all of the 16 countries in the euro zone .
German anger at Greece 's profligacy could easily delay the cash it would need should bond markets close .
Any rescue package would be co-financed by the IMF , which may be good for € 12 billion ( $ 16 billion ) of swift support .
But the stipulation , insisted on by Germany , that EU cash would only be furnished at near - market rates meant the deal failed to provide an interest - rate ceiling for Greece 's public debt , leaving the country to suffer every turn in market sentiment .
Senior EU sources say a formula is being discussed to address this flaw .
The interest - rate benchmark would be set over a long period , so it would not be unduly influenced by immediate market stresses .
Rates paid by countries with a credit rating similar to Greece 's would also be a factor .
Optimists are still confident that the government can raise enough funds in the next six weeks to stave off default , though at a high cost .
The government has more than € 13 billion in cash , enough to refinance maturing debt and fund the budget deficit during April .
It needs to raise another € 10 billion - 12 billion in May .
The likely borrowing requirement for the remainder of the year , around € 25 billion , is spread more evenly .
“ If we can get over the May borrowing hump , it 's a relatively smooth cruise for the rest of the year , ” says one trader in Athens .
That is a big “ if ” , say pessimists .
In the six months since the Socialists were elected , spreads have jumped by more than two percentage points .
Greece can no longer risk holding an auction for a new issue of bonds for fear that it fails .
Its Public Debt Management Agency has resorted to syndicated - bond sales managed by big international banks .
But the pools of spare cash that Greece can tap seem to be drying up .
Subscriptions for a new seven - year bond on March 29th reached only € 6.2 billion , just above the target of € 5 billion .
Two previous issues this year were heavily oversubscribed , even if the investors who were allocated bonds are now cursing their luck .
On March 30th Greece failed for the first time to raise a targeted amount when it offered a fresh slug of an existing , but illiquid , 20 - year bond .
In an auction restricted to local market - makers just €390 m was subscribed against a target of € 1 billion .
The bond was reopened in part to accommodate hedge funds that wanted to cover short positions .
Some may subsequently have bought the bonds they needed more cheaply elsewhere .
But for many observers this was a clear signal that Greece will need a bail - out soon .
George Papaconstantinou , the finance minister , plans to lead a roadshow to America in the last ten days of April .
He hopes to persuade American investors , including emerging - market funds , to buy $ 5 billion - 10 billion worth of a new dollar - denominated bond .
It would be a heavy irony if Greece , a member of the euro club , were temporarily reprieved by loans in dollars .
But the fear is that investors will stick to buying the bonds of genuine emerging markets , which have much more solid growth prospects .
It is not yet clear what Greece 's fallback plan will be if American demand is weak .
“ The roadshow will be decisive .
If it does n't fly , the alternative is either a wave of T - bill issues at very high interest rates , or a rescue package , ” says a senior Greek banker .
Mr Papaconstantinou insists that Greece does not plan to fall back on support from the EU and IMF .
But he also accepts that the government cannot go on borrowing at such high interest rates .
Even at lower interest rates , however , Greece will struggle to keep borrowing .
Previous analysis of the country 's debt dynamics by The Economist , based on fairly benign assumptions , concluded that Greece 's public debt would stabilise above 150 % of its GDP .
That burden is probably too much to bear for a small country with such ropy economic prospects : it also implies that a much bigger bail - out pot is needed than the one currently being mooted .
Some buyers of Greek debt may still think the interest rewards on offer are worth the default risk , but they seem to be a diminishing band .
The bigger worry for Greece is not its immediate funding hump , but that investors are starting to lose faith that the country will be able to sustain its growing indebtedness .
The Ten Year treasury yield hit 4.0 % this morning for the first time since Oct 2008 .
Mortgage rates are moving up too and that probably means that refinance activity will decline sharply .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Refinance activity picks up when mortgage rates fall ( for obvious reasons ) , and this graph shows the monthly refinance activity ( MBA refinance index ) and the 30 year fixed mortgage rate and one year adjustable mortgage rate ( both from the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey ) - and the Fed Funds target rate since Jan 1990 .
Notice that following the ' 90/'91 and '01 recessions , the Fed kept lowering the Fed Funds rate because of high unemployment rates .
This spurred refinance activity .
The Fed can't lower the Fed Funds rate now - and could only spur refinance activity if they restarted the MBS purchase program .
The second graph shows the weekly MBA refinance activity , and the Ten Year Treasury yield .
When the ten year yield drops sharply , usually refinance activity picks up .
And when the yield increases , refinance activity declines .
With the yield on the Ten Year Treasury increasing to 4 % , and the end of the Fed MBS purchase program last week , mortgage rates will probably rise and refinance activity will fall sharply .
You 're about to kickbox with a very large , very angry man .
What 's the best way to psyche him out ?
If you 're Japanese kickboxer Yuichiro Nagashima , you dress up as a female anime character .
And you thought pro wrestling was flamboyant .
These clips from the recent K - 1 World Max 2010 kickboxing tournament in Saitama , Japan showcase avid cosplayer Nagashima 's ring entrances .
In a way , it 's not much different from what Apollo Creed did to Ivan Drago in Rocky IV ( only without James Brown ) .
Unlike Apollo , Nagashima won the tournament .

Catholic Scandal Spreads Former Regensburg Choirboys Talk of ' Naked Beatings '
Former choirboys of the Regensburger Domspatzen have told SPIEGEL about sexual and physical abuse at two boarding schools attached to the famous Catholic choir .
One former choirboy says it's " inexplicable " that the Pope 's brother Georg Ratzinger , a former head of the choir , did n't know about it .
In 1998 Hollywood introduced us to a new star when it released The Truman Show , shot on location at Seaside in Florida .
No I ’m not talking about Jim Carrey , Laura Linney or Ed Harris .
I 'm talking about none other than Andres Duany .
A few months ago , I stayed at the magnificent WaterColor Inn , which is in the neighborhood adjacent to Seaside .
Watercolor is closer in feel to a suburban development 's sense of space ( more open ) , but WaterColor ’s Town Center does n't offer a large choice of restaurants , so Seaside serves as a destination .
Other than a sign marking the border , one does not immediately feel as if Seaside and WaterColor are two very different developments .
While both Duany and Peter Calthorpe seem to make claims to be the founders of the New Urbanism , Duany gets more attention .
I ’ve only met him once , at a conference .
I was impressed with his presentation as honest and straightforward , even though I ’m not a New Urbanist — quite the opposite , in fact .
He spoke of his disdain for the suburbs , but agreed that 80 % of the housing market preferred them , and then went on to speak of the benefits of New Urbanism .
What I experienced in Seaside was much different than what I expected from watching The Truman Show .
When the film was released , the main feature of a typical cookie - cutter suburban home was … well , uh , hmm …
I guess you could describe it as quite featureless .
But some developers and builders ventured forth into New Urbanism , or an emulation of the look .
The home buyer was now faced with a choice : the requisite aluminum , white , three car garage door with the home hidden somewhere behind it , or a home with a front porch instead .
Buyers became smitten .
They may have still bought the garage snout home , but the writing was on the wall .
The days of the vinyl clad / garage forward / featureless home were numbered , and if builders were smart , then they had to increase their architectural character .
Many suburban homes gained a porch , some architectural detail , and a somewhat less prominent garage .
Buyers started demanding walks and other amenities … and builders and developers responded until the housing market crashed .
This evolution can be attributed more to the efforts of Duany than of anyone else .
The Duany developments stand apart from some other New Urbanist development partly because of their detail and character , and partly because of their high price point .
I ’ve been to the Kentlands , I’on , Celebration , and now Seaside .
The architectural and landscape detailing is outstanding .
When I went to Kentlands , a decade ago , I got lost ; it breaks from the Smart Growth grid theory .
There was nobody sitting on the porches , and I saw only one person walking .
To be fair it was during the workday .
I was really looking forward to a stroll to the local coffee shop , but instead , the K - Mart strip center defined the entrance with no apparent internal commercial development .
I understand that today there are more walkable services .
On my I ’on visit ( on a nice weekend ) I saw very large homes with only single car garages or no garages at all .
Again , nobody was sitting on any of the porches ( which were spacious and beautiful ) , but there were people strolling .
I ’on is a very large development , and the only one I visited that seemed to be planned on a grid .
The only local businesses ( at the time ) were a chocolate shop , a hair stylist , and the I ’on sales office .
For anything else you would probably need to drive .
Upon entering Celebration we were greeted by massive , majestic homes that align the main street .
Very cool .
This gives a feeling of arrival , as opposed to a suburban development that would typically showcase the highest density and cheapest product at the front entrance ( blame Levittown transitional zoning for that ) .
On a Sunday morning my wife and I had a coffee in the Celebration town center .
We were alone , other than one other table where a real estate salesman was trying to sell one of the homes .
The stores were open , but either people are n't shopping before 11:00 AM on Sunday mornings , or they simply get tired of frequenting that same shop that sells all items with “ Celebration " logos .
Again , not a soul on the front porches , and only a few on the walks .
I distinctly remember Seaside from The Truman Show as well coiffed and manicured .
Homes all behind picket fences .
When we strolled the streets , the landscaping between each home and white picket fence was overgrown , making it difficult to see the homes and closing up space along the streets .
There were no walks along the streets .
There were natural trails in a straight pedestrian system behind each home along the rear yards , with paths so narrow ( about 4 ’ between picket fences ) that I needed to follow behind my wife as we strolled through the blocks ( these paths were not in the movie ) .
Many of the homes had observation towers hovering over the rooftops , cool architectural features that would allow a view of the shoreline .
A decade after the development 's premiere , that open view was closed up by a wall of very large ocean view homes , blocking all those great views that the towers would have provided .
There 's now little tie from the community to the shore other than a single bar elevated above the shops allowing a good view .
In general , much of Seaside is overgrown with landscape that blocks the feeling of space .
We were told by a few sources that only about twenty residences have full time owners , with the rest rented .
There were a few restaurants and bars , and the same grocery store that was in The Truman Show , but the feel of the development was much different than what I expected after seeing the movie .
The main street has rows of Airstream trailers with street vendors selling various food items , something I found distracting from the image of New Urbansim ; very touristy .
The general pattern of Seaside is quite maze - like , requiring us to carry a map as we took a stroll .
By contrast , WaterColor has similar architectural character , but is much more diverse in its open spaces and provides the look of Seaside with a more suburban sense of space .
Seaside homes generally lacked vehicle storage or protection from the elements ; WaterColor homes had the convenience of garages -- mostly , but not all , in alleys -- and some carports .
Garages are an indication of permanent residence , not a weekend jaunt .
They keep many of the cars off the street and out of sight .
Unlike a standard New Urbanism design that separates the garage from the home ( as if a car contained some negative aura that could take control of our lives ) , the WaterColor homes had the garages attached .
WaterColor is a place you can live in , not just rent for a week .
If the nation 's suburban architectural character has improved , I think much of it is due to the effort that Duany has taken to showcase New Urbanism , which has had a positive influence in the overall character of land development .
Whether New Urbanism thrives or it fails , he has left us this lasting gift .
Duany developments
I ’ve visited are beautiful , even with their flaws and their high priced entry .
But architecture and landscaping are NOT planning .
And here lies the problem .
You can take the worst planned neighborhood and showcase it with the Duany style of high quality elements —- his eye for architecture and landscaping —- and it will look great .
In a well - planned suburban neighborhood , on the other hand , the display of repetitive garage - grove facades with plain vinyl siding , void of landscaping other than the requisite sod , will look awful .
As people drive or stroll through the Duany development , they will naturally say it ’s well planned , even if it ’s dysfunctional , inefficient , and has a high environmental impact .
This is not to say that it necessarily is , but you ca n’t feel those things from street level .
The plain subdivision will be identified as terribly planned , even if the plan is functional and efficient with low environmental impacts .
I ’m not a follower of Duany and disagree with much of his ideology .
But I do thank him for making the real world , suburban and urban —- not just the make - believe world of The Truman Show —- a better place .

Introduction
The PubFig database is a large , real - world face dataset consisting of 58,797 images of 200 people collected from the internet .
Unlike most other existing face datasets , these images are taken in completely uncontrolled situations with non-cooperative subjects .
Thus , there is large variation in pose , lighting , expression , scene , camera , imaging conditions and parameters , etc .
The PubFig dataset is similar in spirit to the Labeled Faces in the Wild ( LFW ) dataset created at UMass - Amherst , although there are some significant differences in the two :
LFW contains 13,233 images of 5,749 people , and is thus much broader than PubFig .
However , it 's also smaller and much shallower ( many fewer images per person on average ) .
of , and is thus much broader than PubFig .
However , it 's also smaller and much shallower ( many fewer images per person on average ) .
LFW is derived from the Names and Faces in the News work of T. Berg , et al .
These images were originally collected using news sources online .
For many people , there are often several images taken at the same event , with the person wearing similar clothing and in the same environment .
Our paper at ICCV 2009 showed that this can often be exploited by algorithms to give unrealistics boosts in performance .
Of course , the PubFig dataset no doubt has biases of its own , and we welcome any attempts to categorize these .
We have created a face verification benchmark on this dataset that test the abilities of algorithms to classify a pair of images as being of the same person or not .
Importantly , these two people should have never been seen by the algorithm during training .
In the future , we hope to create recognition benchmarks as well .

December 23 , 2010 : Updated PubFig to v1.2 .
The changes are as follows :
We added md5 checksums for all images in the datafiles on the download page .
September 10 , 2010 : Updated PubFig to v1.1 .
The major changes are as follows :
We recomputed attribute values using updated classifiers , expanding to 73 attributes .
Attribute values now exist for the development set as well as the evaluation set ( previously only the evaluation set had attribute values ) .
We updated the face rectangles for faces to be much tighter around the face , as opposed to the rather loose boundaries given before .
We removed 679 bad images , including non-jpegs , images with non-standard colorspaces , corrupted images , and images with very poor alignment .
We generated a new cross-validation set , taking into account these deleted images .
We ran our algorithm with our new attribute classifiers on this set , obtaining a new curve .
We removed the verification subsets by pose , lighting , and expression , as they were not being used .
Instead , we created a single datafile which contains the manual labels for these parameters .
Some of the datafile formats have changed slightly , to be more consistent with the others .
We added the python script used to generate the output ROC curves
We updated this website to be cleaner and easier to read
December 21 , 2009 : Added face locations to dataset
December 2 , 2009 : Created website and publicly released v1.0 of dataset

Aryan stands for noble and he is not racist ; Letter on hate site proves he knows significance of 14 , 88 and lied to Washington Post
A Virginia Department of Transportation worker who told the Washington Post that he had no clue that his since - revoked vanity license plate contained a “ coded racist message ” has posted numerous internet messages denying the Holocaust and attacking President Obama as “ muslime scum . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Last week , Carl Franzen reported for AOL News , “ Personalized or vanity license plates typically fall somewhere between sentimental and silly , but this week , a photo of license plates containing a coded message of white supremacy made the rounds on the Web before the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles formally recalled them . ”
The Washington Post ’s Brigid Schulte spoke to Melanie Stokes , a member of the state ’s committee charged with vetting personalized license plates explained why 14CV88 was revoked .
A photo of the truck hit the Web a few days ago , went viral on car and other blogs and finally came to the attention of the Council on American - Islamic Relations , an advocacy group for American Muslims .
On Wednesday morning , the group complained to the DMV that the plate contained a white supremacist and neo -Nazi statement .
A few hours later , the DMV agreed that the plate contains a coded message :
The number 88 stands for the eighth letter of the alphabet , H , doubled to signify “ Heil Hitler , ” said CAIR ’s Ibrahim Hooper .
“ CV ” stands for “ Confederate veteran ” — the plate was a special model embossed with a Confederate flag , which Virginia makes available for a $ 10 fee to card - carrying members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans .
And 14 is code for imprisoned white supremacist David Lane ’s 14 - word motto :
“ We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children . ”
The giveaway that something was amiss , Hooper said , was the truck itself .
An enormous photo of the burning World Trade Center towers covers the entire tailgate , with the words : “ Everything I ever needed to know about Islam I learned on 9/11 . ”
In another Post article , Schulte writes , “ Douglas Story , a Chantilly dump truck driver for the Virginia Department of Transportation , says he wanted to grab people ’s attention when he paid $ 224.90 to have a mural of the burning World Trade Center detailed onto the tailgate of his Ford F - 150 along with a sticker that reads : “ Everything I ever needed to know about Islam I learned on 9/11 . ”
“ There is absolutely no way I ’d have anything to do with Hitler or Nazis , ” Story said Wednesday .
He contacted The Washington Post after an article about his plate appeared last week ; the state , citing privacy rules , had declined to release the identity of the plate ’s owner .
“ My sister - in - law and my niece are Jewish .
I went to my niece ’s bat mitzvah when she turned 13 three years ago .
Does that sound like something an anti-Semite would do ? ”
Story says the numbers 14 and 88 on his plate were not references to a white power slogan or “ Heil Hitler , ” as the Council on American - Islamic Relations theorized , but an homage to his favorite NASCAR drivers : Tony Stewart , who drives car No. 14 , and Dale Earnhardt Jr. , who drives No. 88 .
Story applied for the vanity plate in March 2009 , shortly after Earnhardt changed his car number from 8 to 88 and Stewart changed his from 20 to 14 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Aside from the fact that Earnhardt changed his plate for the 2008 race season ( after deciding in 2007 ) , and Stewart announced his change in July of 2008 , the Washington Post author fails to notice that her own reporting contains a major conflict in the two stories .
In one story , CAIR ’s Ibrahim Hooper reportedly “ called the DMV and discovered the plate was registered in 2005 to a Ford F - 150 pickup truck , ” while the other Schulte Post story claims “ Story applied for the vanity plate in March 2009 . ” ( Editor ’s Note :
The follow - up blog written by Schulte for the Post linked below attempts to explain the disparity , but there still are unanswered questions which the reporter was unable to fully explain to RAW STORY ) .
AOL News also reported , “ It was the fifth complaint the DMV had received about the ’ 14CV88 ′ plates since they were registered in 2005 , according to DMV spokeswoman Melanie Stokes .
In accordance with the agency ’s rigorous policies on issuing and revoking personalized plates , they had been under DMV review since the initial complaint .
The agency decided to recall them even before receiving the latest complaint . ”

Commenter CablinasianDem directed us to what is likely his Facebook profile ( same workplace as the Douglas Story in the article ) , and uh … it looks kinda racist !
What with all that Aryan and 100 % white and David Duke stuff .
Maybe this is a fake profile ?
If not , it ’s pretty damning .
If the profile was somehow hacked , there ’s little chance that countless comments by Story at Facebook and at linked sites that contain racial slurs and attack Jews , which go back years , were also faked .

A RAW STORY investigation shows that on November 11 , Veterans Day , Story put up a holocaust denial posting on a Facebook page for the “ Band of Heroes ” game .
Story ’s post , entitled “ Refusal to fight fellow White men for the interests of jews ” stated ,
jews convinced the ENTIRE world to gang up on the tiny European Country of Germany by saying Hitler ’s killing 6 million of us jews ( how ’d he do that ?
there were only 5.5 million jews in ALL of pre-war Europe ) .
No folks , the “ Holocaust ” is really the Gentiles ’ jew masters pulling the wool over our eyes , the “ holocaust ” , or rather , the HOLOHOAX is just that , A HOAX !!!
Never happened , and I refuse to fight in this game “ Band of Heroes ” for the interests of jews ( Germany NEVER attacked the US , so we had NO business in the European theater of Operations ) .
I will , however , fight those sneaky , Pearl Harbor bombing jap bastards ( like my Granddaddy did in the Philippines ) .
In response to another Facebook user ’s comment ( “ Dude , you need to move out from under those power lines . ” ) , Story wrote , “ And Gary , you need to stop listening to jews and the jew - run media . ”

Arguing for days with his fellow gamers , Story later wrote ,
Not at all , the camps were LABOR camps where the jews were forced to work for the German war effort .
How stupid would it have been [ for the Germans ] to kill off your free work force ?
Sure , they [ the jews ] were malnourished but they were n’t killed , and the ovens were to make the best use of limited space , gas chambers were to kill off lice ( the gas the Germans used would have been TOTALLY inefficient ( and if nothing else , Germans are EFFICIENT ) for killing people , but it works great with lice ) .
So more propaganda from the jew masters .
Story later asked for his post to be deleted :
Oh , and Brian , I ’d like to stop , I ’d like to delete my OP , but there ’s no option for that in the forum controls , so I , like Al Felix , ask whatever mods regulate this forum to just please delete my OP , and Brian , I simply wrote my OP as my being disgusted that so many young White American men fought and died defending jews .
Someone please DELETE this entire discussion , I give up , there are too many heads full of mush for my to keep battling day to day , I grow weary .

At Resistnet.com , Story left the following comment last November , “ After he ’s impeached , kicked out of office , tried and convicted for crimes against the people of the United States , this muslime scum NEEDS to be RUN OUT OF THIS COUNTRY ON A RAIL !!!!!! ”
In addition , there are comments at a website called Newsnet 14 : World News for Europeans ” written by a Doug Story from Virginia , which go even further ( Editor ’s note :
Other comments left at the site are similar to postings at Facebook , but the names could still end up being coinicidental ) :
“ Great , just great , now this feces colored animal will get to spend time in prison with his Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ homiesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â  and get to live for the rest of his useless life on the taxpayers dollar ( Oh wait , being a neeegro , he was already living off the taxpayers via welfare ) .
The ONLY upside to this sentence is maybe , just maybe , he might Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ run intoÃ¢â‚ ¬Â an Aryan brother in prison and get killed in prison .
Comment to slobo , he logically should nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t be executed in 30 days , in my perfect world , after heÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s found guilty , he gets taken out behind the courthouse and shot hung by the neck until he is DEAD !!!!!!!!!!
In response to a fellow family member ’s caption on a photo at Facebook ( “ We could not wait for some white people food .
Trust me , you can only eat so much Mexican food , and still go use the bathroom normally two or 3 times !! LOL ” ) , Story responded , “ white people food ” , gasp , how racist …..
I LOVE IT !!!!!!!! ”
Letter on hate site proves Story knows significance of 14 , 88 and lied to Washington Post
For some reason , Brigid Schulte ’s followup story , which confronts Story on his internet rantings as opposed to his statements to the Washington Post , on Friday was consigned to a blog posting at Story Lab .
ADVERTISEMENT
Schulte initially failed to properly vet Story ’s statements , and his defense which stood in the face of countless internet postings was carried by the Associated Press and other outlets .
“ The saga of the Virginia license plate that is either a white supremacist message or a tribute to NASCAR continues … ” Schulte writes .
When I called Story to ask about the Facebook page , he continued to maintain that his license plate message had nothing to with racism .
He stuck by his NASCAR story .
“ Southern white men .
Southern white sport .
What else needs to be said ? ” he said .
Story acknowledged that he thinks of himself as 100 percent Aryan .
“ Aryan is a Sanskrit word that means noble , ” he said , “ no matter what spin the liberal media tries to put on it as being a racist , hate word . ”
He said he is an admirer of David Duke , who , he said was “ reamed by the media because of his Klan affiliations . ”
“ I am a white nationalist , ” Story said .
“ I am in favor of the whites having their own homeland . ”
When I asked him where that homeland would be , he said he did n’t know .
“ The Pacific Northwest maybe .
Alaska .
Denmark .
Greenland .

The message left in January at New Saxon , “ an online community for whites by whites , ” uses 14/88 as a sign off , which is clearly not a reference to any “ southern white sport . ”
The following pic of Story ’s gallery items at his New Saxon account reveal a fondness for Adolf Hitler , skinheads , and racist imagery against African - Americans .

Finally , in case the Washington Post is still unsure about Story ’s ideological leanings or his anti-Semitism , his dislike page notes that he hates “ jews , niggers , race traitors , folks that tolerate and accept jews , niggers and race traitors , ” along with the “ negro ‘ president ’ of the jewnited snakes . ”
Update : A Democratic Underground member found a posting by Story which contains anti-Semitic hatred directed at the very same Jewish members of his family that he bragged about to the Post .

Stellen
Sie sich vor , Sie durchstöbern einen Online - Shop .
Sie schauen sich einige Produkte an , entscheiden sich dann aber dagegen , etwas zu kaufen .
Wäre es nicht praktisch für den Betreiber des Online - Shops , wenn er Sie auf den nächsten Internetseiten nochmal dezent an die Produkte erinnern könnte , für die Sie sich eben noch interessiert haben ?
Und wäre es für Sie als Nutzer nicht irgendwie gruselig ?
Seit vorletzter Woche bietet Google unter dem Namen „ Retargeting “ eine Erweiterung seiner Werbeprodukte an , die genau dieses Szenario ermöglichen soll .
Angeblich soll diese Maßnahme datenschutzkonform sein .
Wir haben uns das mal genauer angeschaut .
Gibt es anno 2010 „ schutzwürdige Interessen “ eines Internetnutzers , die einer Speicherung und Verwendung von „ Retargeting “ Cookies entgegen stehen ?
Der Besuch der Website einer Werbeagentur ( nach eigenen Angaben „ Deutschlands erster Spezialvermarkter “ in Bezug auf „ Retargeting ” ) veranschaulicht ganz praktisch , dass das Prinzip tatsächlich funktioniert :
Man surfe von dort aus auf die Seiten der aufgeführten Referenzkunden , beschäftige sich etwas mit den einzelnen Produkten , und kehre dann zurück auf die Website der Agentur .
Auf der dort bereitgestellten Demo - Fläche wird dann umfänglich Werbung für Produkte dargestellt , die man kurz zuvor so oder ganz ähnlich sich auf den Webseiten der Referenzkunden angesehen hatte .
Bei Besuch einer „ Retargeting “ - Website wird beim Besucher ein Cookie gesetzt , der auf dessen Rechner verschlüsselte Informationen ablegt .
Jede Website , die danach angesurft wird und Google Werbung verwendet , kann mit Hilfe des Cookies beim jeweiligen Internetnutzer , immer wieder und wieder , maßgescheiderte Werbung der besuchten „ Retargeting “ - Websites eingeblenden .
Da die allermeisten Websites heutzutage in irgendeiner Form Google Werbung verwenden , sollte es für Google ein Leichtes sein , anhand der „ Retargeting “ –Cookies die vielzitierten „ umfänglichen Bewegungsprofile ” über Besucher entsprechender Websites erstellen zu können .
Google ist damit faktisch in der Lage , über längere Zeiträume genau nachzuvollziehen , welche Seiten welcher Benutzer in welcher Häufigkeit aufgerufen hat , mithin für welche Produkte und Services er sich ganz besonders interessiert .
Es lassen sich damit auch annähernd exakte Informationen über die Person bestimmen wie zum Beispiel über Geschlecht , Alter , Arbeitszeiten , finanzielle Situation oder auch Kleidungs - und damit Körpergrößen der Besucher .
Außerdem erscheint es keineswegs als ausgeschlossen , dass „ Retargeting “ - tätowierte Surfer auch von Websites identifiziert werden , die „ Google Analytics “ verwenden .
Gleiches gilt für die mögliche Wiedererkennung bei der eigenen Google - Suche , bei der YouTube - Videosession oder beim E - Mail - Versand mittels Google Mail .
Im Ergebnis ist so ein Höchstmaß an personalisierter Werbung im Google - Netzwerk denkbar .
Für alle Werbetreibenden grundsätzlich ein begrüßenswerter Umstand , ein weiterer Quantensprung hin zu zielgerichteter personalisierter Werbung ohne Streuverluste .
Und es wird sicher auch Surfer geben , die sich solche Werbung wünschen und diese als hilfreich bei ihrer Entscheidungsfindung beim Kauf etwaiger Produkte betrachten .
Gleichwohl ändert dies nichts an der Tatsache , dass Informationen über Internetnutzer zunächst ungefragt gesammelt und zu Zwecken personalisierter Werbung zusammen geführt werden .
Das Ergebnis der Datensammlung - und Auswertung wird dem Internetnutzer dann in Gestalt von Anzeigen aufgetischt .
Und damit ist man auch schon bei der Frage angelangt , ob „ Retargeting “ tatsächlich und wie von den Verwendern behauptet datenschutzrechtlich nicht zu beanstanden ist .
Im Mittelpunkt einer solchen Betrachtung hat dabei zunächst zu stehen , ob es sich bei den „ Retargeting “ - Cookies um Daten mit Personenbezug handelt und es damit überhaupt zu einer Anwendbarkeit der datenschutzrechtlichen Vorschriften kommen kann .
Vom Grundsatz aus kann es sich auch bei Cookies um personenbezogene Daten im Sinne des § 3 Abs. 1 BDSG handeln , nämlich immer dann , wenn Google ein Zusatzwissen aus anderen Diensten mit dem Cookie verbindet und damit eine Person identifizieren kann .
Im Falle von „ Retargeting “ soll der Cookie gerade mit den „ AdWords “ - Funktionen verknüpft und mit weiteren im Werbenetzwerk gesammelten Informationen zusammen geführt werden , um passgenaue " Retargeting " - Werbung zu ermöglichen .
Es entstehen so detaillierte Informationen wie z.B. über Dauer und Häufigkeit der Internetnutzung , Alter , finanzielle Situation und selbst Kleidungsgrößen des Internetnutzers .
Da diese Informationen unter Zuhilfenahme des „ Retargeting “ - Cookies gezielt zu Zwecken personalisierter Werbung zusammen geführt werden , muss zwangsläufig auch von einem Personenbezug dieser Cookies ausgegangen werden und damit auch von einem erlaubnispflichtigen Vorgang in Bezug auf das Abrufen und Auswerten der jeweiligen Cookiedatei .
Es bedarf diesbezüglich also der Einwilligung der Einwilligung der betroffenen Nutzer oder eines gesetzlichen Erlaubnistatbestandes .
Da sowohl die „ Retargeting “ - verwendende Website als auch Google „ Diensteanbieter “ von Telemedien sind , ergeben sich mögliche Erlaubnistatbestände bezüglich des Abrufens und des Auswertens der Cookies zunächst vorrangig aus den Vorschriften des Telemediengesetzes .
Als konkrete Vorschrift kommt insoweit nur § 15 Abs. 3 TMG in Betracht , wonach der Diensteanbieter Nutzungsprofile von Pseudonymen erstellen darf , sofern der Nutzer dem nicht widerspricht .
Eine Anwendbarkeit dieser Regelung ist aber schon deshalb nicht möglich , weil die Pseudonymisierung der Daten nicht durch Dritte , sondern durch Google selbst geschieht .
Im Ergebnis handelt es sich bei den Cookies deshalb weiterhin um Daten mit Personenbezug und eben nicht um Pseudonyme im Sinne der Vorschrift , da die Pseudonymisierung faktisch jederzeit von Google selbst wieder aufgehoben werden könnte .
Über den Verweis des § 12 Abs. 1 TMG bleibt somit nur noch der Rückgriff auf die Erlaubnissätze des BDSG .
Insbesondere § 29 Abs. 1 Satz 1 Nr. 1 BDSG gestattet der verantwortlichen Stelle seit dem 1.4.2010 neben der geschäftsmäßigen Erhebung und Speicherung personenbezogener Daten nun auch die Nutzung dieser Daten zum Zweck der Übermittlung , sofern dies unter anderem der Werbung diene und keine schutzwürdigen Interessen des Betroffenen entgegen stehen .
Da die in der Cookiedatei hinterlegten Daten durch Google beziehungsweise durch die jeweilige „ Retargeting “ - verwendende Website zu Zwecken personalisierter Werbung genutzt werden , liegt darin auch ein „ Übermitteln “ im Sinne des § 3 Abs. 4 Nr. 3 a und b BDSG .
Die über die Zulässigkeit der Verwendung von „ Retargeting “ entscheidende Frage lautet damit : Je nach Standpunkt wird eine Beantwortung natürlich anders ausfallen .
In eine Beurteilung einfließen sollte auf jeden Fall der Umstand , dass durch „ Retargeting “ ein neues Level , eine andere Dimension des Datensammelns - und Auswertens erreicht wird .
Und dass es sich bei den entsprechenden Cookies um anonymisierte und pseudonymisierte Daten im Sinne von § 3 Abs. 6 , 6 a BDSG und nicht um personenbezogene Daten handeln würde , ist schlicht lebensfremd , da Google mit den Cookies ein Zusatzwissen aus seinem gesamten Werbenetzwerk , darunter auch die so datenintensiven „ sozialen Netzwerke “ , verknüpfen kann und will .
Man stelle sich Google „ Retargeting “ einmal im realen Leben vor : Nach Besuch eines Kaufhauses kommt einem der Verkäufer nachgelaufen , und hält einem das nicht gekaufte Produkt oder ein anderes ähnliches immer wieder vor .
Er scheut sich auch nicht , andere Geschäfte zu betreten , sondert zahlt diesen sogar ein Entgelt , um zu erfahren , was dem Kunden noch so alles gefällt und ihn weiterhin belagern zu können .
Nun sind die Realitäten im Web 2.0 andere und es ein grundsätzlich begrüßenswerter Umstand , dass eine Entwicklung stattgefunden hat von ehemals dumpfer Bannerwerbung hin zu fein austarierter personalisierter Werbung , womit auch ein spürbarer Mehrwert für den Kunden und Internetnutzer einher gehen kann .
Gleichwohl kann es nicht darum gehen , diese personalisierte Werbung um jeden Preis und unter Missachtung des Datenschutzrechtes zu realisieren , auch wenn dieses mit dem raschen technischen Wandel der letzten Jahre nicht Schritt halten konnte .
Nach wie vor und immer wieder sollte daher ganz nüchtern abgewogen werden , was im „ Web 2.0 “ unter den datenschutzrechtlichen relevanten „ schutzwürdigen Interessen “ der Internetnutzer zu verstehen ist .
Pauschale Formulierungen wie „ datenschutzrechtlich unbedenklich “ oder einfache Hinweise auf ein von Google angebotenes „ Opt - Out “ genügen einer solchen Abwägung nicht .

Big planet or companion brown dwarf ?
Using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Gemini Observatory , astronomers have discovered an unusual object orbiting a brown dwarf , and its discovery could fuel additional debate about what exactly constitutes a planet .
The object circles a nearby brown dwarf in the Taurus star - forming region with an orbit approximately 3.6 billion kilometers ( 2.25 billion miles ) out , about the same as Saturn from our sun .
The astronomers say it is the right size for a planet , but they believe the object formed in less than 1 million years — the approximate age of the brown dwarf — and much faster than the predicted time it takes to build planets according to conventional theories .
Kamen Todorov of Penn State University and his team conducted a survey of 32 young brown dwarfs in the Taurus region .
The object orbits the brown dwarf 2 M J044144 and is about 5 - 10 times the mass of Jupiter .
Brown dwarfs are objects that typically are tens of times the mass of Jupiter and are too small to sustain nuclear fusion to shine as stars do .
While there has been a lot of discussion in the context of the Pluto debate over how small an object can be and still be called a planet , this new observation addresses the question at the other end of the size spectrum :
How small can an object be and still be a brown dwarf rather than a planet ?
This new companion is within the range of masses observed for planets around stars , but again , the astronomers are n’t sure if it is a planet or a companion brown dwarf star .
The answer is strongly connected to the mechanism by which the companion most likely formed .
The Hubble new release offers these three possible scenarios for how the object may have formed :
Dust in a circumstellar disk slowly agglomerates to form a rocky planet 10 times larger than Earth , which then accumulates a large gaseous envelope ; a lump of gas in the disk quickly collapses to form an object the size of a gas giant planet ; or , rather than forming in a disk , a companion forms directly from the collapse of the vast cloud of gas and dust in the same manner as a star ( or brown dwarf ) .
If the last scenario is correct , then this discovery demonstrates that planetary - mass bodies can be made through the same mechanism that builds stars .
This is the likely solution because the companion is too young to have formed by the first scenario , which is very slow .
The second mechanism occurs rapidly , but the disk around the central brown dwarf probably did not contain enough material to make an object with a mass of 5 - 10 Jupiter masses .
“ The most interesting implication of this result is that it shows that the process that makes binary stars extends all the way down to planetary masses .
So it appears that nature is able to make planetary - mass companions through two very different mechanisms , ” said team member Kevin Luhman of the Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds at Penn State University .
If the mystery companion formed through cloud collapse and fragmentation , as stellar binary systems do , then it is not a planet by definition because planets build up inside disks .
The mass of the companion is estimated by comparing its brightness to the luminosities predicted by theoretical evolutionary models for objects at various masses for an age of 1 million years .
Further supporting evidence comes from the presence of a very nearby binary system that contains a small red star and a brown dwarf .
Luhman thinks that all four objects may have formed in the same cloud collapse , making this in actuality a quadruple system .
“ The configuration closely resembles quadruple star systems , suggesting that all of its components formed like stars , ” he said .
The team ’s research is being published in an upcoming issue of The Astrophysical Journal .

Hello there my fellow wizarding triangles ,
Again it has been a very long time since the last update .
We are now in 2018 , the tenth year since Triangle Wizard 's initial release back in 2008 .
The last few years there have been only a few updates .
The main reasons were my PhD and me moving on to other projects .
However , bugs were reported and so I answered the call with an update .
Two actually ; the first was just the quick bug fix , the second adds some new content .
Patch R 17.03 and R 17.02 Notes :
- Fixed bug where sometimes you could no longer cast any spells .
- Added Mimisica , The Dame of Pleasure , as a new deity .
NOTE : I ’ve moved the list to it ’s own dedicated page so that I can manage it a little easier so for the most up - to - date list , go to the following page .
I ’ve been meaning to do a roll - up of top JavaScript , CSS & HTML development tools that I use or have been recommended to me and after having lunch with my bud Brian Wilpon today , I realized I just needed to do it .
He asked me what some of the newer tools are and I think this is the best way to help him ( and the community in general ) .
It ’s definitely not an all - inclusive list so if you see some that you feel I should add or remove , let me know in the comments .
Here they are by category :
Debugging Tools That Make Life MUCH Easier :
Effectively debugging JavaScript applications is a royal pain in the derriere and to compile that , the available tools just do n’t stand up to those used by managed code developers .
Luckily , we do have a decent set of tools that lessens the pain substantially .
Firebug is definitely a must have since it incorporates so much DOM & XHR introspection as well as the Web Developer Toolbar .
Both are simply awesome .
I also love Charles for HTTP sniffing and it ’s saved my butt when Firebug could n’t handle it .
IE8 Developer Tools – Microsoft ’s browser debugger tools
Firebug – Mozilla ’s browser debugger add - on
WebKit Web Inspector – Webkit ’s browser debugger tools
Fiddler – HTTP Sniffer .
Great for seeing Ajax requests .
Charles – HTTP Sniffer .
Great for seeing Ajax requests .
( my personal fav )
Service Capture – HTTP Sniffer .
Great for seeing Ajax requests .
dynaTrace Ajax – HTTP performance analyzer
Web Developer ’s Toolbar – All purpose Firefox toolbar to inspect everything on a page
YSlow – Analyzes page performance based on accepted industry best practices .
PageSpeed – Analyzes page performance based on accepted industry best practices .
DebugBar –
An IE plugin that brings advanced debugging features to IE including JS , DOM & HTTP inspection
CSS Editors :
I prefer to write my CSS code by hand .
Call me old - school but many swear by the following CSS editors .
CSSEdit by MacRabbit ( Mac only ) is especially loved by many designers .
TopStyle
Rapid CSS
Xyle
Stylizer
CSSEdit
CSS Frameworks :
These frameworks have really taken off .
Like their JavaScript brethren , they help to abstract much of the complexity of building consistent layouts in cross - browser fashion .
They ’re definitely something I need to look into more and from what I ’ve read , 960 GS & Blueprint are the ones people are looking at .
960 Grid System
Blueprint CSS Framework
YAML
Yahoo YUI Grids CSS
Tripoli
Object - Oriented CSS
CSS Resets :
Want to minimize browser inconsistencies ?
Then use a CSS reset stylesheet to specify baseline CSS styles that make browser presentation defaults more consistent .
Meyer Reset by Eric Meyer
YUI2 : Reset CSS
IECSS
JavaScript Libraries :
I definitely recommend everyone to learn JavaScript as you ’ll need it to be a really effective client - side developer .
With that said , a good JS library will go a long way to making your development faster and much more stable .
These libraries are all very mature and dramatically help to abstract the complexities of cross - browser development .
My personal favorite is jQuery , of which I ’m a member of the project team .
jQuery
j Query UI
Prototype
MooTools
Dojo
YUI
JavaScriptMVC
qooxdoo
Ext JS
Adobe Spry
Raphael.js – simplifies working with vector graphics on the web
LabJS Dynamic Script Loader – Allows execution and load management of JavaScript files
Lawnchair – A lightweight client - side JSON document store
Sessvars.js – Client - side session data management solution
Reactive Extensions For JS
PURE JS Templating Lib
Underscore.js – Utility lib for jQuery that provides a ton of extended functionality
JavaScript Minifiers
Every byte counts when you ’re sending files via HTTP and best practices dictate that on a production , you need to optimize all of your files to minimize page load times .
Compressing JavaScript code is one of the easiest ways to do that and these tools will help .
On the jQuery project , we ’ve started using Google ’s Closure compiler because it ’s generated the best compression .
Try all of them out to see which suits you best .
YUI compressor
Closure compiler
JSMIN
Dean Edward ’s Packer
Microsoft Ajax Minifer
Dojo Shrinksafe
JavaScript Shells
There are times when you just want to test a snippet of code without actually going through the trouble of creating a full page .
That ’s where JavaScript shells shine .
JSFiddle and JSBin both rock because apart from supporting plain ole JS , they also allow you to include a host of libraries including jQuery , MooTools , & Dojo .
jsfiddle.net
JSBin
mootools.net / shell ( MooTools - specific )
Color Management :
As a programmer , I ’m insanely color scheme challenged .
I ’m inclined to mix yellow with mauve causing a concerted moan to occur across the design community .
Luckily , these tools help you choose web safe color schemes that are not only consistent but wo n’t burn the eyeballs off your site visitors . :)
Colourlovers
Kuler
Editors and IDEs :
I work at Microsoft so you would expect me to be a Visual Studio whiz .
Not so .
Only recently starting at MS , I ’ve only dipped my toe in the VS waters .
What I ’ve seen though has impressed me but I still have a long way to go before I understand it .
If you ’re on a Mac , though , I do highly recommend both TextMate and Coda .
Both are truly awesome .
I ’ve used Coda a little more because I liked the UI of it a little better than TextMate ’s but TM ’s bundle system and ecosystem is amazing .
You can get code - complete for just about anything via bundles .
For Windows , Notepad ++ has been just awesome .
I wish it had built - in FTP support like UltraEdit .
Visual Studio
Expression
TextMate
Coda
UltraEdit
Komodo IDE
Notepad ++
Notepad2
BBEdit
Aptana

Sublime Text
WebStorm
VIM
Eclipse
Netbeans
Geany
Wireframing :
I know some of you are cowboys ( or cowgirls ) and you just want to start hacking .
Well , for the truly impatient , these tools at least let you wireframe your pages quickly and easily .
I ’ve used Balsamiq and FlairBuilder and both rock .
It seems that FlairBuilder is really cranking it up with some nice features .
Both are Adobe AIR apps which means they ’re cross-platform .
Omnigraffle
Balsamiq
FlairBuilder
Visio
Axure
WireframeSketcher
Browser Testing :
I ’ve been fortunate to have multiple OS versions over the years .
My wife would definitely prefer for me to have a couple of less PCs sitting around but it ’s let me test out my web apps on a variety of platforms , browsers and OSes .
Shoot , I even have a version of IE6 !
For those with less hardware , these services should definitely help .
Note that services like BrowserCam & Gomez are subscription - based but worth the cash if you can afford it .
BrowserCam
Adobe BrowserLab
Microsoft Expression Web SuperPreview for IE
Gomez
TredoSoft MultipleIE
CrossBrowserTesting
Multi-Safari
Browserscope
Cuzillion
IETester
Testing ( based on the list by John Resig ) :
This was a list I snagged from John Resig .
Obviously , he ’s done a boatload of testing so I know this list rocks .
JSLint is the old mainstay created by Douglas Crockford but other have really become increasingly essential to good testing .
j Query developers should definitely be looking at QUnit & jQuery - Lint .
The most complete tool is Selenium but it does have a bit of a learning curve .
If you ’re into determining JS performance , checkout SunSpider , Dromaeo , Google ’s V8 Benchmark and JSLitmus .
These measure the performance of the JS engine , not your apps .
JSLint
j Query Lint

The books below are really a great selection .
I have many in my own library and every so often re-read them I ’m currently reading High Performance JavaScript by Nicholas Zakas .
Another great book is Stoyan Stefanov ’s Object - Oriented JavaScript : Create scalable , reusable high - quality JavaScript applications and libraries .
I also highly recommend Steve Souders performance book at the bottom of the list .
They ’re basically the definitive sources for optimizing your web apps .

Glenn Greenwald and Julian Assange set the record straight on frequent misreporting of the discovery of U.S. military atrocities .
Today at Democracy Now ! , Glenn Greenwald of Salon and WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange , made points on analyzing the recently released video showing U.S. soldiers indiscriminately firing on civilians in Iraq .
The first point is that what occurred in the video and what ’s been discovered of U.S. special forces staging their massacre of pregnant Afghan women as ‘ honor killings ’ do not occur at rare incidences .
The actions of the soldiers , the cover - up ’s , the obstructionism and the media as a branch of government propaganda are all “ standard operating procedure ” , according to Mr. Greenwald .
These are n’t ‘ man , that ’s some crazy shit ’ circumstances , but , according to Mr. Assange , actually “ another day at the office ” for soldiers following orders that trickle down , directly or indirectly , from the White House and the Office of Legal Counsel and the Pentagon and the Justice Department and Central Command .
There ’s no reasonable dispute against this claim .
Case and point : the Defense Department ’s investigation of the New Baghdad Massacre , having the same videos we all saw , clearing all soldiers of any wrongdoing . [ .pdf ]
Second , many more than 12 civilians were killed in the New Baghdad Massacre shown the WikiLeaks video .
A Hellfire missile struck an apartment complex with three families living in it , according to documents recovered by WikiLeaks .
“ My concern with the discussions that have been triggered , though , is that there seems to be the suggestion , in many circles — not , of course , by Julian — that this is some sort of extreme event , or this is some sort of aberration , and that ’s the reason why we ’re all talking about it and are horrified about it , ” Mr. Greenwald said .
“ In fact , it ’s anything but rare .
The only thing that ’s rare about this is that we happen to know about it and are seeing it take place on video .
This is something that takes place on a virtually daily basis in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places where we invade and bomb and occupy .
And the reason why there are hundreds of thousands of dead in Iraq and thousands of dead in Afghanistan is because this is what happens constantly when we are engaged in warfare in those countries .
“ And you see that , as Julian said , in the fact that every step of the way they got formal approval for what they wanted to do .
And if you read the Defense Department investigations , which cleared the individuals involved , in every sense , … And you see that this is standard operating procedure .
The military was not at all concerned about what took place .
They did n’t even think there were remedial steps needed to prevent a future reoccurrence .
They concluded definitively that the members of the military involved did exactly the right thing .
“ This is what war is .
This is what the United States does in these countries .
And that , I think , is the crucial point to note , along with the fact that the military fought tooth and nail to prevent this video from surfacing , precisely because they knew that it would shed light on what their actual behavior is during war , and instead of the propaganda to which we ’re typically subjected . ”
To which , Mr. Assange added : “ We have seen some straw manning in relation to this event .
So quite a few people have simply focused on the initial attack on Namir , the Reuters photographer , and Saeed , the other one , this initial crowd scene , and gone , ‘ Well , you know , camera , RPG , it can look a bit similar .
And there do appear to be two other — two people in that crowd having weapons .
A heat - of - the - moment situation .
Even if the descriptions were false previously , maybe there ’s some excuse for this .
I mean , it ’s bad , but maybe there ’s some excuse . ’
This is clearly a straw man .
We can see , over these three events — the initial attack on the crowd ; the attack on the people rescuing a completely unarmed man , themselves completely unarmed ; to the Hellfire missile attack on an apartment complex , which killed families — all in the course of one hour , that something is wrong .
“ And the tone of the pilots is another day at the office .
This is not , as Glenn said , an extraordinary event .
This outlines that this is an everyday event .
It ’s another day at the office .
They get clearance for everything that they do from higher command before they do it .
“ There was an investigative report in response to Reuters , so it ’s not a minor incident .
There was pressure from Reuters to produce an investigative report .
There was an investigative report .
It cleared everyone of wrongdoing .
You can read that report that was released .
It is clearly designed to come to a particular conclusion , the suppression of the [ Freedom of Information Act ] material , non-response to Reuters .
And now we hear yesterday from the Pentagon an attempt to keep the same line , that everything was done correctly . ”
He continued : “ Even the number — everyone was described initially as insurgents , except for the two wounded children .
A blanket description .
It was only from pressure from the press that changed that number to there being civilians amongst the crowd .
But we also see that the total death count is wrong .
There were people killed in the buildings next to this event who were just there living in their houses .
There were additional bystanders killed in the Hellfire missile attack , and those people were n’t even counted , let alone counted as insurgents .
So you cannot believe these statements from the military about number of people who were killed , whether people are insurgents , whether an investigation into rules of engagement was correct .
They simply cannot be believed and cannot be trusted . ”
The rational reaction to discoveries like the last couple of days should n’t be the regurgitation of the reactions of ‘ unnamed officials ’ who are looking to save their own asses by playing damage control against their institution .
The rational reaction is not to treat these incidents independent of all other knowledge .
But when the ‘ news ’ is whatever ‘ officials who want to save their asses say it is ’ , you see the problem that Robert Fisk illuminates so well ( 1:35 ) :
The rational reaction from an informative media is to tie such atrocities and cover - up ’s together when patterns clearly emerge , when cover - up ’s are clearly not the exception , but the rule .
As Mr. Greenwald said , “ This is what war is .
This is what the United States does in these countries . ”
And it creating very angry orphans and widows like those this world may have never seen before .
The U.S. War of Terror is making the world a more dangerous place every day .
Luckily , it ’s the largest global arms profiteer in the world .
Of course , ‘ it ’ does n’t mean you and me , but a handful of cartels .
Coincidentally , people from these cartels sit in government seats and invest in media corporations .
Lucky for them !
Sucks to be the idiot who believes this government can be a good thing to an acceptable degree .
Like the computerized killing machine in " The Terminator " the Thrashers playoff chances have risen from the ashes to once again show some vital signs .
Is this just a tease for the audience before they are finally extinguished ?
Or is this a case of genuine revival ?

The Club Sports odds are back up to 18 % which is about a 1 in 6 chance of making the post - season .
The Flyers are in the midst of some goalie trouble but they are well ahead of the Bruins who currently occupy the 8th spot .
The Thrashers and Bruins have played the same number of games , so the Thrashers would need two more wins and two regulation losses just to catch the Bruins -- and THEN the Thrashers would need to match every win by the Bruins .
So below I have created a table that shows what the Thrashers would need to do in order to catch and pass Boston .
If Boston were to simply play .500 hockey the rest of the way the Thrashers would need a record of 8 - 4 to beat them .
If the Bruins were to manage 7 - 5 down the stretch the Thrashers need to go 9 - 3 .
If the Bruins were to really fall apart and just win just 5 of their final 12 , then the Thrashers get in with a 7 - 5 record ( assuming the NYR do n't play any better ) .
If Boston went …
Thrashers need to go… .
W L OTL PTS W L OTL PTS 12 0 0 24 impossible to qualify 11 0 1 23 impossible to qualify 11 1 0 22 impossible to qualify 10 1 1 21 tie breaker 10 2 0 20 12 0 0 24 9 2 1 19 11 0 1 23 9 3 0 18 11 1 0 22 8 3 1 17 10 1 1 21 8 4 0 16 10 2 0 20 7 4 1 15 9 2 1 19 7 5 0 14 9 3 0 18 6 5 1 13 8 3 1 17 6 6 0 12 8 4 0 16 5 6 1 11 7 4 1 15 5 7 0 10 7 5 0 14 4 7 1 9 6 5 1 13 4 8 0 8 6 6 0 12 3 8 1 7 5 6 1 11 3 9 0 6 5 7 0 10 2 9 1 5 4 7 1 9 2 10 0 4 4 8 0 8 1 10 1 3 3 8 1 7 1 11 0 2 3 9 0 6 0 11 1 1 2 9 1 5 0 12 0 0 2 10 0 4
I think the odds of the Thrashers limiting their losses to just 3 the rest of the way are rather remote given their schedule .
Atlanta can only qualify if the Bruins meltdown and the Rangers stay tepid .
That 's not a very likely scenario , but if you 're looking to hang your hat on something -- there you go .
So right now the odds of the Thrashers finishing 8th or better are 18 % , the odds of finishing 9th or 10 are 45 % and the odds of finishing 11th or worse are 38 % .
President Obama will seek to promote his vision for the nation ’s human space flight program on Thursday , just two days after three storied Apollo astronauts — including Neil Armstrong , the first human to walk on the Moon — called the new plans “ devastating . ”
In an announcement to be made at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , the president will personally talk for the first time about the sweeping upheaval of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ’s human spaceflight program outlined in his 2011 budget request : canceling the current program that is to send astronauts back to the Moon , investing in commercial companies to provide transportation to orbit and developing new space technologies .
A senior administration official said Mr. Obama would describe a vision “ that unlocks our ambitions and expands our frontiers in space , ultimately meaning the challenge of sending humans to Mars . ”
The official spoke with administration approval , but on the condition of anonymity so that the comments would not upstage the president ’s remarks .
Mr. Obama ’s budget request called for the cancellation of Orion crew capsule , which was to be used to carry astronauts to the International Space Station and then to the Moon , as well as other components of the current program known as Constellation .
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio has been raising fistfuls of money for months now , but the question is : for what ?
If Arpaio knows what office he will run for next , he is n't saying yet .
But he promises to let voters know by May 1 whether he will hang onto his sheriff 's badge or toss his hat into the ring for governor .
Arpaio has raised $ 2 million to date , money he cannot touch until he starts campaigning for sheriff or shifts gears to run for governor .
He has been soliciting contributions for nearly a year , and the response has been striking even for someone with his name recognition .
Despite - or maybe because of - state and federal investigations into Arpaio 's office , donors have handed over $ 25 and $ 30 contributions in droves .
If Arpaio makes a bid for governor , he could roll that $ 2 million into the statewide campaign , experts say .
Arizona statutes allow for candidates to transfer funds to another campaign when seeking a different office , as long as the legal - contribution limits are equal or greater for the new office .
Arpaio will not be able to use the money to mount a legal defense against what he describes as various left - leaning enemies , but a politician seemingly playing a martyr is usually an effective strategy to get donations , said Bruce Merrill , an Arizona State University professor who conducts the Cronkite / Eight poll .
Merrill noted that Arpaio seemed to pick up supporters after demonstrators interrupted a question - and - answer session with the sheriff at Arizona State University last year .
" The more they rail against Joe , the more it helps him .
He ought to give money to those demonstrators , " Merrill said .
" The media covers that , and what 's the message ?
Here 's a guy who 's getting pounded on because he 's tough on criminals . "
Arpaio could use the money he has raised so far to campaign against a recall election if someone attempts to force one .
That is what political strategists had in mind when they started sending out solicitations last year , said Chad Willems , Arpaio 's political consultant .
" These left - wing groups and their allies in the media need to know just how strong the support is among law - abiding people like you for me and my policies , " one of Arpaio 's solicitation letters reads .
" They are mounting an all - out effort to remove me as Sheriff , including the latest talk of a recall campaign . "
Arpaio has such fundraising potential among a certain segment of conservative voters that other groups have used Arpaio 's name to raise money , too .
A border - protection group recently promised supporters a copy of Arpaio 's book in exchange for donations .
Another group claimed to be raising money to help Arpaio fight the American Civil Liberties Union , Willems said .
Neither is affiliated with Arpaio , but Willems said there is little Arpaio can do to stop organizations from trading on his name .
" It has nothing to do with us - we do n't trade lists with those people , we do n't have any interactions with those people - it's like a free - speech thing , " Willems said .
" There 's always going to be people trading on different people 's names . "
The prospect of Arpaio possibly running for governor has generated the most interest - and at least some campaign revenue .
Willems said the campaign returns donations with any mention of " governor " included .
However , people not affiliated with the campaign have sent out mass e-mails and posted information on the Internet with claims that Arpaio is running for governor .
Those missives advertise a post - office box where supporters can contribute to the campaign - the same address where Arpaio collects his 2012 campaign donations .
Willems said those solicitations have not generated a huge response .
The campaign occasionally receives checks with a note attached indicating the donation is for Arpaio 's illegal - immigration - enforcement efforts .
" We just have to send it back and say , ' If you want to support the sheriff 's re-election , here 's a form , ' " Willems said .
" We vet all that stuff . "
A potential gubernatorial run by the 77 - year - old sheriff has political observers curious about how Arpaio 's tough - on - crime , short - on - politics stance would play at the statewide level .
There is consensus that he would be a tough competitor in the GOP primary , which already has a crowded field of four official candidates .
What is less certain is whether Arpaio could parlay his popularity among conservative voters into a general - election victory .
" He 's always done pretty good in Maricopa County , but I do n't know how that translates , " said Bruce Hernandez , research director at the Behavior Research Center , a Phoenix polling firm .
" People seemed to have a pretty high opinion of him for so many years running the sheriff 's office , but I do n't know that that translates to running the state . "
At a Young Republicans event last month in Mesa , Arpaio told the crowd he would " lead the state with my personality , " if elected governor , and that he would leave detailed decisions to experts .
" I can hire someone to give me a position paper on education , " he said .
* ‘ South Park ’ showed Prophet Mohammad in bear suit
* Muslim group references slain filmmaker in ‘ warning ’
* New ‘ South Park ’ beeps out Mohammad ’s name ( Recasts with latest episode of show )
LOS ANGELES , April 21 ( Reuters ) - Satirical animated TV show “ South Park ” beeped out the words Prophet Muhammad and plastered its Wednesday episode with the word “ CENSORED ” after being issued a grim warning by a U.S. Muslim group .
The irreverent comedy show on Comedy Central also substituted a controversial image seen last week of the Prophet Muhammad in a bear outfit with one of Santa Claus in the same costume .
It was not immediately clear if the move was a bid to tread carefully following the warning against the “ South Park ” creators , or if they were poking fun at the fuss .
The little - known group RevolutionMuslim.com posted a message on its website earlier this week warning creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker “ that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show . ”
The website posted a graphic photo of Van Gogh , a Dutch filmmaker who was killed in 2004 by an Islamic militant over a movie he had made that accused Islam of condoning violence against women .
It also posted a link to a news article with details of a mansion in Colorado that Parker and Stone apparently own .
Most Muslims consider any depiction of the founder of Islam as offensive .
The website warning followed the first in a two - part episode of “ South Park ” a week ago in which Prophet Mohammad was depicted in a bear outfit .
“ South Park ” has a history of biting satire against politicians , celebrities and the media .
The two Colorado filmmakers are known to often work on “ South Park ” until just before they air , enabling them to react to current events .
In Wednesday ’s new episode , Jesus Christ was depicted watching pornography and Buddha was portrayed snorting cocaine .
The head of Revolution Muslim , Younus Abdullah Muhammad , 30 , defended the Web posting by his group .
“ How is that a threat ? , ” he told Reuters earlier on Wednesday .
“ Showing a case study right there of what happened to another individual who conducted himself in a very similar manner ?
It ’s just evidence . ”
According to U.S. law enforcement officials , the federal government rarely prosecutes threat cases .
The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives broad protections to free speech , and what constitutes a threat is often subject to interpretation .
Muhammad described his group as an alternative media outlet with about 20 active posters to the website .
He said the group “ did n’t tell anyone to go to their houses and conduct violence ” against Parker or Stone .
Comedy Central , a unit of Viacom Inc VIAb.N , has declined to comment on the controversy .

UPDATE 6:58 p.m. ET : Toyota will temporarily stop selling the Lexus GX 460 after Consumer Reports said the SUV carried an unusually high risk of a rollover accident during certain types of turns .
In a statement , the automaker says it will suspend sales of the SUV while it conducts its own testing .
EARLIER :
Consumer Reports is warning consumers not to buy the Lexus GX 460 SUV because it is a safety risk , the magazine editors say .
Despite coming equipped with electronic stability control , Consumer Reports says the SUV had trouble going through the paces of the magazine 's emergency - handling tests .
TELL US : What 's on your Do - Not - Buy list ?
" When pushed to its limits on a handling course on CR's test track , the rear of the GX CR purchased slid out until the vehicle was almost sideways before the electronic stability control system was able to regain control , " reads a press release .
The magazine said it " believes that in real - world driving , that situation could lead to a rollover accident , which could cause serious injury or death . "
Toyota , the parent company of Lexus , did not return calls for comment .
But Consumer Reports included a comment from a Lexus spokeswoman :
" We 're mystified by the results of Consumer Reports testing on the Lexus GX 460 , " spokeswoman Allison Takahashi said .
" Our engineers conduct similar tests during development of all SUVs .
We will look into this and we appreciate Consumer Reports bringing it to our attention . "
The magazine purchases all of the vehicles it tests , and ran the Lexus through four different drivers in similar situations , and each driver experienced the same thing .
To confirm the test , the magazine paid to use another Lexus GX 460 .
It , too , had problems .
The test , called a lift - off oversteer , involves the driver taking his or her foot off the accelerator while steering through a turn .
In real - world driving , drivers often do the same thing when entering exit ramps , or when driving through a large turn and encountering an obstacle , or after discovering a turn is too tight for the speed of the vehicle .
" A natural impulse is to quickly lift off the accelerator pedal , " Consumer Reports says .
" If that were to happen in the GX , the rear could slide around far enough that a wheel could strike a curb or slide off the pavement . "
Either scenario could cause a rollover accident .
Consumer Reports says it conducted the test on 95 SUVs in its current ratings .
No other SUV " slid out as far as the GX 460 , " the magazine says , including the Toyota 4 Runner which shares the same platform .

With the iPad a few days away , now begins one of the great rituals of the release of a new Apple product : the posting of the reviews from the lucky few journalists who were given a week to play with the product .
Here are the reviews we ’ve found so far :
Walt Mossberg of the Wall Street Journal weighs in with “ Apple iPad : Laptop Killer ?
Pretty Close . ”
For the past week or so , I have been testing a sleek , light , silver - and - black tablet computer called an iPad .
After spending hours and hours with it , I believe this beautiful new touch - screen device from Apple has the potential to change portable computing profoundly , and to challenge the primacy of the laptop .
It could even help , eventually , to propel the finger - driven , multitouch user interface ahead of the mouse - driven interface that has prevailed for decades . [… ]
All in all , however , the iPad is an advance in making more - sophisticated computing possible via a simple touch interface on a slender , light device .
Only time will tell if it ’s a real challenger to the laptop and netbook .
Ed Baig of USA Today writes “ Verdict is in on Apple iPad : It ’s a winner . ”
The first iPad is a winner .
It stacks up as a formidable electronic - reader rival for Amazon ’s Kindle .
It gives portable game machines from Nintendo and Sony a run for their money .
At the very least , the iPad will likely drum up mass - market interest in tablet computing in ways that longtime tablet visionary and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates could only dream of . [… ]
Apple has pretty much nailed it with this first iPad , though there ’s certainly room for improvement .
Nearly three years after making a splash with the iPhone , Apple has delivered another impressive product that largely lives up to the hype .
Andy Ihnatko of the Chicago Sun-Times ( and Macworld ! ) has posted part one of a promised five part series , “ The iPad is pure innovation - one of the best computers ever . ”
The iPad user experience is instantly compelling and elegant .
It ’s not every computer and every function .
It ’s a computer that ’s designed for speed , mobility , and tactile interaction above all other considerations .
The most compelling sign that Apple got this right is the fact that despite the novelty of the iPad , the excitement slips away after about ten seconds and you ’re completely focused on the task at hand … whether it ’s reading a book , writing a report , or working on clearing your Inbox .
Second most compelling : in situation after situation , I find that the iPad is the best computer in my household and office menagerie .
It ’s not a replacement for my notebook , mind you .
It feels more as if the iPad is filling a gap that ’s existed for quite some time .
David Pogue of the New York Times writes “ Love it or not ?
Looking at iPad from 2 angles . ”
And the techies are right about another thing : the iPad is not a laptop .
It ’s not nearly as good for creating stuff .
On the other hand , it ’s infinitely more convenient for consuming it — books , music , video , photos , Web , e-mail and so on .
For most people , manipulating these digital materials directly by touching them is a completely new experience — and a deeply satisfying one .
The bottom line is that the iPad has been designed and built by a bunch of perfectionists .
If you like the concept , you ’ll love the machine .
The only question is :
Do you like the concept ?
Tim Gideon of PC Magazine reviews the iPad and gives it 4.5 red dots out of 5 .
Kindle : I like you , but I am nervous about your future .
The iPad displays books in a way that is much flashier than your black and white e-ink screen .
It shows illustrations in color .
Page turns actually look like page turns .
And Apple gets the extras right , like being able to bookmark any word in the book you ’re reading and then find it on a menu of all your bookmarks , sorted by date . [ … ]
Is the iPad a perfect product ?
No .
And the omissions will give the anti-Apple crowd plenty of ammo .
Why do I need this extra device that ’s not a full - fledged laptop ?
Where ’s the camera ?
What about Flash ?
Um , how about multitasking ?
These are all valid complaints , but one thing I can say about most Apple products , and certainly the iPad :
There may be things it does n’t do , but what it does do , it does remarkably well .
Aside from the aforementioned limitations , there is n’t a lot else to gripe about .
Xeni Jardin of BoingBoing writes , “ Apple ’s iPad is a touch of genius . ”
Tapping and swirling my way through iBooks ( the store includes free , public domain titles in addition to the $ 9.99 - $ 12.99 bestsellers ) , and iPad native apps provided at launch such as the spectacular , game - changing Marvel Comics app ( crisp , lucid art , the ability to navigate frame - by - frame , rendering spoilers down the page obsolete ) , the Epicurious recipe browser , and the news browsing app by Reuters ( free app in which video is , again , a seamless delight ) , the idea hits .
This is what we wanted e-books to be all along .
Rich , nimble , and dense with image and sound and navigability , right there inside the flow of the story .
And this is what we wanted the web to feel like all along .
We just want it to work , and we do n't want to be aware of the delivery method while we 're enjoying what 's delivered .
Bob LeVitus of the Houston Chronicle writes that “ Apple ’s iPad is better than expected . ”
It turns out the iPad is n’t as much a laptop replacement as I thought ( though it could easily be used as one ) .
Instead , it ’s an entirely new category of mobile device .
For example , now when I want to surf the Web from the couch or back deck , the iPad is the device I choose .
Starbucks ?
Same thing .
Think of the iPad as a new arrow in your technology quiver , an arrow that will often be the best tool for a given task .
I had high expectations for the iPad , and it has met or exceeded most of them .
Omar Wasow at The Root says that “ techies are wrong about the iPad ” :
... the techie obsession with specs and obscure features completely misses how most consumers will actually use the iPad .
A small percentage of power users will be disappointed that the iPad does n't , say , have an HDMI video - out port or that it currently lacks the ability to run multiple applications simultaneously or that it fails to address some other esoteric concern .
The rest of us ( even most techies ) will be thrilled that doing what we want to do on the iPad is generally effortless .
Wanna read the news in bed before breakfast ?
Easy .
Wanna play a casual multiplayer game of Scrabble on the sofa ?
Trivial .
Wanna check your calendar , review a recipe , listen to a mix of indie rock , and load a map with detailed driving directions for an upcoming trip ?
Cake .
With few exceptions , the iPad is impressively easy and fun to use .
And Stephen Fry is unpacking his iPad on YouTube .
Of course , our own iPad coverage will arrive as soon as we get our hands on one !
The project aims to help orchards of apples , plums , pears and damsons Dozens of orchards have been created and cultivated in a bid to protect traditional fruit trees and the habitat they offer to wildlife .
The National Trust and Natural England effort follows a 60 % decline in ancient orchards in England since the 1950s .
Some 27 orchards have been restored and replanted and 12 new ones created , with some 2,200 trees planted .
The National Trust is celebrating the first year of the project with a " full bloom festival " starting on Sunday .
The major decline in ancient orchards has been the result of urban development , conversion to other uses and the pressure on small - scale producers from commercial fruit growing .
Wildlife habitat
The UK biodiversity action plan now lists traditional orchards as a conservation priority as they are home to local varieties of apples , plums , pears and damsons , and provide an important habitat for wildlife .
A series of wildlife surveys have been undertaken at the new and restored sites , with one location found to be home to 37 different bird species , including mistle thrush , bullfinch , green woodpecker and kestrel .
The project 's orchard officer , Kate Merry , said : " You can't fail to appreciate what they add to our landscape .
They do so much for us , it 's imperative that we try and save what 's left
Orchard officer Kate Merry " We would lose that and lose their historic importance .
We would also lose valuable wildlife habitat , and all the old heritage and fruit varieties we have found .
" And we would lose a lot of community opportunities to use this space to come together and have events .
" They do so much for us , it 's imperative that we try and save what 's left , " she said .
The project also aims to find ways to help orchards pay their own way , including repairing and using old equipment such as harvesting ladders and cider presses .
The project is also training people in traditional orchard management skills in order to ensure the orchards are maintained beyond the scheme 's two - and - a - half year lifespan .

Not making this up .
Outside of Congresswoman Mary Jo Kilroy 's district office , teabaggers heckled , cursed at , and threw money at a man suffering from Parkinson 's disease .
This needs to be splattered throughout the media tomorrow .
The shear heartlessness of the moment is heartbreaking .
Video :
http://www.dispatch.com/...
The video is not embeddable -- the heckling starts about 50 seconds into it .
H/T Progress Ohio :
Video shot by the Columbus Dispatch from today 's Honk and Wave in Support of Health Care at Congresswoman Mary Jo Kilroy 's district office contains a segment wherein the teabaggers mock and scorn an apparent Parkinsen 's victim telling him " he 's in the wrong end of town to ask for handouts " , calling him a communist and throwing money at him to " pay for his health care " .
We need to pass reform this week .
Not just for this man who needs help -- but in spite of these horrible people .
Yeah , that just might be a nice cherry on top .
Concept : iPad Split Keyboard
Aesthetics aside …
It seems like the iPad ’s keyboard , in landscape mode , leaves you no choice but to hold the device in one hand and hunt - n - peck with the other .
What if the keyboard was split into two , and placed in the lower - right and left corners ?
Then , you could hold it with both hands , and type a la the iPhone .
It ’d be a sacrifice to the key size , for sure , but it might be more comfortable and functional .
Richard Koo's latest observations on the US economy are as always , a must read .
The critical observation from the Nomura economist explains why the realists and the naive idealists are at greater odds than ever before : the government continues to perpetuate , endorse and legalize accounting fraud in the hope that covering everything up under the rug will rekindle animal spirits .
The truth , as Koo points out , is that were the FASB to show the real sad state of affairs , the two core industries in the US - finance and real estate , would be bankrupt .
" If US authorities were to require banks to mark their commercial real estate loans to market today , lending to this sector would be extinguished , triggering a chain of bankruptcies as borrowers became unable to roll over their debt . "
In other news Citi , Bank of America , and Wells just reported fantastic earnings beats on the heels of reduced credit loss provisions .
Nothing on the conference call mentioned the fact that all would be bankrupt if there was an ounce of integrity left in financial reporting , and that every firm is committing FASB - complicit 10 ( b ) - 5 fraud .
One day , just like Goldman 's mortgage follies , all this will be the subject of epic lawsuits .
But not yet .
There is some more money to be stolen from the middle class first , by these very firms .
Some other observations on the greatest game of extend and pretend from the well - respected economist :
Fed understands risks of too - rapid bad loan disposals
Mr. Bernanke also emphasized that the Fed is making serious efforts to address credit supply problems — ie , the credit crunch .
The Fed chairman understands that an exclusive focus by bank examiners on uncovering bad loans could leave banks reluctant to lend , thereby sparking a “ bank inspector recession ” and delaying the recovery .
To prevent this scenario , Mr. Bernanke says he has instructed Fed bank inspectors to ensure that banks are lending to creditworthy borrowers .
In ordinary times , the Fed would seek to have banks write off their non-performing loans as quickly as possible .
This is the correct approach when there are only a handful of distressed lenders .
But during a systemic crisis , when many banks face the same problems , forcing lenders to rush ahead with bad loan disposals ( ie , sales ) can trigger a further decline in asset prices , creating more bad loans and sending the economy into a tailspin .
I think the Fed ’s shift in focus from conventional nonperforming loan disposals to credit crunch prevention is an attempt to avoid this scenario .
Fed retraining bank examiners in bad loan management
Perhaps based on an awareness of Japan ’s failures in this area , the US has not only made public a list of items bank examiners are to focus on , but is also retraining its examiners in a bid to keep them on the right track .
Roughly 1,000 inspectors have already completed the retraining .
Among other things , the retraining program teaches examiners how to modify loans to troubled borrowers and how to manage distressed commercial real estate loans .
In that sense , it is a far cry from traditional training , which emphasized the quick discovery and disposal of nonperforming loans .
Full Koo note :
h/t Jake
The scientists have just begun to explore the implications of this technique , so it might be a while before a doctor actually uses a stent or implant created by folding titanium hydride .
However , Japanese legend holds that if someone folds 1,000 origami cranes , a real crane will grant their wish .
So all the researchers need to do is fabricate 999 more of these , and just wish for a practical application for this technology to arrive within a year .
Easy !
By hitting single molecules with quadrillionth - of - a - second laser pulses , scientists have revealed the quantum physics underlying photosynthesis , the process used by plants and bacteria to capture light 's energy at efficiencies unapproached by human engineers .
The quantum wizardry appears to occur in each of a photosynthetic cell 's millions of antenna proteins .
These route energy from electrons spinning in photon - sensitive molecules to nearby reaction - center proteins , which convert it to cell - driving charges .
Almost no energy is lost in between .
That 's because it exists in multiple places at once , and always finds the shortest path .
" The analogy I like is if you have three ways of driving home through rush hour traffic .
On any given day , you take only one .
You do n't know if the other routes would be quicker or slower .
But in quantum mechanics , you can take all three of these routes simultaneously .
You do n't specify where you are until you arrive , so you always choose the quickest route , " said Greg Scholes , a University of Toronto biophysicist .
Scholes ' findings , published Wednesday in Nature , are the strongest evidence yet for coherence — the technical name for multiple - state existence — in photosynthesis .
Two years ago , researchers led by then - University of California at Berkeley chemist Greg Engel found coherence in the antenna proteins of green sulfur bacteria .
But their observations were made at temperatures below minus 300 degrees Fahrenheit , useful for slowing ultrafast quantum activities but leaving open the question of whether coherence operates in everyday conditions .
The Nature findings , made at room temperature in common marine algae , show that it does .
Moreover , similar results from an experiment on another , simpler light - harvesting structure , announced by Engel 's group last Thursday on the pre-publication online arXiv , suggest that photosynthetic coherence is routine .
The findings are wondrous in themselves , adding a new dimension to something taught — incompletely , it now seems — to every high school biology student .
They also have important implications for designers of solar cells and computers , who could benefit from quantum physics conducted in nonfrigid conditions .
" There 's every reason to believe this is a general phenomenon , " said Engel , now at the University of Chicago .
He called Scholes ' finding " an extraordinary result " that " shows us a new way to use quantum effects at high temperatures . "
Scholes ' team experimented on an antenna protein called PC645 , already imaged at the atomic scale in earlier studies .
That precise characterization allowed them to target molecules with laser pulses lasting for one - quadrillionth of a second , or just long enough to set single electrons spinning .
By analyzing changes to a laser beam sent through the protein immediately afterwards , the researchers were able to extrapolate what was happening inside — an ultra - high - tech version of shadows on a screen .
They found that energy patterns in distant molecules fluctuated in ways that betrayed a connection to each other , something only possible through quantum coherence .
" It 's the same as when you hit two tuning forks at the same time , and hear a low - pitched oscillation in the background .
That 's the interference of sound waves from the forks .
That 's exactly what we see , " said Scholes .
According to Scholes , the physics of photosynthetic proteins will be further studied and used to improve solar cell design .
Engel suggested their use in long - promised but still - unworkable quantum computing .
" This allows us to think about photosynthesis as non-unitary quantum computation , " he said .
Quantum - physical processes have been observed elsewhere in the biological realm , most notably in compass cells that allow birds to navigate by Earth 's geomagnetic fields .
Researchers have also proposed roles for quantum physics in the animal sense of smell and even in the brain .
Engel predicts the emergence of an entire field of quantum biology .
" There are going to be some surprises , " said Scholes .
" Who knows what else there is to discover ? "

Oh Look , UK Piracy Statistics Are Based On Nonsense Too
from the fake - science - makes - the - world - go - round dept
A recent GAO study found claims of piracy 's supposedly - devastating impact on the economy ( shockingly ) usually are n't based on real science -- despite the fact that such claims ( which usually originate from the entertainment or software industries ) are repeatedly parroted by government officials .
The study also found that there were a few instances where file trading could actually be a good thing -- and could actually result in increased product sales .
The GAO 's overall conclusion ?
No government agency actually bothers to track piracy statistics , and instead just regurgitates scary industry claims without question .
The study also found that there 's so many moving parts involved -- that making broad claims about piracy 's impact on the economy ( for better or worse ) may not even be possible .
In the UK , the recent Digital Economy Bill was rushed through without any real debate -- but with plenty of typical claims of how piracy was going to lead to economic armageddon if the bill was n't passed .
Just like in the States , the UK government never actually bothered to study whether any of these claims were accurate .
If they had , they would have found that -- also just like in the United States -- the claims were n't based on real science but on the usual combination of flawed logic ( assuming a copy shared naturally equates to a lost sale ) and skewed , industry - supplied data .
Looking more closely at the most recent reports that most heavily influenced Digital Economy Bill voting found that very little ( if any ) data originated with independent , scientific studies :
" So the net result of this 68 - page report , with all of its tables and detailed methodology , is that four out of the top five markets used for calculating the overall piracy loss in Europe draw on figures supplied by the recording industry itself .
Those apparently terrifying new figures detailing the supposed loss of money and jobs due to piracy in Europe turn out to be little more than a * re - statement * of the industry 's previous claims in a slightly different form .
As a result , as little credence can be placed in the the report as in those criticized by the US GAO . "
Of course none of this surprises anybody who watched the BPI manipulate and massage reality in order to get the bill passed .
Meanwhile , the passage of the Digital Economy Bill has file traders heading further underground ( where they 'll be harder to track ) , with anonymous BitTorrent protection services seeing a pronounced spike in new users .
While the BPI waits for their pet legislation to kick in , they 've meanwhile announced that they plan to " reluctantly " return to suing potential customers .

In a shocking , but not so shocking article for those of us who continue to yell about the broken economy of the United States , CNNMoney talks about the insanely low levels of retirement funds for most Americans .
A few highlights from the article :
The percentage of workers who have less than $ 10 k in retirement savings grew from 39 % to 43 % in 2010
Workers who have less than $ 1 k jumped to 27 % from 20 %
Factor in unemployment , health care costs , the fact that most Americans are underwater on their homes , insane debt levels , the government is broke , etc. and it all adds up to a simply depressing situation .
And , you ’re buying stocks right now ?
The way I see it , the typical middle class retirement dream is gone for most people .
It just is n’t going to happen for our generation .
The below table presents the possible solutions to this horrific retirement savings picture .
The problem is that each “ solution ” comes with a consequence .
The last column will tell you how to prepare for this consequence should the corresponding solution be implemented .
Solution Consequence of the Solution Hedge against the Consequence Americans massively increase their savings by astronomical levels
The economy tanks because we depend on consumer spending Sell your stocks , pray you do n’t lose your job Americans delay retirement and work longer Stubbornly high unemployment because with our ill - structured economy , there simply are n’t enough jobs to go around Build your skill set to make sure you can beat out Grandpa for your current job
The government should bailout people who do n’t have money for retirement because , after all , everyone deserves to play golf , pop Viagra , and enjoy the sunset years of their life
The welfare system collapses amid soaring deficits and high interest rates
Pay off your debt , save cash , buy gold The government prints a bunch of money to pay for people ’s retirements !
Massive inflation
Do n’t pay off your debt , buy gold
Am I reading this wrong ?
Please set me straight if I am .
As I ponder the future for the average 20 - something American , I ’m not sure if I should be excited about the future since it ’s undoubtedly going to be interesting , or if I should stock up on guns and food , or if I should just cry .
Either way , we ’re going into uncharted territory .
If you ’re not too depressed , read my post from yesterday entitled America : Land of the Unsustainable .
This should complete the one - two punch to ruin your day .
God bless .

The Bible Has Dominion Over the Law in Sarah Palin ’s America
When she ’s not inciting violence , Palin is selling a manifestly incorrect distortion of the Constitution , which she invariably gets mixed up with both the Pledge of Allegiance and the song , “ America the Beautiful ” .
Her goal is to create a Christian Nation , where the bible has dominion over the law .
A pause while the reader digests this salient fact about the GOP ’s front - runner for 2012 .
Advertisements
Perhaps it does n’t really matter if Palin is so ignorant that she believes her own lies ; perhaps the real issue here is that she is trying to sell Christian Nationalism .
Lest you think I ’ve been caught in a web of hyperbole best left to the Right , Palin actually used the words , “ this is a Christian Nation ” in describing the USA .
“ ” We hear of a judge ’s ruling that our National Day of Prayer is unconstitutional , ” said Palin .
“ I think we ’ll be challenging that one . ” ….
” God truly has shed his grace on thee — on this country , ” Palin told the Women of Joy conference .
“ He ’s blessed us , and we better not blow it . ”
Without ever mentioning him by name , Palin also took aim at President Obama , repeating an often cited but incorrect claim that Obama said he believed that the U.S was no longer a Christian nation during a 2006 speech .
“ And then , hearing any leader declare that America is n’t a Christian nation and poking an ally like Israel in the eye , it ’s mind - boggling to see some of our nation ’s actions recently , but politics truly is a topic for another day . ”
Palin used words from “ America the Beautiful ” to justify her statement that the National Day of Prayer is not uncontitutional .
She then proceeds with her assumption that this is a Christian Nation , presumably also buttressed by “ America the Beautiful ” .
The Right is being led down a path of treason by a woman who did not even know who the founding fathers were and clearly has yet to read the Constitution .
How odd for someone who claims to love America and how scary for someone who sees herself fit to actually run this country .
It ’s worth noting that Palin ’s spiritual adviser also believes Palin was “ mantled ” by God to be the President of the USA .
This is the same adviser who prayed for an opponent to get cancer and suggested Palin would get a career boost from an act of terrorism which would take McCain out , leaving Palin as President .
Now , when you place that in context with her attempt to create anarchy under a Democratic president , her close allegiance with the secessionist group the Alaska Independence Party , and the AIP ’s ties with both militia movements and the KKK , a reasonable person is forced to doubt Palin ’s good intentions toward this country .
Is Palin pallin ’ around with treason ?
What exactly are her intentions ?
Palin ’s ties with right wing extremist groups should give serious pause to all citizens .
While it ’s easy to dismiss her as “ stupid ” because she so clearly is willfully ignorant , being stupid does not mitigate one ’s potential impact upon the political landscape of a country so devoid of authenticity that Hooters is a “ family restaurant ” .
In fact , it could be argued that there is no one so dangerous as a demagogue who combines ignorance with arrogance .
In case you ’re still not sold , allow me to softly whisper “ W ” in your ear , so as not to scare the rest of the world .
Palin ’s goal as a Christian Dominionist is to create a Christian Nation , where the bible has dominion over the law , hence the term “ Dominionist ” .
The mere notion that the Republican Party would consider running such a dangerous person should be shocking .
Instead , it ’s par for the course for the Party who jumped the shark with W ’s presidency and then swallowed water by giving an unvetted Palin the nod as Vice Presidential candidate .
If you ’re not scared yet , you were n’t around during the Hunt for Gog .

Why do n't you just call them to find out ?
This type of question , and there are many , shows an unrealistic dependence or obsession or misdirected common sense when it comes to making the appropriate inquiry to the proper source .
The departing cast of Lost is hot property now as new series look to cast their pilots .
But it has only ever been a dream of Lost fans that Terry O’Quinn and Michael Emerson , the squirrely dynamic duo with more onscreen chemistry than any of the show ’s romantic pairings , would once again be paired together in a new project post - Lost .
All manner of spin-offs and Odd Couple - esque scenarios have been proposed by fans , particularly after a recent episode which spawned wishes for a spin - off exploring John Locke and Benjamin Linus as high school teachers in the alternate reality .
Other farcical ideas have ranged from live - action Bert and Ernie to a slash - fiction inspired romantic pairing .
So what are the odds , really , that Emerson and O’Quinn will ever chew the scenery of a new set together again ?
Apparently the odds are pretty favorable as TV Guide reports Terry O'Quinn is shopping around what they ’re calling a “ TNT - type ” series he has penned for himself and Emerson to star in as suburban hitmen with domestic difficulties .
TV Guide does n’t reveal the show ’s details per O’Quinn ’s request , but it ’s noted that he has spoken to Lost executive producer J.J. Abrams about the idea , and also said , “ I really hope this works out because Michael would be in his prime in this .
We ’d play kind of awkward partners . ”
One of the most popular questions from our " ask a physicist " feature was , " What happens if you 're driving at the speed of light and you turn on your headlights ? "
The simple answer :
You can't .
So quit trying .

At least ten of you asked some variant of this question , but Turael asked it first and arguably most succinctly .
So Turael , feel free to email me so we can send you a free copy of A User 's Guide to the Universe .

Sadly , physics teaches that we are forever confined to sub - light speeds .
There were several comments , in response to the original call for questions , that took umbrage at this certainty on the part of physicists .
Are we just being closed - minded ?
There are always people who are skeptical of equations , regardless of other evidence .
For example , long after the advent of nuclear weapons and power have vindicated Einstein , I still get detailed manuscripts from people every few weeks claiming that E=mc2 is wrong .
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
So no lengthy derivations , but I will give you a few observations , and hopefully that will be enough .
Special relativity predicts that if you take a massive particle and keep applying forces on it , it goes faster and faster , slowly approaching the speed of light , but never quite reaching it .
Right now , for example , the Large Hadron Collider has protons flying around it at a whopping 3.5 TeV .
This means that the protons are traveling 99.999994 % the speed of light , and when the LHC gets up to full power ( at about twice the energy ) , the protons will go even faster , but even then , less than the speed of light .
At these speeds , the difference between " at " and " a tiny bit below " the speed of light may seem academic , but it makes a world of difference .
We always need to accept the possibility that we could be wrong , but in this case , there 's just so much evidence that we 're right !
The particle colliders would n't actually work if relativity were wrong .
For that matter , neither would GPS devices .
Michelson and Morley found in 1887 that light travels at the same speed to all moving observers , a result that does n't make sense unless special relativity is correct .
All of modern physics ( and technology ) is built on an edifice of special relativity , and so far , it 's proven ridiculously accurate .
In other words , you 've got a very big barrier to overcome if you want to prove Einstein wrong .

Part of the reason that people are so confused about this aspect of relativity is that it flies in the face of everyday experience .
If I 'm in a boxcar moving 60 mph and throw a 90 mph fastball , someone standing by the side of the tracks will see the ball moving at 150 mph .
It seems like the same logic should work with light .
Except that it does n't .
Strange things happen when you get close to the speed of light , and they become stranger still when you realize that your high school physics teachers ( perhaps inadvertently ) lied to you .
Lots of you are sci - fi nerds , so I 'm guessing that at least once in your lives you learned Newton 's force equation , F=ma .
Deciphering the symbols , it means that if you apply a constant force to a particle , it should experience a constant acceleration .
Taken to its natural extremes , if I apply a force for long enough and the particle keeps accelerating , eventually it should exceed the speed of light .
Voila !
Newton 's force equation ( at least in the form it 's normally written ) is wrong .
Advertisement
But then what happens when you get close to the speed of light and turn on your headlights ?
From your perspective : nothing , or at least nothing special .
If you held a mirror in front of you , you 'd look exactly as you always have .
In fact , one of the surprising things about special relativity is that if you were n't looking at all of the scenery passing you , you could n't tell that you are moving at all .
But from the perspective of people standing on the sidelines , things look really cool .
Stationary observers would notice that your entire ship ( or racecar , or whatever you 're driving at 99 % the speed of light ) is compressed along your direction of motion .
If you 're standing the right way , it 'll look like you 've lost weight and that your body has been flattened under a giant stone .
Advertisement
They 'd also see your clocks – and your heartbeat , your speech , your computer cycles – running slow .
This is true , but completely unobservable in everyday life .
Typically on earth , it 's an effect of about 1 part in a quadrillion , but at 99 % the speed of light , you 'll appear to be running at only 1/7th speed .
The length contraction and time dilation conspire ( out of mathematical necessity ) to make your high beams move at the speed of light to somebody watching you from the side .
But just as a baseball gets a boost of energy when you throw it on a train ( which you should n't do , incidentally ) the light gets a boost of energy as well .
The difference is that it does n't go faster ; it just looks bluer .
In this case , your headlights would be boosted into the ultraviolet .
Stranger still is the case of two spaceships traveling toward one another , each a 99 % the speed of light .
Common sense would dictate that the captain of each ship should see the other hurtling toward him at faster than light .
Not so !
One of the results of the constant speed of light is that all relative speeds are going to be less than you think .
In this case , for example , each captain would see the other coming at him at only 99.995 % the speed of light .
Advertisement
Back to the original question ( which , incidentally , is so startlingly good that it's one of the ones that Einstein himself asked as a young man ) , what would happen if you could get up to the speed of light ?
As you get closer and closer to the speed of light , time gets slower and slower compared to stationary observers .
So if you really need an answer to the original question , this means that if you actually hit the speed of light for real , time would stop entirely , which means that nothing could happen .
But that 's okay , because you can't get up to the first place .

Dear Cecil :
For years
I 've tolerated my friend 's need for a strict vegan diet .
I am lectured nearly daily about the benefits of veganism and the injustice of my murderous , meat - craving lifestyle .
It 's gotten to the point that we can't go out anywhere decent because there are few places vegan - friendly enough to suit his tastes .
He has many redeeming qualities , so our friendship remains strong despite our philosophical differences .
However , if there were an issue that would be a deal breaker , it would be his terrible , terrible gas .
Its pure , unmitigated evil is indescribable .
I 'm pretty sure that in a highly concentrated form it could change laws of physics .
Just god-awful .
To make a dumb question long , are the rumors about vegan body odor , and specifically vegan gas , really true ?
Or is my friend just a naturally awful - smelling individual ?
Scott , via e-mail
Cecil replies :
Notwithstanding your assurances about redeeming qualities , Scott , I have to wonder what ’s keeping this relationship going .
It ca n’t be your friend ’s pleasant personality , since he continually hectors you and accuses you of sordid crimes .
It is n’t his scintillating conversation , unless lectures on your murderous meat - craving lifestyle are your idea of diverting chat .
It ’s obviously not his attractive physical presence .
So what are you getting out of this — stock tips ?
Weekly payments ?
Does he give great head ?
Call me a wuss , but I did n’t feel the question of intestinal gas was one I could profitably broach with the Vegan Society .
Instead , as so often , I went browsing on the Internet .
Googling vegan flatulence turned up 2,600 hits — considerably fewer than trepanation ( skull boring ) , which netted an alarming 31,200 , up from 6,120 just two years ago ( and what ’s that all about ? ) .
But it was more than enough to make you think twice about signing up for any long road trips with a bean zealot .
Suffice it to say that flatulence is a common complaint among and about vegans , and for that matter vegetarians generally .
( For those of you who do n’t know many vegetarians , they come in various flavors ; vegans are the most hard - core , eschewing not only meat but animal products of any kind , including milk and eggs . )
The problem is the body ’s inability to fully digest the complex carbohydrates so abundant in the vegetarian diet and the consequent excessive production of gases such as hydrogen , carbon dioxide , and methane .
Vegetarian nutritionists claim this phenomenon abates once the intestinal flora adapt to the new menu ; perhaps your friend is an intransigent case .
However , I suspect high gas production is inherent in any diet consisting predominantly of plant products .
Cows and sheep , for example , are marvelously adapted to all - veggie fare , yet they generate such prodigious quantities of methane - laden flatulence that some authorities regard them as major contributors to the greenhouse effect and thus to global warming .
Some vegetarians have seized on this as further evidence of the wickedness of animal husbandry , to which skeptics mindful of people like your friend reply :
Oh , sure , let ’s quit having the ruminants pass gas all day in distant fields so we can do it ourselves at close range .
A matter avoided studiously in most discussions of this subject , and to which I now must delicately turn , is odor .
While it seems inarguable that a vegetarian diet eventuates in increased flatulence , the gases produced in greatest volume — the aforementioned hydrogen , carbon dioxide , and methane — are odorless .
The noxious fragrance of which you complain is produced by minute amounts of other digestive by - products , typically containing sulfur , such as hydrogen sulfide , methanethiol , and dimethyl sulfide .
Whether a vegetarian diet is uniquely productive of such irritants is the subject of hot debate .
Some vegetarians claim that if anything they and their kind are more , not less , sweet - smelling than the meat - eating majority , and what ’s more that they taste better .
( And you thought my comment above about the various flavors of vegetarian was only a figure of speech . )
I pass no judgments , observing only that foul smells are likely to be associated with particular high - sulfur foods rather than with a vegetarian diet in general .
I have it on solid authority , for instance , that if you pack in the garlic you will stink like a son of a bitch .
Broccoli and cauliflower are also notable in this regard .
Willpower and muscle control wo n’t save you — if you do n’t shed the noisome molecules in the form of flatus , they ’ll be absorbed into your bloodstream and later waft from your breath or pores .
Some will say animal protein delivers far more sulfurous compounds than any plant protein , and that with modest care a vegetarian can minimize offense .
Maybe so , but your friend does n’t sound as though he frets about the opinions of others .
Assuming you continue to truck with this character , ca n’t you socialize by phone ?

This story is part of a special series that explores energy issues .
For more , visit The Great Energy Challenge .
When the Navy F / A - 18 jet called the Green Hornet takes off over the Chesapeake Bay on Earth Day , it will aim to break a barrier that has proven far more durable than the speed of sound .
The twin -engine tactical aircraft is prepared on April 22 to make a supersonic flight on biofuel — its tanks filled 50 percent with oil refined from the crushed seeds of the flowering Camelina sativa plant .
The test flight at the Naval Air Station at Patuxent River , Maryland will be a milestone in the Navy ’s efforts to reduce its reliance on petroleum , and perhaps , in the elusive search for an alternative fuel for aviation .
The event is meant to showcase the Pentagon ’s efforts to increase use of renewable energy , not only as a climate change initiative but to protect the military from energy price fluctuations and dependence on foreign oil .
When President Obama announced his offshore drilling and energy security plan last month at Andrews Air Force Base , he used the Green Hornet as a backdrop .
As naval aviation ’s biggest fuel consumer , the F / A - 18 Super Hornet is a fitting test aircraft .
Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus has set a target that half of naval energy consumption will come from alternative sources by 2020 .
A “ Great Green Fleet , ” to sail by 2016 , will include nuclear ships , as well as surface combatants with hybrid electric power systems using biofuel and biofuel - powered aircraft .
But for now , the Navy is seeking only to certify its first blend of biofuel and petroleum , by showing it can be used for the Super Hornet ’s full range of flight operations .
That includes demonstrating that the alternative fuel can deliver the power needed to fly faster than the speed of sound ( 343 meters per second ) .
Petroleum Paradigm
“ One of the challenges we ’ve had is that everything we have ever used in naval aviation has been designed around petroleum - based fuel , ” says Rick Kamin , the civilian who leads the Navy ’s fuel program .
“ [ The engine ] is taking advantage of everything that a petroleum - based fuel provides .
We ’ve had to work to break down that paradigm . ”
Case in point : Engine seals .
They were designed under the assumption that the engines would run on petroleum jet fuel , which contains aromatics — certain very stable compounds — that cause seals to swell , preventing leaks .
After months of testing , the Navy concluded that current engine seals still need a certain amount of petroleum .
“ One of our primary objectives is that the fuel we approve from non-petroleum sources has to be a drop - in replacement , ” Kamin says .
“ It has to perform the same as a petroleum - based fuel performs and require no modification to the aircraft .
Our goal is that these fuels have to be invisible to the operator . ”
One of the appeals of Camelina oil , in fact , was that despite the aromatics issue , the fuel made from it was remarkably similar to the military petroleum jet fuel called JP - 5 .
The biofuel developed by Sustainable Oils of Seattle has the same energy density .
Not only does it deliver the same power , but all the aircraft systems — including the fuel gauge , which reads energy density — can operate on biofuel just as they would on conventional jet propellent .
“ All we ’re doing is what nature does over millions of years , ” says Tom Todaro , chief executive of Sustainable Oils .
“ Jets today are flying on biomass — it ’s just that with pressure and time , the oxygen has been leached off the oil and replaced with hydrogen .
All we did was , using molecular biology and chemistry , make that move at a much faster speed . ”
Without the work in the laboratory , wild - growing Camelina would not easily squeeze out a type of oil with the oomph to power military flight .
A member of the mustard family and a relative of canola plants , the heavily - branched Camelina looked like a good biofuel source because it produces copious small seeds with high oil content .
But Sustainable Oils and its two parent companies , agricultural science firm Targeted Growth and Houston - based biofuel producer Green Earth Fuels , spent a decade and millions of dollars breeding a strain of seed optimized for fuel production .
The company won contracts valued at $ 18 million from the Defense Department last year .
Crop Science
The company is confident that it has overcome many of the disadvantages of the corn - and soy - based biofuels now in commercial use , like ethanol and biodiesel .
Camelina is cold - tolerant , needs little water or fertilizer , and can be rotated in the northwestern United States and Canada on fields that farmers otherwise would leave fallow between wheat crops .
“ We wanted a crop that did n’t compete with food , ” says Todaro .
The company points to a lifecycle analysis conducted by scientists at Michigan Technical University concluded that the Camelina - derived jet fuel would produce 84 percent lower carbon emissions than petroleum fuel .
Sustainable Oils is just one of several companies working with the Department of Defense in the search for military - grade biofuel .
Solazyme of South San Francisco , California has contracts to provide algae - based fuel to the Navy for testing in ships as well as aircraft .
Houston - based Accelergy last month announced it has begun production of a synthetic jet fuel from coal and biomass to be evaluated by the Air Force .

LOS ANGELES ( Hollywood Reporter ) -
How much should a copyright owner pay for improperly telling a website to remove content ?
Stephanie Lenz got into trouble with Universal Music Group in 2007 after she posted a YouTube video of her toddler dancing to the Prince song “ Let ’s Go Crazy . ”
The label fired off a letter demanding removal of the clip and YouTube complied .
Lenz then teamed with online free - speech advocates at the Electronic Frontier Foundation to get a judge to declare that her video was a “ fair use ” of the song .
She then sought damages against Universal , the world ’s biggest record company , for sending a meritless takedown request .
Universal fought back by raising affirmative defenses that Lenz had bad faith and unclean hands in pursuing damages .
Now a California district court judge has rejected those arguments , granting partial summary judgment to Lenz and paving the way for Lenz to collect attorneys fees .
The case is important because it raises the question of whether a media company can be held liable for pursuing a takedown without a full consideration of fair use .
The decision by the court last Thursday is very technical and examines damage claims under a statutory code that deals with liability when misrepresentations are made about infringing works online .
A preliminary read on the decision indicates that Lenz can recover legal fees associated with fighting the takedown , but not necessarily fees connected with the cost of pursuing Universal for damages in follow - up litigation .
To really sock it to Universal , Lenz would have to make a claim under a code that awards fees at the court ’s discretion .
To do that , she will likely need to show that Universal knowingly misrepresented its initial claim .
I was born in England in 1948 , late enough to avoid conscription by a few years , but in time for the Beatles : I was fourteen when they came out with “ Love Me Do . ”
Three years later the first miniskirts appeared : I was old enough to appreciate their virtues , young enough to take advantage of them .
I grew up in an age of prosperity , security , and comfort — and therefore , turning twenty in 1968 , I rebelled .
Like so many baby boomers , I conformed in my nonconformity .
Without question , the 1960s were a good time to be young .
Everything appeared to be changing at unprecedented speed and the world seemed to be dominated by young people ( a statistically verifiable observation ) .
On the other hand , at least in England , change could be deceptive .
As students we vociferously opposed the Labour government ’s support for Lyndon Johnson ’s war in Vietnam .
I recall at least one such protest in Cambridge , following a talk there by Denis Healey , the defense minister of the time .
We chased his car out of the town — a friend of mine , now married to the EU high commissioner for foreign affairs , leaped onto the hood and hammered furiously at the windows .
It was only as Healey sped away that we realized how late it was — college dinner would start in a few minutes and we did not want to miss it .
Heading back into town , I found myself trotting alongside a uniformed policeman assigned to monitor the crowd .
We looked at each other .
“ How do you think the demonstration went ? ” I asked him .
Taking the question in stride — finding in it nothing extraordinary — he replied : “ Oh I think it went quite well , Sir . ”
Cambridge , clearly , was not ripe for revolution .
Nor was London : at the notorious Grosvenor Square demonstration outside the American embassy ( once again about Vietnam — like so many of my contemporaries I was most readily mobilized against injustice committed many thousands of miles away ) , squeezed between a bored police horse and some park railings , I felt a warm , wet sensation down my leg .
Incontinence ?
A bloody wound ?
No such luck .
A red paint bomb that I had intended to throw in the direction of the embassy had burst in my pocket .
That same evening I was to dine with my future mother - in - law , a German lady of impeccably conservative instincts .
I doubt if it improved her skeptical view of me when I arrived at her door covered from waist to ankle in a sticky red substance — she was already alarmed to discover that her daughter was dating one of those scruffy lefties chanting “ Ho , Ho , Ho Chi Minh ” whom she had been watching with some distaste on television that afternoon .
I , of course , was only sorry that it was paint and not blood .
Oh to épater la bourgeoisie .
For real revolution , of course , you went to Paris .
Like so many of my friends and contemporaries I traveled there in the spring of 1968 to observe — to inhale — the genuine item .
Or , at any rate , a remarkably faithful performance of the genuine item .
Or , perhaps , in the skeptical words of Raymond Aron , a psychodrama acted out on the stage where once the genuine item had been performed in repertoire .
Because Paris really had been the site of revolution — indeed , much of our visual understanding of the term derives from what we think we know of the events there in the years 1789 - 1794 — it was sometimes difficult to distinguish between politics , parody , pastiche …and performance .
From one perspective everything was as it should be : real paving stones , real issues ( or real enough to the participants ) , real violence , and occasionally real victims .
But at another level it all seemed not quite serious : even then I was hard pushed to believe that beneath the paving stones lay the beach ( sous les pavés la plage ) , much less that a community of students shamelessly obsessed with their summer travel plans — in the midst of intense demonstrations and debates , I recall much talk of Cuban vacations — seriously intended to overthrow President Charles de Gaulle and his Fifth Republic .
All the same , it was their own children out on the streets , so many French commentators purported to believe this might happen and were duly nervous .
By any serious measure , nothing at all happened and we all went home .
At the time , I thought Aron unfairly dismissive — his dyspepsia prompted by the sycophantic enthusiasms of some of his fellow professors , swept off their feet by the vapid utopian cliches of their attractive young charges and desperate to join them .
Today I would be disposed to share his contempt , but back then it seemed a bit excessive .
The thing that seemed most to annoy Aron was that everyone was having fun — for all his brilliance he could not see that even though having fun is not the same as making a revolution , many revolutions really did begin playfully and with laughter .
A year or two later I visited a friend studying at a German university — Goettingen , I believe .
“ Revolution ” in Germany , it turned out , meant something very different .
No one was having fun .
To an English eye , everyone appeared unutterably serious — and alarmingly preoccupied with sex .
This was something new : English students thought a lot about sex but did surprisingly little ; French students were far more sexually active ( as it seemed to me ) but kept sex and politics quite separate .
Except for the occasional exhortation to “ make love , not war , ” their politics were intensely — even absurdly — theoretical and dry .
Women participated — if at all — as coffee makers and sleeping partners ( and as shoulder - borne visual accessories for the benefit of press photographers ) .
Little wonder that radical feminism followed in short order .
But in Germany , politics was about sex — and sex very largely about politics .
I was amazed to discover , while visiting a German student collective ( all the German students I knew seemed to live in communes , sharing large old apartments and each other ’s partners ) , that my contemporaries in the Bundesrepublik really believed their own rhetoric .
A rigorously complex - free approach to casual intercourse was , they explained , the best way to rid oneself of any illusions about American imperialism — and represented a therapeutic purging of their parents ’
Nazi heritage , characterized as repressed sexuality masquerading as nationalist machismo .
The notion that a twenty - year - old in Western Europe might exorcise his parents ’ guilt by stripping himself ( and his partner ) of clothes and inhibitions — metaphorically casting off the symbols of repressive tolerance — struck my empirical English leftism as somewhat suspicious .
How fortunate that anti-Nazism required — indeed , was defined by — serial orgasm .
But on reflection , who was I to complain ?
A Cambridge student whose political universe was bounded by deferential policemen and the clean conscience of a victorious , unoccupied country was perhaps ill - placed to assess other peoples ’ purgative strategies .
I might have felt a little less superior had I known more about what was going on some 250 miles to the east .
What does it say of the hermetically sealed world of cold war Western Europe that I — a well - educated student of history , of East European Jewish provenance , at ease in a number of foreign languages , and widely traveled in my half of the continent — was utterly ignorant of the cataclysmic events unraveling in contemporary Poland and Czechoslovakia ?
Attracted to revolution ?
Then why not go to Prague , unquestionably the most exciting place in Europe at that time ?
Or Warsaw , where my youthful contemporaries were risking expulsion , exile , and prison for their ideas and ideals ?
What does it tell us of the delusions of May 1968 that I cannot recall a single allusion to the Prague Spring , much less the Polish student uprising , in all of our earnest radical debates ?
Had we been less parochial ( at forty years ’ distance , the level of intensity with which we could discuss the injustice of college gate hours is a little difficult to convey ) , we might have left a more enduring mark .
As it was , we could expatiate deep into the night on China ’s Cultural Revolution , the Mexican upheavals , or even the sit-ins at Columbia University .
But except for the occasional contemptuous German who was content to see in Czechoslovakia ’s Dubcek just another reformist turncoat , no one talked of Eastern Europe .
Looking back , I ca n’t help feeling we missed the boat .
Marxists ?
Then why were n’t we in Warsaw debating the last shards of Communist revisionism with the great Leszek Kolakowski and his students ?
Rebels ?
In what cause ?
At what price ?
Even those few brave souls of my acquaintance who were unfortunate enough to spend a night in jail were usually home in time for lunch .
What did we know of the courage it took to withstand weeks of interrogation in Warsaw prisons , followed by jail sentences of one , two , or three years for students who had dared to demand the things we took for granted ?
For all our grandstanding theories of history , then , we failed to notice one of its seminal turning points .
It was in Prague and Warsaw , in those summer months of 1968 , that Marxism ran itself into the ground .
It was the student rebels of Central Europe who went on to undermine , discredit , and overthrow not just a couple of dilapidated Communist regimes but the very Communist idea itself .
Had we cared a little more about the fate of ideas we tossed around so glibly , we might have paid greater attention to the actions and opinions of those who had been brought up in their shadow .
No one should feel guilty for being born in the right place at the right time .
We in the West were a lucky generation .
We did not change the world ; rather , the world changed obligingly for us .
Everything seemed possible : unlike young people today we never doubted that there would be an interesting job for us , and thus felt no need to fritter away our time on anything as degrading as “ business school . ”
Most of us went on to useful employment in education or public service .
We devoted energy to discussing what was wrong with the world and how to change it .
We protested the things we did n’t like , and we were right to do so .
In our own eyes at least , we were a revolutionary generation .
Pity we missed the revolution .

[ Editor 's note : As part of our Best of the Campus Press series , The Tyee is pleased to share this article which first appeared in the Ubyssey student newspaper of University of British Columbia . ]
The mattock , a close cousin of the pickaxe , is used to dig through tough , earthy surfaces .
It loosens soil , breaks rock , and tears through knotted grass .
Its handle is a three - foot wooden shaft , twice the density of a baseball bat and its dual - sided iron head is comprised of a chisel and a pick .
It was Pastor Fred Phelps 's weapon of choice when beating his children according to his son , Nate Phelps .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
" The Bible says ' spare the rod , spoil the child , ' " explained Nate , " and he would be screaming that out as he was beating us . "
One Christmas night , Pastor Phelps hit Nate over 200 times with a mattock 's handle , swinging it like a baseball player .
Nate would hide out in the garage with his siblings , where he could escape his father 's wrath .
What he could n't escape , however , was the fear of going to hell .
He suffered much abuse growing up under the roof of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church ( WBC ) -- he still suffers today .
The church , which believes that " God is hateful , " has n't changed its grim outlook since Nate 's time there 30 years ago , but it has expanded its fame .
WBC has become well known for picketing funerals , where its followers , predominantly Phelps family members , proclaim that God is punishing " fags and fag enablers . "
To further the damage , the church frequently targets military funerals .
" WBC will picket the funerals of these Godless , fag army American soldiers when their pieces return home , " their website says .
They believe God is punishing America for facilitating homosexuality , which , according to the church , ought to be a capital crime .
Last year , WBC planned to protest the funeral of Tim McLean , the young man who was beheaded on a Greyhound bus .
However , they were barred from crossing the Canadian border .
And the church has declared Canada to be a " a filthy country run by fags . "
It is little wonder that Louis Theroux ’s BBC documentary on the Phelps ' was titled The Most Hated Family in America .
Incidentally , it was when I mentioned this documentary that Nate introduced himself to me .
Dad , the hateful preacher
It was a Monday in September of last year and I was on my way to the Cranbrook Airport .
Cranbrook , a modest city of about 25,000 , hides in B.C. 's Kootenays .
It rests behind a shroud of mountains , clean air , and restful silence .
I began a conversation with my cab driver , who looked to be in his late forties , with a trimmed beard and kind eyes .
He told me that he once owned a chain of print shops with his brother , that he liked the BBC , and that Pastor Fred Phelps was his father -- only after I had mentioned WBC , unaware .
Following this coincidence , he agreed to an interview .
Nate 's story tells of the " shadow -- the dark , ugly thing at the back of their minds . "
The fear of burning in hell never goes away , said Nate , who is still struggling with it himself .
" It 's destructive .
It 's hard to live life with that stuff in your head . "
But he 's doing his best .
His conditioning began over 40 years ago in Topeka , Kansas , where WBC was formed and still exists today .
As its pastor , his father very quickly alienated himself from most of the people who had seeded the church .
" A young lady got pregnant by a solider at Fort Riley , " explained Nate , " and [ my father 's ] response to that was to kick her out of the church .
. . and that sent most of the people packing .
There was already that siege mentality developing : us against the world . "
Sundays were particularly strict .
Nate was expected to dress formally and present himself in the church auditorium by a certain time .
The sermon that followed was always " fire - and - brimstone preaching . "
" I know that very early on [ my father ] was under the influence of those drugs , " Nate said .
Pastor Phelps was attending law school and would take amphetamines to stay awake and barbiturates to come down .
" It spiralled out of control [ and he ] was prone toward violence … .
He just was n't tolerant toward the presence of all of us kids running around — and the accompanying noise .
. .
He would beat the kids with his fists and kick them and knee them in the stomach . "
Nate does n't know why his father was such an angry man ; he did n't know his father very well .
" I just know that that 's the way he was and I stayed as far away from him as I could . "
He remembers when his father would force him and his siblings to run five to ten miles around the high school track every night .
One evening another boy was riding his bicycle along the outer lanes of the track , and Fred began yelling at him to leave .
The boy 's response was to keep riding on the track , and Fred 's was to push him off the bike .
The boy left , screaming , and 20 minutes later a truck came screeching into the parking lot .
The boy had brought his father , who approached Fred and knocked him to the ground .
" The man was threatening to sue him , " said Nate .
" Then my old man yelled at us all to get in the car and we went home , and [ my father ] ended up beating my mom that night . "
Nate left home the day he turned 18 .
For a while he worked for a lawyer in Kansas City , eventually moving to St. Louis to work for a printing company with his brother Mark .
He and Mark opened up their own print shop soon after .
But then , after three years and despite his brother ’s disapproval , Nate returned home .
" My sisters were trying to convince me that things had changed .
. .
I attended college for a semester and realized that while he may have been less prone to physical violence , he still was the same person .
He just used different techniques to violate people -- with his words and his deeds . "
Escape from hell
In October of 1980 , Nate left for good .
He found residence above a Volkswagen repair shop , where he went through about six months in a drug and alcohol haze .
He eventually ran into Mark 's wife and she suggested that he and his brother reconcile their animosity , which had been caused when Nate returned to WBC temporarily .
And so Nate moved to California to work with his brother again .
Late one night over a decade later , Nate found himself listening to his father being interviewed on a radio station in LA -- it was n't long after Fred had gained national attention with his protests .
Nate called in under the impression that the interview was a rerun , but realized after calling that his father was on the air live .
" I was freaked out .
I got on and I challenged [ my father ] .
. .
That lasted about maybe a minute , and it devolved quickly into him calling me every name he could imagine , and then he handed the phone to Shirley , and she delivered a few diatribes . "
Shirley Phelps - Roper , Nate 's sister , has gained her own reputation for being the church 's other loud voice .
Nate says that she has always been their father 's favourite .
I contacted her to ask about her brother , and she responded with the following .
" Nathan Phelps is a rebel against God , " she said .
" He has nothing to look forward to except sorrow , misery , death and hell .
. ..
Great peace fell upon our house when Nathan left .
. .
He spit on the goodness of his mother and father .
In spite of that , his father and mother loved him and did their duty to him .
. . and required of him that he behave while he lived in their house .
They loved him in the only way that the Lord God defines love !
They told him the truth about what the Lord his God required of him .
He was not going to have that ! "
Shirley also claimed that Nate " left when he was a raging disobedient rebel with selective memory , " and asked , " What in this world is he doing in Canada ? "
' It was like paradise '
Nate met his ex-wife in ' 81 , married in ' 86 .
They had three children together and he helped raise a fourth .
They moved to a new , pre-planned city , Rancho Santa Margarita , nestled at the foot of Saddleback Mountain in California .
" It was like paradise , " Nate said .
" It was a perfect little town , and we were young and starting a family .
It all just seemed so ideal . "
They joined a church , where they met many other families , five of which they became close with .
" Every Sunday , I was listening closely and trying desperately to find something in the preaching or in the words that would convince me that this was right .
Even while I was doing that , I was always skeptical .
. . but I never voiced it .
I was very good at playing the apologist for the Christian faith .
In fact , I had quite a reputation for writing and talking in defence of Christianity . "
The turning point was one Christmas , when Nate decided to teach his children about God .
In the end , his son Tyler began crying in the backseat of the car , saying that he did n't want to go to hell .
" He wanted to believe because he did n't want to go to hell , " Nate said .
" I was just stunned because I did n't know what I had said or how I had left him with that fear .
I thought I was doing a good job of presenting it without the fear .
" Thinking about it after the fact , I realized you can't do that .
With a young mind it does n't matter .
You can try as much as you want to talk about how good God is , but the bottom line is there ’s this intolerably frightening punishment if you do n't accept it .
And how does a young mind deal with that ? "
Using religion to abuse
Nate agrees with prominent atheist and scientist Richard Dawkins , who has said that religion can be " real child abuse . "
Dawkins tells the story of an American woman who wrote to him .
She was raised as a Roman Catholic and was sexually abused by her parish priest in his car .
Around the same time , a Protestant school friend of hers died tragically .
" Being fondled by the priest simply left the impression ( from the mind of a seven - year - old ) as yucky , " she wrote , " while the memory of my friend going to hell was one of cold , immeasurable fear .
I never lost sleep because of the priest , but I spent many a night being terrified that the people I loved would go to hell .
It gave me nightmares . "
" The threat of eternal Hell is an extreme example of mental abuse , " Dawkins says on his website , " just as violent sodomy is an extreme example of physical abuse . "
" I could n't agree more , " asserted Nate .
" In so many different ways we have abused children with religion over the centuries . "
Nate said that he is being contacted by nephews he'd never previously met who have made the same choice he did 30 years ago .
One of them was Tim , who told Nate that he spends many nights crying himself to sleep .
He 's scared .
" Once he made the choice , he 's cut off .
Everything that he grew up with is taken away from him , and he gets to wonder if he 's going to burn in hell .
. . [ He 's ] living with that shadow . "
Branded a traitor
Eventually , Nate told his wife that he could n't continue believing .
Then he told the men from the five families that they were close to , and they responded by disappearing from his life .
" As far as they were concerned , I was a traitor -- well , that 's how they behaved . "
" I do declare myself an atheist now , " affirmed Nate , " although I 'm willing to admit that there 's stuff in life that I 'm not real clear on yet . "
Despite this , he still lives with anxiety caused by his experiences over 40 years ago .
" I spent the first 25 or 30 years of my life denying that anything was wrong with me .
. .
Then bam : all this weird stuff just starts coming out .
" It 's so , so difficult to go back and look at stuff and try to make sense of it , especially being this far removed from it .
I 'll immerse myself in it for a couple weeks , and then I got to back away because it 's too destructive .
But I have to believe it 's going to turn out . "
I asked Nate what he wanted for his future .
" I think the best way to answer that is what I said to my wife when we were fighting at the end . "
He paused for a moment .
" That I just want peace .
I want to not wake up fearful every morning . "
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , left , and Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) plan to unveil legislation later this week .
Dems move to blunt Citizens United
In the coming week , Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) and Rep. Mike Castle ( R - Del. ) plan to unveil legislation to close campaign - finance loopholes opened by the Supreme Court 's Citizens United decision .
The legislation was written in consultation with the White House .
Here are details that have been circulated to Democratic congressional staffers , and were obtained by POLITICO :
The DISCLOSE Act :
Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act
The Response to Citizens United
Advertisement
The Supreme Court , in a 5 - 4 decision on January 21 ( Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ) , overturned decades of campaign finance law and policy , and will now allow special interest money to overwhelm our system and corrode our democracy .
We can not sit by and watch this money flood our system .
On February 11 , Senator Schumer and Congressman Van Hollen released a legislative framework that outlined how we can respond to this decision , and they have been working on the legislation since then .
Next week , Senator Schumer will be introducing The Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act ( or “ The DISCLOSE Act ” ) , which will rein in the increased influence of special interest money in our federal elections that this decision will unleash .
The House companion will be led by Reps. Chris Van Hollen ( D - MD ) and Mike Castle ( R - DE ) .
Below is an outline of the proposal :
The legislation will address seven major points :
1. Enhance Disclaimers : Make CEOs and other leaders take responsibility for their ads .
If a corporation , union , section 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , or ( 6 ) organization , or section 527 organization spend on campaign - related activity , its CEO or organization head will have to stand by the ad and say that he or she “ approves this message , ” just like candidates have to do now .
In order to seek out the real money behind the ad , this legislation will drill down several layers and require the top contributor directing the funds to also “ stand by the ad . ”
Additionally , we require the top five contributors to an organization to be listed on the screen .
2. Enhance Disclosures :
It is time to follow the money .
Any covered organization must disclose within 24 hours to the FEC not just its campaign - related activity , but also transfers of money to other groups which can then be used for campaign - related activity .
Additionally , a covered organization must disclose its donors and has two options : 1 ) it can disclose all of its donors $ 1,000 and above ; or 2 ) it can set up a “ Campaign - Related Activity ” account and disclose only those political donors to that account $ 1,000 and above .
If , however , the organization dips into its general account for funds , it must then disclose all its general treasury donors in excess of $ 10,000 .
In both options , the Act allows for organizations to “ wall - off ” donations if the donor does not want the money to go to campaign - related spending .
3. Prevent Foreign Influence : Foreign countries and entities should not be determining the outcome of our elections .
Corporations that have either 1 ) a foreign entity controlling 20 % of its voting shares ; 2 ) foreign nationals comprising a majority of its board of directors ; 3 ) a foreign national who directs , dictates , or controls U.S. operations ; or 4 ) a foreign national who directs , dictates , or controls political decision - making are banned from spending in U.S. elections .
If a corporation is under the direction or control of a foreign entity , it should not be able to spend money on our elections .
4. Shareholder / Member Disclosure :
We should allow shareholders and members to know where money goes .
This provision would mandate disclosure by corporations , unions , and other groups to their shareholders and members in their annual and periodic reports .
This would also require these groups to make their political spending public on their websites within 24 hours after filing with the FEC .
5. Prevent Government Contractors from Spending : Taxpayer money should not be spent on political ads .
Due to the appearance of corruption and possible misuse of taxpayer funds , government contractors with a contract worth more than $ 50,000 will not be allowed to spend money on elections .
Similarly , TARP recipients who have not paid back government funds are also banned from spending .
6. Provide the Lowest Unit Rate for Candidates and Parties : Special interests should not drown out the voices of the people .
If a covered organization buys airtime to run ads that support or attack a candidate , then candidates , parties , and party committees get to take advantage of the lowest unit rate for that market .
This provision is limited specifically to that media market .
Additionally we improve the reasonable access provisions to ensure that candidates are not shut out of airtime .
7. Tighten Coordination Rules : Corporations should not be able to “ sponsor ” a candidate .
Loopholes in current coordination rules would be filled , thereby banning coordination between a candidate and outside groups on ads that reference a candidate from the time period beginning 90 days before a primary and running through the general election .
At the same time , rules limiting coordination between the party and the candidate are loosened a bit to allow for effective responses to the influx of corporate and special interest money .
Loose threads and general vagueness are often poor crutches in storytelling .
These aspects tend to be weird for the sake of being weird , or serve as token springboards for potential sequels , or — worse yet — are indicative of the creator (s ) ’s lack of a narrative plan , e.g. , Lost .
Mystery is inherently alluring , though , and it can also have a fulfilling payoff .
The Souls games are a good example of that .
Each title begins with a seemingly disconnected CG intro , and proceeds to thrust the player into a crumbling world with barely an explanation .
There are no lengthy expositions , conquests retold over animated world maps , extensive flashback sequences , etc. Instead , whatever pieces of narrative the player puts together are entirely optional and widely scattered about .
A tib - bit mentioned in passing by an NPC foreshadows a gruesome battlefield encountered later in the game .
Flavour text accompanying an item hints at a long - standing dynasty and its wealth .
Parts of defaced statues allude to an outcast regal heir .
There ’s not much of a plot to the player - controlled protagonist , but there ’s an incredible sense of depth and history to the setting itself .
It ’s all very cohesive and consistent , and delivered with understated elegance .
That ’s something incredibly rare for a brand new series , but the Souls games actually have something of a 20 + year development history .
From Software ’s other games such as Eternal Ring , Shadow Tower , Evergrace , Otogi , and King ’s Field contain bits of gameplay and ambiance present in the Souls titles : stamina - draining melee attacks , stat - boosting equipment , sporadically dispersed NPCs , non-linear exploration , item durability and crafting , fog - of - war / dynamic lighting , loading screen and item flavour text , highly destructible environments , “ soul ” - harvesting progression , etc .
All of these previous games experimented with and revised what ’s so confidently delivered in Demon ’s Souls and Dark Souls , but the series itself also follows in the footsteps of another older title : Wizardry .
Wizardry ’s arrival and subsequent popularity in Japan is fairly well documented , and King ’s Field , From Software ’s inaugural release , is said to have been closely inspired by the Western CRPG .
The interesting part is that Wizardry ’s success seems to have come in part due to a shoddy localization .
The only clear example of this I can find is a Wikipedia entry that mentions Blade Cusinart — a silly nod to Cuisinart food processors — evoking an aura of alien mythology .
I assume the results were similar with subsequent Wizardry titles , which contained even more pop culture references , but it ’s hard to find any concrete evidence of how these were interpreted in Japan .
Perhaps someone else could shine a light on the subject ?
Regardless , it ’s still fascinating to think about how a simple misconception could be taken to an extreme .
Many of From Software ’s titles found a niche audience and followed their own paths instead of borrowing the homogeneous conventions of their peers ; what else could we have seen if a misunderstood production memo or marketing bullet - point was left to evolve in a bubble ?
In the end the significance of Wizardy ’s Japanese localization might be a bit overstated , but its heritage is certainly evident in the Souls games .
They ’re positively brimming with relics steeped in a strange , foreign history , and greatly contribute to the series ’ unique style .
A 6.9 - magnitude earthquake struck Qinghai province of China Wednesday morning , the U.S. Geological Survey reported .
The quake hit at 7:49 a.m. local time ( 8:49 p.m. ET ) .
The epicenter was about 150 miles ( 240 kilometers ) northwest of Qamdo , Tibet .
Qinghai borders the autonomous regions of Tibet and Xingjiang and the provinces of Gansu and Sichuan .
No other details were immediately available .
Today ’s topic :
At what point in the economic recovery can Washington turn its attention to addressing the impending insolvency of Medicare and Social Security ?
Dean Baker and Maya MacGuineas finish their debate on the relationship between unemployment rates and economic recovery , and how much Washington can do about both .
Point : Dean Baker , Center for Economic and Policy Research
We should separate the issues of getting the economy on track and fixing our long - term deficit problems .
As long as the economy is suffering from excessive levels of unemployment , it would be foolish to take steps that would throw even more people out of work .
This kind of fixation on deficit reduction caused President Franklin Roosevelt to throw the economy into a second recession in 1937 as he sought to cut back the stimulus he put in place .
We must be careful to avoid the same mistake going forward .
In terms of the long - term deficit problems , it is essential to separate out Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , Social Security will be financed fully from its own stream of tax revenue through the year 2048 .
It is projected to face deficits in subsequent years due to the fact that our children and grandchildren are projected to live longer than we do .
We will have to adjust the spending or revenue streams at some point for this program , but it is still a distant problem .
We should also be clear that any cuts any time soon must be completely off the table .
Due to the loss of home equity and the plunge in stock prices associated with the collapse of the housing bubble , the vast majority of baby boomers will have almost nothing to support themselves in retirement other than their Social Security benefits .
The problem with Medicare is that our healthcare system is broken ; we pay far more than other wealthy countries for our care and get worse outcomes .
We do n’t need to fix Medicare ; we need to fix our healthcare system , and this is something we should have started yesterday .
The remedies are actually easy ; the problem is that the political will does not exist to challenge powerful vested interests such as the insurance industry , the pharmaceutical industry and the doctors lobbies .
Close to 20 % ( about $ 500 billion a year ) of our healthcare spending is wasted on financing the insurance industry and the paperwork requirements that it imposes on providers .
We pay almost twice as much for prescription drugs as other countries .
If we could get our costs in line , it would save us close to $ 100 billion a year .
If drugs were sold in a competitive market without patent protection , we would save more than $ 200 billion a year .
If we paid our doctors the same salaries as those in other wealthy countries , we ’d save another $ 80 billion a year .
All of these changes would be doable if it were n’t for the power of special - interest groups in Washington , as we see in the current debate on healthcare reform .
If it proves impossible to fix our healthcare system , we can still save a vast amount of money by simply going around it .
Why not let Medicare beneficiaries buy into the more efficient healthcare systems of other countries and split the savings ?
This could save us tens of trillions of dollars over the next few decades .
We just need a Congress that is n’t scared to stand up to the protectionists and the special interests .
Counterpoint : Maya MacGuineas , New American Foundation Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget
Unfortunately , one of the outcomes of this recession is that the faraway fiscal problems are now at our doorstep .
It has been well known for years that Social Security and Medicare need altering to deal with the financial imbalances in those systems .
Yet basic partisanship and an unwillingness by politicians to make tough choices has stood in the way .
Keep in mind , the sooner changes are made , the more gradually they can be phased in and the more time beneficiaries will have to prepare for the changes that would affect them .
We no longer have the luxury of time .
The Social Security trust funds have shrunk dramatically because of the recession .
Already , those trust funds were misleading ; in order to repay them when the money is needed to pay retirees , the government would have to raise taxes , cut government spending or borrow -- the same policy options that would have been necessary if the trust funds had not existed in the first place .
In its use by lawmakers as an accounting technique and a mechanism to fund government spending , the trust funds have been a failure .
Now on top of that , the funds have less money to provide the rest of the government with dollars to borrow .
The bottom line is that we should have been making changes to Social Security years ago once we knew there was a problem ; there is no excuse for further delay .
With healthcare , I was hopeful that the reforms to come out of Congress would be large enough to fix Medicare and Medicaid , or at least go much of the way ( the problems are so large , there will probably have to be several rounds of “ healthcare reform ” ) .
But it is likely that none of the bills under consideration will go far enough , especially after they are further watered down on the cost - saving side .
( Click here and here to see a comparison chart of the bills . )
Sooner or later , the types of changes that I believe will have to be made include raising the retirement age for both Social Security and Medicare , means - testing the programs and creating an overall government healthcare spending cap .
Can I imagine the political attack ads that will be run against anyone who dares explain this to the public ?
Of course .
I only hope there are members of Congress who are courageous enough to tackle these issues honestly and head on .
When it comes to entitlement reform , we should have started yesterday .
Thanks ,
Dean , for an interesting discussion .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Sharp Corp said it plans to start making this year advanced 3D displays for cellphones and other mobile devices that do n’t require special viewing glasses , betting that demand for 3D images will grow beyond movie theatres and living rooms to portable machines .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Stirring demand for small - sized displays is important for Japanese LCD panel suppliers after they suffered sluggish demand for panels designed for portable electronics due to a sharp slide in mobile phone sales in the domestic market .
Sharp launched mobile phones and PCs equipped with a display that enables users to watch 3D images without glasses in the early 2000s .
But they have not really caught on because of such factors as bulkiness , insufficient brightness and the lack of 3D contents .
Sharp since then has developed brighter and thinner 3D displays with higher resolution and a touch panel function .
“ In the 2D era , contents and infrastructure have spread from movies to homes , and from homes to mobile devices , ” Sharp Executive Managing Officer Yoshisuke Hasegawa told a news conference on Friday .
“ We believe the same thing will happen with 3D .
Three - dimensional images that mostly inhabit big screens now are about to hit mobile terminals . ”
Hasegawa , head of Sharp ’s LCD business , did not disclose a sales target for the new 3D display .
Consumer electronics makers are scrambling to launch 3D TVs this year , hoping the technology will be as big a boost for the industry as the transition to color TVs from black and white .
Panasonic Corp and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd have already released 3D models , while Sony Corp is planning to start offering 3D TVs in June .
But analysts have said the need for special 3D glasses may keep consumers from adopting the technology quickly .
Mobile electronics that let users enjoy 3D images without special glasses have been around for some time , since people tend to watch the display from a fixed distance and with a fixed angle on personal devices such as mobile phones , making it technologically less challenging to offer a 3D function .

Co said last month it planned to launch a new model of its DS handheld game console that allows users to play 3D games without using special glasses .
Hasegawa said the company has already received inquiries on the new product from mobile phone makers and other potential customers , but declined to say if Nintendo is one of them .
Shares of Sharp , the world ’s fourth - largest LCD TV maker behind Samsung , Sony and LG Electronics Inc , closed 2.7 percent higher at 1,209 yen on Friday , outperforming the Tokyo stock market ’s electrical machinery index , which gained 0.8 percent .
Many of the Arab Christians flocking to holy sites in Israel this Easter Sunday come from neighboring Jordan .
But they do so at a price .
Those who make the trek – and , as part of a broader rise in religious tourism , more are making it every year – risk their professional reputation and their family ’s disapproval .
For a country whose 1994 peace treaty with Israel was never accepted at the popular level , receiving an entry stamp , let alone a visa from Israel , is considered “ treason ” to the Arab cause .
But despite a growing movement to discredit those involved with the “ Zionist enemy , ” hundreds of Jordanians risk their careers and reputation to complete a pilgrimage to holy sites in Israel ’s occupied territories .
“ I cannot help it , ” says Daoud Yazeed , a Jordanian Christian who disguises his pilgrimages as business trips .
“ Jerusalem is calling . ”
Religious tourism
In 2009 , 15,000 Jordanians traveled to Israel , the most of any Arab or Muslim country .
While a majority of them were visiting Palestinian relatives , a significant number are part of a growing trend of religious tourism .
According to tour operators , an increasing number of Jordanian Christians and Muslims – Jerusalem is Islam ’s third holiest city – are taking part in all - inclusive week - long trips through Nazareth , Hebron , and Jerusalem , priced at $ 600 .
But under the Anti-Normalization movement , spearheaded by Islamists and professional associations opposed to Jordan ’s 1994 peace treaty – or “ normalization ” with Israel – those found to have normalized are disbarred from their union and lose their professional licenses , which are required by Jordanian law .
Families further face the public humiliation of being added to a once - publicized blacklist of individuals and companies that deal with the “ Zionist entity . ”
' Anti-normalization ' activists
Anti-Normalization activists are determined to crack down on the practice this holiday to bring to light those who have “ normalized with the enemy , ” according to Muslim Brotherhood and National Anti- Normalization Committee leader Hamzah Mansour .
“ This is supporting Zionist efforts to rid the holy lands and Palestine of its inhabitants , and it is forbidden , ” he said .
He compared trips to Jerusalem to the Hajj , the pilgrimage to Mecca which is considered the duty of every adult Muslim , pointing out that the journey is not required if a worshiper has poor health or a lack of money .
“ Al Aqsa is occupied territory and you are not expected to pilgrimage to Al Aqsa .
God understands , ” Mr. Mansour said , calling on Jordanian Christians to pray in local holy sites this Easter to “ support the local industry . ”
According to the professional associations , they have yet to revoke union memberships over normalization .
But the threat itself has deterred hundreds , if not thousands , from making the trip , or pushed their travel into secret , tour operators say .
Normalization , however , was the last of the concerns for Ramzi Mustafa , one of 200 Christian pilgrims from Egypt – the only other Arab country that has made peace with Israel – in the holy city this weekend with organized tour groups .
He said his participation in processions on Via Dolorosa on Good Friday is a way of showing support for the Palestinians and the need for peace , not support for “ Zionism . ”
“ We do not approve of the occupation , and Easter is a way to pray for strength to endure , ” said Mr. Mustafa , as he held up a wooden cross .
Nor do Muslim pilgrimages suggest support for occupation , says the head of Jerusalem ’s holy sites , Sheikh Mohamed Azzam Tamimi .
" Jordanians and Egyptians , all Arabs should come and see the holy city , ” he said , noting that due to visa restrictions most of the visitors are from Asia , not the Arab world .
“ We may be under occupation , but supporting our efforts is not normalization . ”
Politics in the way of prayer
Politics should not prevent Arab Christians and Muslims from traveling to the holy city , according to William Shomali , auxiliary bishop of the Latin Patriarch in Jerusalem , who welcomed all Arabs to take part in Easter services .
“ Our dream is for all Arab Christians and Muslims to come and pray in the holy city , ” he said , acknowledging the current situation has been “ difficult ” for Arab Christians across the region .
“ They should come regardless of the political situation , ” he said .
“ We should separate politics from religion , even if certain parties want to join them together ; all have the right to pray in the holy sites . ”
HIV is striking back against the antiretroviral drugs that keep it largely in check in rich countries , thanks both to its exposure to the major drugs and to individuals who do n’t realise they ’re infected and so spread resistant strains to new partners .
Drug -resistant strains of HIV have already been documented in San Francisco and elsewhere in the US , and Europe .
Now a model of their transmission , based on studies of gay San Francisco men , forecasts a rapid upsurge in the next five years .
What ’s more , as access to antiretroviral therapy is expected to expand in poorer countries , they could experience a rise in resistance too , predicts Sally Blower of the University of California , Los Angeles , lead author on the analysis .
Cocktail of resistance
Currently , people with HIV tend to be given a cocktail of drugs , making it less likely that resistance will emerge .
That ’s because even if a strain evolves resistance to one of the drugs , it will still succumb to the others .
Advertisement
However , the virus can evolve resistance nonetheless .
Currently , about 15 per cent of new infections in San Francisco are from resistant strains , some of them resistant to all three major classes of drug used to combat the virus .
To see how this might increase in future , Blower ’s team created a model of HIV transmission that predicts how and when resistant strains will emerge .
When they fed it data from San Francisco , it correctly predicted how drug - resistant HIV has already evolved and spread among gay men there over the past 20 years .
Self - sustaining epidemics
When the team used the model to look into the future , it predicted a rapid upsurge in the spread of resistant strains .
The model suggested that 60 per cent of the resistant strains currently circulating in San Francisco could cause “ self - sustaining epidemics ” , says Blower , in which each infected individual spreads the resistant strain to more than one new recipient .
The most serious surge in resistance it predicted was against non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NNRTIs ) such as nevirapine , introduced in the mid-1990s .
Like the earliest anti-HIV drugs such as zidovudine ( AZT ) , introduced 10 years earlier , these block enzymes vital for viral multiplication .
“ We predict a wave of NNRTI - resistant strains will emerge over the next five years in San Francisco , due to transmission from untreated individuals , ” says Blower .
Rapid diagnosis
By 2013 , the proportion of new infections resistant to NNRTIs may have increased by 30 per cent in the city compared with now , says Blower .
The more individuals infected with resistant strains , the faster they will spread .
Resistant strains can be kept in check provided infected individuals are diagnosed rapidly , before they pass on the virus , and treated with drugs to which the virus remains vulnerable , says Blower .
But resistance may be more difficult to contain in poorer countries .
And according to Blower , a strategy recently unveiled by the World Health Organization to “ test and treat ” as many people as possible in such countries may hasten the emergence of drug - resistant strains , by exposing more people to the drugs .
“ The best approach for resource - constrained countries would be to carefully roll out first - line regimens , making sure second - line regimens are available whenever there ’s resistance to the first - line regime , ” says Blower .
However , Carl Dieffenbach , director of the division of AIDS at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda , Maryland – which this week launched a similar pilot “ test and treat ” program in Washington DC – says that development of resistance is not an insoluble problem .
“ The emergence of HIV drug resistance is not a dead end , ” he says .
“ We can identify patients who are failing treatment and switch them to other , effective regimens . ”
“ The advantage of having the model developed by Blower is that it can predict where problems may occur , and this allows us not to move forward blindly , but to proceed while taking the model ’s predictions into account , ” he adds .

On his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh unveiled his brand new conspiracy theory that environmentalists were secretly behind the oil rig explosion that has spilled hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
He reasoned , “ What better way to head off more oil drilling , nuclear plants than by blowing up a rig ? ”
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Limbaugh laid out his conspiracy theory , “ Now lest we forget , ladies and gentlemen , the carbon tax bill , cap and trade , that was scheduled to be announced on Earth Day , I remember that , then it was postponed for a couple of days later , after Earth Day … This bill the cap and trade bill was criticized by hard core environmentalist wackos because it supposedly allowed more offshore drilling and nuclear plants , nuclear plant investment , so since they ’re sending swat teams down there folks , since they ’re sending swat teams to inspect the other rigs , what better way to head off more oil drilling , nuclear plants than by blowing up a rig ?
I ’m just noting the timing here . ”

Of course , the part of Rush ’s conspiracy theory that makes no sense is why any environmentalists would want to destroy the very environment that they are trying to save by blowing up an oil rig and spewing 5,000 barrels of oil per day into the Gulf ?
Would n’t this be a violation of everything that the environmental movement stands for ?
I do n’t think that anything can be read into the timing of the explosion , because as Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - NJ ) pointed out today , there have been 509 oil fires in the Gulf since 2006 .
Instead of being a left wing conspiracy , maybe this incident shows that we need to look at the environmental dangers of offshore drilling a little more before we agree to expand it .
President Obama announced today that swat teams were being sent to the Gulf to help investigate the cause of the explosion .
Anything could have caused this explosion , but I think that it is absurd that Limbaugh would blame the very people who love the environment for destroying it .
Rush ’s conspiracy theory is not logical , but he will say anything to blame the left and protect the interests of right wing corporate America .
The Arab is a one - dimensional caricature , a cartoon cutout used by film makers as stock villains and as comic relief .
And so , over and over , we see Arabs in movies portrayed as buffoons , their only purpose being to deliver cheap laughs .
This groundbreaking documentary dissects a slanderous aspect of cinematic history that has run virtually unchallenged from the earliest days of silent film to today 's biggest Hollywood blockbusters .
Featuring acclaimed author Dr. Jack
Shaheen , the film explores a long line of degrading images of Arabs -- from Bedouin bandits and submissive maidens to sinister sheikhs and gun-wielding " terrorists " -- along the way offering devastating insights into the origin of these stereotypic images , their development at key points in US history , and why they matter so much today .
Shaheen shows how the persistence of these images over time has served to naturalize prejudicial attitudes toward Arabs and Arab culture , in the process reinforcing a narrow view of individual Arabs and the effects of specific US domestic and international policies on their lives .
By inspiring critical thinking about the social , political , and basic human consequences of leaving these Hollywood caricatures unexamined , the film challenges viewers to recognize the urgent need for counter - narratives that do justice to the diversity and humanity of Arab people and the reality and richness of Arab history and culture .
Conservative columnist and former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum made waves earlier this week when he announced that the Democrats ’ passage of health reform amounts to the GOP ’s “ Waterloo . ”
On ABC ’s Nightline Monday night , Frum showed that he is clearly not happy with the direction that American conservatism — at least as embodied in the Republican Party — has taken .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Republicans originally thought that Fox worked for us and now we ’re discovering we work for Fox , ” Frum told ABC ’s Terry Moran .
“ And this balance here has been completely reversed .
The thing that sustains a strong
Fox network is the thing that undermines a strong Republican party . ”
Frum laid the blame for the anger of anti-health reform protesters not with the GOP , but with talk radio and Fox News , which he said was the “ real leadership ” in setting the terms of the political debate on health care .
“ The anger trapped the [ Republican ] leadership , ” Frum said , and “ the leadership discovered they have no room to maneuver as a result of the anger . ”
Frum ’s view of the GOP ’s electoral prospects seemed dim .
“ Nobody ever won an election by spitting on his political opponents , ” he said , evidently referring to the incident this past weekend when anti-health reform protesters spat on Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver .
The following video was broadcast on ABC ’s Nightline , Monday March 22 , 2009 , and uploaded to the Web by MediaMatters .
George W. Bush and Dick Cheney are long gone .
Fox News Channel is Jon Stewart ’s new enemy No. 1 .
Last week that comedian did something that the hosts of “ Fox & Friends , ” the morning show on Fox News , did not do : he had his staff members call the White House and ask a question .
It may have been in pursuit of farce , not fact , but it gave credence to the people who say “ The Daily Show ” is journalistic , not just satiric .
“ Fox & Friends ” had repeatedly asked whether the crescent - shaped logo of the nuclear security summit was an “ Islamic image , ” one selected by President Obama in his outreach to the Muslim world .
The White House told “ The Daily Show ” that the logo was actually based on the Rutherford - Bohr model of the atom .
“ This is how relentless Fox is ” in savaging President Obama , Mr. Stewart said .
On the subject of Fox , Mr. Stewart is pretty relentless too .
As demonstrated by that crescent segment and dozens of others since Mr. Obama took office , he may well be television ’s pre-eminent fact - checker of Fox News , the nation ’s highest - rated cable news channel .
It has been noticed by , among other people , the Fox host Bill O’Reilly , who called Mr. Stewart a “ devoted critic ” of Fox News and said “ his influence is growing . ”
Dude , my parents let me watch TV in my bedroom .
Kids are leading the world 's transition to digital media .
This is in part because kids are n't afraid of technology , and , in part , because kids have n't spent years getting use to anything else .
So if you want to get a sense of where the world 's media habits are headed , it makes sense to watch what kids are doing .
The Kaiser Family Foundation did just that in a comprehensive survey released in January .
Kaiser surveyed more than 2,000 families , and turned up all sorts of interesting information about the media habits of 8 - 18 year olds .
( Just go to the presentation >)
Some key points :
Kids consume a hell of a lot of media -- and more all the time .
Basically , if kids are awake , they 're consuming media .
And , increasingly , they 're consuming multiple forms of media at the same time .
Kids ' print media consumption is tiny and falling .
Kids ' digital media consumption is going through the roof .
No big surprise there .
What is a surprise is how little parents seem to care about this .
( Or , alternatively , how much parents encourage this media consumption by consuming a huge amount of media themselves . )
In 2/3 of households , TVs are on during meals
In 75 % of households , TVs are on when no one is watching them .
More than 70 % of kids have TVs in their bedrooms
Only 1/3 of households have media - consumption rules
No surprise , more media is consumed in households in which TVs are always on , where there are no rules , and where kids have TVs in their bedrooms .
And , no surprise , kids who consume the most media get the worst grades ( is this cause or effect ? )
It 's a long presentation , but it 's awesome .

Welcome to Dave Arnesons Basement .
Itâ€™s 1971 and youâ€™ve been invited to play this cool new gameâ€ ¦
Experience the thrill of the very first RPG adventures with Dragons at Dawn , the rule set that hearkens back to the first days of adventure gaming when everything was new and the possibilities endless .
Dragons at Dawn is a retro tribute to the very first fantasy gaming system pioneered by Dave Arneson , the man who later went on to co-author the worlds most popular roleplaying game .
The result of years of careful historical research , Dragons at Dawn is entirely consistent with Arnesonâ€™s original , largely forgotten methods of play developed roughly in the period 1970 - 1973 .
It is an imaginative foray into what it was like to game long before the rules were available in stores .
The History :
Partly inspired by a horror movie marathon , Arneson sat down one weekend in December of 1970 and began the design of a castle and village peopled with monsters and heroes , with players able to play either one .
Mr. Arneson thought it would be fun to have the players adventure as individual warriors in a vast dungeon beneath the castle .
His group of Napoleonic wargamers loved the new game and clamored for more .
There were no rules for this sort of thing so Dave made them up , inventing things like character classes , ability scores , experience points , magic systems , alignments , and level advancement .
Later , Arneson introduced his new game to Gary Gygax and the two partnered on writing up a rule set that became quite famous , but was quite different from the game as Arneson played it .
Dragons at Dawn returns to the first version of play at the dawn of fantasy RPG gaming .
The Game :
First debuted at the 2010 Dave Arneson Memorial Game Day in NYC , the 60 page rule book allows play in two formats ; original game where players take on the role of either Warriors or Wizards , or an enhanced game where additional classes â€ “ Priest / monk , Elf Mage , Thief Assassin , Merchant and Sage â€ “ are also available .
The combat system is easy to master as it uses some very familiar statistics in some very unusual ways reminiscent of the early wargames from which role playing games developed .
Upon this basic format , layers of complexity can be added as players desire .
This same philosophy is found throughout the game .
Dragons at Dawn approaches gaming with none of the assumptions and habits developed from later rules , allowing a return to a kind of free form and open style of interaction between players and referees to develop and play whatever aspects of adventure gaming the group likes best .

By visiting a doctor and filling out lots of paperwork .
I wonder if you could cut down on some of that if you just grow a moustache ?
A student who wishes to obtain a beard exception must visit a BYU Student Health Center doctor by appointment ( 422.5156 ) .
The doctor will fax his recommendation .
The student then needs to come to the Honor Code Office to fill out some paperwork and receive the letter allowing the growth of the beard , if approved .
If a yearly beard exception is granted , a new Student ID will be issued after the beard has been fully grown , and must be renewed every year by repeating the process .
If a request is granted for a temporary or more permanent beard exception the student will be notified by the Honor Code Office ; at which time the student will come into the office to complete the necessary paperwork .
After completion of this process the student may then grow a full beard according the guidelines given .
One night I found myself reading an article that I was n't sure if it was for real or a joke .
It was about a dating site that cancelled members who became " fatties " after eating too much over the holidays .
In disbelief that such a thing could really exist , I went to check it out .
I certainly was n't going to register and become a member , so the only way to look around was to click on the " Too ugly to sign up ?
… Click here to browse as a guest " link .
The only criteria for registration is how you lookUnfortunately , this site was no joke .
The only criteria for registration is how you look .
And you can't even join unless you are voted beautiful by members who look at your picture !
They actually make it clear that they have a " strict ban on ugly people . "
Meanwhile , this is a dating site !
What kind of long - term relationship can be achieved by people willing to join and pay for a dating site where their only qualification is that they are physically attractive ?
There is no doubt that physical attraction is important and vital in a healthy relationship .
But as many of us know , attraction can grow or fade based on what is inside .
A friend once told me that after her first date with her now - husband , he was n't sure he wanted to date her further .
He just could n't stand how ugly her glasses were .
Fortunately , someone pointed out to him that glasses can always be replaced and that he should give it another shot .
Later , when he announced his engagement , that same friend asked what happened to her glasses , to which he replied , " What glasses ? "
Traditionally , on Friday nights , men recite a poem from Proverbs , a Woman of Valor , ( Eshet Chayil ) in honor of their wives .
One of its final verses reads : Sheker hachein v'hevel hayofee ...
" Grace is false and beauty is vain , but a woman who has awe for G‑d , she should be praised . "
Attraction can grow or fade based on what is insideOn the most external level , we understand that more important than what is on the outside is what is on the inside .
A pretty face with nothing behind it is worthless .
But there is more to it .
Both the words for false , " sheker , " and vain , " hevel , " contain the letters within them to form quite different words .
If what you are solely focusing on in a relationship is external grace , it will lead you to falsehood .
If you care for the one who knows how to talk the talk but not walk the walk , the end result will be disappointing and empty .
Whereas if you know how to refocus , how to re-read and put the emphasis in a different direction , those very same letters that make up the word sheker also form the word kesher , meaning " connection . "
When we meet someone , we determine , based on the qualities we value and where we place our emphasis , whether we have a chance at a true bond , a real and meaningful connection , or if it will remain purely superficial and thereby false .
So too , for vanity , hevel , which is how the verse describes beauty .
When one judges a book by its cover and never takes the time to even browse what is within , the whole basis of the relationship is in vain .
Whereas again , with some refocusing and willingness to recognize and search for the most important qualities for a sustaining and lasting relationship , you might just be able to take the letters that form hevel and form the word halev , the heart .
After all , more important than the face and youthful looks that will diminish with time , is the heart , which should only grow and expand .
Finding your soulmate is not an easy matter .
Not for us , and not even for our Creator .
The Talmud relates that it is harder for G‑d to make match a man and a woman than it is for Him to split the sea .
For after all , bringing opposing and different characteristics together is always more difficult than breaking them apart .
But think how much harder we make the job when we do n't even let ourselves look for the right things or in the right places !
Bringing opposing and different characteristics together is more difficult than breaking them apartSo back to this website that I had the unfortunate experience of wasting three minutes of my life on ...
More specifically , to all those " fatties " that recently got kicked off because they no longer meet the site 's requirements …
Whether or not they realize it , this was a blessing , and not even one in disguise .
Maybe , just maybe , by being judged so harshly for their appearance , they will come to learn that looks really are n't everything .
And maybe they will even start seeing themselves for who they really are and who they truly can be .
Funny enough , it could just be their misguided vanity and falsehood that will now lead them to a new focus , one which will be based on a true connection of the heart and mind , and not just a pretty face !
The sun-wizened Tuareg women of Azalik have declared war on China .
Like their ancestors , they once eked out a living selling dried salts from an ancestral well .
Everything changed last year , when the government leased their land to the China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation ( Sino - U ) for uranium exploration .
Left with no livelihood and no compensation , a hundred women gathered to launch stones at mining machinery .
“ Now it is eternal war , ” says Tinatina Salah , their 50 - year - old leader , who still seeks compensation for the loss of her salt .
Her land contains one of the world 's largest uranium deposits , and Niger was the world 's sixth - largest uranium producer in 2008 .
As resource - hungry China expands its holdings here , local groups and Tuareg - led political opposition are voicing concerns over Chinese investment in the Saharan state ’s graft - ridden mining industry .
Nigerien authorities led by President Mamadou Tandja , deposed last month in a military coup , awarded a fresh round of exploration and operating permits to foreign companies starting in 2007 , for uranium , gold , silver , and oil in the desert of northern Niger .
Despite billions of dollars pouring into the country , however , Tuareg rebels accuse Mr. Tandja ’s administration and mining companies of neglecting development in the north , which is a Tuareg stronghold .
The largely Tuareg rebel organization Movement of Nigeriens for Justice ( MNJ ) , which fought Niger troops and sabotaged Chinese mining operations up until last year , wants local people to have greater control over resources .
All that is harmful about Chinese investment
An economic boom is fueling China 's fresh push for mining contracts in Africa .
But Chinese state - owned companies ’ efforts in Africa have been marred by strikes , substandard conditions , and , in some cases , fighting with locals .
Tuaregs are particularly irked with Chinese investments in uranium and oil .
To Tuaregs , the $ 300 million SOMINA uranium mine at the desert outpost of Azalik , due to begin producing later this year , has come to represent all that is harmful about Chinese investment in Niger .
Last month Nigerien workers – many of whom are Tuareg – denounced in a written statement conditions at SOMINA , claiming it resembled “ a Chinese colony . "
Nigerien laborers sleep in dorms , separately from Chinese workers .
The rooms are located in illegal proximity to open pit uranium mines , and the Nigeriens suffer chronic diarrhea on account of an unsanitary water supply , the document charged .
Trouble at the mine has led Azalik to be referred to throughout northern Niger as “ Guantanamo . ”
Despite poor conditions , the mine offers a coveted chance to work .
But further frustrating locals , SOMINA employs hundreds of Chinese nationals and recruits ethnically Hausa workers from the south despite widespread poverty and unemployment among the local Tuaregs .
“ [ Sino - U ] brings in a lot of Chinese to do jobs that Nigeriens could easily do or be trained to do , ” said one mining official who is prospecting land adjacent to Azalik .
He requested anonymity .
The office of Souleymane Mamadou Abba , minister of mines and energy , declined an interview request .
Few jobs for locals , and low wages
What work is available for Tuaregs is hazardous and poorly paid , according to Ali Idrissa , president of the coalition of nongovernmental groups ROTAB , which recently completed a study on mining conditions in the north .
Hard , manual labor like digging holes and transporting bricks under the glaring sun is reserved for Nigerien workers , while bureaucratic and engineering jobs are given to Chinese workers .
A Nigerien engineer ’s salary at the Chinese - run mine at Azalik is about $ 350 a month , compared with $ 2,000 a month at France ’s Areva .
Chinese companies are " exploiting " the local Tuareg population in areas like Azelik , according to Mr. Idrissa .
" Their land is expropriated and given to the Chinese in order to mine riches .
And in return , [ Tuareg workers ' ] jobs do n't even provide the minimum they need to support their families , " he says .
Meanwhile , Chinese mining executives refuse invitations from local elected officials to discuss improving conditions .
" The [ Chinese ] company at Azalik does not even respect the region 's local elected officials , " Idrissa says .
" They wo n't even receive them . "
“ They say they do n’t have to answer to us because they have direct communication with the central government , ” adds Mohamed Mamane Illo , a former Tuareg rebel and elected councilor of Ingall .
In addition to those at the uranium mine at Azalik , complaints are piling up against a $ 5 billion deal struck last year by state - owned China National Petroleum Corporation ( CNPC ) to pump oil from the Agadem block in exchange for building the country its first oil refinery at Zinder .
CNPC paid a $ 272 million signing bonus to the administration of Tandja , who had appointed his own son Ousmane as commercial attaché to the Nigerien Embassy in Hong Kong , a move NGOs say helped Chinese companies curry favor with the African ex-president .
Alarming figures from the Ministry of Education : 96.7 % of young people have witnessed scenes of violence or clashes within the institutions .
One main reason found in the deterioration of moral education in families , in education system , in consumerism and materialistic lifestyle of adults .
Ho Chi Minh City ( AsiaNews ) - 96.7 % of Vietnamese students have witnessed scenes of violence or violent epsiodes in schools .
And they say that violence is " normal . "
The figure was provided by the Ministry for Education and Training , to demonstrate that violence is on the rise within schools .
A report by the Department of Education in Ho Chi Minh City , for its part , says that since 2003 more than 8,000 students from high schools in the city to have been involved in violence .
According to Huynh Cong Minh , director of the Department , " the clashes between young people are not new , but the phenomenon is growing and becoming serious and dangerous .
Students use knives and sharp objects .
This is really dangerous to the life and safety of children ” .
According to one study , the reasons behind the violence are extremely simple : hatred , revenge , dissatisfaction , unjust behaviour .
Some educators argue that one of the reasons must be sought in the deterioration of moral education in families , in the education system , consumerism and the materialistic lifestyle of adults today .
Many school presidents , moreover work for their own interests rather than those of the young people .
They only teach facts and figures and fail to teach students how to think , behave or interact with each other or society at large .
Even worse , " adults " and parents are not interested in the moral education of their children .
Students are victims of social mechanisms .
They have poor morals .
Now , the Deputy Minister for Education , Tran Quang Do , has signed a document on the prevention of illegal situations and violence in schools .
The Ministry is asking schools to continually improve moral education , to ensure a better lifestyle for students , working in relationship with local authorities , civil society and families in managing and educating the young people .
But all these requests remain on paper .
Inspired by Berin Kinsman ’s post “ Why Savage Worlds is Heir to 3rd Edition ” I am thinking about running an Eberron Campaign using Savage World rules .
Some of you are probably asking why someone should do this : “ If you already own all the Eberron books , why do n’t I just use the D&D 3.5 rules the campaign setting was written for ? ”
The 4E advocates will probably recommend getting the updated campaign for Wizard ’s latest version of D&D .
Savage Worlds is a rules - light game that is fairly easy to learn and to master and combat is fast , furious and fun ( as advertised ) .
One of the reasons why am not entirely happy with D&D 4th Edition is the fact that combat takes ages and that the powers make it necessary that every player has at least a copy of the appropriate PHB or power cards for his class .
When playing Savage Worlds it ’s enough when the GM has one copy of the rulebook .
Ok , but we still have to convert the whole campaign to Savage Worlds to make this work ?
Yes and no .
Especially the magic system of SW is much different from the one you know from D&D.
Converting the Vancian system from D&D 3.5 to SW would be an extremely difficult task and if you ask me , it ’s not worth it .
Just create characters using normal SW rules and choose Arcane Backrounds accordingly .
A wizard or sorcerer for example should use Arcane Background ( Magic ) while Clerics and Paladins should take Arcane Background ( Miracles ) .
In my opinion Artificers could either be handled like mages or you could focus on the item creation aspect by taking the Arcane Background ( Mad Science ) .
SW has a lot of powers that could be easily used to emulate D&D spells and spell - like abilities .
Of course you will probably have much less spells than in D&D , but most powers are much more versatile .
And if the GM allows it , the players can even break with some classic D&D tropes like allowing arcane spellcasters using healing magic .
Your imagination and GM discretion are the only limits here .
Savage Worlds knows no classes , so you do n’t have to convert anything there .
Just create the character the way you think feels right .
The power of SW is that the player is free to create any character he wants without it fitting in the common clichés .
Of course there are some things that should be considered .
At first there are the races .
You need to come up with appropriate stats and edges for the player races .
And although the SW rulebook includes a couple of monsters , the GM will have to create a couple of monsters for his Savage Eberron campaign .
But creating monsters and NPCs for Savage Worlds is much , much easier than in D&D 3.5 , so that ’s only a small hurdle .
One problem may arise , though .
One major part of D&D are magic items , something that ’s a bit foreign to SW .
I may be mistaken , but the SW system was not meant for High Fantasy campaigns .
So handing out D&D - like treasure and magic items may become a problem .
The good news is that you do n’t really need magic items in SW since the game places the focus on the characters and not their equipment .
I believe especially the CSI : Sharn campaign I wrote some time ago would benefit from SW rules .
What do you think ?
Is using SW for D&D campaign a viable alternative ?
Russia threatened to suspend all child adoptions by U.S. families Friday after a seven - year - old boy adopted by a woman from Tennessee was sent alone on a one - way flight back to Moscow with a note saying he was violent and had severe psychological problems .
The boy , Artyom Savelyev , was put on a plane by his adoptive grandmother , Nancy Hansen of Shelbyville .
Artyom Savelyev , 7 , is accompanied by Russian authorities after his adoptive U.S. mother sent him back to Moscow on a one - way flight .
( ( Daily Mail ) )
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called Hansen 's actions " the last straw " in a string of U.S. adoptions gone wrong , including three in which Russian children had died in the U.S .
The cases have prompted outrage in Russia , where foreign adoption failures are reported prominently .
Russia 's main TV networks ran extensive reports on the latest incident in their main evening news shows .
The Russian Education Ministry immediately suspended the licence of the group involved in the adoption — the World Association for Children and Parents , a Renton , Wash . - based agency — for the duration of the investigation .
In Tennessee , authorities were investigating the adoptive mother , Torry Hansen , 33 .
I am sorry to say that ... I no longer wish to parent this child .
The Russian government office in charge of children 's rights says Artyom was carrying a letter from Torry Hansen .
According to a copy of the letter published in Britain 's Daily Mail , Hansen said she adopted Artyom in September but was lied to by workers at the Russian orphanage from where he came .
" This child is mentally unstable , " the letter reads .
" He is violent and has severe psychopathic issues .
" After giving my best to this child , I am sorry to say that for the safety of my family , friends and myself , I no longer wish to parent this child . "
Nancy Hansen said Friday the family had paid a man $ 200 to pick the boy up at the airport in Moscow and take him to the Russian Education and Science Ministry .
She said it was n't child abandonment because a stewardess was watching Artyom on the flight and a reputable person picked him up in Russia .
The U.S. ambassador to Russia , John Beyrle , said he was " deeply shocked by the news " and " very angry that any family would act so callously toward a child that they had legally adopted . "
' Last straw '
In the past , Russia has tried to get the U.S. to sign an accord outlining conditions for international adoptions and the obligations of host families , but to date , the U.S. has refused .
" The recent event was the last straw , " Lavrov said .
" We have taken the decision ... to suggest a freeze on any adoptions to American families until Russia and the U.S.A. sign an international agreement . "
The boy was taken to hospital in northern Moscow for a checkup , Anna Orlova , spokeswoman for Children Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov , told The Associated Press .
Orlova , who visited Artyom on Friday , said the child reported that his mother was " bad , " used to pull his hair and " did not love him . "
Nancy Hansen said the child was violent and angry with his adoptive mother in the U.S .
The discovery over a decade ago that snippets of RNA can be used as gene silencers in worms garnered a Nobel prize in 2006 .
Now , for the first time , RNA interference ( RNAi ) has been proven effective against a human disease – a common respiratory virus .
Under RNAi , short strands of RNA are added to cells to destroy any native RNA molecules with a complementary sequence of letters .
Since genes use RNA molecules to make proteins , these snippets effectively “ silence ” genes that carry the same sequence .
In animals , RNAi has shown promise , but progress in people has been slow .
John DeVincenzo studies paediatric infectious disease at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis .
He and his colleagues tested the ability of short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) to inhibit viruses of the respiratory tract , where cells are exceptionally willing to take up RNA snippets .
Eighty - five healthy adults were given a nasal spray containing either a placebo or siRNA designed to silence one of the genes of respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , which is the leading cause of infant hospitalisation in the US but fairly harmless in healthy adults .

Delivery issue
They were to use the spray daily for five days .
On day two , all the volunteers were infected with live RSV .
By day 11 , just 44 per cent of those who received the RNAi nasal spray had RSV infections , compared with 71 per cent of the placebo group .
RNAi can trigger an immune response , which might have helped keep infections at bay .
But blood samples showed that the risk of RSV infection did not depend on levels of immune molecules , suggesting that RNAi ’s protective effect was due to the silencing of genes .
The team is now testing the therapy in lung - transplant patients , who take immunity - suppressing drugs that can make RSV infections deadly .
DeVincenzo also hopes to test the therapy in infants soon .
For non-respiratory diseases , however , new ways of getting RNA into the target cells are still needed .
“ Delivery has always been the big issue for RNAi , ” says John Rossi , a molecular geneticist at City of Hope medical centre in Duarte , California , who is testing RNAi ’s potential to fight HIV .

A team of archaeologists have unearthed five chamber tombs at Ayia Sotira , a cemetery in the Nemea Valley in Greece , just a few hours walk from the ancient city of Mycenae .
The tombs date from 1350 – 1200 BC , the era in which Mycenae thrived as a major centre of Greek civilization .
They contain the remains of 21 individuals who probably came from Tsoungiza , an agricultural settlement close to the ancient city .
Despite the significant human remains , however , the team have found no evidence of elite burials , prompting speculation that Tsoungiza may have been an egalitarian society without leaders .
The team excavated the five tombs between 2006 and 2008 , containing the skeletal remains of 21 individuals , including what appears to be an extended family made up of two men , one woman and two young children .
Detailed analysis of the remains will be difficult to carry out as they are generally poorly preserved .
The team have been advised by scientists that DNA analysis will not be possible , but it is hoped that analysis will reveal further information about the diet of the individuals .
The team also discovered pieces of obsidian and flint debris in the tombs , and believe that these tools would have been used to cut up bodies as part of ‘ secondary burial ’ procedures - a funerary practice that was not uncommon in the ancient world .
Professor Angus Smith , of Brock University in Canada , is one of the directors of the excavation project .
He explained :
“ You bury somebody , then you wait for that person to decompose , then you go back into the tomb or grave and you collect the bones after all the flesh has decomposed ” .
Professor Smith suggested that there were practical reasons to bury bodies in this way , in that the bodies would take up less space .
But there may also have been ritualistic reasons .
In Tomb 4 the team found a small pit that contained the secondary burials of two adult men .
Both of their skulls were “ displayed at a higher level than the rest of the skeleton , ” said Professor Smith , suggesting that the men were “ carefully placed in this pit ” .
The team were surprised to find a lack of burial goods in the tombs .
The Mycenaean civilization is known for its rich elite burials , but the goods found at Ayia Sotira were modest .
They included alabaster pots , bowls , jugs , faïence and glass beads , and a female Psi figurine ( one of three styles typical of Mycenae ) .
After water - sieving the remains , they also found stone micro beads that were no bigger than a millimetre in size .
One tomb contained 462 of these beads stowed in a side - chamber , and are thought to be the remains of a necklace .
There were no findings of the gold or silver artefacts expected in an elite burial , although they did find fragments of a conical rhyton – a two - hole vessel that can be used for libation rituals and is often associated with elite burials .
Professor Smith described the tomb complex as having a “ distinctly different character to those around Mycenae .
The wealthy and very wealthy tombs are missing ” .
One explanation could be that the elite tombs were looted , either in ancient times or more recently .
When the team arrived at Ayia Sotira , they found ' probe holes ' that had been dug into the ground by looters searching for airways .
Another possibility is that the elite tombs at Ayia Sotira just have n’t been discovered yet .
A third possibility is that these people lived in a classless society – that despite being close to a rich city , the people of this settlement , for whatever reason , had no elites .
“ It does seem to be a community of agriculturalists who do n’t seem to have a clear leader or clear elite mixed in amongst them , ” said Professor Smith .
“ Were they governed by the palace at Mycenae which sort of oversaw them ?
Or were they removed enough that they had their own system of politics and government but one that did n’t produce clear elites ? ”

Secondly , she fuses both Tea -Party anti-government sentiment with neocon conviction about the necessity for American empire .
Of course , none of this makes any sense , but Palin , unlike some of her rivals who feel some kind of lingering need to relate their policies to fiscal and global reality , is a thoroughly post - modern creature .
She creates her own reality , and that is an incredibly important talent for a party base that desperately wants to live in another reality ( a kind of souped - up version of 1950s culture and late nineteenth century economy ) .
Her book - a fictional account of an imagined life - sold well with the GOP base because they too want a fictional account of America 's current standing in the world and an imagined set of viable policy positions .
She so lives and breathes this magical - realist culture she does n't need to channel it .
She knows we can keep social security and Medicare and global power for ever and balance the budget without any taxes - because that is what she wants to know .
And she has never let reality get in her way .
Reality is one of those doors she keeps crashing through .
Thirdly , she has a child with Down Syndrome .
If you see Trig as a political tool , the near - appalling exposure of him in the campaign and book tour is not so bizarre .
For a pro-life base that suspects that all Republican leaders , including even Bush , are phonies on the life issue , Palin has , in their eyes , walked the pro-life walk .
Since this issue motivates the base in deeply powerful ways , Palin 's ace has always been her youngest son .
He proves her political authenticity - or at least seems to .
Who else puts all this together for the GOP ?
No one .
Huckabee is crippled by a record of spending and leniency .
Romney is crippled by being Mitt Romney and Mormonism .
Pawlenty : seriously ?
Santorum ?
Ditto .
Brown ?
We are beginning to see the depth of his predicament .
DeMint ? Rubio ?
C'mon .
Yes , many tea-partiers do not think Palin is " qualified " to be president .
But primaries are won by enthusiasm and star power .
Palin has both .
And she has money .
And , most important , she has a media machine dedicated to promoting her outside of any real scrutiny or questions .
She has never faced a real press conference and speaks to " pre-screened " questioners at debates and speeches .
She is a test - case of how willfully divorced from reality a segment of America can remain , and how irrelevant reality is for today 's niche - targeted media .
All of this makes Palin the most potent force in American politics since Obama .
Acknowledging that requires a grasp of the depth of the crisis on the right .
I think David still under-estimates how deep that crisis is .
I think he still thinks the current Republican party is salvageable as a credible governing force .
I do n't .

Kris Meeke has pulled away from his rivals on the second loop of stages in the Rally Islas Canarias .
The reigning Intercontinental Rally Challenge champion left service with only a three - second gap back to the chasing Skodas of Jan Kopecky and Juho Hanninen .
But three straight stage wins for Peugeot UK driver Meeke , who was revelling in the car 's handling after lunchtime set - up changes , mean he completed the loop 14s clear of Kopecky and 21s ahead of Hanninen - having pulled out 8s on SS5 alone .
Guy Wilks has been frustrated by his inability to keep up with the leaders on this rally .
Unhappy with his Skoda UK Fabia 's handling , he is now 41s behind Meeke and gradually being caught by Peugeot Portugal 's Bruno Magalhaes , who has shown good pace since his transmission was changed at service and swiftly reclaimed fifth from Alberto Hevia .
Further back , new Kronos Peugeot signing Thierry Neuville has passed Spanish champion Sergio Vallejo for seventh .
Pos Driver Car Time / Gap 1 . Kris Meeke Peugeot 56m16.2s 2 . Jan Kopecky Skoda + 14.5s 3 . Juho Hanninen Skoda + 21.9s 4 . Guy Wilks Skoda + 41.2s 5 . Bruno Magalhaes Peugeot + 52.5s 6 . Alberto Hevia Skoda + 1m00.9s 7 . Theirry Neuville Peugeot + 1m13.9s 8 . Sergio Vallejo Ford + 1m20.0s 9 . Franz Wittmann Peugeot + 1m38.2s 10 . Jose Suarez Mitsubishi + 4m19.5s
David Cameron came under fire today after he claimed he knew nothing about a controversial Tory youth group which has trained some of the party 's parliamentary candidates , despite its leaders describing the NHS as " the biggest waste of money in the UK " and suggesting that waterboarding of prisoners can be justified .
In an interview in Time Out magazine , Cameron denied all knowledge of the Young Britons ' Foundation , which has been called " the Conservative madrasa " .
Conservative HQ promotes YBF - run training courses for young Tory activists .
Several members of Cameron 's team , including shadow defence secretary Liam Fox , addressed a YBF rally last month and at least 11 prospective Tory candidates have been delegates or speakers at training conferences run by the YBF .
The group 's leader , Donal Blaney , has taken Conservative activists on training courses in the US which include sessions shooting semi-automatic weapons and machine guns .
Asked if it was true that prospective candidates had been trained by the YBF , Cameron said : " No , I do n't think so .
I do n't know anything about the Young Britons ' Foundation . "
When told the YBF claims on its website that it trains
Tory members at official party conferences , Cameron said : " I 've no idea about this . "
The party 's link to the YBF was front page news last month and tonight Labour said Cameron 's denial was " unbelievable " and called for him to " come clean " about his party 's involvement with the YBF .
Labour MP Jon Cruddas said : " It is absolutely unbelievable that David Cameron does n't know about an organisation that is training up candidates on behalf of the party – not least because its events have included contributions from party chairman Eric Pickles , shadow defence secretary Liam Fox , and other members of his frontbench team .
Cameron should come clean on the role this shadowy organisation has at all levels of the party . "
A spokesman for Cameron declined to answer questions about his depth of knowledge of the organisation , but confirmed it has " been involved with some Tory candidates " .
He added : " The YBF is independent of the party .
We do not endorse their views . "
Im Sommer wollen die Bundesländer über eine Reform der Rundfunkgebühren beraten .
Die Sozialdemokraten bringen sich dafür schon einmal mit einem Eckpunktepapier in Stellung , in dem sie die schrittweise Abkehr von der gerätebezogenen Rundfunkgebühr fordern .
Der rheinland - pfälzische Ministerpräsident Kurt Beck , immer noch ein Schwergewicht in der SPD , geht einem Bericht zufolge noch weiter :
Er will die öffentlich - rechtlichen Sender werbefrei machen – und die Gebühren anheben .
" Der öffentlich - rechtliche Rundfunk ist auch im Zeitalter von Digitalisierung und Konvergenz ein unverzichtbares Element in einem Mediensystem , das den demokratischen , sozialen und kulturellen Bedürfnissen einer modernen Gesellschaft entsprechen soll " , erklärte der Vorsitzende der medienpolitische Sprecher der SPD , Marc Jan Eumann , laut einer Mitteilung .
Der Gesetzgeber müsse also weiterhin " für eine zukunftsorientierte und ausreichende Gebührenausstattung " der Sender sorgen .
Die Ausdehnung der Medien ins Internet erfordert nach Ansicht der SPD - Medienexperten " entsprechende Anpassungen " , da " die ausschließlich gerätebezogene Rundfunkgebühr den Anforderungen an eine moderne Kommunikationsgesellschaft nicht mehr gerecht " werde .
Immer mehr Geräte seien zwar technisch in der Lage , Fernsehen und Radio zu empfangen , dafür aber primär nicht vorgesehen .
Deshalb plädiere die SPD für eine " behutsame Abkehr der Rundfunkgebührenpflicht von der Geräteabhängigkeit " .
Die SPD sagt dabei nicht , wie so eine neue Gebührenordnung konkret aussehen könnte , markiert aber ein paar " Eckpunkte " .
So müssten europarechtliche Fallstricke beachtet werden .
Eine reine Haushaltsabgabe etwa könne die EU - Kommission dazu veranlassen , die Rundunkfinanzierung erneut zu überprüfen .
Das könne " weitreichende Folgen für die deutsche Medienordnung nach sich ziehen " .
Das neue Finanzierungsmodell muss nach SPD - Vorstellungen zudem auf eine " breite gesellschaftliche und politische Akzeptanz " treffen , um langwierige Diskussionen zu vermeiden und die Gebührenfinanzierung langfristig zu sichern .
Das neue System solle den unabhängig ermittelten Finanzbedarf der Sender decken , diese müssten aber weiter an ihrer Wirtschaftlichkeit arbeiten .
Zudem will die SPD den " Kontrollbedarf " reduzieren .
Kurt Beck , als rheinland - pfälzischer Ministerpräsident derzeit Vorsitzender der Rundfunkkommission der Länder , will einem Bericht des Branchenmagazins Kontakter vom Montag zufolge das öffentlich - rechtliche Fernsehen " nach und nach werbefrei machen " .
In der Kommission herrsche Konsens darüber , dass Sponsoring nach 20 Uhr und an Sonn - und Feiertagen ab 2013 aus dem öffentlich - rechtlichen Fernsehen verbannt wird – ausgenommen sollen Sportübertragungen sein .
Danach könnte die Werbung laut Beck in zwei Stufen komplett aus ARD und ZDF verschwinden : Eine Halbierung der Werbezeiten 2015 , zwei Jahre später dann die komplette Abschaffung der Werbung .
Im Gegenzug plädiert Beck für eine Erhöhung der Gebühren .
Dabei dürfe laut Kontakter die kritische Grenze von 20 Euro pro Monat aber nicht überschritten werden .

The Obama administration said Saturday that it would delay a decision on whether to declare China a currency manipulator , but it vowed to press Chinese leaders on the politically charged issue of its currency valuation during a series of meetings through June .
The Treasury ’s action seemed intended to send a reassuring message both to China and to Congress .
It signaled to China that the administration prefers to resolve the dispute diplomatically , rather than force a showdown , but also pressed the case for a change in China ’s policy , a position advocated by many United States lawmakers in both parties .
“ China ’s inflexible exchange rate has made it difficult for other emerging market economies to let their currencies appreciate , ” Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in a statement .
“ A move by China to a more market - oriented exchange rate will make an essential contribution to global rebalancing . ”
In his statement , Mr. Geithner said he had decided to delay the semiannual exchange rate report to Congress , which was to be due on April 15 and which many members of Congress had hoped would officially cite China as a currency manipulator .
The game of the week in South America last week was the first leg of the Sao Paulo State Championship between Sao Paulo and Santos .
The first 4 months of the year in Brazil are devoted to the more than 20 different State Championships .
The poor quality of play in most of these State leagues would surprise football fans brought up on the myths of Brazilian brilliance .
The standard of play generally is no better than can be found in the lower Scottish divisions , with many of the bigger clubs not taking them seriously in favour of concentrating on the Copa Libertadores and Copa Brazil tournaments .
The biggest best and most organised of these State leagues is the Sao Paulo State Championship but even this League does not have quality strength in depth .
Readers of the GGW “ The Fat Boy Done Good ” post of June 2009 will remember that Corinthians won the 2009 version due mainly to the goals of Ronaldo .
This time , Corinthians , the best supported club in Sao Paulo , did not bother to make a serious attempt to retain their State crown , preferring instead to concentrate on their Group games in the Copa Libertadores , the South American equivalent of the European Champions League .
Corinthians have never won the Libertadores and are desperate to do so in 2010 their Centenary year .
Palmeiras , another of the Sao Paulo Gang of Four , and the only top Brazilian club to play in green and white , did try to win the State League .
However still demoralised by the shocking collapse in December that cost them the 2009 Brazilian Championship , they stuttered through mediocre form and failed to qualify for the 4 semi-final places .
It was left to Sao Paulo and Santos to uphold the honour of the traditional Big Four .
Santos finished top of the initial League stage which they dominated with brilliant attacking football to gain second leg home advantage against the 4th place team , Sao Paulo .
The other semi-final was due to take place at the same between 2nd placed Gremio SP ( not to b e confused with the more famous Gremio Porto Alegre from Rio Grande State ) and 3rd placed Santo Andre a club relegated from the Brazilian Championship in 2009 .
Sao Paulo and Santos are not just two of the biggest clubs in Sao Paulo , or even Brazil but in the whole world .
Both of them have been World Club champions on more than one occasion .
Santos reigned supreme in the early 1960 ’s under the influence of the world ’s best ever player Pele .
In 1962 they won the Copa Libertadores then beat Benfica to establish themselves as the best team in the world .
They retained the Libertadores in 1963 and went on to beat AC Milan for the World crown .
As well as Pele , that team of the early 1960s had world class players like Carlos Alberto Torres ( the full back who scored that unforgettable 4th goal in the 1970 World Cup Final ) Gilmar , Zito , Mauro , Countinho , Pepe and Edu .
The club , from the busy port of Santos 50 miles down the coast from Sao Paulo city , went into a long downward spiral after Pele moved on but revived in the new Century .
They won the 2002 and 2004 Brazilian championships and in between reached the final of the Libertadores in 2003 only to lose to a strong Boca Juniors .
That team had young stars like Robinho , Diego , Elano and Renato who all have gone on to star in the top leagues of Europe .
Santos won the Sao Paulo State League in 2006 and 2007 but in the last few years have failed to perform well in the Brazilian League , falling well below the Libertadores spots in 2009 .
Sao Paulo have 3 times been Copa Libertadores champions , each time going on to win the World Club Cup .
In 1992 and 1993 under clever coach Tele Santana they established themselves as the best team in the world beating Barcelona in the 1992 Final and AC Milan in the 1993 game .
In 2005 they won the first World Club Cup involving the 6 Confederation Champions beating Liverpool in the Final .
Sao Paulo have been the best organised and most successful Brazilian club of the past few years .
In 2006 , 2007 and 2008 they won three successive Brazilian Championships but failed in each subsequent attempt at the Copa Libertadores despite being among the strong favourites every year .
Last year , when Palmeiras collapsed just before the finishing line of the Brazilian Championship after looking certain winners for months it looked as if Sao Paulo would collect a 4th consecutive title until their own astonishing stutter in the final few days allowed a slightly bemused Flamengo to take the title .
However the sensible Sao Paulo Directors kept faith with coach Ricardo Gomes , who has extensive managerial experience in France most recently with Bordeaux and Monaco .
They also invested in bringing three players back from Europe .
Two former Sao Paulo heroes attacking full back Cicinho , back from Roma and Alex Silva a classy defender rescued from a poor experience in Hamburg , . and an old Santos favourite Cleber Santana a skilful midfielder who never quite settled at Atletico Madrid .
They joined existing stars like World Cup winning goalkeeper Rogerio Ceni , who has scored , yes scored , over 80 goals mostly from penalties and freekicks , commanding centre back Miranda and constructive midfield star Hernanes .
These latter two will almost certainly move to European clubs in the summer .
They would be brilliant assets for Celtic but alas not under current economic circumstances .
The main story of the year in Brazil though has been the sensational repatriation of Robinho back to his old club Santos .
It is still unclear how they have managed to find the money to pay Robinho ’s inflated Manchester City wages ( or indeed even if they have , but that is another story , which may emerge later ) .
Whatever the financial arrangements involved , there is no doubt the move back to his old club Santos has transformed Robinho rapidly from an unhappy , grouchy and ineffective player , back into the world superstar that convinced both Chelsea and Manchester City to offer more than £ 40 million for him .
Playing with a smile on his face he has led Santos to a series of victories with exciting attacking football producing many goals .
He has been assisted in these endeavours by Santos ’s trio of outstanding young talents Neymar , Paulo Henrique Ganso and Andre .
If you have never heard their names before make a note of them because they are likely to be the new Robinhos and Diegos of the next few years ( if not the new Peles , as every young Santos player gets cripplingly labelled ) .
Neymar is only 18 years old but has been tipped for several years as a future superstar and there is a campaign under way aided by Pele and Zico to persuade National coach Dunga to take him to the World Cup , as Brazil did with a young Pele in 1958 and a young Ronaldo in 1994 .
Santos coach Dorival Junior has encouraged a positive approach fielding five attacking players most games with Robinho and Andre up front supported by Neymar , Paulo Henrique Ganso and Marquinhos , and only one defensive midfielder , Arouca bought in on loan from Sao Paulo .
The defence has an excellent goalkeeper Fabio Coosta and two players with extensive European experience in Edu Dracena and Leo .
So the first leg of what everyone in Sao Paulo has assumed is the true final , took place on Sunday in Sao Paulo ’s stadium , the Morumbi .
Santos stayed true to Dorival ’s attacking principles with the gang of five all selected .
He was rewarded by a sparkling first half performance which saw Santos score two goals and Sao Paulo have a player sent off .
However Ricardo Gomes drew on all his experience at half time , brought on Cicinho as an attacking full - back , and pushed Jean up to reinforce the midfield , sacrificing a forward but not attacking determination .
His reorganised team took the game to a stunned Santos in the second half .
Within 20 minutes of the second half the revived 10 men had brought the game back to 2 - 2 parity and encouraged by the partisan Morumbi crowd , pressed on for outright victory .
However the miracle never quite happened and in the last minute of the game Santos centre back Durval thundered home a dramatic header to clinch a 3 - 2 away victory .
The GGW man of the match was Hernanes , magnificent in defense , superb going forward , he scored a great goal and generally controlled the game .
He showed more commitment , determination , aggression and skill than the whole Celtic team had against Ross County .
He probably added another £ 5 m to the £ 20 m needed to buy him .
But on this kind of display Real Madrid and AC Milan his most ardent suitors will do well to find the money for him .
After the game both managers acknowledged that the tie was not yet settled .
However with the away goal rule in force in next Sunday ’s second leg at the Vila Belmiro stadium , the odds must favour the home side Santos .
Robinho who had a good game rattling the crossbar and playing positively without scoring , expressed the view after the game that Santos should remain true to their attacking style in the second leg rather than playing defensively to hold their advantage .
He admitted Santos has relaxed too soon in the Morumbi but remained upbeat about the chances of securing his first Sao Paulo State League title .
Santos proved on Wednesday their morale had not been damaged by the second half slump , when on the day of the club ’s 98th birthday they thumped state neighbours Guarani 8 - 1 in the first leg of their Copa Brazil tie. , with Nilmar scoring 5 and Robinho 2 of the goals .
The current Santos team are a unique team in the world top class game , with 3 fast skilful attackers , 2 attacking midfielders and a right back who is really a winger .
In 2010 they have scored an amazing 88 goals in only 25 games ( that this is nowhere near a Santos record is due to the young Pele who 3 times helped Santos exceeded this average ) .
There is a breath - taking excitement about their game , a sparkling naivety .
However there is the nagging thought that they can play like this and succeed against the poor quality of the Sao Paulo State league but one wonders what the top European coaches like Benitez , Mourinho , Ancelotti and Wenger would do with the spaces they leave .
It only took wily Ricardo Gomes 45 minutes to suss them out and reverse things .
Still all power to them for their bravery and flair and let us hope they succeed at least at State level to prove that attacking football can succeed .
In the other semi-final Santo Andre won 2 - 1 away to Gremio SP so should be the likely opponents cum whipping boys in the Final .
Next week GGW will report on the second leg of the semi-finals and also on the Finals of the Rio de Janeiro , Rio Grande and Minas Gerais Leagues

Chronic kidney disease causes the organs to function less effectively
The identification of 20 genes which could help explain the causes of kidney disease could one day " revolutionise " treatment , researchers say .
Chronic kidney disease affects about one in 10 adults and can require dialysis or even an organ transplant .
The genes identified by the international team of researchers control kidney functions such as filtering waste from the blood .
Experts said the Nature Genetics study was " a great breakthrough " .
Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) is a long - term condition in which the kidneys progressively lose their function .
These are still early days but it is truly a great breakthrough
Charles Kernahan , Kidney Research UK
People tend not to notice symptoms , which can include swollen ankles and hands or blood in the urine , until the condition is advanced .
It is linked to ageing - about one in five men and one in four women aged between 65 and 74 will have some degree of CKD .
The most common cause of CKD is damage caused by other long - term conditions , such as diabetes and high blood pressure .
It was known there was a genetic component to the disease , but not which genes were involved .
' First step '
In this study , an international team of scientists , including researchers at the University of Edinburgh , looked at the genes of nearly 70,000 people across Europe .
They found 13 new genes that influence renal function and seven others that affect the production and secretion of creatinine - a chemical waste molecule that is generated from muscle metabolism and filtered through the kidneys .
Dr Jim Wilson , a geneticist at the University of Edinburgh who worked on the study , said : " This work could revolutionise the treatment of kidney disease in the future - but this will take some time .
" It 's a very critical first step towards a completely new understanding of the biology behind CKD .
Transferring what we 've found into clinical benefits will take some years . "
Charles Kernahan , chief executive of the charity Kidney Research UK , said " These are still early days but it is truly a great breakthrough .
" No - one knows who will be affected or when kidney disease may strike next , so even more research needs to be funded to help us tackle this challenge . "

LOS ANGELES --
An Illinois insurance executive who secretly
shot nude videos of ESPN reporter Erin Andrews was sentenced Monday
to 2 ½ years in prison after giving a tearful apology that was
harshly rebuked by his victim .
Michael David Barrett pleaded guilty in December to interstate
stalking after prosecutors accused him of following the reporter to
at least three cities and shooting the videos through hotel
peepholes .
Barrett , 48 , of suburban Chicago , agreed to a 27 - month prison
sentence after pleading guilty but it was up to the judge to decide
how long he would actually serve .
Andrews urged the judge at the hearing for a harsher sentence
and said she fears for her life every time she enters a hotel .
" You violated me and you violated all women , " Andrews told
Barrett .
" You are a sexual predator , a sexual deviant and they
should lock you up . "
After the sentencing , she said , " Thirty months is n't enough . "
Barrett admitted renting hotel rooms next to Andrews three times
and shooting two videos of her while she was naked .
He was accused
of posting the videos online and trying to sell them to Los
Angeles - based celebrity gossip site TMZ last year .
U.S. District Judge Manuel Real said he gave Barrett the maximum
sentence under the law .
" The victim , Andrews , will be suffering with this problem for
the rest of her life , " Real said .
" There is no life sentence that
can be imposed upon him , except his own guilt . "
Barrett cried as he addressed Andrews in court , saying he would
spend the rest of his life regaining the respect of his friends and
family and atoning for his mistakes .
" There are no words to tell Ms. Andrews how sorry I am for what
I 've done to her , " he said .
" I hope someday she can forgive me . "
Andrews , visibly nervous as she spoke , said she had no sympathy
for Barrett 's claim he was publicly humiliated .
" It 's my body on the Internet , " she said .
" I 'm being
traumatized every single day for what he did .
...
This will never
be over for me . "
Barrett , who has until May 3 to surrender , was ordered to have
supervised probation for three years after his release , during
which he will be prohibited from contacting Andrews , her family or
friends .
He will not be allowed to stay in a hotel without approval of a
probation officer and if he accepts employment somewhere , Andrews
will be notified .
Barrett was also ordered to pay $ 5,000 in fines
and $ 7,366 in restitution , but the judge said further restitution
may be imposed to compensate ESPN .
Barrett 's lawyer , David Willingham , said his client is
undergoing psychological treatment and " has sought the path of
redemption . "
" Mr. Barrett has lost everything he built throughout his
life , " Willingham said .
" He 's lost his career , his fiancee and
his life savings .
He knows that he brought this on himself . "
Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have agreed not to pursue
further charges against Barrett .
However , he could face criminal
action in other states stemming from other videos he allegedly shot
of unsuspecting nude women through peepholes .
Andrews ' attorney , Marshall Grossman , has said there could be as
many as a dozen other women that Barrett taped .
A sentencing memo filed last month in federal court says Barrett
uploaded videos of 16 other women to an online account .
Barrett also allegedly conducted 30 Internet background checks
that can produce birthdays and home addresses , the document said .
The filing did not name the other alleged victims or say what
information he obtained or how he may have used it .
Prosecutors claim that 32 videos provided by DailyMotion.com
show Barrett " victimized approximately 16 other women in almost
precisely the same way that he victimized " Andrews .
They did not
identify the women .
Andrews testified in December that Barrett 's actions had a
devastating impact on her and her family because she is constantly
reminded that his videos appeared online and is subjected to cruel
taunts from sports fans when she works as a sideline reporter .
Andrews has agreed to appear on the new season of ABC - TV's
" Dancing with the Stars " - an offer she said ABC made before the
stalking allegations .
She said she does n't want to seclude herself
from the public eye because other victims would get the wrong
message .
" I did nothing wrong .
Just trying to live my life , " she said .
" I had to deal with a lot of people who said I deserved it ,
that I had played to a certain audience . "
Her attorney said she will not file a lawsuit against Barrett .
A James Bond fan who was fed up with drivers cutting him up has invented the ultimate gadget to gain his revenge - a moped which fires 15 ft flames .
Colin Furze , 30 , spent a month converting the scooter .
But sadly Colin , who built the moped in his spare time in his back garden in Stamford , Lincs , will not legally be allowed to use it on the road

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) --
Ancient stories oft retold :
Blame the mythic gods for today 's political crisis , for Wall Street 's 2008 meltdown , America 's $ 23.7 trillion new debt , for Beck , Palin , the Tea party , and now for Goldman and the resurgence of Reaganomics ...
Yes , the Kraken was released , ravaging American politics .
Since time immemorial humans have seen their struggles as endless battles between the gods , Zeus and Hades , good vs. evil , the forces of Heaven battling the Underworld .
... so we blame Zeus ... or his arch - enemy Hades for releasing the Kraken , the deadly evil monster that devours good ... yes , blame the gods , yes , " the devil made me do it ! "
Backflash :
To that crucial moment , election time 2008 ... when Wall Street 's near - death experience opened the Gates of Hell , beckoning Wall Street 's too - sinful - to - save bankers ...
Hades , ruler of the Evil Underworld , counter - attacked ... first releasing his Trojan Horse , the Treasury Secretary , to save his dark legions from certain destruction ... Henry Paulson kept Hades ' warriors alive ... but Zeus feared Hades was preparing for a bigger catastrophe on earth , created a new Perseus , his son , the hero who must finally defeat Hades and his dark warriors ... for that role Zeus cast Barack Obama .
But remember , Perseus is half - human , may be no match Hades ' ultimate WMD , The Kraken .
Flash forward : Elections 2010 ... the eternal battle rages on Earth , growing louder , more violent ...
The Kraken , reborn as Goldman and the too- political - to - fail Wall Street Greed Machine was winning many battles ... concessions on derivatives and fiduciary regulations , disclosures , on the CFPA ... yes , the Kraken returned from the Darkness , more powerful , thanks to a raid on Treasury .
Wall Street has new dark forces inside Zeus ' domain ... Timothy Geithner , Lawrence Summers and the reincarnation of Reaganomics darkest hero , Ben Bernanke ...
The Kraken now commands the most lethal WMD , the propaganda machine that 's releasing inflammatory Scorched Earth talking points for Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh , Sarah Palin , Michele Bachmann , Mitch McConnell and John Boehner , Tea Partiers , militiamen and secessionists ...
Welcome to American politics , folks .
Exciting fun is n't it , our tradition of American political discourse developed over two centuries ... politics is code for getting rich off the many endless battles throughout eternity cooked up to amuse the gods of Heaven and Hell , Zeus and Hades , fought by angels and saints , sinners and demons , and us humans ... minor skirmishes on the Senate floor , on cable news , at Tea Party confrontations ... and major battles over financial reform , Goldman 's treachery .
There 's more coming as good fights evil :
The new Supreme Court nomination , abortion , gay rights , immigration , taxes , elections in 2010 and the big one in 2012 ... so blame Zeus and Hades for not getting along ... or " the devil made me do it " ... blame someone , anybody but you ... then blindly vote in a new Kraken , for both sides have one , and either one can self - destruct America ... now sit back , enjoy the popcorn , and watch the latest " Clash of the Titans . "
Release the Kraken ... and defeat Dodd 's financial reforms
Last week 's SEC suit again Goldman Sachs may slow the trend .
But the truth is , since Wall Street 's takeover of Washington by the Paulson - Bernanke - Geithner - Goldman conspiracy , we 've been predicting that even though we twice dodged the Great Depression II ( in 2000 and again in 2008 ) , Dodd 's financial reforms will be denuded by the GOP , setting America up for the third wave , the next big meltdown that will finally bankrupt Wall Street 's too - political - to - fail banks , and America .
Bankrupt America ?
Yes , that prediction comes loud and clear from Nobel Prize - winner Joseph Stiglitz , former bond trader Michael Lewis , financial historian Niall Ferguson , hedger Barton Biggs , Yale economist Robert Shiller , Hong Kong 's Marc Faber and many other ignored voices drowned out by the hundreds of millions spent by Wall Street lobbyists to kill Dodd 's reforms .
Now Simon Johnson , former IMF chief economist and co-author of " 13 Bankers : The Wall Street Takeover and the Next Financial Meltdown , " adds his voice :
Yes , another financial meltdown is coming : " And when it comes , the government will face the same choice it faced in 2008 : to bail out a banking system that has grown larger and more concentrated or let it collapse and risk an economic disaster ...
But there is another choice ... take a stand against concentrated industrial power ...
It is a choice that the American people need to make -- and sooner rather than later .
The Panic of 1907 only led to the reforms of the 1930's by way of the 1929 Crash .
We hope that a similar calamity will not be a prerequisite to action again . "
And yet , catastrophe is dead ahead .
That 's right : Even if Dodd 's financial reforms are passed with token GOP support , the reforms will be watered down .
America will not have to wait 22 years as we did after the Panic of 1907 till the Crash of 1929 .
With today 's high - tech exchanges operating at the speed of light , we have turned years into milliseconds thanks to high - frequency trading algorithms , $ 100 million profit days , risky highly - leveraged derivatives , and Wall Street 's insatiable greed demanding mega-billion bonuses .
No , not 22 years : Another crash will be triggered in 2012 , certainly within the next presidential term , and it 'll be a whopper .
Release the Kraken : Revive the 1981 -2008 Reaganomics disaster ?
Even with the Goldman suit , Wall Street 's $ 400 million lobbyist effort to kill financial reforms signals a resurgence of unregulated free market Reaganomics capitalism , the conservative ideology that killed Glass - Steagall in 1999 creating too - big - to - fail banks , setting the stage for the 2008 meltdown .
That 60 - year - old law protected Main Street by separating low - risk retail banking from high - risk investment banking gambling with high - octane derivatives .
Wall Street 's goals are simple : Water down the Dodd reforms enough so that Wall Street can continue to : ( 1 ) evade securities laws , ( 2 ) avoid taxes , ( 3 ) minimize capital requirements , ( 4 ) increase leverage , ( 5 ) hide speculative risks , ( 6 ) maximize short - term profits , ( 7 ) avoid stockholder disclosures , and ( 8 ) manipulate regulators .
Expect surface change , but little of substantive .
Why ?
Wall Street needs to continue running the same scam on taxpayers in order to get their mega - bonuses .
They have lost their moral compass , sold their soul to the devil , lack a conscience , have no interest in the public .
The truth is , Beck , Rush , Sarah , Michele , and others driving the GOP Tea Party of No are in fact a smoke screen for Wall Street and their lobbyists ' shadowy takeover of America 's government ... the new Kraken is destined to self - destruct America ... even now as it fights for the resurgence of neo-Reaganomics .
Last year we predicted this revival as a " mutant capitalism . "
We saw Wall Street 's cultural " soul - sickness , " hidden in many disguises .
To fully understand this relentless toxic threat , you must see it in the broader historical context of the Reaganomics capitalism as one manifestation of the eternal war between Zeus , Hades and their armies here on earth .
Here 's the back story :
1. Birth of Capitalism , Adam Smith 's 1776 ' Wealth of Nations '
Pure capitalism is the aggregate economic activities of greedy irrational selfish people .
" Every individual ... labors ... great as he can , " but " neither intends to promote the public interest , nor knows how much he is promoting it .
... he intends only his own gain ... led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention . "
2. Alan Greenspan , Ayn Rand , Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged
For decades Rand was Greenspan 's conservative guru : " When I say ' capitalism , ' I mean a pure , uncontrolled , unregulated laissez - faire capitalism ... the only system that can make freedom , individuality , and the pursuit of values possible in practice because capitalism demands the best of every man -- his rationality -- and rewards him accordingly ... free ... to go as far on the road of achievement as his ability and ambition will carry him . "
Rand and her disciple Greenspan demanded total , unrestricted freedom for Wall Street .
3. Milton Friedman's ' Capitalism & Freedom ' powered Reaganomics
After 1981 Reaganomics defined conservatism : Grounded in Nobel Economist Milton Friedman 's conviction that " the government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem . "
He preached pure Adam Smith capitalism , hated FDR's New Deal , hated the Keynesian economics that Obama revived with the stimulus .
Reaganomics ideology released the Kraken , gutted Glass - Steagall , created Wall Street 's too - big - to fail fat - cats , set up the 2008 meltdown , and exploded America 's massive debt problems .
4. Reaganomics capitalism must kill financial regulations
Today Wall Street 's myopic mindset lives in this unbroken 234 - year history from Adam Smith to Friedman , Rand , Greenspan , Bernanke and Reaganomics .
And today it 's coming to a head in this new " Clash of the Titans , " driven by Wall Street 's Scorched Earth obsession to kill all restrictions in Dodd 's reforms .
This is the ultimate turning point , a grand battle to the death between the new Obamanomics and the resurgence of Reaganomics .
Why ?
Wall Street knows it cannot survive without Reaganomics ' ideological freedoms .
Wall Street 's cash got Obama elected , got their Trojan Horses in his cabinet .
But they never expected Obama to turn against them , starting with suing Goldman for fraud .
Wall Street spent $ 400 million on lobbyists to release a new Kraken in this war to kill Dodd 's reforms , a war Zeus and Hades must be proud of .
This , my friends , is our mythic destiny ... at least till the gods decide to shift the balance of power again in this eternal " Clash of the New Titans . "
But rest assured , no matter who 's elected in 2010 or 2012 , who 's got power in Washington , for now , Wall Street will continue financing both sides , because volatility and gridlock , deception and propaganda , lies and confusion all favor the dark forces of Hades , yes , Wall Street 's too - greedy - to - fail fat - cats are his army .
As i stated I think it is clear that the section of a city ( Istambul ) panning up to the Hagia Sofia is part of its wonder movie .
Thus considering the similar length and content , I feel it is safe to say that the section panning around The Sphinx and The Pyramids is also their or one of their wonder movie .
While it is most likely for the Pyramids I feel it would be premature to narrow it down any further without confirmation .

A crazy game of football to watch , a difficult one to analyse .
Two open , attacking sides produced a wonderful game for the neutral , but one that will probably leave both managers absolutely fuming – Wenger because his side were awful and conceded poor goals , Guardiola because his side threw away a 0 - 2 lead .
Wenger went with his standard line - up , but with Arshavin deployed on the right , Nasri on the left – presumably because Nasri is slightly better defensively and therefore better against the Alves - Messi combination down Barcelona ’s right .
Barcelona played Keita ahead of the more defensive option of Yaya Toure , meaning they had the flexibility to switch to the 4 - 2 - 4ish shape they ’ve played in recent matches .
Indeed , the shape they played was probably a mixture between that and their more established 4 - 3 - 3 .
Ibrahimovic was the centre - forward , Messi just off him , Pedro certainly wide - right – but then Keita seemed to shuttle between a central midfield position and a left - wing position , similar to how Ramires plays for Brazil .
Keita played a more defensive role than Iniesta did against Stuttgart ( a ) as he is a naturally more defensive player and ( b ) Stuttgart fielded two central midfielders , so it was 2 v 2 in the middle , whereas Arsenal play with three , meaning Keita had to make sure Barcelona were not outnumbered in the middle .
Have you ever seen a side start a big game as well as Barcelona started tonight ’s match ?
Within the first quarter of an hour they had already forced Manuel Almunia into five saves , and had a couple more shots blocked .
How Arsenal went in 0 - 0 at half - time , it ’s difficult to understand .
The most astonishing thing about the opening exchanges was quite how intense Barcelona ’s integrated pressing was .
The fact they played with a system that effectively featured four forwards meant that Arsenal ’s defenders were all faced with a yellow shirt pressing them immediately , and the key was that Barcelona pressed as a unit , rather than as individuals .
They may be renowned for their skilful attacking play , but Barcelona defend from the front better than any other side in Europe .
The often - cited problem with pressing like this is that you ca n’t sustain it for a whole game , and perhaps this was apparent again , for Barcelona blatantly fell away towards the end of the game .
But they were certainly able to keep it up for the first half – simply because the pressing itself was so effective and won the ball so many times .
They had 70 % of possession in the first half , and therefore they spent much of the half passing the ball around casually rather than pressing .
Arsenal were guilty of leaving too big a gap between their ‘ lines ’ ( Qique Sanchez Flores , whose Atletico team beat Barcelona two months ago , advised that ‘ making it hard for Barcelona to find players between the lines ’ was the way to beat them ) – they should have been squeezing the play in front of their defence , but a lot of the time when they did n’t have the ball , Arsenal ’s midfield was closer to the forwards than to the defence .
They simply gave too much space to Barcelona in the opening period .
Another stark contrast was whilst Barcelona were defending with effectively nine and half outfield players ( Ibrahimovic is n’t a great presser ) , Arsenal were defending with more like seven .
Bendtner wandered around aimlessly when the ball was n’t near him , Arshavin never looks bothered about protecting his full - back – and Nasri and Fabregas contributed a ‘ half ’ each – both putting in a couple of decent tackles but simply not pressing as intently at their opposite numbers were .
The problem with switching between a 4 - 3 - 3 and a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 is that the roles of the wide players changes only slightly in terms of position , but hugely in terms of actual role .
In a 4 - 3 - 3 the wide players are essentially forwards – their main job is to pressure the full - backs and track them if necessary .
For those players in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 , there is one fewer player behind them , and therefore significantly more defensive work from them is needed .
They are a second line of midfield rather than a line of forwards .
Nasri has the desire but not the defensive ability – as for Arshavin , the fact he was fielded on the right surely points to the fact that even Arsene Wenger does n’t think he ’s up to it defensively .
In a sense , Arshavin going off injured was the best thing that could have happened for Arsenal .
He was replaced by the energetic Eboue – and whilst the Ivorian did n’t have a great game , he did provide the running , the determination and the work rate that Arsenal desperately needed when they were being thrashed in the first half .
As mentioned earlier , Arsenal ’s main problem was that they left too big a gap infront of their defence – Jens Lehmann said at half - time that their defence needed to push up in the second half .
And that ’s essentially what they did .
Sadly , this left them open to the threat of Barceona playing balls over the top , and sure enough Ibrahimovic scored twice in almost identical circumstances – a long ball chipped into Arsenal ’s left - hand channel , and Ibrahimovic finished twice .
Did the Arsenal plan of pushing their defence forward fail ?
On one hand , of course it did – they conceded two goals by doing it .
But bizarrely , it was probably still the right move – those were amongst the only opportunities Barcelona had in the second half .
Ibrahimovic ’s excellent finishing was the reason Barcelona scored in the second half – the chances were n’t any more blatant than the countless ones they missed in the first half .
The goals also came as a result of individual errors by Almunia and Vermaelen – whereas the chances in the first half came because Arsenal were all over the place as a team .
( Incidentally , both the goals also game as a result of a lack of pressure from Arsenal on the player in possession – for the second , in particular , they simply allow Xavi all the time in the world to pick out a pass ) .
But pushing the defence up also squeezed Barcelona in the final third and broke up their attacks more easily , meaning Arsenal saw more of the ball themselves .
OK , the first half was a draw and the second half was too – but in terms of dominance , Arsenal were ten times better off in the second period .
Wenger ’s decision to send for Theo Walcott was a brave – and inspired – move .
Despite how it may have looked , Maxwell is not a slow player – just Walcott is supremely quick .
He constantly got in behind the Brazilian both with and without the ball , and he lifted both the crowd and his fellow Arsenal players .
There will be inevitable calls for Wenger to play him from the start against Barcelona , but it might well be that this is the best role for him – coming out later on in games .
Assuming a vaguely similar pattern of play in the second leg , Arsenal will need to weather the storm early on ( perhaps meaning Sagna and Eboue on the right ) before unleashing Walcott once Barcelona ’s ( makeshift ) defence tire .
Credit to Wenger for rescuing the situation , but on another day Barcelona would have won the tie by half - time .
Arsenal need to learn their lessons from this game if they are to progress : they need to defend from the front as a unit , they need to hold a higher defensive line , and they must field one more defensive - minded player .
If they play like they did today at the Nou Camp , they will suffer the demolition job they were fortunate to avoid tonight .

Playing with Gender : A Critical Look at Blizzard 's Smash Hit Starcraft
After a hard day of classes , who does n't want to kick back and relax ?
But there are so very many options of what to do on our beloved Bethany campus ! …
Many people on this campus , and throughout the country and world relax by indulging in various forms of gaming .
Whether it be sports or role - playing , pool , arcade , or computerized , gaming is a popular form of entertainment .
But , are modern computer games more destructive than they are productive ?
Now , do n't get me wrong , there 's nothing that I love more than curling up with my computer , a Starcraft CD , and Josie and the Pussycats in the stereo , but the other day I came to a few realizations .
While this argument could take nearly any game and come to the same conclusions , I would like to talk about the game Starcraft .
To those of you who have never played it , do n't worry , my point is clear enough that the actual gameplay need not be experienced to understand .
I fear that Starcraft , along with nearly all modern computer games , alongside it 's addictively entertaining gameplay , and beautiful plotline , reinforces negative gender stereotypes by quantifying the women as sexual objects , and simultaneously as unknowable beasts .
This is not but a problem of Blizzard ( the company the produces Starcraft and the popular Warcraft series . ) , but in fact of our society at large … .
But to attack a whole society is so very difficult these days , so let 's just stick with Starcraft for now .
Starcraft is an ' overhead - realtime - strategy game ' .
Which in short means that it is a game in which you build armies , and send them strategically to eradicate your enemies , while holding a bird 's eye view .
There are three races in Starcraft : The Terrans .
Humans , expelled from Earth so very long ago that they 've adopted their own governmental reign , technology , and customs … but who are still pretty much just like us with bigger guns .
The Protoss , an ancient alien race whose power comes from their honor , nobility and psionic powers .
And , the Zerg .
A monstrous race of insects that have bred themselves into a hierarchical , hive - minded powerstructure , who wish to attain supreme perfection of form and essence .
Sounds pretty straightforward , huh ?
The blatant problem however is the way that women are depicted in this game , and perhaps the bigger problem is the comments on women that Blizzard may or may not have even realized that they put in ( you may argue that if Blizzard did n't know , it 's not a problem … if you want to argue this , first read some Michel Foucault … then e-mail me .
( A game is a work , just like a book , once out of the author 's hand , it is no longer theirs . ) .
Women in this and many computer games are depicted as sexual objects , and nothing more .
Simply put , women are much more than that .
Women , men … we are people , humans … nothing more , nothing less .
Just because some of us have breasts , and others penises , does not make either more of an object of sex , nor more an object of power .
We are of America , where we claim that we 're all equal ; equal rights , equal opportunities , equal power , equal sexuality .
Therefore , it is not right to ingrain into our minds ( through our entertainment ) that one gender is only for the sake of sexuality .
( For examples of the ways that women are overly sexualized in these games , see the attached " evidence " quotes . )
Although this is a distinct problem , as these sexual identities get ingrained in us as we recreate , this is not actually the issue that I wish to address at the moment .
The issue that I wish to address is the much less obvious one .
Of the three races in Starcraft , the player begins by first greatly feeling a connection to the Terrans .
They are , after all , like us .
They are humans , they look like us , they sound like us , and they claim Earth as their homeland .
They have their power struggles , and their titles , and their government , and we understand this all , and empathize with it … quite frankly because it is our society .
The Terrans are us , and so we relate to them .
Blizzard was intelligent to do this , as it brings you into the game , and allows you to learn the user interface with a feeling of comfort , as you are not outside of the comfortable world of your computer room .
The next race is the Protoss .
They are alien from us ( as with all ' good ' sci - fi aliens ) in that they are exactly like us , but with a tweak here and there .
Most players settle into the Protoss as their favorite race .
This is presumably because of the fact that they are ' human ' enough that we can feel for them , but they are alien enough that their power is new and sweet .
The Protoss are essentially humans with greater psychic powers , and a more rigid code of honor ( Note : I do not mean to say this of the story line , but of how we relate to them …
I mean this in the same way as saying that Vulcans are humans with greater logic , less emotions , and pointy ears , or that orcs are green barbaric humans . ) .
The Protoss are what many developing boys with to be .
They are powerful , honorable warrior - philosophers .
They are described as perfection of essence , but not of form ( Alternately to the Zerg who are described as perfection of form who are seeking perfection of essence , and the Terrans who are described as perfection of neither , but on the brink of both . ) .
We can feel for the Protoss , because , when all is boiled away , they are us … or at least our dreams and aspirations .
And then there are the Zerg …
The ruthless , writhing alien beasts .
The icky bugs .
The enemy .
The Zerg are not human .
We have difficulty relating to them because ( if for no other reason ) when we click on them , they do not talk to us .
They do not sass talk .
They do not bend to our will .
They do not entertain us .
They simply respond to us in an animalistic tongue that we cannot comprehend .
Upon clicking on one of their buildings , you do not hear the sounds of building , nor of metal upon metal , but instead of the organic sounds of life oozing .
The Zerg tap into the spirit of fear that resides in all human beings .
It taps into our primal memories of beasts that cause our tribes harm .
And they are meant to be that way .
They are the plague upon the universe , the disease , the evil , the enemy … the Other .
So what ?
What the hell does any of this have to do with sex , sexuality , gender , or the price of tea in China ?
It has everything to do with reinforcing gender stereotypes .
but first you have to realize that the Terrans and the Protoss are men , while the Zerg are women .
What ???
The Terrans have male and female .
The Protoss are asexual .
And the Zerg…well , they 're the Zerg !
I understand … but keep reading and it will become clear .
Both the Terrans and the Protoss function on a productive economy .
You build buildings that are suited to the type of unit ( army ) that you would like to use to conquer your opponent , then you invest money into those buildings .
The more money that you invest into the more of those buildings , the stronger your army , and the faster you get those armies .
The Zerg however work on a reproductive economy … something that we are not all too familiar with .
With the Zerg , there is one main building , called a hatchery , that produces Larva .
These larva are then transformed into a more powerful unit , which is even then occasionally transformed into an even more powerful unit .
The power of the Zerg lies not in how many productive buildings you have , but in how many reproductive ( larva - birthing ) buildings you have .
Also , their power lies not in efficiency of building ( more marines per minute ) but in keeping your troops alive long enough to get them nurtured and grown up to a state of power .
( Good job for those of you who are putting together the gender argument already ) .
So ?
So , the Terrans play hard and fast , the Protoss play power , and the Zerg need to nurture , who cares ?
The reason why this is important is because the productive economy is the male economy .
It is the economy that is set up by the half of the species that cannot bear children , the half than needs to invest worth in order to gain .
Conversely , the reproductive economy is the female economy .
It is the economy of the half of the species that bears children and is biologically required ( at least for a while ) to nurture the young .
So that 's great !
We 've shown one side of evidence that implies that the Zerg are playing off of female ideology , while the Terran and Protoss play off male … but that is still not yet anything offensive or bad .
Allow me to show more support for the claim of Zerg being female , and Terrans and Protoss being male before I show the full extent of my hand .
The buildings say a lot about what gender they are meant to parody .
The Terran buildings are sharp and angular .
They are built in a series of poles and walls , and constructed from the ground up , sharp , boxy , and rigidly unwavering .
Cold .
The Protoss buildings are tall and thin , reaching toward the sky , the large phalluses reach upwards , rigid and firm , an emblem of power for all to behold .
The Zerg ' buildings ' are somewhat different .
First of all they are not buildings , per se , but are living entities in and of themselves .
Secondly , they must be ' built ' upon the life - giving fluid that oozes from the mother building : the hatchery .
Thirdly , a drone ( evolved from a larva as are all troops ) must sacrifice its life in order to become the building .
Once the drone sacrifices itself , it becomes a large , undulating womb - sac that pulses and grows until the building inside has finished incubating .
It then bursts forth out of the womb as a once again undulating ' building ' .
But the Zerg buildings are neither angular , nor phallic , but explicitly gynic .
All of the Zerg buildings ooze some sort of fluid from one of their many openings .
Nearly all of their buildings have one to multiple openings , ranging from gaping circles , to small oozing slits , to rounded triangles that pulsate open and then closed slowly .
Also , one of the Zerg 's greatest strengths is a building known as a Nydus Canal .
A Nydus Canal is a large , vaginal opening , that if a Zerg unit enters , it may emerge at the other end , in a manner that " greatly puzzles most Terran scientists . "
( This quote is too much to not mock : What ?
Men cannot understand the vagina : the symbolic representation of women ?
I never would have guessed . )
My third argument comes from the actual experience of playing the game .
When playing the Terran and Protoss , you slowly build and army of ever increasing power .
You start off low in power , but then build and build , and build , and build until one glorious moment when you ' go ' and it is either your moment of glory when you sweep the map , or it is an unpleasant resolution , as your great accomplishment is wiped out and you have no choice but to lose , or if you are lucky to undergo the slow but steady process of getting back up to the point where you can ' go ' again .
The Zerg on the other hand , build up first a small and weak group of troops .
These troops usually test the mettle of the enemy , and so you build up a slightly larger group to do the same .
You then follow this with a larger , and more powerful , and a larger and more powerful , and a larger and more powerful group … until finally you have won , or you are struck in the instant of rebuilding before your next great thrust begins .
While this argument is much more blatant when shown graphically , anyone who has studied either human sexuality , or gender - comparative literary styles should recognize this pattern .
It is the comparative stages of sexual peaks , climaxes , and orgasm (s ) .
The Protoss and Terrans , follow the male sexuality of building up , and up , and up , until finally it is the long awaited moment , while the Zerg build up , and then drop some , then build more … and more … and more … and more , and once dropped it may re-build up again , much sooner than it 's male counterpart .
If these arguments are n't enough ' evidence ' to get you to at least contemplate the possibility that the Zerg are intended to be taken as female , while the Protoss and Terran are to be taken as male , I feel that you should reread the evidence more carefully , and perhaps simply examine if you do n't want to believe it .
Now , to the crux of the matter .
The reason why it is harmful for games like this to draw on such ideologies is that it reinforces negative gender stereotypes , in regard to both men and women .
I am mainly concerned with the female aspect , and so that is what I will put my emphasis upon .
To solidify into gamers minds the idea of Zerg = female , alongside Zerg = unknowable , evil beast yields a culture who regard female = unknowable , evil beast .
This is obviously a problem .
Women are human , men are human .
In that sense there is no distinction .
I would say " women are as worthy ( or as human ( or as anything ) ) as men " , but this statement itself reinforces the ideology that men are standard , while women simply strive to be like them .
this need not be the way that we look at it .
Women and Men are equals , and anything , addictively entertaining or not , that reinforces an ideology that says otherwise needs be taken to task .
I am not assaulting Blizzard , for I truly believe that they are not even aware of what they did .
The problem lies in the fact that this game , in fact nearly all computer games , is a direct product of the American male fantasy .
The problem lies not in the game ( although it perpetuates the problem ) , but in the fantasy life that we have set up for the American male youth .
Freud refers to women as the " immense heart of darkness " , the unknowable , the different , the other .
This permeates our society .
Well , I call for it to stop here and now .
The only way to combat preconceptions such as this is to become aware of them .
Women are not inhuman , are not unknowable , are not evil , nor the enemy , nor an immense heart of darkness .
No , women are simply humans , the same as men , but with different sexual organs .
Games that perpetuate such stereotypes are a symptom of a greater problem within society , a problem that I am calling attention to now .
Fight sexism .
Fight gender stereotypes .
Think of people as people , not as sexual objects , nor as the unknowable other .

In early April , Sony issued a new software update for the PlayStation 3 that eliminated the option to install an alternate operating system , like Linux , to the console .
Now , a California man is suing Sony Computer Entertainment over the change .

PS3 Loses Linux Support
Ever since it launched in 2006 , one of the neater features of the PlayStation 3 has been its …

PlayStation 3 firmware 3.21 — a mandatory update — went live on April 1 , removing the " Install Other OS " feature present in the original version of the console .
Sony Computer Entertainment reps said the decision to eliminate the feature was " due to security concerns , " that dropping a secondary operating system would " help ensure that PS3 owners will continue to have access to the broad range of gaming and entertainment content from SCE and its content partners on a more secure system . "

Plaintiff Anthony Ventura takes issue with that decision in a suit filed against SCEA in a North District of California court .
The suit filed on his behalf believes the change " reflected Sony 's concerns that the Other OS feature might be used by ' hackers ' to copy and / or steal gaming and other content . "
" Sony 's decision to force users to disable the Other OS function was based on its own interest and was made at the expense of its customers , " reads the complaint .

The class action suit was brought on behalf of " a nationwide class of all persons who purchased a PS3 during the period November 17 , 2006 and March 27 , 2010 and who did not resell their PS3 " during that time .
The suit claims that the " Install Other OS " function was " extremely valuable . "
According to the suit , the plaintiff he has not yet installed the latest firmware update so that he can continue to use the Other OS feature .
The suit also notes that PS3 owners who choose not to update their firmware cannot access the PlayStation Network , play PS3 games online , nor can they play new games or Blu-ray videos that require firmware 3.21 .

Ventura 's suit against the PlayStation maker seeks " damages for Plaintiff and each class member , including but not limited to compensatory damages ; restitution ; injuctive relief ; attorneys ' fees ; and the cost of this suit . "
Specific sums are not listed , although court documents note " the amount in controversy is in excess of $ 5 million . "

Blizzard is still hip - deep in the StarCraft II multiplayer beta , but fans of the sci - fi real - time strategy game should expect a pair of important updates over the next couple weeks , including the release of the game 's Galaxy Editor .

StarCraft II lead Chris Sigaty says that the developer is planning to release the game 's map and mod editor for those already enjoying the PC version of the game 's beta sometime this week , letting players add their own creations and game mode customizations .
Expect that alongside a substantial patch to the game very soon .
Soon thereafter , possibly some time next week , Blizzard plans to release the long - awaited ( by me , at least ) StarCraft II multiplayer beta for Mac users .

If any single number captures the state of the American economy over the last decade , it is zero .
That was the net gain in jobs between 1999 and 2009 — nada , nil , zip .
By painful contrast , from the 1940s through the 1990s , recessions came and went , but no decade ended without at least a 20 percent increase in the number of jobs .
Many people blame the great real estate bubble of recent years .
The idea here is that once a bubble pops it can destroy more real - world business activity — and jobs — than it creates as it expands .
There is some truth to this .
But it does n’t explain why , even when the real estate bubble was at its most inflated , so few jobs were created compared to the tech - stock bubble of the late ’90s .
Between 2000 and 2007 American businesses created only seven million jobs , before the great recession destroyed more than that .
In the ’90s prior to the dot - com bust , they created more than twenty - two million jobs .
Others point to the diffusion of new technologies that reduce the number of workers needed to produce and sell manufactured products like cars and services like airline reservations .
But throughout economic history , even as new technologies like the assembly line and the personal computer destroyed large numbers of jobs , they also empowered people to create new and different ones , often in greater numbers .
Yet others blame foreign competition and offshoring , and point to all the jobs lost to China , India , or Mexico .
Here , too , there is some truth .
But U.S. governments have been liberalizing our trade laws for decades ; although this has radically changed the type of jobs available to American workers — shifting vast chunks of the U.S. manufacturing sector overseas , for instance — there is little evidence that this has resulted in any lasting decline in the number of jobs in America .
Moreover , recent Labor Department statistics show that the loss of jobs here at home , be it the result of sudden economic crashes or technological progress or trade liberalization , does not appear to be our main problem at all .
Though few people realize it , the rate of job destruction in the private sector is now 20 percent lower than it was in the late ’90s , when managers at America ’s corporations embraced outsourcing and downsizing with an often manic intensity .
Rather , the lack of net job growth over the last decade is due mainly to the creation of fewer new jobs .
As recent Labor Department statistics show , even during the peak years of the housing boom , job creation by existing businesses was 14 percent lower than it was in the late ’90s .
The problem of weak job creation certainly can’t be due to increased business taxes and regulation , since both were slashed during the Bush years .
Nor can the explanation be insufficient consumer demand ; throughout most of the last decade , consumers and the federal government engaged in a consumption binge of world - historical proportions .
Other , more plausible explanations have been floated for why the rate of job creation seems to have fallen .
One is that the federal government made too few investments in the 1980s and ’90s in things like basic R&D , so the pipeline of technological innovation on which new jobs depend began to run dry in the 2000s .
Another is that a basic shift in competitiveness has taken place — that countries like India , with educated but relatively low - cost workforces , have become more natural homes for jobs - producing sectors like IT .
But while the mystery of what killed the great American jobs machine has yielded no shortage of debatable answers , one of the more compelling potential explanations has been conspicuously absent from the national conversation : monopolization .
The word itself feels anachronistic , a relic from the age of the Rockefellers and Carnegies .
But the fact that the term has faded from our daily discourse does n’t mean the thing itself has vanished — in fact , the opposite is true .
In nearly every sector of our economy , far fewer firms control far greater shares of their markets than they did a generation ago .
Indeed , in the years after officials in the Reagan administration radically altered how our government enforces our antimonopoly laws , the American economy underwent a truly revolutionary restructuring .
Four great waves of mergers and acquisitions — in the mid-1980s , early ’90s , late ’90s , and between 2003 and 2007 — transformed America ’s industrial landscape at least as much as globalization .
Over the same two decades , meanwhile , the spread of mega-retailers like Wal - Mart and Home Depot and agricultural behemoths like Smithfield and Tyson ’s resulted in a more piecemeal approach to consolidation , through the destruction or displacement of countless independent family - owned businesses .
It is now widely accepted among scholars that small businesses are responsible for most of the net job creation in the United States .
It is also widely agreed that small businesses tend to be more inventive , producing more patents per employee , for example , than do larger firms .
Less well established is what role concentration plays in suppressing new business formation and the expansion of existing businesses , along with the jobs and innovation that go with such growth .
Evidence is growing , however , that the radical , wide - ranging consolidation of recent years has reduced job creation at both big and small firms simultaneously .
At one extreme , ever more dominant Goliaths increasingly lack any real incentive to create new jobs ; after all , many can increase their earnings merely by using their power to charge customers more or pay suppliers less .
At the other extreme , the people who run our small enterprises enjoy fewer opportunities than in the past to grow their businesses .
The Goliaths of today are so big and so adept at protecting their turf that they leave few niches open to exploit .
Over the next few years , we can use our government to do many things to promote the creation of new and better jobs in America .
But even the most aggressive stimulus packages and tax cutting will do little to restore the sort of open market competition that , over the years , has proven to be such an important impetus to the creation of wealth , well - being , and work .
Consolidation is certainly not the only factor at play .
But any policymaker who is really serious about creating new jobs in America would be unwise to continue to ignore our new monopolies .
t ’s not as if Americans are entirely unaware of how consolidated our economic landscape is , or that this is a perilous way to do business .
The financial crisis taught us how dangerously concentrated our financial sector has become , particularly since Washington responded to the near - catastrophic collapse of banks deemed “ too big to fail ” by making them even bigger .
Today , America ’s five largest banks control a stunning 48 percent of bank assets , double their share in 2000 ( and that ’s actually one of the lessconsolidated sectors of our economy ) .
Similarly , the debate over health insurance reform awakened many of us to the fact that , in many communities across America , insurance companies enjoy what amounts to monopoly power .
Some of us are aware , too , through documentaries likeFood , Inc. , of how concentrated agribusiness and food processing have become , and of the problems with food quality and safety that can result .
Even so , most Americans still believe that our economy remains the most wide open , competitive , and vibrant market system the world has ever seen .
Unfortunately , the stories we have told ourselves about competition in America over the past quarter century are simply no longer true .
Perhaps the easiest way to understand this is to take a quick walk around a typical grocery or big - box store , and look more closely at what has taken place in these citadels of consumer choice in the generation since we stopped enforcing our antitrust laws .
The first proof is found in the store itself .
If you are stocking up on basic goods , there ’s a good chance you are wandering the aisles of a Wal - Mart .
After all , the company is legendarily dominant in retail , controlling , for instance , 25 percent of groceries sales in some states and 40 percent of DVD sales nationwide .
But at least the plethora of different brands vying for your attention on the store shelves suggests a healthy , competitive marketplace , right ?
Well , let ’s take a closer look .
In the health aisle , the vast array of toothpaste options on display is mostly the work of two companies : Colgate - Palmolive and Procter & Gamble , which split nearly 70 percent of the U.S. market and control even such seemingly independent brands as Tom ’s of Maine .
And in many stores the competition between most brands is mostly choreographed anyway .
Under a system known as “ category management , ” retailers like Wal - Mart and their largest suppliers openly cooperate in determining everything from price to product placement .
Over in the cold case we find an even greater array of beer options , designed to satisfy almost any taste .
We can choose among the old standbys like Budweiser , Coors , and Miller Lite .
Or from a cornucopia of smaller brands , imports and specialty brews like Stella Artois , Redbridge , Rolling Rock , Beck ’s , Blue Moon , and Stone Mill Pale Ale .
But all these brands — indeed more than 80 percent of all beers in America — are controlled by two companies , Anheuser - Busch Inbev and MillerCoors .
Need milk ?
In many parts of the country , the choices you see in the Wal - Mart dairy section are almost entirely an illusion .
In many stores , for instance , you can pick among jugs labeled with the names PET Dairy , Mayfield , or Horizon .
But do n’t waste too much time deciding : all three brands are owned by Dean Foods , the nation ’s largest dairy processor , and Wal - Mart ’s own Great Value brand containers are sometimes filled by Dean as well .
Indeed , around 70 percent of milk sold in New England — and up to 80 percent of milk peddled in some other parts of the country — comes from Dean plants .
Besides dominating the retail dairy market , Dean has been accused of collaborating with Dairy Farmers of America , another giant company that buys milk from independent farmers and provides it to Dean for processing and distribution , to drive down the price farmers are paid while inflating its own profits .
The food on offer outside of the refrigerator aisle is n’t much better .
The boxes on the shelves are largely filled with the corn-derived products that are the basic building block of most modern processed food ; about 80 percent of all the corn seed in America and 95 percent of soybean seeds contain patented genes produced by a single company : Monsanto .
And things are just as bad farther down the ingredients list — take an additive like ascorbic acid ( Vitamin C ) , produced by a Chinese cartel that holds more than 85 percent of the U.S. market .
How about pet food ?
There sure seems to be a bewildering array of options .
But if you paid close attention to coverage of the massive pet food recall of 2007 , you will remember that five of the top six independent brands — including those marketed by Colgate - Palmolive , Mars , and Procter & Gamble — relied on a single contract manufacturer , Menu Foods , as did seventeen of the top twenty food retailers in the United States that sell “ private - label ” wet pet foods under their store brands , including Safeway , Kroger , and Wal - Mart .
The Menu Foods recall covered products that had been retailed under a phenomenal 150 different product names .
Heading out to the parking lot should give us some respite from all of this — surely the vehicles here reflect a last bastion of American - style competition , no ?
After all , more than a dozen big carmakers sell hundreds of different models in America .
But it ’s a funny kind of competition , one that ’s not nearly as competitive as it looks .
To begin with , more than two - thirds of the iron ore used to make the steel in all those cars is likely provided by just three firms ( two of which are trying to merge ) .
And it does n’t stop there .
A decade ago , all the big carmakers were for the most part vertically integrated , and they kept their supply systems largely separate from one another .
Today , however , the outsourcing revolution , combined with monopolization within the supply base , means the big companies increasingly rely on the same outside suppliers — even the same factories — for components like piston rings and windshield - wiper blades and door handles .
Ever wonder why Toyota came out so strongly in favor of a bailout for General Motors last year ?
One reason is they knew if that giant fell suddenly , it would knock over many of the suppliers that they themselves — as well as Nissan and Honda — depend on to make their own cars .
And do n’t fool yourself that this process of monopolization affects only America ’s working classes .
What ’s happened to down - market retail has happened to department stores as well .
Think Macy ’s competes with Bloomingdale’s ?
Think again .
Both are units of a holding company called Macy ’s Inc. , which , under its old name , Federated , spent the last two decades rolling up control of such department store brand names as Marshall Field ’s , Hecht ’s , Broadway , and Bon Marché .
A generation ago , even most midsized cities in America could boast of multiple independent department stores .
Today a single company controls roughly 800 outlets , in a chain that stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific .
n school , many of us learned that the greatest dangers posed by monopolization are political in nature — namely , consolidation of power in the hands of the few and the destruction of the property and liberty of individual citizens .
Most of us probably also learned in seventh - grade civics class how firms with monopoly power can gouge consumers by jacking up prices .
( And indeed they often do ; a recent study of mergers found that in four out of five cases , the merged firms increased prices on products ranging from Quaker State motor oil to Chex brand breakfast cereals . )
Similarly , it ’s not hard to understand how monopolization can reduce the bargaining power of workers , who suddenly find themselves with fewer places to sell their labor .
The way corporate consolidation destroys jobs is clear enough , too — it dominates the headlines whenever a big merger is announced .
Consider two recent deals in the drug industry .
The first came in January 2009 when Pﬁzer , the world ’s largest drug company , announced plans for a $ 68 billion takeover of Wyeth .
The second came in March 2009 , when executives at number two Merck said they planned to spend $ 41.1 billion to buy Schering - Plough .
Managers all but bragged of the number of workers who would be rendered “ redundant ” by the deal — the first killed off 19,000 jobs , the second 16,000 .
Nevertheless , America ’s problem in recent years has n’t been job destruction , it ’s been a fall - off in job creation .
Consolidation causes problems here , too , in a variety of ways .
First , it can reduce the impetus of big firms to invest in innovation , a chief source of new jobs .
The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter famously theorized that monopolists would invest their outsized profits into new R&D to enable themselves to innovate and thus stay ahead of potential rivals — an argument that defenders of consolidation have long relied on .
But numerous empirical studies in recent years have found the opposite to be true : competition is a greater spur to innovation than monopoly is .
In one widely cited study , for instance , Philippe Aghion of Harvard University and Peter Howitt of Brown University looked at British manufacturing firms from 1968 to 1997 , when the UK ’s economy was integrating with Europe and hence subject to the EU ’s antitrust policies .
They found that on balance these firms became more innovative — as measured by patent applications and R&D spending — as they were forced to compete more directly with their continental rivals .
The opposite trend took place in some of America ’s biggest industrial firms in the years after 1981 , when the Reagan administration all but abandoned antitrust enforcement .
Many of the most successful U.S. companies adopted a winner - take - all approach to their industries that allowed them to shortchange innovation and productive expansion .
Prior to 1981 , for instance , General Electric invested heavily in R&D in many fields , seeking to compete in as many markets as possible ; after 1981 it pulled back its resources , focusing instead on gathering sufficient power to govern the pace of technological change .
Consolidation in the retail sector can also inhibit job growth .
As behemoth retailers garner ever more power over the sale of some product or service , they also gain an ever greater ability to strip away the profits that once would have made their way into the hands of their suppliers .
The money that the managers and workers at these smaller companies would have used to expand their business , or upgrade their machinery and skills , is instead transferred to the bottom lines of dominant retailers and traders and thence to shareholders .
Or it may be simply destroyed through pricing wars .
A good example is the pre-Christmas book battle between Amazon and Wal - Mart , in which the two giant conglomerates pushed down the prices of hardcover best sellers to lure buyers into their stores and Web sites .
In many cases , the two companies actually sold the books for less than they bought them , treating them as “ loss leaders ” and expecting to recoup the loss through the sale of other , more expensive products .
Although consumers welcomed the opportunity to pay $ 9.99 for the latest Stephen King novel priced elsewhere above $ 30 , the move caused a near panic among publishers .
Even though the low prices may have resulted in the sale of more books , the longer - term effect is to radically lower what consumers will expect to pay for books , which will in turn reduce the funds available to publishers to develop and edit future prospects .
Another way that monopolization can inhibit the creation of new jobs is the practice of entrenched corporations using their power to buy up , and sometimes stash away , new technologies , rather than building them themselves .
Prior to the 1980s , if a company wanted to enter a new area of business , it would typically have had to open a new division , hire talent , and invest in R&D in order to compete with existing companies in that area .
Now it can simply buy them .
There is a whole business model based on this idea , sometimes called “ innovation through acquisition . ”
The model is often associated with the Internet technology company Cisco , which , starting in the early ’90s and continuing apace afterward , gobbled up more than 100 smaller companies .
Other tech titans , including Oracle , have in recent years adopted much the same basic approach .
Even Google , many people ’s notion of an enlightened , innovative corporate Goliath , has acquired many of its game - changing technologies — such as Google Earth , Google Analytics , and Google Docs — from smaller start - ups that Google bought out .
As the falloff in IPOs over the last decade seems to confirm , one practical result of all this is that fewer and fewer entrepreneurs at start - up companies even attempt any longer to build their firms into ventures able to produce not merely new products but new jobs and new competition into established companies .
Instead , increasingly their goal , once they have proven that a viable business can be built around a particular technology , is simply to sell out to one of the behemoths .
Finally , dominant firms can hurt job growth by using their power to hamper the ability of start - ups and smaller rivals to bring new products to market .
Google has been accused of doing this by placing its own services — maps , price comparisons — at the top of its search results while pushing competitors in those services farther down , where they are less likely to be seen — or in some cases off Google entirely .
Google , however , is a Boy Scout compared to the bullying behavior of Intel , which over the years has leveraged its 90 percent share of the computer microchip market to impede its only real rival , Advanced Micro Devices , a company renowned for its innovative products .
Intel has abused its power so flagrantly , in fact , that it has attracted an antitrust suit from New York State and been slapped with hefty fines or reprimands by antitrust regulators in South Korea , Japan , and the European Union .
The EU alone is demanding a record $ 1.5 billion from the firm .
To understand just how disadvantaged small innovative companies are in markets dominated by behemoths , consider the plight of Retractable Technologies , Inc. , of Little Elm , Texas .
The company manufactures a type of “ safety syringe ” invented by its founder , an engineer named Thomas Shaw .
The device uses a spring to pull the needle into the body of the syringe once the plunger is fully depressed .
This helps to prevent the sort of “ needlestick ” injuries that every year result in some 6,000 health workers being infected by diseases such as hepatitis and HIV .
Since starting the company in 1994 , Shaw has carved out a modest market niche , selling his lifesaving product to nursing homes , doctors ’ offices , federal prisons , VA hospitals , and international health organizations for distribution in the Third World .
But he ’s not been able to break into the mainstream U.S. hospital market .
The reason , he says , is that a company called Becton Dickinson & Co. controls some 90 percent of syringe sales in America and enjoys enough power over hospital supply purchasing groups to all but block adoption of Shaw ’s device .
In 1998 , Shaw sued , charging restraint of trade , and in 2004 won what looked like a stunning victory : Becton Dickinson agreed to settle for $ 100 million , and the purchasing groups promised to change their business practices .
But according to executives at Retractable Technologies , things have only gotten worse .
“ We probably have less of our products in hospitals today than we did ten years ago , ” says Shaw , who just won a patent - infringement case against Becton Dickinson and is pursuing another antitrust suit against the company .
“ I have spent what should have been the most creative , productive years of my life sitting in depositions .
By the time I ’m done fighting , my patents will have expired . ”
A few years back , Bess Weatherman , the managing director of the health care division of the private equity firm Warburg Pincus , spelled out the effect of such monopoly power on investments in new health care technologies .
In a Senate hearing , Weatherman testified that “ companies subject to , or potentially subject to , anti-competitive practices … will not be funded by venture capital .
As a result , many of their innovations will die , even if they offer a dramatic improvement over an existing solution . ”
he degree of consolidation in many industries today bears a striking resemblance to that of the late Gilded Age .
So too the arguments that today ’s monopolists use to justify consolidation .
In the late nineteenth century , men like John D. Rockefeller , Andrew Carnegie , and J. P. Morgan often defended themselves against antimonopoly activists with the argument that one giant vertically integrated company could deliver oil or steel more efficiently than could many firms in competition with one another .
This “ efficiency ” argument appealed to a broad range of opinion , from European socialists to many American progressives .
Even Theodore Roosevelt , despite his reputation as a “ trust buster , ” accepted the notion that competition was wasteful .
He hewed instead to a philosophy of “ corporatism , ” which held that giant enterprises could best be managed through a mix of government and private power according to “ scientific ” principles to ensure their maximum utility to the public .
When antitrust law was put to use during these years , it was often in ways that aided the monopolists : it was used to break up labor unions , farmers ’ cooperatives , and small business alliances .
The one big exception to this rule was the administration of Woodrow Wilson , who was elected in 1912 by a Democratic Party largely dominated by populists .
But the outbreak of war in 1914 swiftly put an end to the populist effort to force big businesses to compete and to leave small businesses in peace .
Herbert Hoover was a fervent believer in corporatism , as were the New Dealers who succeeded him .
When they brought their National Industrial Recovery Act to Congress in June 1933 , one of the act ’s central provisions called for suspension of America ’s antitrust laws .
The modern era of antitrust enforcement began in 1935 , when the Supreme Court declared the NIRA unconstitutional .
In the aftermath of that decision , populists in Congress and the administration moved swiftly to take the New Deal in a radically different direction .
Unlike the corporatists , the populists believed that the central goal of government in the political economy should be to protect the individual citizen and society as a whole from the consolidation of power by the few .
Antitrust laws were integral to this notion .
In the immediate aftermath of the NIRA decision , Congress passed laws like the Robinson - Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act and the Miller - Tydings Fair Trade Act , which restricted the power that big retailers could bring to bear on smaller rivals and on producers .
By 1937 , Roosevelt officials were shaping a “ second ” New Deal centered largely around the engineering of competition among large companies .
Populists have often been charged with being naive romantics who pine for a lost agrarian utopia .
Yet in practice , most New Deal–era populists were perfectly at ease with concentration of power ; they simply wanted the government to create at least some competition wherever possible and to regulate monopoly in those cases — like the provision of water or natural gas — where competition truly seemed wasteful .
Indeed , many of the populists were strong proponents of industrial efficiency ; they just did n’t believe that unregulated industrial monopoly ever was more efficient than competition among at least a few industrial firms .
Under the direction of Thurmond Arnold , the antitrust division of the Department of Justice set out to engineer rivalries within large industries wherever possible .
In the late 1930s , for example , the government brought an antitrust suit against Alcoa , which had commanded a monopoly over aluminum production .
As the suit dragged on through the ’ 40s , the government sped up the process by selling aluminum plants built with public money during World War II to Alcoa ’s would - be competitors , Kaiser and Reynolds .
The result of the second New Deal was an economy in which competition was regulated in three basic ways .
“ Natural ” monopolies like water or gas service were left in place , and regulated or controlled directly by government .
Heavy industry was allowed to concentrate operations to a large degree , but individual firms were made subject to antitrust law and forced to compete with one another .
And in sectors of the economy where efficiencies of concentration were far harder to prove — retail , restaurants , services , farming — the government protected open markets .
One result was a remarkably democratic distribution of political economic power out to citizens and communities across America .
Another was an astounding burst of innovation .
As the industrial historian David Hounshell has documented , the new competition among large corporations led companies like DuPont and General Electric to ramp up their R&D activities and fashion the resulting technologies into marketable products .
Smaller firms , meanwhile , were carefully protected from Goliaths , enabling entrepreneurs to develop not merely ideas but often entire companies to bring the ideas to market .
Antitrust enforcers were n’t content simply to prevent giant firms from closing off markets .
In dozens of cases between 1945 and 1981 , antitrust officials forced large companies like AT&T , RCA , IBM , GE , and Xerox to make available , for free , the technologies they had developed in - house or gathered through acquisition .
Over the thirty - seven years this policy was in place , American entrepreneurs gained access to tens of thousands of ideas — some patented , some not — including the technologies at the heart of the semiconductor .
The effect was transformative .
In Inventing the Electronic Century , the industrial historian Alfred D. Chandler Jr. argued that the explosive growth of Silicon Valley in subsequent decades was largely set in motion by these policies and the “ middle - level bureaucrats ” in the Justice Department ’s Antitrust Division who enforced them in the field .
hile this was happening , a group of thinkers centered around the economist Milton Friedman began to develop arguments in favor of resurrecting the laissez - faire political economic theories of the nineteenth - century monopolists .
Their basic contention was that America ’s markets and America ’s industrial activities should be governed by private individuals .
They held that when public officials participated in the management of industrial corporations or used antitrust law to protect open markets , such actions merely distracted the private executives in charge of these institutions from the task at hand .
In his 1962 collection of essays , Capitalism and Freedom , Friedman argued against any application of antitrust law aside from breaking up labor unions and guilds like the American Medical Association that threatened to encumber the work of the capitalists .
In his book , Friedman also developed a more palatable term for laissez faire : “ free market . ”
Another leader of this movement , future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , focused on rehabilitating the efficiency argument that monopolists like Rockefeller and Morgan had once employed to justify their near - total domination of their industries .
The Chicago School thinkers — so named because many of its members taught at the University of Chicago — found their champion in Ronald Reagan , who brought their theories with him into the White House in 1981 .
Almost as soon as Reagan ’s team took power , they made clear that one of their very first targets would be the antitrust laws .
William F. Baxter , the head of the Justice Department ’s Antitrust Division under Reagan , announced his intentions to “ pursue an antitrust policy based on efficiency considerations . ”
The declaration was met by a strong bipartisan outcry in Congress , but the Reagan team skillfully reframed their ideas in terms that fit the policy mood of the era .
The administration borrowed a page from Chicago School legal scholar Robert Bork , who in his 1978 book The Antitrust Paradox had made the case for the old efficiency argument in language adopted from the then - flourishing consumer movement .
The reason to promote efficiency , Bork wrote , was to increase the “ welfare ” of the consumer .
The basic argument was as simple as it was subversive : given that consumers benefit from lower prices , and given that greater scale and scope gives managers the power to drive down prices , we should embrace concentration rather than resist it .
Beginning in Reagan ’s first term , antitrust enforcement all but ended .
Throughout the 1980s , the opponents of antitrust sometimes buttressed their arguments by stoking fears about the supposed dangers posed to American manufacturers by their Japanese rivals .
But for the most part such arguments proved unnecessary , as the government had already largely retired from the field , leaving corporations largely to their own devices .
By the time Reagan left office , laissez faire had become conventional wisdom .
The Clinton administration was more activist , cracking down on price - fixing schemes and bringing a high - profile antitrust action against Microsoft .
But for the most part it accepted the new corporate consolidation guidelines that the Reagan team had devised .
Waves of mergers and acquisitions came and went with few calls to reexamine our thinking about antitrust .
In no small part this was because the economy as a whole seemed to be performing quite well ; not only did prices for many goods fall , but for a short while toward the end of the Clinton years there was actually a shortage of workers in America .
As the twentieth century drew to a close , the United States was in the midst of the longest period of sustained economic growth in its history .
But as we ’ve seen , the great burst of business activity in the 1980s and ’90s was to a significant extent the result of actions taken by the federal government during previous decades of anti-trust enforcement .
Indeed , many of the companies we most associate with the ’90s tech boom — Apple , Microsoft , Oracle , Genentech — were actually founded in the 1970s , went public in the ’ 80s , and eventually grew big enough to force establishment behemoths like IBM to revolutionize their management philosophies and business models in order to compete .
It is this dynamic — of radically innovative start - ups growing in size and eventually challenging the status quo — that drives most jobs creation .
And it was precisely this dynamic that the pro-consolidation policies launched in the Reagan years would eventually upset .
By the time the 2000s rolled around , industry after industry had been consolidated ; the “ innovation by acquisition ” trend was in high gear ; antitrust enforcement was reaching a new low in George W. Bush ’s administration ; and a plethora of global capital , unable to find enough attractive growing companies to invest in , started flowing into subprime mortgages and other financial exotica .
The rest , as they say , is history .
That , at least , is one possible explanation for why the American jobs machine seems to have failed in the last decade .
As we ’ve noted , there are others as well , having to do with changes in technology and international trade .
These other theories are open to debate , but at least they ’re beingdebated .
What is n’t getting talked about is the role industry consolidation might be playing in all this .
That needs to change .
s we seek new ways to jump - start America ’s job growth , we would be wise not to rely only on big government or big business to accomplish the task for us .
Indeed , the new and better jobs of tomorrow will be created not by any such abstract powers but by very real people — such as our own more entrepreneurial neighbors , cousins , and children — working in big corporations made subject to competition and working in small ventures launched specifically to compete .
These entrepreneurs will be able to do so only after we have used our antimonopoly laws to clear away the great private powers that now stand in their way .
When we get serious about this task , we will find that an entire political economic model lies ready for our use — the one shaped largely by the populists in Congress and the Roosevelt administration during the second New Deal .
Before we can make use of this ready - made system for distributing power and opportunity , however , we will first have to break up the intellectual monopoly that has been forged over so much political economic policymaking in Washington today .
The generation of political economists who understood the theory and practice of antitrust as devised by the late New Dealers are mostly retired or dead , and the academic economists who today dominate most discussions either have little understanding of the political nature of antimonopoly law or are openly hostile .
That ’s why our first step must be to repopulate our discussions of political economics with the voices of the people who actually make our economy go .
After all , real entrepreneurs and real scientists and real executives and real bankers and real farmers and real software engineers and real venture capitalists tend to understand quite well how real power is used against them .
Just as it is they who know better than anyone else what freedoms they require to go about the task of putting their fellow Americans back to work .
