The final day of the ALP national conference saw protesters demonstrate against the Government over gay marriage and climate change .
Hundreds gathered outside the conference venue at Darling Harbour on Saturday to voice their anger at Labor 's refusal to allow gay marriage , while on the conference floor activists accused the Government of pandering to the coal industry .
Earlier yesterday , the conference passed amendments which supported a system to allow same - sex relationships to be recognised , but opposed gay marriage .
Frontbencher and ALP left faction leader Anthony Albanese said the left would continue to push for change .
Around 80 couples then took part in a mass wedding ceremony in front of the protesters gathered outside the conference .
Matthew Loader from Rainbow Labor said gay marriage supporters had not got what they wanted and told protestors he would continue the fight .
" But this is the beginning of the process and not the end and I know that you 'll be back at the next conference at a bigger rally , " he said .
" I can tell you that Rainbow Labor and all of our friends in the Labor Party will be back here fighting on your behalf . "
During climate change debate on Saturday afternoon , protesters took to the conference floor to make a point about compensation to the coal sector in the Government 's carbon trading scheme .
As Climate Change Minister Penny Wong addressed delegates , 12 protestors with taped mouths stood in front of the stage holding signs that said " silenced by the coal industry " and " no green jobs in coal " .
It is thought the protesters were observers to the conference and not delegates .
Two of the protesters were questioned by police outside the conference centre over whether their passes were fake before being allowed to go .
The Government is under pressure to increase its $ 750 million compensation already offered to the coal industry as part of its carbon trading scheme .
Senator Wong passionately defended the scheme which is headed for defeat in the Senate when Parliament resumes for August sittings .
" We 'll be criticised from all parts from those who say we need to do more and those who oppose any action , " she said .
" We know in this party that the only party in this Government that will actually put policy into place to reduce carbon pollution is the Australian Labor Party . "
The conference wrapped up after three days of mild debate , with all motions agreed to unanimously .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd had a low - key presence , only making an appearance to open the conference and to award former prime minister Bob Hawke lifetime membership to the party .
Industrial relations had threatened to become a flashpoint , but it too was argued out behind the scenes with a motion passed endorsing the eventual end of coercive powers over the construction industry .
Mr Rudd 's announcement that the Government would create 50,000 " green " jobs also came under fire , after Employment Participation Minister Mark Arbib struggled to explain the details of the policy .
Getting Ahead in America
Fall 2009
America 's familiar debate over income inequality conceals and confuses at least as much as it reveals .
To hear most journalists and activists tell the story , our country is the scene of a rampant and long - running economic travesty , as the rich grow richer , the poor grow poorer , and the distance between them belies the promise of America even in times of prosperity .
As President Barack Obama put it during his 2008 campaign : " While some have prospered beyond imagination in this global economy , middle - class Americans as well as those working hard to become middle class are seeing the American Dream slip further and further away . "
Such arguments are generally marshaled in the cause of expanding social - welfare programs aimed at transferring wealth from the rich to the poor , thereby combating both poverty and inequality .
Opponents of such programs have usually not engaged the inequality argument directly , instead contending against the growth of government or pointing to the failure of some welfare programs to achieve their stated aims .
But in so arguing , both sides too often miss the point .
Those enraged by inequality tend to be careless with their statistics , often painting a distorted picture of American life .
Their opponents have accepted these false premises , rejecting only the solutions the outraged wish to pursue .
Both sides ignore the real threat to the American Dream .
That dream , after all , is not about economic equality , but about opportunity and upward mobility about getting ahead .
And for those at the bottom in our society , the challenge of getting ahead is daunting and complicated .
The rich are not the reason that the poor are poor , and the real reasons — which have to do not only with economics but also with culture , history , and especially individual behavior and personal choices — add up to an enormous problem that deserves to stand front and center in our politics .
As we have learned over decades of trying , it is a problem that does not lend itself to easy policy solutions .
But seeing more clearly just how the question of mobility does and does not relate to the equality debate may clarify both the potential and the limits of policy and politics in helping the poor get ahead .
UNDERSTANDING INEQUALITY
On its face , the common tale of economic inequality in America seems clear and simple .
For the past quarter - century , household income has grown substantially for upper - income families , modestly for middle - income families , and even more modestly , if at all , for low - income families .
Figure 1 compares the trends in size - adjusted household incomes at the 95th , the 50th , and the tenth percentiles between 1979 and 2006 .
To emphasize trends , incomes are expressed as percentage changes each year relative to 1979 ( a peak year in the business cycle ) using inflation - adjusted dollars .
The figure shows that those at the tenth percentile increased their income by a paltry 10 % over the last quarter - century ( even after government benefits ) ; those in the middle increased their income by nearly 25 % ; and those at the 95th percentile enjoyed a growth of nearly 50 % .
Further data not shown in the graph leave no doubt that if we moved above the 95th percentile , the percentage growth in income would rise rapidly .
In his popular 2007 book Richistan , Robert Frank reports that by 2004 the top 1 % of Americans earned around $ 1.35 ­trillion a year — a figure greater than the total national incomes of France , Italy , or Germany .
Now consider wage growth .
Earnings are the major source of income in most households , and income from earnings is determined in large part by wages .
Figure 2 shows the trends in real hourly wages since 1979 , using the same percentage - change approach as Figure 1 .
The tenth percentile declined and then rose , but ended up slightly below its starting point a quarter - century earlier .
The middle ended up about 8 % above its 1979 starting point , and the top soared by more than 35 % over the same period .
These results seem to present a straightforward tale of exploding incomes and wages at the top , and struggle and stagnation at the bottom .
But the full story is far less simple , as these common measures of inequality overlook several important considerations .
The first is spending on health care .
As shown by my Brookings Institution colleagues Gary Burtless and Pavel Svaton , medical spending as a share of personal income averaged across all Americans jumped from 7 % in 1960 to 21 % in 2007 .
If medical care were paid for out of the pockets of health - care consumers , the huge growth in health spending would have little or no bearing on income inequality , since it would come out of personal income .
But about 75 % of spending on health care comes from sources other than personal income , namely private insurance mostly paid for by employers and government payments made by Medicaid and Medicare .
In other words , one of the biggest single sources of consumer spending by families — and one that is growing rapidly each year — is ignored in most inequality calculations .
This approach to inequality is roughly equivalent to estimating the size of a city by counting the names in the phone book , but ignoring all names that begin with " R , " " S , " and " T . "
What if we included spending on health care paid for by third parties in our inequality calculations ?
Burtless and Svaton used data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey to explore this question .
Averaged over the 2001 - 2005 period , per-person spending on health care for those under age 65 in the bottom fifth of income was greater than per-person spending on health care for those in the second and middle fifths .
It was only slightly below spending by those in the two richest fifths .
For those over age 65 , whose needs for health care are much greater than the needs of younger people , per-person spending was higher in the bottom fifth than in any other .
How is it possible that people with so little income could spend so much on health care ?
The answer , as we have seen , is that most of the payments for health care are made by third parties .
Indeed , people under age 65 in the bottom 10 % of earners enjoyed third - party payments on health care equal to 65 % of their income .
People in the second tenth enjoyed third - party payments equal to 21 % of their income .
By contrast , people in the top two income tenths had third - party payments equal to 3 % and 2 % of their income , respectively .
For those over age 65 , people in the bottom fifth enjoyed third - party payments equal to an amazing 130 % of their income , while those in the top fifth enjoyed payments equal to only 6 % of their income .
If the cost of health care paid for by third parties were included in the calculation of income , in percentage terms the incomes of families at the bottom of the distribution would get a much bigger boost than incomes at the top of the distribution .
It follows that inequality would fall .
These figures say a lot about the American health - care system , which certainly has its problems .
But government programs — which cover nearly everyone over age 65 and a considerable share of those living in poverty ( including all poor children ) — nearly equalize per-person spending on health care across the income spectrum .
This is a dramatic , albeit expensive , achievement of American social policy .
But the typical account of growing income inequality ignores almost all of this spending .
A second omission in the standard story of income inequality has to do with the limits of the most commonly cited data on the subject .
Most articles on income inequality that appear in professional journals and the media are based on the Census Bureau 's Current Population Survey .
But as Cornell economist Richard Burkhauser has shown , this CPS data has serious problems .
To protect the identities of very high - income participants in the survey , their incomes — estimated in 24 categories , including earnings , investments , capital gains , business income , and gifts — are top - coded .
Under this procedure , income above the top - code level in all 24 categories is scored as equal to the top - code , which leads to a flawed view of income growth at the top of the distribution .
This is especially true when one considers that all analysts who have studied changes in income over the past several decades agree that the big increases take place at the top .
If this growth is poorly measured , calculations of income inequality over time are bound to be unreliable .
Burkhauser and his colleagues gained access to special data from the Census Bureau not generally available to researchers ; they also developed sophisticated statistical techniques to construct a data set that provides an accurate portrayal of income over the entire distribution for the years between 1975 and 2005 .
This more accurate data set yields results that would be quite surprising to the editors of the New York Times , who routinely rail against the rising income inequality shown by CPS data .
A standard measure of inequality employed by Burkhauser and many other researchers is the ratio of income at the 90th percentile of the income distribution to income at the tenth percentile .
If this ratio rises over time , we can conclude that inequality has increased .
Burkhauser finds that the 90 / 10 measure of inequality increased nearly 25 % during the 1980s , declined by 7 % during the 1990s , and was more or less flat in the first five years of the 2000s .
By another standard measure of income — the Gini coefficient that measures changes along the entire income distribution — income inequality increased by about 15 % in the 1980s , fell by over 2 % in the 1990s , and held steady between 2000 and 2005 .
An especially notable feature of Burkhauser 's work — and one that many inequality researchers have yet to acknowledge — is that , since about 1990 , the entire income distribution has shifted up .
In other words , incomes all along the distribution , including the bottom , grew .
If Burkhauser is correct — and no one has yet shown his improved data to be flawed — claims about increased income inequality since 1990 based on the CPS are exaggerated .
Relative changes in the prices paid for consumer goods by the poor and rich provide yet a third caveat to the standard inequality story .
Consumption is a more direct measure of well - being than income : A family with a modest income might use some of it to purchase jewelry and lottery tickets , while another family with the same income buys food , makes a house payment , and saves a little .
Judging solely on the basis of income would lead us to believe that the two families are equally well off .
But examining the consumption patterns of the two families produces a different picture .
Christian Broda and John Romalis of the University of Chicago have shown that the prices of goods purchased by the poor have increased much more slowly than the prices of goods purchased by the rich ( and , in some cases , have even fallen ) .
Using data on purchases of food , durable goods , and nearly every other consumer item by a representative sample of American households , Broda and Romalis found that , between 1994 and 2005 , the consumer basket - adjusted income of households at the tenth percentile increased 18 % , while adjusted income at the 90th percentile increased 17 % .
They show similar results for food purchased away from home .
Broda and Romalis estimate that 20 % of the relatively inexpensive consumer items purchased by the bottom fifth of households ( often at big - box stores like Wal - Mart ) come from China , while only 5 % of such items purchased by households in the top income fifth do .
Free trade does a lot to compensate for the growth in inequality caused by trends in wages and incomes , and goods from China play an especially important role in helping the poor enjoy a higher standard of living than they would if their choices in consumer goods were more restricted .
Broda and his colleague David Weinstein show , for example , that the types of consumer goods increasingly imported from China exhibit steeper price declines , and that the poor purchase more of these goods .
As a result , consumer goods from China — and the free trade that brings them to the United States — help poor households more than rich households .
The seemingly straightforward story of income inequality therefore turns out not to be so simple .
It is a tale of subtle hues , not stark contrasts , and some of the most basic claims thrown around in the media turn out to be rather dubious .
This does not mean that inequality has not been growing , or is unimportant .
But it does suggest that our approach to the plight of the poor ought not to be rooted in the familiar story of inequality — as that story is not entirely accurate , and is not the most important facet of poverty and opportunity in America .
Whatever the relative position of the poor in America compared to the wealthy , their plight should draw our attention on its own terms .
Whether their situation improves as quickly as that of the wealthy or not , we ought to find policies that enable those at the bottom to rise .
Unfortunately , the inequality debate is more often a distraction from that challenge than an appropriate path toward
solving it .
GETTING AHEAD
Polls show that when it comes to measuring fairness , income inequality has long been less important to the American public than economic mobility .
What matters is not how you compare to others , but whether you have a chance to improve your own circumstances .
Using a powerful data set built by researchers at the University of Michigan over more than four decades , my Brookings colleagues Isabel Sawhill and Julia Isaacs and I have examined American economic mobility in great detail .
The Michigan data set includes mostly annual data on employment , income , family composition , education , and many other measures of a set of 5,000 families who have been participating over the entire four decades .
As they left home and formed their own families , children of the original 5,000 families were followed through childhood and into adulthood .
Most of the analyses of income mobility compared the incomes of nearly 2,400 individuals who were younger than 18 in 1968 with the incomes of their parents .
The average age of parents was about 41 at the time the income data was collected ; adult children ranged in age from 27 to 52 .
All incomes are adjusted for inflation and expressed in 2006 dollars .
Figure 3 shows the income of the parent generation divided into five groups of equal size from lowest to highest on the horizontal axis of the figure .
The sections within each set of bar graphs provide the income levels achieved by the children of parents in each fifth of the income scale .
The set of five bar graphs on the left is for children who did not earn a four - year college degree ; the set on the right is for those who did .
The figure illustrates several of the most salient characteristics of income mobility in America .
Even among those without a college degree , we see considerable movement between income fifths .
Nearly 30 % of children from families in the middle fifth moved up to the fourth or top fifths as adults .
About one - quarter of them stayed in the middle fifth , but the remaining half fell to the bottom two fifths .
The bar graphs that show the fortunes of those who obtained a four - year degree reveal perhaps the most important generalization to emerge from this analysis of mobility :
The effects of a college education are pervasive , regardless of family background .
Children from the bottom fifth can greatly increase their chances of making it out of the bottom as adults — from 55 % to 84 % — if they obtain a four - year degree .
Similarly , with a degree they can nearly quadruple — from 5 % to 19 % — their chances of making it all the way to the top fifth .
A college degree is equally powerful for those at the top : 75 % of children from the next - to - the - top fifth , and 81 % of children from the top fifth , can stay in the top two fifths as adults by obtaining a college degree .
If they do n't get a college degree , their chances of remaining in the top two fifths plummet to 47 % and 43 % respectively .
These striking findings on the effects of a college degree — combined with the fact that the federal government , state governments , and the private sector provide generous support for student aid for the disadvantaged ( totaling about $ 162 billion in grants , loans , and tax breaks in 2008 ) — illustrate the best approach to boosting opportunity : personal effort , bolstered by public and private support .
These data lead to the conclusion that mobility is alive and well in America .
Although family background continues to exert a powerful influence , there is considerable movement both up and down the income distribution .
Even more to the point for our purposes , individuals can greatly influence where they wind up by working hard and getting a college degree .
A vital characteristic of mobility in America is that effort pays .
But there is still room for improvement .
Compared to other countries , for instance , mobility in America is surprisingly low .
Americans tend to think they have more opportunity and mobility than citizens of other nations :
As shown by the International Social Survey Program conducted in 27 countries between 1998 and 2001 , Americans believe more than the citizens of most other countries that they are rewarded for effort , that family background is not a major barrier to mobility , that income inequality is not too large , and that individuals rather than governments bear the major responsibility for reducing differences in income .
But the American belief that opportunity is greatest in the United States is out of line with the facts .
Miles Corak of the University of Ottawa surveyed all published studies of international comparisons of father - son income correlations and determined that the highest correlations were found in the United States and the United Kingdom .
France , Germany , and Sweden were a step below , while Canada , Finland , Norway , and Denmark had still smaller correlations .
All four countries in this last group had a father - son income correlation well less than half the level of the U.S. and U.K .
If the incomes of sons are more similar to those of their fathers in the U.S. than in other industrialized countries , the implication is that we have less rather than more economic mobility .
The apple is falling closer to the tree in America than in other nations .
Markus Jäntti and his colleagues from Finland 's Abo Akademi University replicated Corak 's findings , using data from the U.S. , Finland , Norway , Sweden , and the U.K .
The team also came across a discovery that gives pause to anyone concerned with the income mobility of poor males in the United States .
Across all nations , there was a tendency for correlations to be " sticky " at the top and bottom .
In other words , father - son income correlations tend to be higher between rich fathers and their sons , and between poor fathers and their sons , than they are between fathers and sons in the middle of the income distribution .
But the stickiness was stickier in the U.S. : Young American men from families in the bottom fifth of income had a greater likelihood ( 42 % ) of ending up in the bottom fifth themselves than did males from the five European nations ( between 25 and 30 % ) .
Similarly , whereas only 8 % of U.S. males from the bottom made it all the way to the top , males in the European nations had an 11 to 14 % chance of reaching the top .
The quality and breadth of these studies , plus the consistency of findings , lead to the conclusion that the U.S. has less income mobility than other industrialized nations .
Nonetheless , America is the world 's leading destination for opportunity - seeking immigrants .
For over a decade , around 1.5 million immigrants have entered the U.S. each year , perhaps a third of them illegally .
The home countries of these immigrants have shifted from primarily European to primarily South American and Asian nations over the past several decades .
Simultaneously , the number of immigrants with less education than the average American has increased substantially .
Thus , although many immigrants with advanced degrees and highly marketable skills come to the U.S. , the average wage of immigrants relative to the average wage of native workers has been declining for more than half a century .
Economists disagree about whether poorly educated immigrants have an impact on the wages of native workers at the bottom of the distribution ; they do not disagree , however , that immigrants with less education greatly increase their economic mobility by coming to the United States .
In fact , as Robert Lerman of the Urban Institute has shown , the openness of America 's borders tends to promote the economic mobility of immigrants while reducing summary measures of economic mobility for America as a whole .
It is easy enough to see why .
Consider an immigrant from Mexico with a fifth - grade education .
If he stays in Mexico , he might earn the equivalent of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 a year ( if he can even find a job ) .
But in the U.S. he can easily find a job that pays $ 9 per hour and work full - time to earn around $ 19,000 a year .
In the surveys used to measure income mobility in the U.S. , the amount he could earn or actually did earn in Mexico is not included in the calculation , but his low wage working in the United States is .
And because there are so many others like this immigrant , as Lerman shows convincingly , measures of U.S. economic mobility would be boosted if their actual or potential income in Mexico were included in the calculation .
American citizens might not be impressed by this argument , but America certainly provides great opportunity for the economic advancement of poorly - educated immigrants , not to mention their children — who , on average , greatly surpass the income of their immigrant parents .
Even more than comparisons with other countries , comparisons with historical measures of America 's own economic mobility can help us trace the state of economic mobility and opportunity .
Americans seem to think that economic mobility is declining : Only 41 % said in 2008 that they were better off than they were five years before — fewer than at any time in a half - century , according to Gregory Acs and Seth Zimmerman of the Urban Institute .
But using the same Michigan data set described above , Acs and Zimmerman compared trends in mobility during the 1984 -1994 period with trends during the 1994 - 2004 period .
They found that 60 % of those 25 to 44 years old moved up or down across income fifths in both periods .
Nor did the stickiness of the bottom fifth increase : During both periods , a little over half of those studied moved out of the bottom fifth .
Based on the best available data , then , there is no evidence that mobility has declined since the early 1980s .
But if things have not gotten worse , they have not gotten much better either , despite decades of enormous effort and expense by private and charitable enterprises and especially by government at every level .
The scale of government investment in the alleviation of poverty and the promotion of economic mobility is extraordinary .
The best information about means - tested anti-poverty spending by states and the federal government is a study done periodically by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service .
The most recent report provides detailed data for 1968 through 2004 , and shows that during that period annual state and federal spending on anti-poverty programs increased from $ 89 billion to nearly $ 600 billion ( in inflation - adjusted dollars ) .
Simple calculations based on these numbers show that whether measured on a per capita basis , as a percent of federal spending , or even as a percent of gross domestic product , means - tested spending has grown since the War on Poverty began in the mid-1960s .
And the CRS estimate , of course , includes neither the dramatic increase in spending already taking place under the stimulus bill enacted in February 2009 , nor the additional increases called for under President Obama 's proposed 2010 budget .
We can gain an even better understanding of the federal commitment to promoting economic mobility by focusing on the specific programs that are designed for this purpose .
Adam Carasso , Gillian Reynolds , and Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute found that in 2006 , the federal government spent $ 746 billion — or 5.7 % of GDP — promoting economic mobility .
The bulk of this money , of course , comes from income taxes .
And who pays the income taxes ?
According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office , in 2006 the top 5 % of earners paid almost 60 % of federal income taxes and nearly 75 % of corporate taxes .
By contrast , the bottom 40 % of earners paid negative taxes ; the Internal Revenue Service sent them payments equal to around 2 % of their income .
The size and scope of federal spending on programs to boost economic mobility , paid for disproportionately by the rich , helps us to see that the current system — again in contrast to the common ­perception — is structurally designed to help the poor .
But many years of evaluation studies show that most of these programs produce modest , if any , lasting impacts on participants .
The effect of government assistance , in short , is not proportional to its scope and scale .
Even so , the decades of data on which programs work and which do not allow us to sketch out a realistic public - policy agenda to aid economic mobility in America — provided we understand that the ability of government to change the underlying circumstances will always be limited , because economic mobility is constrained above all by personal choices and behaviors .
Indeed , we need more public polices that are designed to provide incentives for individuals to make choices that will promote their own development and boost their own income .
THE OPPORTUNITY AGENDA
What , then , should policymakers do to help spur economic mobility in America ?
In our recently completed book , Creating an Opportunity Society , my Brookings colleague Isabel Sawhill and I argue that the latest data and analyses of this vexed question point to a familiar answer : that the best way to increase opportunity is to encourage strong families , more education , and full - time work .
To begin with , society — from parents and teachers to celebrities and political figures — should send a clear and consistent message of personal responsibility to children .
They should herald the " success sequence " : finish schooling , get a job , get married , have babies .
Census data show that if all Americans finished high school , worked full time at whatever job they then qualified for with their education , and married at the same rate as Americans had married in 1970 , the poverty rate would be cut by around 70 % — without additional government spending .
No welfare program , however amply funded , could ever hope for anything approaching such success .
Indeed , what distinguishes successful government programs to aid economic mobility is not how much money they spend , but how they approach the problem .
Three strategies seem especially worthwhile .
The first is arguably the most effective approach the nation has yet devised for reducing poverty : bringing poor mothers into the mainstream economy and supplementing their earnings .
The 1996 ­welfare - reform law has been highly successful in this regard ; despite the relatively low wages of the women involved , employment has substantially increased their income .
The reason is that welfare reform actually had two components : the widely known work requirements that bring mothers into the labor force , and the lesser - known work - support system that subsidizes all low - income workers , especially parents .
This combination not only got between a million and a million and a half single mothers — most of whom would otherwise have been on welfare — to find jobs , but also drove down the poverty rate of female - headed ­families to its lowest level ever .
The black child - poverty rate also reached its historical low , and even after the 2000 recession , child poverty was still about 20 % lower than before the 1996 overhaul .
Our strategy now should be to expand both components of the 1996 reforms .
Specifically , serious work requirements should be built into the food stamp program ( the program 's current work requirements are ineffective ) and housing programs to get still more poor people into the work force .
Once they arrive , they should find an expanded work - support system — especially additional funding for child care , and an expanded cash income supplement ( through the Earned Income Tax Credit ) for full - time workers who do not have custody of children .
These reforms would bring more people — including young males — into the labor force and show them that they can improve their income even through low - wage work .
The cost to taxpayers would be partially offset by increased tax revenue and reduced dependence on welfare benefits by those involved .
And this approach would be consistent with the goal of requiring more responsible behavior by individuals and rewarding them if they do the right thing .
It builds on the most successful policy innovation of the past several decades to further the cause of economic mobility , and uses government to encourage rather than undermine individual responsibility .
The second strategy is directed at the growth and development of poor children .
It is widely accepted that high - quality pre-school ­programs can have lasting effects on child development — including children 's school readiness , high - school graduation , delinquency and crime , earnings , and a range of other outcomes .
The problem is that most of the evidence for long - term results comes from experimental , small - scale programs .
Only weak evidence supports the claim that Head Start — a broad - scale program that serves 900,000 children — produces these types of long - term outcomes .
Even so , states and localities are now using both federal and state dollars to develop large - scale quality pre-school programs .
We should embrace this growing movement by providing states with greater control of Head Start funding ( now about $ 7 billion per year ) if they agree to serve all pre-school children below around 150 % of poverty , and agree to allow parents to select from a variety of programs .
States should provide home - visiting programs to the small number of infants who are at great risk of poor development as indicated by family violence , child - abuse reports , parental drug addiction , or parents living in deep and persistent poverty .
To receive federal funding , programs should include frequent testing of child outcomes , and improve these outcomes based on the results of testing .
Programs must also test students when they enter kindergarten , with federal funds going only to programs that can demonstrate school readiness for most students from poor families .
The third strategy is to do everything possible to increase the share of children being reared by their married parents .
Good studies have linked lone parenting ( or the shock of transitions between family living arrangements ) with poor education outcomes , delinquency and crime , mental - health problems , lower labor - force participation , and a host of other bad outcomes for children .
Unfortunately , Americans have perfected every known way of producing lone - parent families ; we are especially good at having babies outside marriage , boosting their share of all births from about 5 % in 1960 to nearly 40 % in 2006 .
We also still have the highest divorce rate among Western nations .
As a result , nearly 30 % of our children live in lone - parent families at any given moment , and nearly half spend time living apart from at least one of their parents before age 18 .
Among black children , about 70 % are born outside marriage and up to 80 % live in a lone - parent family sometime during childhood ( many for virtually their entire childhood ) .
In 2007 , the poverty rate for lone - parent families was over 28 % , nearly six times the rate for married - couple families .
Research shows that if we had the same share of children living in married - couple families as we had in 1970 , poverty would decline by almost 30 % without any additional government spending .
The growth of female - headed families is like a giant poverty - generating machine .
Even if government programs to reduce poverty become more effective , they would have an increasingly difficult time just offsetting the powerful upward push on child poverty caused by the continuing growth of lone parenting .
It is popular to argue that we could not roll back the causes underlying these trends even if we wanted to .
But given the implications , we should not accept defeat on marriage and two - parent families .
One way to push back is by reducing teen pregnancy and unwed pregnancy , because women who have babies outside marriage reduce their chances of ever forming a marital bond .
Programs for adolescents that teach about reproduction , emphasize the value of abstinence , examine the values that surround teen sex , offer information about contraception , teach skills in avoiding unwanted sexual advances by partners , provide mentoring by adults , and encourage participation in community activities have been shown frequently and reliably to reduce teen pregnancy .
( So far , there is not comparable evidence for abstinence - only programs . )
Unfortunately , there are almost no programs that have been shown to reduce pregnancy among unmarried twenty - somethings , a group that has grown rapidly because both males and females are now delaying marriage until later ages .
Twenty - somethings have filled the marriage void with huge increases in rates of cohabitation and other non-marital relationships , which lead to equally huge increases in the frequency of sex outside marriage .
Pregnancy for many of these couples is therefore all but inevitable , and perhaps the best policy goal with this group is to emphasize systematic use of birth control .
For example , research shows that making birth control available through the Medicaid program significantly reduces non-marital births .
Indeed , the Congressional Budget Office has recently calculated that increased spending on Medicaid to provide family planning to low - income females who are somewhat above the normal Medicaid income requirements actually saves money .
Of course , an even more direct means of ensuring that more children live with their married parents is to increase marriage rates — which have plummeted in the last three decades .
Although college - educated women still marry at high rates ( though later in life ) and are much less likely to have babies outside of marriage , marriage is rapidly declining among the poor and minorities .
The 1996 welfare - reform law allowed states to use welfare funds to mount pro-marriage initiatives , but few states did more than create token programs .
That 's why George W. Bush , upon becoming president in 2001 , mounted a vigorous campaign to support the fledgling marriage movement .
His administration began awarding discretionary grants to a wide range of activities to strengthen couple relationships ; funded community - wide pro-marriage initiatives that included media campaigns and divorce - reduction programs ; and eventually began a $ 100 million competitive grant program to promote marriage while also funding a National Healthy Marriage Resource Center to provide technical assistance to the grantees .
His administration also launched a series of large - scale studies on the effect that marriage - education programs have on poor unmarried couples who had ( or were about to have ) a baby , as well as on poor married couples with children .
These studies , the first of their type to be conducted with poor couples , will begin reporting results in 2010 .
Based on these studies , we will know for the first time whether structured programs that teach such skills as managing finances , handling conflict , avoiding family violence , and showing love and affection can lead to increased marriage rates , reduced rates of separation and divorce , and improved well - being of poor children .
If so , broader use of these programs is warranted .
President Obama himself , in his book The Audacity of Hope , expressed his support for such programs .
BEYOND INEQUALITY
Taken together , these proposals make the point that although there is room for government to help advance the cause of economic mobility in America , it can do so mostly by encouraging personal responsibility .
Poverty in America is a function of culture and behavior at least as much as of entrenched injustice , and economic mobility calls not for wealth - transfer programs but for efforts that support and uphold the cultural institutions that have always enabled prosperity : education , work , marriage , and responsible child - rearing .
Thus , the inequality debate is not nearly as relevant to the more important question of mobility as it sometimes seems to many advocates and politicians .
Inequality is a cloudy lens through which to understand the problems of poverty and mobility , and it does not point toward solutions .
Great wealth is not a social problem ; great poverty is .
And great wealth neither causes poverty nor can readily alleviate it .
Only by properly targeting poverty , and by understanding its social , cultural , and moral dimensions , can well - intentioned policymakers hope to make a dent in American poverty — and thereby advance mobility and sustain the American Dream .
Stephen Farrell , a reporter for The New York Times , and Sultan M. Munadi , an Afghan journalist working with him , were kidnapped by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan on Saturday .
In a British raid to free them early Wednesday , Mr. Munadi was killed , as was a British soldier who has not been identified .
This is Mr. Farrell ’s account of the four - day ordeal .
Mid -to - late morning on Friday , Sept. 4 , we in the Kabul bureau began hearing reports of an explosion in a Taliban - controlled area near the northern city of Kunduz .
It was clear that this was going to be a major controversy , involving allegations of civilian deaths against NATO claims that the dead were Taliban .
Furthermore , it was in an area that was becoming increasingly newsworthy because it was becoming more troubled by insurgents .
My colleague Rich Oppel and I began discussing the story , and I forewarned the Afghan staff that they should at least begin thinking about logistics for a possible drive north , for a decision to be taken later .
The drivers made a few phone calls and said the road north appeared to be safe until mid- to late afternoon .
It was close to the cut - off point , but if we left immediately we could do it .
We left within minutes .
En route , I called in to the bureau to check with Rich on how the story was developing .
He said the Kunduz police were saying that there were only adult male patients at the main hospital in Kunduz , leaving it unclear whether they were civilians or Taliban .
We saw that the highway we were on was going to pass through Ali Abad , a village near the location of the blast .

We decided not to stop and made straight for the hospital .
But after we passed through Ali Abad , Sultan saw a man walking along the road , and suggested we offer him a lift and talk to him as we drove .
We did but he was unhelpful beyond generally proffering local rumors .
A few miles farther on , we ran into a fortified police checkpoint .
Sultan began talking to the police and gleaned the exact location of the tanker blast , the substance of the story and that it was not safe to go off the main highway to the site , which we had no intention of doing that late anyway .
We went directly to the hospital , which was crowded with patients , doctors , journalists — including one Western woman from Reuters news agency — and International Committee of the Red Cross officials .
The reactions to us were very benign .
We took extensive notes and interviews with two patients including a young boy of 10 who said he was injured in the blast , and went straight to the hotel in Kunduz to spend the night .
The hotel had armed guards .
While there I spoke to a Western journalist from Al Jazeera English , who said he had been to , or near , the scene in the afternoon , but that he had not felt safe to go into the villages .
On Saturday , Sept. 5 , I woke up in Kunduz to begin the second day of reporting .
We did what we had not dared do at such a late hour on Friday .
We drove south of Kunduz along the main Kabul highway until we reached the turnoff .
I checked with Sultan and the driver to see if they felt safe going there , and they said it seemed all right .
We edged along a narrow country lane and came out on the riverbank with the tankers a few hundred yards ahead .
We did not go up to the tankers themselves , which were stranded in the middle of the river , but stayed on the towpath .
I briefly filmed the vehicles while Sultan and the driver spoke to Afghans beneath a tree , dividing the duties to save time .
I then rejoined Sultan and the driver and we began interviewing an Afghan beneath the tree , getting his account of what happened .
He said that the Taliban — he later amended it to ” armed men ” — had stolen the tanker , failed to drive it across the river and then commanded residents of nearby villages to bring tractors to help ferry away the load .
Word quickly spread , according to the witness — supporting the evidence from the hospital the night before — and many ran to the site with jerrycans , eager for free fuel in an impoverished area .
As the interviewee spoke I was checking with Sultan and he seemed relaxed : there was no sign of hostility from the crowd , only faces eager to tell a story .
A crowd began to gather , time passed and we grew nervous .
I do not know how long we were there , but it was uncomfortably long .
I am comfortable with the decision to go to the riverbank , but fear we spent too long there .
I said , “ We should go , ” almost exactly as Sultan said the same thing .
An old man said we should not tarry .
The driver went to the car .
Even as we were carrying our gear bags to the car , villagers shouted , “ Taliban , ” and scattered away from the river .
Our driver fled , with the keys .
His instincts were immaculate — he survived .
Sultan and I fled a shorter distance , stopped and tried to gauge where we were running , and from whom .
Should we stay and hope they did not cross the river toward us , or flee straight across unknown fields and run the risk of being cut down by Taliban in the field ahead of us , shooting at anything that moved ?
We hovered , and got caught .
The first one to wade across the river hit Sultan with his Kalashnikov and began shouting at him .
Then he appeared to calm down , pointed at the car and toward the main road , seemingly ordering us to leave .
We could not , because we did not have the keys .
He could not understand why we refused to comply , and became enraged again .
Other Taliban arrived and forced us to wade across the river to the far bank at gunpoint .
There was no point trying to resist , Sultan advised , just go with them .
I was still carrying my camera equipment and was thinking that at least we had interviews with civilians talking about civilian casualties , which should establish our credentials as journalists who were drawing attention to a controversial NATO strike .
This later proved very useful to demonstrate who we were and what we were doing .
I reached the other side of the river and was immediately bound , my hands behind my back , and blindfolded , very badly .
One Talib drove off with me on a motorcycle at high speed , crashing at one point as we overbalanced .
Sultan followed behind .
Once away from immediate pursuit , they transferred me to a waiting car and drove into the dusty back roads of Char Dara District at high speed .
“ Russian ? ” one asked me , a question that seemed so out of recent historical context that it made my heart sink .
They unloaded me at a tree and began questioning me , but not in a hostile manner .
After half an hour of questions , they summoned more Taliban and drove me back to where Sultan was being held .
From that moment on we were not separated .
Apart from the initial swing of the rifle at Sultan right at the outset , neither of us was subjected to any beatings , torture or ill - treatment over the next four days .
Quite the reverse — they offered food and water to me even though it was during the Ramadan fast ( apart from the first drink at a time when I had been running and fallen off the motorcycle , I declined during the fasting period ) .
Sultan repeatedly prayed alongside them .
For four days they drove us around Char Dara , almost always in the same old Toyota Corolla , sometimes with masked and turbaned motorcycle outriders , rocket - propelled grenades sticking out of backpacks in full daylight , just a few miles from the main Kabul - to - Kunduz road .
They delighted in showing off , at one point driving within 500 meters of what they said were government and NATO watchtowers — gleeful at their daring , at others they drove with headlights full on at night as they moved us from house to house , at least three different buildings a day .
It became a tour of a Taliban - controlled district of Afghanistan , and that control appeared total .
At no point did we see a single NATO soldier , Afghan policeman , soldier or any check to the Taliban ’s ability to move at will .
We did see two green Afghan police pickup trucks , both full of Taliban fighters and weapons .
“ This is our jail , ” went the running commentary .
“ This is the checkpoint where we expelled the government forces . ”
It felt like a military embed with the American military , except at gunpoint .
“ You spend enough time with the Americans , you should spend some time with us , ” one of the Taliban said , making the comparison explicit .
In fact I had not spent any time with the American military in Afghanistan , but it seemed unwise to correct him .
There was no doubting the absolute force of their writ in the area southwest of Kunduz , which we traversed time and again , in an area of cornfields , rice plantations , mud brick villages , waterways and other farmlands , measuring perhaps eight miles long by three or four miles wide .
They drove down lanes , through villages , stopping at will and talking to residents , boasting about how the people provided a willing intelligence service to them .
The extent of volition was impossible to determine , but the Taliban were the only armed presence I saw there for four days .
Interestingly , they paid when they needed gas for the car , instead of just commandeering it , which they could have easily done .
Some villagers appeared very friendly , others more wary and formally polite .
Motorists unfailingly gave way as soon as they saw a Taliban car coming in the other direction , and snapped to a smile and an Islamic greeting .
Whether through consent or fear was impossible to read on the faces of villages who were rarely allowed glimpses of us , except at favored stops and safe houses .
Then we were paraded to the children in the street : the infidel and his translator , to be laughed at and mocked .
At first they seemed seamlessly efficient — teams of motorcycle riders would come from nowhere , ushering us to our next destination , where we would quickly be guided — not pushed — into a room out of the sight of prying electronic eyes above .
The teams changed — the captor team gave way to the guard team .
“ We are just looking after you , ” one Talib said , bored by yet another attempt to convince him of our credentials as journalists .
“ The people who captured you , they are checking out whether you are journalists , and independent journalists . ”
That was a crucial distinction , Sultan impressed upon me .
They seemed to believe we were genuine , not least from their repeated satisfied “ aahs ” when we played and replayed the video of the tankers , and of a NATO armored car they claimed to have destroyed some days earlier .
But their elders remained to be convinced .
There were good hours , and bad ones .
Progress and setbacks .
They reported to Sultan that their elders — the word “ commandant ” was used frequently — thought that we were “ not security people so are to be treated well . ”
But then our status as journalists was called into question again , and it became an endless series of assurances and reassurances .
They allowed Sultan to talk to his mother and father , which was encouraging , but on the second day Sultan picked up that they might be seeking money , and on Day 3 an exchange of prisoners .
He became glum at this , especially so when two Taliban told him that while they were confident that an exchange could be arranged for me , not so for him .
They offered no evidence of this , or any of the welter of conflicting claims we heard .
Indeed , they appeared sometimes to be playing with our heads .
“ You , three days , Kabul , ” one said to me , smiling .
And he was the least likely smiler and encourager I had met of the entire crews .
Another said 10 to 15 days .
It was impossible to read motives behind words .
“ Do you know anyone in the government , you should get them to work on this , ” one relatively friendly Talib told Sultan early on the final day .
Another reminded him that an Italian journalist had once been exchanged , but his translator was not so fortunate .
“ He was beheaded , ” the unsmiling youngster said , to Sultan ’s face .
He translated it , faithfully but with a gray face .
Our guards , usually six or eight in number , were hugely unpredictable .
One became enraged when I urinated standing up , deeming it an offense to local families .
He then calmed down and asked me to teach him how to count to 10 in English .
Another kept trying to convert me to Islam , amid endless conversations with Sultan about Islam , working with Americans and his job .
When they bundled us into cars , they would sit with half a dozen rocket - propelled grenades bouncing around inside the car down rutted country lanes , or Kalashnikovs pointing at our , or their own , heads .
As the days wore on they seemed to be more relaxed with me , more verbally sharp to Sultan .
( One Talib apologized for that blow to Sultan in the first minute , saying they could not always get good quality people . )
As Day 2 passed into 3 , amid a blur of different houses and days spent sleeping , hoping and worrying , the mood changed .
It became harder for them to find safe houses .
They would get lost down ever narrower and ever more obscure country lanes .
We would arrive at a building late at night , bang on the gate and eventually be admitted — never knowing if the Taliban had just picked on a house at random and demanded entrance or arranged it in advance .
Although their discipline was good in their conduct toward us , their operational security was hopelessly inept .
So much so that the supposed team leader would be bellowing my name and the word “ journalist ” repeatedly into his Nokia cellphone — they all had Nokias operating on almost no battery life and no reception — heedless of who was , almost certainly , monitoring the calls .
From the car ’s cassette recorder blared the words “ Taliban , Taliban ” in song .
They were not making it hard .
By Day 2 or 3 , new characters emerged .
One very scary , powerfully built Talib , who seemed to inspire awe among his underlings , sat staring at us , saying almost nothing .
When they finally found a house with electricity , two youngsters produced a tape recorder and began blaring hours of religious sermons , praising Osama bin Laden , the mujahedeen of Chechnya , Somalia , Helmand , Kandahar and anyone fighting the Americans .
The repeated mention of prominent extremist groups and individuals , such as Hizb - i - Islami and Abdul Rasul Sayyaf did nothing to ease our fears about being handed over to other Taliban or Qaeda groups .
We also began hearing the word “ Baghlan ” shouted into cellphones , a town and province south of Kunduz .
This made me nervous as I felt that these Talibs were strictly local , and operated only within their own comfort zone of these few square miles .
Transferring us to another area could not be good .
The hectoring and attempts at converting me accelerated , and the demands to know why I would not convert , what I thought of the Prophet Muhammad , and so on .
One , named Amman , said he wanted me to invite him to my home country of Ireland — I have dual Irish / British nationality — to start jihad .
He at least appeared to be doing so out of a genuine conviction that it was his duty to bring me to Islam , occasionally tossing me cinnamon candies during the fasting period , which I declined to eat during the day .
Others were harsher in tone .
On the third night , just before the 3 a.m. meal —
Muslims breakfast very early to comply with the Ramadan daytime fast — there was a scare .
Aerial activity intensified , and there were loud explosions in nearby fields .
We , and the Taliban , took this as an attempt to free us .
They fled with us in minutes , racing across open fields in the dark until they found another refuge .
From that point I noticed that the “ A team ” of hardened Taliban fighters disappeared , leaving only youths .
On the fourth day , there was more indoctrination and more racing around homes .
But the level of planning had fallen away dramatically , which was alarming .
They appeared to be going farther and farther afield to find safe houses ; the meals dwindled to just bread and butter instead of the feasts of grapes , fish , meat and sweets on earlier days , and the dirt tracks they were using were almost impassable .
When we finally arrived at the house where we were to spend the fourth , and last , night , Sultan and I were left alone in the car for a rare two minutes .
I warned him that if there was to be a rescue , it might well be tonight , because the moon was much fainter than the two previous nights , and clearly something had been happening in the air the night before .
He was trying to be upbeat , but was increasingly despondent about his own chances .
We waited , and half - slept .
The noise of the spotter drones overhead intensified , turned into a louder buzz , then multiple engine noises , rotors , and then gunshots and explosions .
The half - dozen or so Taliban in the room rolled from their mattresses , snatched up their rocket - propelled grenades and ran from the room .
We absolutely expected them to cut us down as they ran .
We were crouching targets in a long , narrow room devoid of anything but walls and matting .
We were no longer of any use to them , and belonged to their hated enemy who had manifestly just arrived and presented a far harder target than we did .
The last Talib out of the room turned round , his Kalashnikov rising and falling with hesitation .
It was the half - smiling , half - scowling Talib with whom we had bonded the most — the one I had taught to count to 10 in English .
He had looked bewildered on Day 2 as I could n’t suppress laughter when he played me the English language option on his cellphone menu : “ Press 6 for Help .
Press 7 for Exit . ”
He had second thoughts and , in the final analysis , lack of conviction .
It would have delayed him half a second to cut us in two .
Even if he had n’t thought about it , our behavior was making it clear we had .
I grabbed the thickest cushion I could find and , more substantively , the torso - sized sized camera bag onto which I had been holding for four days for — in part — precisely this outcome .
It was filled with metal , hard plastic , mini-tripods and a metal camera light .
I hid behind the cushion and bag , and Sultan hid behind me .
The Talib jerked his head for us to follow , and left .
We had no intention of running out of a room and then a courtyard with a group of rocket - carrying Taliban into an oncoming American — we wrongly assumed — raid .
Once the Taliban had gone , we ran to the door , Sultan ahead of me because I had to pick up the camera bag and put on Western sneakers , which takes more time than sliding into Afghan flip - flops .
I lost him .
Inside the courtyard I was merely a lone sitting target in a slightly larger enclosed space , so I ducked and ran out the gate .
Someone loomed out of the dark .
I lost my balance and fell back , my leg still somewhat impaired from the motorcycle accident .
It was Sultan , in the last minute of his life .
He held out a hand , steadied me and asked if I had my contact lenses in , which I had .
With him already in front we crouch - ran along a very narrow ledge of earth — less than a foot wide — along the outer wall of the compound .
It was dark .
There were trees to our left and a high mud -brick wall to our right .
We could see nothing more than a few feet in front of us .
We had no idea who was where , and there were bullets flying through the air .
I could hear Taliban voices shouting and shooting from trees to our left , I thought .
I could also hear indistinct voices ahead .
We continued 20 yards along the wall until it suddenly reached the corner .
With the still indistinct voices ahead — but I do not know what Sultan could see or hear — he carried straight on beyond the corner of the wall , bringing him out into the open .
Wearing the same pale salwar kameez he had worn for four days he raised his hands and shouted , “ Journaliste , journaliste , ” even as he stepped out .
It was accented , in exactly the same way he had used 1,000 times in four days talking to the Taliban .
In the dark I could not see around him to discover who he was trying to reassure : the troops that he was n’t Taliban , or the Taliban that he was n’t a soldier .
There was a burst of gunfire and he went down immediately .
In the dark , with firing all around , trees everywhere and my view obscured by him and the wall , I did not know whether the bullets came from in front , to his right or to his left .
I had already reared back at the sound of gunfire and dived into a two - foot deep ditch with water at the bottom .
I dragged out the camera light to flash it if necessary .
I could hear a blur of voices , but could still not make out the direction from which they came .
I waited a minute or two , raising my head , turning it left and right to get a better sense of what they were , and where they were coming from .
Vague sounds coalesced into northern British vowels .
One voice was urging someone to get a ladder up over the wall and into the compound we had just left .
Pressing my face down as low as I could I screamed , “ British hostage , British hostage , ” and flashed the light once , very briefly to tell them the direction .
I heard a voice saying something like : “ British hostage approach me with your hands in the air and lie down on the ground . ”
I complied , dropping the camera bag and all its contents .
While I wanted to keep my equipment , emerging suddenly from the dark carrying a bag seemed an insane risk .
I lay on the ground , gave my name and newspaper and pointed to where Sultan was lying behind me , telling them I thought he had been shot .
The body was lying motionless in the ditch where I had seen him go down .
I hoped he had dropped and was lying still .
I knew it was n’t the case .
They told me they had his picture and would look for him , then dragged me away past the house across a rutted field and toward the helicopter landing zone .
It was over .
Sultan was dead .
He had died trying to help me , right up to the very last seconds of his life .
There were some celebrations among the mainly British soldiers on the aircraft home , which soon fell silent .
It later emerged that one of the rescue party was also dead , mortally wounded during the raid .
His blood - soaked helmet was in front of me throughout the flight .
I thanked everyone who was still alive to thank .
It was n’t , and never will be , enough .

( Newser ) – Every aspect of Sonia Sotomayor 's nomination procedure to become the newest Supreme Court justice was so controlled that she was even told what to wear at the acceptance ceremony , she said in a talk at Yale yesterday .
Sotomayor , who appeared on campus for her 30th Yale Law School reunion , wanted to shop for new clothes for her acceptance , but was told to bring five suits for White House officials to choose from , the New Haven Register reports .
" It was a really rough process and she knew it was just something she had to get through , " said a student who attended the talk , which was closed to the media .
Sotomayor became teary at times when discussing the grueling procedure , but kept the audience laughing , witnesses said .

MINGORA , Pakistan 
Two months after the Pakistani Army wrested control of the Swat Valley from Taliban militants , a new campaign of fear has taken hold , with scores , perhaps hundreds , of bodies dumped on the streets in what human rights advocates and local residents say is the work of the military .
In some cases , people may simply have been seeking revenge against the ruthless Taliban , in a society that tends to accept tit - for - tat reprisals , local politicians said .
But the scale of the retaliation , the similarities in the way that many of the victims have been tortured and the systematic nature of the deaths and disappearances in areas that the military firmly controls have led local residents , human rights workers and some Pakistani officials to conclude that the military has had a role in the campaign .
The Pakistani Army , which is supported by the United States and in the absence of effective political leadership is running much of Swat with an iron hand , has strenuously denied any involvement in the killings .
The army has acknowledged that bodies have turned up , but its spokesmen assert that the killings are the result of civilians settling scores .

Have we forgotten how to forget ?
Viktor Mayer - Schönberger worries about this .
The associate professor of public policy , who is affiliated with Harvard , has written a fascinating book called Delete : The Virtue of Forgetting in the Digital Age , due out in September .
In it , he argues that technology has inverted our millennia - old relationship with memory .
For most of human history , almost everything people did was forgotten , simply because it was so hard to record and retrieve things .
But there was a benefit : " Social forgetting " allowed everyone to move on from embarrassing or ill - conceived moments in their lives .
Digital tools have eliminated that amnesty .
Google caches copies of our blog postings ; social - networking sites thrive by archiving our daily dish .
Society now defaults to a relentless Proustian remembrance of all things past .
The downsides are obvious .
We live with a nagging fear that something we say or do online will come back to haunt us years later .
( Just ask anyone who 's been Google - vetted at the start of a relationship . )
" We become enormously more cautious with what we say or do , " says Mayer - Schönberger .
And society suffers when people stop taking risks .
So what 's the solution ?
Mayer - Schönberger argues that we need to stop creating tools that automatically remember everything .
Instead , we need to design them to forget .
As it turns out , software developers are beginning to do just that :
They 're becoming architects of oblivion .
A good example is Drop.io .
It 's one of many new " private sharing " services that let you upload a file — a picture , a video , whatever — and get a special URL you can give to select friends or workmates .
Photographers , for instance , use it to send photos to clients when they want to keep the images under wraps .
But here 's what makes Drop. io unique :
When you upload a file , the service asks you to put an expiration date on it .
It could be a month , a few hours , even " after five people have seen it . "
If you do n't set a date , the default is one year .
And when that time arrives , the file is deleted .
The result ?
Of the tens of millions of files uploaded to Drop.io in the past year and a half , two - thirds no longer exist .
As company founder and CEO Sam Lessin says , Drop.io files are " like little wormholes that pop into and out of existence for a specific purpose . "
Another case of intentional forgetting is the Guest Pass feature on Flickr .
Like Drop.io , it lets you share a specified photo stream by creating dedicated URLs that you can email to friends .
And with one click you can " expire " those links .
According to senior engineer Kellan Elliott - McCrea , about 11 percent of all Flickr members use Guest Pass , mostly for snapshots of kids , homes , weddings , and parties .
That 's precisely the kind stuff you want to show off , while retaining the ability to make it go poof *.*
Of course , there are no guarantees .
Someone could take a private file they 've been granted temporary access to and re-post it for all to see , forever .
But because these systems have been engineered for forgetting , users tend to respect this .
Our behavior is shaped by the code .
Mayer - Schönberger thinks all social software should be designed like Drop.io — to at least ask when we want our posts and uploads to be deleted .
That way , we'd be more inclined to meditate for a second about whether something ought to live forever .
Because in a world of cheap data storage , if we 're not prompted to delete , we wo n't .
( By Mayer - Schönberger 's calculation , the amount of flash RAM needed to store a photo costs less than the few seconds spent deleting it . )
Being required to think about whether to retain or discard a digital memory will have another side benefit :
It will make us pay closer attention — in real time !— to our experiences .
If you decide a sunset or a conversation is going to live only in your mind instead of on your hard drive , you 'll probably savor it more richly .
Just ask Marcel Proust .

The following draft of an “ isolation order ” was discovered on the CDC ’s website .
It is a template for state and local officials to impose quarantines and what would effectively be martial law .
“ Your illness [ as determined by state and local officials ] requires that you be isolated and requires further public health investigation and monitoring . ”
Failure to obey will result in imprisonment without bail prior to trial and the possiblity of a two year prison term .
In other words , according to this document , officials can impose quarantine without evidence that somebody is actually infected with a virus that is now negligible at best .
It may also be used to quarantine potentially millions of people suffering from any number of illnesses — or not suffering from any disease at the discretion of the state — that have nothing to do with H1N1 .
It is basically a carte blanche for martial law under the cover of protecting the public from a communicable disease that is demonstrably a manufactured and weaponized threat .

Rapper Baay
Bia says hip - hop in Senegal is a medium for change
Thirty years after the Sugarhill Gang 's Rapper 's Delight became the first mainstream rap song to hit the US charts , how and why has hip - hop spread to different parts of the world ?
Public Enemy rapper Chuck D famously once said rap was " CNN for black people " .
In the years following its emergence in 1970s New York , hip - hop culture has manifested itself around the world - most notably in the many rap acts that now exist across the globe .
Ben Herson is founder of the Nomadic
Wax record label Ben Herson is the founder of fair trade record label Nomadic Wax , which is committed to bringing acts from developing countries into the wider public consciousness by distributing music online , pressing records and making documentaries .
He argues that Africa is the true " birthplace of hip - hop " .
" It travelled through the transatlantic slave trade to the US , via the Caribbean - that 's what created this culture , " he says .
" Hip - hop is the missing connection between the US and Africa .
It 's about a conversation within the African diaspora .
There was Creole culture , the blues , jazz , rock 'n ' roll and it has become hip - hop . "
Mr Herson is particularly interested in the " CNN " factor , whereby " music affects politics and affects social change " , meaning that people from all around the world can relate to rap .
" Hip - hop , at its most basic form , reminds people across the world of a poetic culture .
Most cultures have an oral poetic tradition . "

But Mr Herson is right to point out that it has taken off across Africa in particular , in many styles .
Sudanese rapper Emmanuel Jal , for example , has risen to prominence in world music for work that draws on his experiences as a former child soldier .
In Ghana , hiplife - a blend of west African highlife and hip - hop - is ubiquitous in nightclubs and bars , while Senegal 's rappers have a reputation for political commentary .
Rap has been used as a powerful political weapon by Senegalese youth - most notably in 2000 when politically charged songs that were highly critical of the government received regular airplay on a popular radio station .
These protest songs are thought to have played a part in the then ruling party losing that year 's national election .
It 's one of the most important tools in music nowadays because it 's the only type of music talking about reality and connected to the people
Mahmoud Jreri
Rapper " In 2000 , rappers spoke about how we could change the nation .
People understood and we changed the government .
Until we spoke people did n't believe this could happen , " says Baay Bia , a 32 - year - old award - winning rapper from Dakar .
The artist , who has had three albums and largely focuses on what he sees as the repeated failings of African governments , says he wants to " inspire " people .
" I chose hip - hop to express myself - it gives me more detail in my music and message .
If I was just singing I would n't be able to share all I wanted to say . "
The rapper , whose real name is Birane Diouf , raps in Wolof and says this style of music is so popular in his country because it is " something familiar " , since it chimes with the griot tradition of storytellers and praise - singers in the country .
Using rap to carry political and social messages is not a uniquely Senegalese , or even African , phenomenon .
DAM , a Palestinian hip - hop group consisting of three members , rap in Arabic , Hebrew and English and have been active since 1999 .
And they 're just one group in the Middle East 's burgeoning hip - hop scene .

More from BBC World Service Group member Mahmoud Jreri recalls there being no hip - hop scene in Israel when he was growing up .
He says he " felt connected " with American rappers like Tupac and Nas , who he saw in music videos of the late 90s , because " they were talking about social and political problems " and , like him , seemed to live in poverty .
Now the group says there 's a big hip - hop scene in the West Bank and Gaza .
DAM 's lyrics touch on issues from the Palestinian situation to women 's rights in Arabic society .
The theme of rap as a medium for protest recurs again in France , where hip - hop is seen as one way that the immigrant population in the suburbs express discontent .
But , just as US rappers often court controversy , rap in France - has its critics .
Nineties rappers like Tupac Shakur influenced artists worldwide
In 2005 , about 200 MPs urged the country 's justice ministry to prosecute seven rap groups over allegedly provocative lyrics , following claims by some political figures that rap music fuelled suburban rioting in France .
In one particularly controversial song , entitled FranSSe , rapper Monsieur R called France a prostitute .
The artist said it was a diatribe against French leaders who had neglected ethnic minorities , not an attack on France in general .
And earlier this year Orelsan , a 27 - year - old rapper from Normandy , saw 10 of his concerts cancelled after former Socialist presidential candidate Segolene Royal and other politicians complained that his lyrics encouraged violence against women .
A political row over censorship ensued after Ms Royal threatened to withdraw the public subsidy from a prestigious festival , Les Francofolies in La Rochelle , in her capacity as head of Poitou - Charentes regional council .

But why has this style of music , and the culture it engenders , taken off all over the world ?
" It 's one of the most important tools in music nowadays because it 's the only type of music talking about reality and connected to the people , " says Jreri .
The Palestinian rapper thinks the music 's appeal is that it gives a voice to outsiders .
" It has started to be one language of the minorities .
One language of the people who wanted to express themselves and describe the situation that they are living in - talking about political , social and personal issues . "
Meanwhile , Herson says rap 's simplicity is the key .
" It 's the most basic form of music .
All you need is a beat and a voice .
" If you want rock and roll , you need money for instruments .
With hip - hop you can bang on a table and rap .
In its rawest form it 's very easy to make . "

Recently , clients of the Iseo Lake shipyard in St. Tropez were amazed by the new Italian yacht Riva 86 ’
Domino which was exclusively released to them .
This magnificent presentation of the Riva shipyards new model opened 2009 – 2010 nautical year .
The beauty of this mobile 26 meter yacht at once has riveted everyone ’s attention .
People just could not remain indifferent looking at this tremendous design .
Metallic
Ice color which covers both the deckhouse and the hull makes her look staggering .
86 ’ Domino seems to have soul .
Her unique personality , style and elegance that are so common in Italian - made quality production makes her beautiful both on the inside and outside .
Right after the presentation to the general public it was presented to the international press at Festival de la Plaisance in Cannes and then moved to Monaco as a representative for a brand .
86 ’ Domino will attend the 19th Monaco Yacht Show and will surely impress the public and press immediately .
It will be the only yacht presented by Riva at the show but not the only vessel in Monaco , produced by that company .
One of the most successful boats of last year ’s show , the 92 ’ Duchessa will also be present but unfortunately will not be part of the show .
People will be able to see it at the wharf of Monaco Boat Service , which is also the headquarters of Riva ’s dedicated dealer .

There ’s a new twist on that classic McDonald ’s experiment , the one in which there are two photos of a guy ; in the first he ’s dressed in a Mickey D’s uniform and in the second he looks like a banker .
Women are asked to judge the man ’s physical attractiveness and — surprise ! — he gets much higher attractiveness ratings when he ’s wearing a suit .
In the current study by evolutionary psychologist Murray Millar at the University of Nevada , women behaved similarly .
This time , 123 female judges were shown photos of three men seeking a partner .
A description accompanied the photo of each man , containing general biographical information ( e.g. place of birth , food preferences ) , a statement about what type of relationship he was seeking ( long - term or short - term ) , and his profession , which was either high - status ( doctor , banker , lawyer ) or low - status ( salesman , janitor ) .
No shocks here :
As Millar suspected , women , when primed to think about a long - term relationship , found men more attractive when they were described as having a high - status profession than a low - status one .
For a fling , the ladies gave men more - or - less equal attractiveness ratings regardless of profession .
These results , Millar concluded , are in keeping with the evolutionary argument that women have different mating strategies .
For long - term relationships , women implicitly place more value on social status and resources that may benefit her child .
For short - term relationships , women place more value on cues of genetic value such as physical attractiveness .
In the latter condition , it does n’t matter so much if he cleans toilets or flips burgers for a living .
They ’re lovin’ it .
But it ’s not always so simple , as I describe in BLONDES .
Hormonal cycles may subtly push or pull us in unexpected directions .
Do n’t forget the UCLA study in which women who were in their peak fertile window ( around ovulation ) found poor creative men more attractive than rich boring ones , at least in the short term .
As evolutionary psychologists suggest , mating is n’t always binary .
That is , some women may pursue more than one strategy at once : marry a stable office worker and have curiously - timed flings with hunky down - and - out artists ( or burger flippers ) .
Perceptions may also shift .
As women becoming more economically independent , they may find high - dominance males less desirable in a marriage context .
Better , perhaps , to have a man who ’s around more to change diapers .
Even now , given the cause of the current recession , pinstripes might not be so marriage - worthy .
I love reading books , and if you ’re like me you know the problem is there are too many books and too little time !
If you can relate to this , then this post is for you .
I overcame this problem by going through several Speed Reading books to develop my reading & comprehension skills .
I ’m now able to read a book several times faster , and I ’m not exaggerating when I say that I can read a 300 page book in 2 hours .
Though most Speed Reading Books focused on Reading Drills , what I found was that by adopting a few basic techniques , one can dramatically & instantly improve their Speed Reading Skills .
In this post I ’ll be sharing with you these secrets .
( A Note : these techniques work best with Non-Fiction books )
Step 1 : Know the purpose of reading the book
This is the first and perhaps the most important step to enhance your speed in reading .
It is to know the purpose you ’re reading the book .
Is it pleasure reading , self - improvement or looking for details on a particular subject ?
Without knowing why you wo n’t be able to jump into the pool of information to get what you want .
Ask yourself :
First :
In an overall scheme of things how worthwhile is the material that I am reading
Second :
What do I want or need to remember , as specifically as possible , from this material that I am about to read ?
Step 2 & 3 : Get an Overview of the Book & Author ( 15 minutes )
Go through the Front Cover , back cover & inside page cover
Table of Contents ( make a note of chapters that seem interesting )
Amazon Reviews
Preface
Introduction
While going through the Amazon reviews , preface & introduction gather some more information about the author and form an opinion of the Author and why has he written the book .
Doing the above should not take more than 15 minutes .
By the end of this step , you should be able to explain to someone in a few sentences what the book is about .
If you can do this you ’ve completed this step successfully .
Step 4 : Flip through the entire book ( 10 minutes )
You ’ll be surprised by the wealth of information you ’ll come across by just doing this .
Flip through every page of the book , spending 0.5 sec to 3 secs a page .
You ’re not expected to read through the text , but during this exercise , make notice of the following :
Diagrams
Sub Headings
Summary points
Any exercise
By noticing the above you ’ll find your mind automatically absorbing bits of information & connecting the dots between them .
Step 5 : Getting into the details ( 1 hour 20 minutes )
Most readers read books by diving right into the details without doing any background work .
But by the time you ’ve reached this step , you know :
Why you ’re reading the book ?
What the book is about ?
Who the author is ?
How can this book can help you ?
Congratulations , you ’re well in control of the book and to navigate through it with ease .
From step 2 you would have highlighted the chapters that interest you the most .
Be brave start going through these chapters .
Do n’t feel guilty by jumping to the end of the chapter , usually the end of the chapter will summarize the whole chapter .
You ’ll notice more often that not , there are a only few chapters that you need to go through , to know what you need to remember in Step 1 .
It ’s using the 80/20 rule .
80 % of the information you require is found in 20 % of the book .
20 % of the book is approx 50 pages which not take an average reader more than an hour and a half to read .
Make sure you underline the Major themes and ideas of each chapter you read .
Step 6 : Mind Map ( 15 minutes )
Mind -Mapping is a proven method to effecting summarize lots of information in short use of time and space .
You can learn about Mind Mapping from this YouTube Video .
With the information you ’ve underlined in Step 5 , create a Mindmap to connect the central ideas of the book and each chapter it contains .
The center of the MindMap can be the name of the book , and each Chapter you ’ve read is a branch from the center .
From each Chapter connect the lines
How it Works ?
Speed reading is not about reading words fast , but it ’s more about improving one ’s ability to extract the message of the text that is being read .
All the techniques above enhance your ability to understand the message of the text , without the need to read through every letter .
Benefits of Speed Reading :
Absorb new ideas faster
You ’ll be able to make time to read a wider range of material
Greater career success as your ability to acquire and retain knowledge increases dramatically
Increased confidence to sifting through thick books to get what you want

The Bangladesh Cricket Board ( BCB ) has agreed to the ECB 's request to appear in the first - ever day - night Test during the team 's tour of England in May - June next year .
However , the ICC has not yet cleared the idea and its approval will be subject to suitable equipment being developed for the purpose .
The idea was first proposed by the MCC during its World Cricket Committee meeting at Lord 's in July as a way of making the game 's longest and oldest format more appealing .
The other proposals included the use of pink balls and a World Test Championship .
The ICC has made it clear that though the concept of day - night Tests was discussed by its cricket committee , no decision has been taken yet .
" The ICC cricket committee had last year agreed in principle that the notion of day - night Tests should be investigated , " an ICC spokesperson said .
" For now , we are happy for members to try this at the domestic level first and if it proves successful , the cricket committee would consider recommending this on a trial basis at the Test level . "
Apparently , there are a number of key issues related to the concept that are still being discussed : the colour of players clothing , whether the suggested pink balls retains its colour or needs to be changed frequently due to discolouration or wear and tear , to what extent would batting , bowling and fielding conditions vary and so on .
An MCC spokesman confirmed to Cricinfo that the World Cricket Committee would meet with the ICC in November .
The future of Test cricket is on the agenda , and within that floodlit Tests will be discussed .
" We are very keen to help in any way we can , " the spokesman said , " and have been continuing with our trials of coloured balls to see if it will work on television . "
The MCC could have a dual role in this process : as well as being fully behind floodlit Tests .
Lord 's could be the ground to host the match .
One of the Bangladesh Tests is currently allocated to Headingley ; the other is part of the bidding process , with Lord 's in the running to hosting it .
" We would like to host it and we have our brand new floodlights , " said the spokesman .
The future of Test cricket has been the subject of debate within the ICC over the last year with the concept of a Test championship initially gaining ground .
But the idea was opposed by the India and England cricket boards who did not find merit in sharing their substantial TV revenue that would have gone to a common pool .
India and England have subsequently backed the idea of day - night Test cricket as a way of taking the format forward amidst the rise of Twenty20 cricket .
However , the ICC , which is finalising its Future Tours Programme post -2012 , is yet to arrive at a decision on the matter .
The ICC 's executive board meets next in October , when the issue is likely to be discussed again .
In his daily notes , Rosie looks at what is sure to cause a few sleepless nights to all trend chasers who believe that the trillions in excess liquidity will be there to forever prop up artificially high stock prices .
News flash - it wo n't , and it has already started to contract aggressively , yet computers seem to have problems with pulling down St. Louis Fed time series in their quest to constantly front - run one another .
Below are the three main charts of money aggregate levels over the past three months .
As one can see , M1 , M2 and MZM have commenced contracting at an alarming rate , implying that sooner rather than later , PMs will be forced to take out that rusty calculator and do some good old fashioned portfolio rebalancing and relative value digging , as the Fed can only prop the stratospheric equity prices so high before everything comes crashing down .
Here is Rosenberg 's direct quote :
It is interesting that the equity market has begun to wobble ( fade last Friday ’s rally on such low volume ) because we have noticed that some key liquidity indicators are not behaving very well , all of a sudden .
M1 fell 1.0 % in the August 24th week and over the past four weeks is down at a 6.5 % annual rate .
M2 has contracted in each of the past four weeks too and over that time has slipped at a 12.2 % annualized pace , which is a near - record decline .
We see the same trend in the broad MZM money measure — off at a 15.8 % annual rate over the past month .
Bank credit also remains in a fundamental downtrend — contracting at an epic 9 % annualized pace over the past four weeks .
So for the first time in the post - WWII era , we have deflation in credit , wages and rents , and from our lens this is a toxic brew that in the end will ensure that the focus on capital preservation and income orientation will be the winning strategy over a strict reliance on capital appreciation .
As a reminder , by fundamental value we mean something a little more tangible than " sentiment " which was the reason for JPM 's earlier upgrade of GE which seems to be the driving force for most of today 's stock moves ( aside from Bernanke 's crusade to destroy the dollar at all costs of course ) .
To end , here is another quote from Rosie which may explain much of the recent ebulience in the equity market :
As a release date nears , GQ offers an exclusive look into the +J Collection by Jil Sander for Japanese retailer Uniqlo .
The lineup , which features a wide array of contemporary styles , will officially release at select Uniqlo locations starting October 1st , 2009 and should cause somewhat of a frenzy amongst fashionista and Jil Sander fans alike .

Town Hall Talk : Man's Fingertip Bitten Off at Health - Care Rally
Updated 8:29 p.m.
By Garance Franke - Ruta and Sarah Lovenheim
One of a national series of rallies for health - care reform took a violent turn Wednesday night when , according to authorities in Thousand Oaks , Calif. , an unidentified man bit off another man 's pinky finger at the top joint .
The Thousand Oaks event attracted only about 100 people -- a small group compared to the turnout at congressional town halls , which have drawn up to 1,500 people .
But their passions were running high , and when a supporter of health - care reform wound up among a group of about 25 counter - protesters , an argument and fistfight broke out , Ventura County Sheriff 's Capt .
Frank O'Hanlon told the Associated Press .
Reports differ on whether the supporter went to confront the opponents intentionally or was just walking among them while trying to cross the street to the pro-reform rally .
Southern California 's KTLA -TV , which first reported on the fracas , wrote , " The 65 - year - old was apparently aggressive and hit the other man , who then retaliated by biting off his attacker 's pinky . "
The AP reported that the injured man " retrieved the finger and went to a hospital . "
The man , identified by ABC News as William Rice , received care from Los Robles Hospital and on Thursday told the Weekly Standard that the hospital was unable to reattach his fingertip .
Also on Thursday , Rice appeared on Fox News , where he was interviewed by Neil Cavuto ( see video clip , below ) .
O'Hanlon told the AP that authorities have a good description of the alleged biter , who fled the scene .
" It 's considered a mayhem which is the removal of an appendage from a human , " Capt .
Bruce Norris of the Ventura County Sheriff 's Department told ABC News .
" The crime is punishable by imprisonment for 2 , 4 , or 8 years . "
Attendees at the Thousand Oaks rally took to their blogs Thursday to describe the clash .
Reform opponent Eric Ingemunson recounts his story on RedCounty.com , and reform supporter Karoli Kuns tells her tale at DrumsnWhistles.com .
MoveOn.org sponsored the rally , along with others Wednesday night around the country , and Ilyse Hogue , a spokeswoman for the liberal advocacy group , called the incident " a regrettable act of violence . "
" While we do not have any more facts about what happened then what we saw in press accounts , MoveOn condemns violence in all forms , " she said in a statement to The Post .
" While we do n't know if either party involved was a MoveOn member , we regret any violence that may have occurred yesterday , and we support the Ventura County Sheriff 's investigation into the situation .
It is our firm hope that this event does not detract from the tens of thousands who were out peacefully making their voices heard for health - care reform and a public option , " Hogue said .
Police on the New South Wales north coast say a man who sparked a car chase in Lismore over the weekend was wearing only shoes and socks .
It is alleged the 23 - year - old unlicensed driver failed to stop for a random breath test just after 1 am on Saturday .
Police say he drove through 27 intersections and five roundabouts at speeds of up to 135 kilometres an hour before flat tyres caused the car to pull over .
The man was charged with mid-range drink driving .

Canonical has launched a new project called Quickly that aims to simplify the process of developing and deploying Linux applications .
It provides a command - line framework for generating code projects , storing changes in version control , building packages , and releasing finished software .
Quickly uses a template system that allows specialized behaviors to be defined for different kinds of software projects .
The default template , which is called ubuntu - project , will help users build applications with Python and Glade .
It defines several high - level command operations , including edit , save , dialog , glade , and package .
These operations , which are invoked with the Quickly command line tool , will use other software and command line tools to help the user complete the relevant tasks .
It serves as a simple command abstraction layer that insulates the user from having to learn and understand the underlying components .
To create a new project , the user has to run the quickly command and specify the desired base template and what they want to call their project :
$ quickly new ubuntu - project myprogram
This will automatically generate a directory called myprogram that contains a basic PyGTK + application , including boilerplate Python code , sample Glade user interface layouts , and a distutils setup script .
It will also automatically initialize a local version control repository using Bazaar and commit the contents of the project .
Quickly will then launch the stubbed out application so that the user can see that it was created correctly .
After the project is created , the user is free to build their program by modifying the generated code and user interface layouts .
They can do this however they want , but the ubuntu - project template provides a few Quickly commands that will make it easier .
The quickly edit command will launch the GEdit text editor and load in all of the Python scripts that are part of the project .
The quickly glade command will open all of the user interface layouts in GNOME 's Glade user interface editing tool .
The quickly dialog command can be used to generate a new dialog to the add to the application .
It will produce both the necessary Glade layout and the sample code .
To save the latest changes in the Bazaar repository , the user simply runs quickly save , which will automatically commit the code .
A commit message can optionally be supplied as an additional parameter .
There is a quickly release command that can be used to push a release into Launchpad and a quickly package command that will build a Debian package .
The commands provided by the ubuntu - project template make it easy for developers to get a PyGTK + project up and running without having to manually set up the basic structure of the code or manage every aspect of the build process .
This is highly advantageous because it lowers the barriers to entry and allows programmers to focus on programming rather than tooling .
The ideas behind Quickly make it seem a lot like the popular Ruby on Rails Web application framework .
It leverages automation and static code generation to accelerate development and eliminate a lot of the tedious steps that would otherwise have to be undertaken manually .
It does this with simple command line tools rather than a complex IDE so that the developer will not be locked into a single toolset or have to contend with the overhead of a heavy environment .
The downside is that the entire experience is less seamless than , for example , what you get with Qt Creator or MonoDevelop , which more tightly integrate code editing and visual user interface design tools .
The use of Python in the default template is advantageous because it is more conducive to rapid development and also eliminates the need to expose users to the nightmarish abyss of Autotools .
The ubuntu - project template 's Integration with Launchpad and Bazaar is also very nifty because it allows users to leverage Canonical 's powerful collaborative development infrastructure .
Although that default template is obviously tailored to the Ubuntu ecosystem , the Quickly framework is flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of tools and development technologies .
Alternate templates could be made for different kinds of programming toolkits or to facilitate integration with different version control systems and project hosting providers .
For example , it will be possible for users to make a template with custom scripts that use Git and GitHub instead of Bazaar and Launchpad .
Quickly is still at an early stage of development and is still limited in its capabilities , but the underlying vision is very compelling .
It has the potential to radically simplify the development process and provide new programmers with a more friendly introduction to creating Linux applications .
You can get started with Quickly by installing it from a PPA on Ubuntu 9.10 .
Additional details are available from the project 's page at Launchpad .
A monkey that has acquired the sole power to hand out apples is generously rewarded with grooming sessions by the other monkeys in its group .
But as soon as another monkey can hand out apples as well , the market value of the first monkey is halved .
The monkeys therefore unerringly obey the law of supply and demand .
Dutch - sponsored researchers Ronald Noë , Cécile Fruteau and Eric van Damme demonstrated this in their article that was published online on 7 July by the journal PNAS ( Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ) .
Cécile Fruteau placed food containers with highly - desired pieces of apple in two groups of South African vervet monkeys .
For the monkeys there was just one problem : only one in each group could open the food container .
This monkey had a low position in the rank order and was therefore scarcely groomed .
However , as soon as she acquired the power to hand out apples she was valued more and was groomed a lot by the rest of the group .
Yet she could only enjoy that privilege briefly ; the researchers placed a second food container that could be opened by another low - ranking female .
From that moment onwards the market value of the first monkey was halved , and she was therefore groomed half as often .
Long - term planning
The experiments revealed that the female monkeys that could open the food containers were groomed more than when they exerted no power over the food production .
The females concerned also did not have to groom the other monkeys as long .
They were therefore paid for their services as food suppliers .
Biological market theory predicts that the market value of these female monkeys should vary according to the law of supply and demand .
The fact that the grooming time of the first monkey was halved as soon as the second monkey gained the power to distribute apples , confirms this idea ; the price of goods - in this case the female monkeys who could open the containers - was instantaneously adjusted to the market .
Immediately after the opening of the food containers , the researchers registered how long the females were groomed for .
The next occasion on which the females could open a container was , however , several days later .
The fact that the females were still groomed more indicates that the vervet monkeys apply a strategy that works in the long term .
The choice of partners is also influenced by long - term attitudes ; the monkeys can value one monkey relatively more than the others .
A change in price - grooming for less long if there is another monkey that supplies apples - is only possible if a negotiation process takes place .
Many economists assume that such negotiations can only take place if they are concluded with a contract .
However , the vervet monkeys do not have the possibility to conclude such binding contracts and yet they still succeed in agreeing to a change in price for a service .

The word Rapture is n't in the bible .
OK ?
If this is a trick " catch ya " .
The words " caught up " is translated to Rapture .
Now .
There are 2 Raptures , not 1 .
the 2 " R " 's. are Rapture 1
Revelations [ Reveal ] Christ Reveals Himself .
2
The Book of Rev explains it , The book of Acts explains the 2 commings .
WOW ... after reading some of these answers .
Just let me explain it too you .......
There is no conflict , it ’s probably that you do not understand that there are two “ appearings ” : two comings of Christ - both with an “ R ” .
The first is the “ Rapture ” .
That 's when we hear the words , “ come up hither ” in Revelation 4:1 and we 're caught up in the twinkling of an eye , I Corinthians 15:52 .
The dead in Christ rise first , then we which are alive and remain are caught up with the dead in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air , I Thessalonians 4:16 .
And I believe probably the most obvious would be events that happened in the Old Testament that seem like the Rapture .
And , we have some in the Old Testament .
Well not actually what takes place at the Rapture , for then we get brand new bodies , to be like the body of Jesus , I John 3:2-3 .
However , there were two men in the Old Testament who were snatched up to meet the Lord in the heavenlies .
Enoch walked with God , and he was not , for God took him .
Now it was a form of the Rapture , but it was n’t really the Rapture , because he ’s on the other side in his old body .
It was not changed as he went up .
And then in 2 Kings 2:11 , Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven , but he ’s still there in his body .
All the others are there as spirits , to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord , 2 Corinthians 5:8 .
And James teaches us that , chapter 2:27 , as the body went out , the spirit is dead , because that sprit is with the Lord .
So it ’s a total heaven , full of spirits , even the angels , except these two bodies , and they come back , and they are the two witnesses of Revelation chapter 11 .
And in verse 12 , after they ’ve been killed , because the crowds do n’t want to hear their preaching , they are caught up into heaven .
I always remember a child being taught about the " Rapture " in the Catholic schools , but They called it " being caught up into heaven " .
Why do our churches seldom mention the event ?
Catholic school they taught it as “ being caught up ” .
That is I Thessalonians 4:17 .
You know , someone said you can't find the word “ rapture ” in the Bible .
But you can in the Catholic Bible , the Latin Vulgate by Saint Jerome .
When he gets to I Thessalonians 4:17 , he uses the word “ rapiamore ” – it means raptured – where it says , “ caught up ” in our English versions .
Why do n't more churches do it ?
They do n't study and they do n't know what the Bible says .
They do n't study the catechism – they do n’t study the Word of God .
God forgive us for that situation .
He talks about a Pre-tribulation Rapture and the Tribulation is that seven - year period of judgment on earth – Revelation chapters 6 to 18 – because we go up in chapter 4 and it only begins in chapter 6 .
We call it a pre-tribulation Rapture and the Rapture is I Thessalonians 4 verses 16 to 18 , when the dead in Christ rise and the living go up with them to meet the Lord in the air and all in the twinkling of an eye , I Corinthians 15:52 .
However , during the seven - year period of Tribulation , the greatest revival in history occurs as 144,000 evangelists swarm the world in Revelation 7 verses 4 to 8 , and they are preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom – Matthew 24:14 .
The King is coming and a multitude like the sands of the sea , Revelation 7:9 , is converted and verse 14 says , “ They came out of the Great Tribulation and washed their robes , made them white in the blood of the Lamb . "
Because of it , death comes to those new converts during that seven - year period in Revelation 6:9 , 13:50 and Revelation 20 verse 4 .
Now Christ comes back with His saints , Jude 14 , and Daniel 12:2 - the Old Testament Jews are raised and at that point , all those who died during the Tribulation are also raised .
I hope that answers your question .
You notice .
The 144,00 is Old testament evagelists .
This will disappoint the Jehovah Witness ' .
All of the Old Testament Believers have to be washed in The Blood of The Lamb .
Jesus came to " Fulfill The Law of Moses .
Not to change it .
Jesus changed nothing , this was prophecied from the very begining .
Those who read the Bible literally , such as Tim LaHaye and Baxter agree that the end is imminent .
everybody is asking , “ Is this is so , is this so ? ”
Well , what do you have to say ?
Let me just go into this first , before you answer that .
Paul Maier , he takes a very critical look at the end of the world scenario in the Left Behind series .
And “ Prophecy feeds fires debate – end - of - world books have an eternal appeal ” .
And “ Different visions on how it all will end . ”
Well , you know , I just have to say that world “ end ” , I do n't believe the world ’s going to end .
Neither does Tim Lahaye and all these other men .
I know Dr. Tim Lahaye , Dr. Hal Lindsay , Dr. Dwight Pentecost , Dr. Walvoord , and Dr. Grant Jeffrey .
None of them believe that the world will end for at least another thousand years .
Christ is coming as the King of kings and Lord of lords , Revelation 19:16 , to rule and reign for one thousand years , Revelation 20:4 .
It is the amillennialist crowd who says there ’ll be no millennium who ’s preaching that it ’s the end and that the end will come .
Not these men , you ’ve misunderstood them .
Well , does n't the Bible speak about the end of the world ?
Yes , Matthew 13:39 , 40,49 , Matthew 24:3 , Matthew 28:20 and Hebrews 9:26 , but any Greek Orthodox teacher in their catechism will tell you that is not the end of the world .
It is the end of the age of grace before we go into Christ 's reign on earth .
This world even after a thousand years is never going to end .
“ The earth abides forever ” , Ecclesiastes 1:4 .
“ Yahweh God created the earth , it shall never , never , never be removed ” , Psalm 104:5 .
Jesus said , “ The meek shall inherit the earth ” , Matthew 5:5 .
For how long ?
“ the meek inherit the earth forever and forever ” , . Psalm 37:29 when Christ sets up his government on earth , “ of the increase of his government , there shall be no end ” , Isaiah 9:7 , and when he sits on David 's throne in Luke 1:32 , He rules over the house of Jacob , Israel forever and forever and of his kingdom “ there shall be no end ” .
The Dalai Lama on Thursday added a new entry to his English vocabulary - " political correctness " - oddly enough in Prague , a liberal city known for leniency towards the incorrect .
Tibet 's spiritual leader , who is in the Czech capital to speak about human rights in Asia at a conference on Friday , found himself lost for words when a Czech journalist asked him what he thought about political correctness .
" What do you mean ? " he blinked , genuinely puzzled .
His expression forced laughs from the crowd and an eloquent explanation from the journalist , but the Dalai Lama still looked stumped .
" What do you mean ? " he repeated , shaking his head and turning to his assistants for help .
After a lengthy discourse , the Dalai Lama straightened up but still radiated uncertainty .
" I do n't know ...
I openly express - if someone 's short , I express it as short .
If someone 's very tall , I say very tall , " he mused .
" Of course , if you create embarrassment , you can't be saying this .
But otherwise , black is black , white is white , yellow is yellow .
And that 's it . "
Mr. Bloomberg , who smoked as a young man , faced furious criticism from restaurant and bar owners in 2002 when , in his first year in office , he reached a deal with the City Council on legislation banning smoking in virtually every indoor public or commercial area , including most bars .
( Smoking had been banned in most restaurants in 1995 . )

A new plan to ban smoking would affect over 1,700 parks , playgrounds and recreational facilities .

But the ban , which took effect in 2003 , has since gained widespread acceptance and has been credited with helping drive down the percentage of adults in the city who smoke to 15.8 in 2008 , from 21.5 percent in 2002 .
The New York City proposal would affect more than 1,700 parks , playgrounds and recreational facilities , as well as the city ’s seven beaches , which span 14 miles of shoreline .
The proposal drew praise from public health advocates and criticism from one of the nation ’s biggest tobacco manufacturers .
“ The issues with secondhand smoke are very real , and the majority of the population today does n’t want to be breathing in tobacco smoke , whether indoors or outdoors , ” said Dr. David A. Kessler , who was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 1990 to 1997 .
“ While undoubtedly some will think this is going too far , 10 years from now , we ’ll look back and ask how could it have been otherwise . ”
Cheryl G. Healton , president and chief executive of the American Legacy Foundation , the smoking prevention group that was created as part of the 1998 master settlement between the tobacco industry and 46 state governments , also applauded the proposal .
“ There is no redeeming value in smoking at beaches or parks , ” she said in a statement .
“ Anyone who has sat behind someone smoking a stogie can tell you that .
The health risks are real .
Secondhand smoke is deadly . ”
David Sutton , a spokesman for the cigarette maker Philip Morris USA , which is part of the Altria Group , said the company supported a ban on smoking in public buildings , public transportation and many areas of the workplace , as well as areas like elevators where smoking would be a fire hazard .
Let me get this straight .
Thousands of teabaggers take Washington , DC public transit -- let 's call it the public option of transportation -- to their 9/12 protest .
And now they 're complaining that this government - funded service was n't lavish enough ?
Kevin Brady , Texas Republican
House member , is even complaining on their behalf .
Sorry , make that Kevin Brady who voted against $ 150 million in emergency maintenance funding for the DC Metro in July .
Now , he'd like the government to spend more money investigating this alleged failure of a service he voted to deny funding and protesters were hypocrites to have even tried to use .
A spokesman for Brady says that " there were n’t enough cars and there were n’t enough trains . "
Brady tweeted as much from the Saturday march .
" METRO did not prepare for Tea Party March !
More stories .
People could n’t get on , missed start of march .
I will demand answers from Metro , " he wrote on Twitter .
Brady says in his letter to Metro that overcrowding forced an 80 - year - old woman and elderly veterans in wheelchairs to pay for cabs .
He concludes that it " appears that Metro added no additional capacity to its regular weekend schedule . "
For the record , the Metro was rush hour crowded .
Not major sports event crowded .
Certainly not inauguration crowded .
So basically , it 's a whining sense of entitlement .
Business as usual , in other words .

The following article is my opinion of T - Mobile and the events that transpired .
I 'm saying that to legally cover myself .
T- Mobile its really not cool to deny someone a port - out request , causing them to waste another 2 months filing a second port - out request , then charge them for usage during those two months because you could n't get your act together the first time .
Uncool !
Details :
This situation has arisen because of T - Mobile 's decision to illegally deny my porting request which transpired between January 29th ( the day the port was initiated ) and mid February of 2009 .
T - Mobile magically does n't have a record of this first port - out request , and the new telecom ( actually the guy 's name was Saiyad from OOMA ) I was moving to ran into issues with T - Mobile rejecting the port - out request .
>>
I have tried on numerous times to resolve the issue with T - Mobile customer care .
Including speaking to supervisors , and corporate entities .
>>
I later filed a BBB complaint against T - Mobile regarding the issue and T - Mobile could not come to any sort of resolution to the matter .
Brian Watson , the T - Mobile corporate affairs representative that contacted me in regards to the complaint dodged communication by calling my evening phone number ( instead of my morning number ) listed on the BBB complaint while it was ( surprise ) morning time .
>>
As a result , on June 23rd , 2009 , I filed a formal complaint with the FCC against T - Mobile regarding this issue , and the issue was n't pursued like it needed to be .
OOMA confirmed with me that the reason my port out request was denied was due to an invalid last 4 of my social security number .
I have proof to show that a port out attempt was made on my behalf during January 29th , 2009 ( the one T - Mobile denies existing ) , and furthermore that the information provided was correct , and that it was received by OOMA so that the port - out request could be initiated .
The copy of the fax confirmation will also supports that fact .
After T - Mobile denied my first porting request , I immediately consulted with the Director of Operations at OOMA ( my new provider ) , and a new port out request was initiated in March of 2009 .
T - Mobile does recognize this port - out attempt , and the second porting attempt completed on 4/20/2009 .
So now after screwing me over , causing me a 2 month delay where I HAVE to keep my number for the portover to complete , T - Mobile is asking for $ 108.69 which is for service during those months after T - Mobile illegally denied my port - out request .
The sad part is , anyone at T - Mobile really could have stepped up and fixed their mistakes , but its practically impossible for that to happen with customer support or the corporate end .
All I want to do is just meet somewhere in the middle with T - Mobile .
I was wronged , T - Mobile feels they are justified in charging for service during those two months after denying my 1st port out request , and I just - JUST - wanted someone to realize what they had done and find common ground between us .
So then I finally decide to get in touch with Brian Watson as I really thought he may actually hear me out ( yeah right ) .
So I called him and left my name and number .
To my complete and utter surprise , I got a call back from Mr. Watson , and he goes into a 10 minute ordeal about how I 'm not going to be refunded my early termination charges .
He thought I was some other person , and he did n't verify the person I was talking with , and for 10 minutes went on about the personal account details of this other individual he got mixed up with .
So much for consumer privacy there .
I feel that the only reason I actually GOT a call back was because he was intending to talk with another Ben besides myself .
So after all this , what does T - Mobile do ?
They send my account to a collections agency where my outstanding A+ ( 750 score ) credit is now in jeopardy .
I have since filed a debt dispute with the agency in writing and by certified mail , and I am pursuing a more formal FCC complaint against T - Mobile .
These are the kind of antics you have to deal with and put up with , and I , am very VERY not amused .

On the flipside to this , OOMA is one of the best telecom providers I have ever seen .
Period .
No jokes , no bull , no ANTICS .
Kodak last week announced that it was discontinuing its venerable Kodachrome film , sending it gently into that good night after 74 long years .
Like Polaroid 's discontinuation last year of all instant films , Kodachrome 's demise makes it the latest victim in the transition from chemical , film - based photography to digital sensors , Photoshop , and archival inkjet printers .
Though it may seem like an anachronism that has lived far past its prime , the oldest color film was a mind - blowing revolution when it was first introduced in 1935 .
I do n't mean to suggest that color photography did n't exist before Kodachrome — not by a long shot .
The first known color photographs were taken in 1861 by James Clerk Maxwell .
Maxwell 's process , the foundation upon which later commercial processes were developed in the early 1900s , involved exposing three plates , each filtered by red , green , or blue .
The resulting plates could then be projected simultaneously using the same red , green and blue filters , creating what was at the time the most accurate reproduction of color available .
Photographic plates in those days were n't fully sensitive to the full visible spectrum , so this method was n't fully exploited until the photographic documentation of Russia by Sergey Mikhaylovich Prokudin - Gorsky between 1909 and 1918 .
A comparison of Bayer - pattern red - green - blue filters to Autochrome 's orange - green - purple mosaic .
Later processes , including Joly Color , Autochrome , and Dufaycolor used a similar filtering process but included mosaics or other patterns of filters on the photographic plates themselves .
These processes are in fact quite similar to the Bayer filtering used on the sensors in modern digital cameras .
Like all silver salt - based films , digital sensors do n't actually record color , but light intensity .
In the early 1900s , black and white film was filtered to achieve reasonably accurate color reproduction .
In the 2000s , we do the same thing with digital sensors ; however , we have the added advantage of digital interpolation — which attempts to fill in missing color data for each individual pixel position — something that was n't available 100 years ago .
Even Technicolor introduced a color process as early as 1922 for motion pictures .
The early Technicolor processes relied on bulky cameras that split light using a prism , filtering one side with red and the other with green .
Each was then exposed onto separate rolls of film .
Red and green prints were made and cemented together to create a " color " film .
Technicolor later refined the process , adding a blue layer to the process for vibrant , " true " color and creating a process to create prints on a single layer of film — giving us results that we remember from The Wizard of Oz .
Separating and filtering the light this way is still done for high - end , 3 - CCD digital video cameras ( remember , sensors — like film — are only sensitive to the intensity of light ) .
What Kodak did when it introduced Kodachrome in 1935 seemed nothing short of a miracle .
The film had three separate light - sensitive emulsions , each filtered by the film itself to be sensitive to red , green , and blue light .
During the complicated development process , these layers were developed and reversed , then coupled to dyes to create a full color transparency .
Photographers and cinematographers of all types could use standard cameras , expose the film once , and get back a full color image .
It should be noted that Foveon uses a similar concept for its X3 , multi- layered digital image sensors today .
We take for granted this " single shot on a single piece of film " ability today , since the multilayered , dye - coupler approach is the basis for all later color transparency and negative films .
The main difference is that the dye couplers are included in the film emulsions themselves , greatly simplifying the development process — currently E - 6 for color slides and C - 41 for color negatives .
The complicated , expensive , and environmentally challenging K - 14 process for Kodachrome is a big part of the reason the film waned in popularity after the 1980s .
In fact , only one lab in the country still processes the film — Dwayne 's Photo Service in Parson , Kansas .
That company has committed to processing remaining stocks of Kodachrome — which Kodak suggests could be available until autumn of this year — until the end of 2010 .
This haunting image of a young Afghan refugee was shot in 1985 using Kodachrome film .
Despite the benefits of digital photography , though , some photographers mourn the loss of the iconic film , famously praised for its color reproduction by none other than Paul Simon is his 1973 hit " Kodachrome . "
Kodachrome was universally admired for its color reproduction , smooth tonal range , and excellent dark storage properties , which made it practically archival .
Arguably the most famous image ever made on Kodachrome was a 1985 National Geographic cover shot by photojournalist Steve McCurry that featured a young Afghan girl .
National Geographic relied on Kodachrome so heavily , in fact , that it ordered a custom batch of an ISO 200 version of Kodachrome when Kodak discontinued it earlier this decade .
Though a majority of working pros shoot primarily with digital now , some have likened the loss of Kodachrome to a painter who could no longer get his oft - used brand of brushes or his favorite paints .
While we continue to march away from film to a day when all images will be captured digitally , it 's worth recognizing that the technology that made Kodachrome possible gave us a world full of color images for a respectable 74 years .

Only a few hundreds protesters took to the streets of Pittsburgh to mark the opening day of the G20 summit of world leaders , but the police were taking no chances .
Sonic weapons or long - range acoustic devices have been used by the US military overseas , notably against Somali pirates and Iraqi insurgents .
But US security forces turned the piercing sound on their own citizens yesterday to widespread outrage .
Pittsburgh officials told the New York Times that it was the first time " sound cannon " had been used publicly .
[ Warning : the video below contains very loud audio from the start ]
The sonic weapon appear to be more effective than the Metropolitan police 's highly contentious kettling tactics used against G20 protesters in London .
But it is equally controversial .
It is feared the sounds emitted are loud enough to damage eardrums and even cause fatal aneurysms .
House lawmakers will hold markups this week on two key parts of President Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting ' MORE 's proposal to overhaul the financial regulatory system .
The House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to mark up legislation that creates a new federal Consumer Financial Protection Agency ( CFPA ) , which would regulate products such as credit cards and home loans .
The committee is also slated to consider legislation that would regulate the multi-trillion dollar market for financial derivatives , instruments widely used to hedge risk .
ADVERTISEMENT
Both issues have been the center of major lobbying efforts from banks , the wider financial industry and consumer advocacy groups .
The Obama administration , meanwhile , has been ramping up its pressure on lawmakers to pass both pieces of the reform effort .
Senior Treasury Department officials , including Secretary Timothy Geithner , held more than ten meetings on Capitol Hill this week to press for financial regulations .
" The patchwork system of regulations we have now has failed to prevent these abuses , " Obama said on Friday .
" With seven different federal agencies each having a role , there is too little accountability , too many loopholes , and no single agency whose sole job it is to stand up for people .
" Lobbyists on the new CFPA agency are focusing on a handful of provisions , and the biggest battle next week will be over the scope of the agency 's power .
At heart , the battle , which divides Democrats , is over whether the new agency should preempt state and local authorities .
The legislation sets up a minimum federal standard from the new agency but would also allow state officials to pursue stricter or stronger regulations .
The industry is lobbying heavily in favor of allowing federal officials to preempt state laws .
Chairman Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) supports the administration , but centrist New Democrats on the committee are in favor of preemption .
The issue will likely be the most contentious part of the markup .
Frank had scaled back parts of the administration 's original proposal so it did not affect non-financial businesses .
Many of those lobbying groups expressed cautious support for the bill after the revised draft was released .
But several of those groups have reassessed the bill and oppose it .
The National Automobile Dealers Association ( NADA ) , one of those groups that had expressed initial praise for the revised draft , sent a letter to lawmakers this week opposing the bill unless it is revised .
The association criticized Frank 's effort to exempt auto dealers from the new agency , saying that it exempts only car brokers and car buying services but not dealers .
And the association argued that the exemption for merchants did not exclude auto sales that are financed .
On the derivatives legislation , the financial industry and big banks are working hardest on defining an exemption from clearing for " major swap participants . "
An SEC official testified this week that the exemption for major participants that use derivatives primarily for " risk management " purposes is overly broad and ill defined .
This summer , two of my closest college friends and their 12 - year - old daughter came for a visit .
I had n’t seen them in a decade .
These guys , ( at least , prior to the birth of their daughter ) were atheists back when I was still unsure of my own stance .
Although I called myself agnostic , I leaned toward a mystical world view .
At that time I thought they just did n’t “ get it ” .
I could tell they thought the same of me .
But , there was enough mutuality in other areas to make humoring one another easy enough .
Now , I was stoked because we were finally “ on the same page ” , and I was eager to talk about it .
Then it dawned on me that with a 12 - year - old in tow , we probably would n’t be able to get into the political and philosophical implications of the subject , at least not in the length and breadth I had been fantasizing about .
After all , young Megan was going to be surrounded by adults for the duration of the several week trip , and the least I could do was have some sensitivity to that .
I remember what it was like to be invisible in a room full of adults , and I was n’t about to put her through that .
Little did I know …
This 12 - year - old floored me on many levels .
Not only did she have a facility with language , there was a sophistication to her thinking I certainly had not anticipated .
She jumped into political and philosophical conversations with greater ease and fluency than many adults–even if her knowledge of the subject was at times somewhat spotty–and in need of refinement .
She was trying , and in many places she truly held her own .
Still , I was n’t so sure about broaching the subject of religion .
What if my friends modified their views since becoming parents ?
We all know that happens .
How had they oriented their child ?
Besides , I thought to myself , Megan would probably appreciate it if we just had some fun , and were n’t so heady about everything .
NOT .
Out of the blue , with absolutely no hint of religion in our conversation , Megan started talking about how she had recently been discriminated against at school for being an atheist .
My jaw dropped .
Here was the one thing I really wanted to talk about with her parents , and she opened the door wider than I had hoped !
A 12 - year - old speaking out as an atheist ?
I dove in with questions , and she was more than eager to speak out .
So with no further ado , I give you BSJ ’s first young atheist , Megan H .
Morgaine : Welcome Megan !
Tell us a little about who you are , how old you are , and your interests .
Megan : Hi !
My name is Megan .
I ’m 12 years old .
I like to write , read and play video games .
I ’m in a gifted and talented program for exceptional learners and , of course , an atheist .
Morgaine :
What does atheism mean to you ?
Megan :
Atheism to me means the disbelief in any and all religious practice and the disbelief in intelligent creation or god .
I do not believe in god or any other form of intelligent creation .
Morgaine : Would your mom and dad describe themselves as atheists ?
Megan : I believe so .
They have talked with me and referred to themselves as atheists .
Morgaine : Lets go back a little .
At what age did the idea of religion / god become interesting or relevant for you ?
Was there a specific event that caused you to wonder about god or religion , or did questions arise spontaneously ?
Megan :
If I remember correctly , I was about 8 years old .
I think I was talking with a girl in my lunch period .
I asked why I was the only person who was n’t invited to her party .
She said only people her parents knew from church were asked .
That night I asked my dad why we did n’t go to church .
He told me that our family did n’t believe in a god and questions took off from there .
Morgaine : Did what your parents said make sense to you ?
What about it appealed to you ?
Megan :
They told me that they did n’t know why they should pray to a thing they ca n’t be sure of .
They also said that they do n’t think that god could exist and if it does it would be too busy to care if we prayed .
I thought this made sense .
It seemed very logical .
Morgaine : A few years have past since your first conversations and thoughts on the subject .
Are your views the same or different than your parents ?
If different , how so ?
Megan : I think that they are very similar .
The only difference may be that we see highly religious people differently , but we agree it does not apply unless the other person wants it to .
Morgaine : Hypothetically , if your views were to change , how do you think your parents would respond ?
Say , if you told them you wanted to explore going to church , how would they react ?
Megan : I do n’t believe they would care .
We actually talk about this a lot .
That if I wanted to go to church , they would get me there , but would not participate any more than that .
Morgaine :
Do questions of religion come up between you and your friends ?
Megan :
Not normally , no .
Morgaine :
Do any of your friends share thoughts about religion that are similar to yours ?
Megan :
Yes , only one and he is my closest friend .
Morgaine :
How about this friend ’s parents … do they share the same view ?
Megan : Yes .
My friend ’s parents do not believe in god .
Morgaine :
Do you feel you are missing out on anything by not having a connection to a religious community ?
Megan :
Not really , though I do receive some ridicule .
Morgaine :
So your views have affected friendships with those who are religious .
Do you think the ridicule is a result of misunderstanding what it means to hold an atheist world view ?
Megan : Yes .
One of my friends refuses to bring the topic up .
But most kids either push me away , or their parents do .
Many people believe that the word atheist and satanist co-exist .
Morgaine :
What would you like to them to know ?
Megan :
They do n’t [ co - exist ] .
I do n’t believe in religion in general .
I do not worship [ god or ] the devil .
Morgaine :
You told me some stories about how identifying as an atheist caused some difficulties for you specifically at school .
Tell us about that , and your response to it .
Megan : Yes .
Somehow students discovered my beliefs or lack thereof , and treat me like a freak of nature , or devil .
I have lost popularity , and feel that students pick on me in other ways because of the topic .
It has caused depression .
Morgaine : I ’m sorry to hear that .
It ’s never easy to hold a minority view especially on such a loaded topic as religion , and especially being so young .
I think it ’s very courageous .
How do you deal with the discrimination and depression you ’ve experienced ?
Megan : I tell myself that the insults like devil or satan are all words that are used in religion .
If I do n’t believe them they do n’t matter .
Morgaine : Has your school been responsive to kids picking on you ?
If not , what do you think should change ?
Megan :
No [ they were n’t responsive ] .
I think that ANY BULLYING is wrong and must be dealt with .
Morgaine :
Have you had other experiences of discrimination like this at school or elsewhere ?
Megan :
In 5th grade a girl discovered my atheism and did every thing in her power to hurt me or change me .
Morgaine :
Why do you think people lean toward a religious view of life ?
Megan :
Because it is comforting to think that when you die you will go somewhere and have a purpose .
Also if you have been wronged , then maybe that person will be punished .
Morgaine : Religious people often ask how someone can find meaning in life without belief in God … that the wonders of the world are n’t sufficient to satisfy them .
What would you say to that ?
What gives your life meaning ?
Megan :
The meaning of life can not be decided after death , in my opinion .
I think the meaning of life is decided by the person living it –not some being that they do n’t know .
I push on by knowing that I will finish my book and become a doctor .
Morgaine :
Do you see any dangers in religious thinking ?
Dangers to an individual ?
Dangers to the world at large ?
And do you see any benefits ?
Megan : I think that religion will cause history to repeat itself .
As long as there are different beliefs , people will fight and kill for power .
Morgaine : Some people say you ca n’t be moral or ethical without religion .
What would you say to that ?
Megan :
No , religious people have started wars over it .
If they call mass killing good ethics then I do n’t know what to think .
Morgaine :
What would you like to say to other young people who may struggling with issues around religion , who may be torn between what their parents say to believe and their own doubts ?
Megan :
Talk to them .
If your parents really do n’t want you to believe that way then get on with it .
Go to church with them .
Think of it as story …a fabulous fairytale .
You do n’t have to believe it .
No one can make you do that .
Morgaine :
Any other thoughts on religion , or atheism , that you ’d like to share ?
Megan : I do n’t want any one to feel that they have to change .
Just keep these thoughts in mind .
Morgaine :
Thank you very much sharing your thoughts and time .
Megan :
You ’re welcome !
Although Megan is busy with school and her projects , she ’d be happy to answer any questions , time permitting of course !
Stay tuned for future discussions with Megan , and other young atheists .
Not one to back away from controversy , Electronic Arts today mailed out real checks payable to game reviewers for $ 200 .

Yep , beetles , 1.6 million of them .
Or Buprestidae to be precise ; a family of the insect which are more commonly known as Jewel Beetles .
This incredible ceiling art - known as Heaven Of Delight - can be found at the Royal Palace in Brussels and was the brainchild of controversial Flemish artist Jan Fabre , a man renowned for working with strange media including blood , sperm and all manner of insects .
Apparently it took Fabre 's team of around 30 people 4 months just to glue the beetle shells to the ceiling .

The Washington Post recently laid off a columnist because his blog posts did n't get enough web traffic .
Of course , in the old days , the newspaper had no real way to tell which columns got read and which ones did n't .
So journalists were lulled into the sense that it did n't really matter .
The Times quotes Jay Rosen , a journalism professor at NYU , “ It ’s an unusual public rationale for serious newspaper people , that ’s for sure . ”
Wrong tense .
It 's not going to be unusual for long .
In fact , in a digital world where everything can be measured , we all work on commission .
And why not ?
If you do great work and it works , you should get rewarded .
And if you do n't , it 's hard to see why a rational organization would keep you on .

Sharp Blue : Relativity , FTL and causality
<< Previous in Series : “ Absolute Future and Absolute Past ”
A brief note to my recent visitors :
If you ’ve arrived here from sites with highly misleading blurbs and expect to find a discussion of how faster - than - light travel is possible , I ’m afraid you will be disappointed .
This article outlines an argument commonly accepted by physicists which demonstrates that in special relativity faster - than - light travel is not possible .
( This article forms a companion piece of sorts to the first half of the section on Special Relativity in my Very Brief History of Time , so it might make more sense if you read that first .
If that does n’t make sense , try reading the earlier parts too ! )
One of the most striking aspects of special relativity is that faster than light travel is equivalent to time travel .
This is also one of the most widely understood aspects of the theory , and almost every explanation I ’ve seen of the effects of superluminal travel on causality has been badly garbled .
In this article , I will try to explain it more clearly .
The paths of light rays in a special relativistic spacetime ( a so - called Minkowski spacetime ) act like a causal grain running through the spacetime .
The outgoing light rays from an event form a surface in spacetime called the event ’s future light cone .
The light rays converging on an event form a surface called the event ’s past light cone .
For any event P ( where P is a label for something happening at a given place at a given time ) , the events within P’s future light cone make up its absolute future and those within its past light cone make up its absolute past : the former are the events that P can influence and the latter are the events that can influence P .
Unlike the situation in classical mechanics , there are also events outside both light cones of P that can neither influence nor be influenced by P ( at least in the absence of faster than light travel or communication ) .
These concepts are summarised in figure 1 ( where , as usual in such spacetime diagrams , I ’ve suppressed two spatial dimensions ) :
To understand this causal structure a little better , we ’ll have to look more closely at how different observers see spacetime .
In the following , we ’ll be exclusively concerned with observers at rest in inertial frames , which are collections of coordinate systems moving at uniform velocity with respect to one another .
Special relativity is founded on two postulates ( and a lot of experimental evidence supporting its conclusions , of course ) :
The laws of physics look the same to all observers in inertial reference frames .
This is the “ Principle of Relativity ” that lets us perform calculations relative to any inertial frame we like and be assured that we will get the same values for all physically meaningful quantities .
This postulate holds in classical mechanics too .
The speed of light is the same in all directions in all inertial frames .
It is this postulate that gives rise to all the strange consequences of special relativity , including those discussed here .
The constancy of the speed of light in all frames means that different observers must slice spacetime into space and time in different ways .
This is quite unlike the situation in classical mechanics , in which everyone can agree on what is space and what is time .
In particular , from the point of view of a stationary observer , an observer moving at constant velocity has a coordinate frame whose space and time axes are “ tilted ” towards the light cone .
By the relativity postulate , this situation must be symmetric - the second observer will consider herself stationary and the first observer ’s frame “ tilted ” .
From this sort of reasoning and a little bit of mathematical sophistication , we can cook up a recipe for translating the coordinates assigned to events between inertial frames .
Each such translation is known as a Lorentz transformation .
Let ’s look at one more closely :
In this diagram , we can see the seeds of our strategy for violating causality using faster than light signals .
Looking at events P and Q , we see that P occurs after Q according to the observer in the white frame , but to the observer in the blue frame P happens first .
This situation is enshrined in the lore of relativity under the name “ relativity of simultaneity ” , because different observers will have different ideas about which events take place simultaneously .
For events within the light cones , though , all observers agree on temporal ordering .
It ’s not possible to tilt the coordinate frame enough to make events in P ’s absolute future appear to be in P ’s past .
That ’s why it ’s called the absolute future in the first place !
All of the foregoing may be quite odd to those unfamiliar with relativity , but all will be well for causality provided that there are no superluminal causal influences .
If we have faster than light effects then it ’s rather easy to make paradoxical causality violations .
For the sake of concreteness , I ’ll consider a pair of “ ansibles ” - superluminal transmitters whose signals are received simultaneously with their transmission when both the transmitter and receiver share an inertial frame .
The same sort of argument applies to faster than light effects that are not instantaneous , and to signals carried by faster than light spacecraft .
I ’ve just chosen this case because it makes the diagrams easier to draw and easier to understand .
Let ’s look at a single use of our ansible :
By itself , this single use of the ansible does n’t create a causality violation .
If Bob transmits a signal back towards Alice using a conventional light - speed transmitter , she receives it a later time than when she signalled to Bob .
Even if Bob re-transmits with his ansible , Alice receives the reply just a little after she sent out her signal .
The problems arise when we bring another inertial frame into play .
Let ’s suppose that we have another pair of inertial observers , Carol and Dave , who are moving with respect to Alice and Bob , and who have a pair of ansibles of their own .
As Carol flies past Bob at event Q , Bob gives her the message from Alice and she transmits it to Dave as soon in the diagram ( in which I ’ve not drawn any coordinate grids to reduce clutter ) :
Now causality is in real trouble , as we can see if we consider the pair of transmissions ( from Alice to Bob , then from Carol to Dave ) :
Notice that we ’ve arranged for Dave to receive the signal from Carol as he ’s flying past Alice .
Notice too that he receives it before Alice has sent her first signal !
This means that Alice can transmit information into her own past by way of Bob , Carol , Dave , some spaceships , and two pairs of ansibles .
And that ’s why faster than light travel or communication , special relativity and causality cannot coexist .

WASHINGTON  Despite a recession that knocked down global arms sales last year , the United States expanded its role as the world ’s leading weapons supplier , increasing its share to more than two - thirds of all foreign armaments deals , according to a new Congressional study .
The United States signed weapons agreements valued at $ 37.8 billion in 2008 , or 68.4 percent of all business in the global arms bazaar , up significantly from American sales of $ 25.4 billion the year before .
Italy was a distant second , with $ 3.7 billion in worldwide weapons sales in 2008 , while Russia was third with $ 3.5 billion in arms sales last year  down considerably from the $ 10.8 billion in weapons deals signed by Moscow in 2007 .
The growth in weapons sales by the United States last year was particularly noticeable against worldwide trends .
The value of global arms sales in 2008 was $ 55.2 billion , a drop of 7.6 percent from 2007 and the lowest total for international weapons agreements since 2005 .
In the evening of January 15 , 2008 , a 31 - year - old tech consultant named Gregg Housh sat down at the computer and paid a visit to one of his favorite Web sites , the message board known as 4 chan .
Like most of the 5.9 million people who visit the site every month , Housh was looking for a few cheap laughs .
Filled with hundreds of thousands of brief , anonymous messages and crude graphics uploaded by the site 's mostly male , mostly twentysomething users , 4 chan is a fountainhead of twisted , scatological , absurd , and sometimes brilliant low - brow humor .
It was the source of the lolcat craze ( affixing captions like " I Can Has Cheezburger ? " to photos of felines ) , the rickrolling phenomenon ( tricking people into clicking on links to Rick Astley 's ghastly " Never Gonna Give You Up " music video ) , and other classic time - wasting Internet memes .
In short , while there are many online places where you can educate yourself , seek the truth , and contemplate the world 's injustices and strive to right them , 4 chan is not one of them .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
Yet today , Housh found 4 chan grappling with an injustice no Internet - humor fan could ignore .
Days earlier , a nine - minute video excerpt of an interview with Tom Cruise had appeared unauthorized on YouTube and other Web sites .
Produced by the Church of Scientology , the clip showed Cruise declaring himself and his co-religionists to be , among other remarkable things , the " only ones who can help " at an accident site .
For the online wiseasses of the world , the clip was a heaven - sent extra helping of the weirdness Tom Cruise famously showed on Oprah .
But then , suddenly , it was gone : Scientologists had sent takedown notices to sites hosting the video , effectively wiping it from the Web .
Housh and other channers knew that Scientology had a long history of using copyright law to silence Internet - based critics .
But this time , maybe because the church was stifling not just unflattering content but potential comedy gold , the tactic seemed to inflame the chortling masses .
That evening , Housh logged in to an IRC channel frequented by like - minded chuckleheads and started talking with five others about the Cruise video .
There was a sense that something must be done , but what ?
One of them logged out and posted a call to action on 4 chan and some similar sites .
By the middle of the night , 30 people had joined the chat .
Within a couple of days , a consensus emerged :
They would take down the main Scientology Web site with a massive distributed denial - of - service attack , or DDoS .
By the time the attacks started on January 18 , Housh and many of the now 200 others on the chat channel were devoting every spare moment to the cause : " We were like , OK , we have 24 hours today .
None of us need to sleep .
Get your caffeine .
What 's the next step ? "
Someone suggested they create a press release .
Housh and four others broke off into a side channel to work on it while the DDoS attacks unfolded .
They figured they should explain the goals of their spontaneous uprising , but what exactly were those goals ?
" We had no fricking clue what we were doing , " Housh says .
" We did n't mean to do it in the first place . "
They were still more of a riot than a movement — a faceless , leaderless mob growing daily as new adherents flocked in .
None of them knew one another , even by pseudonyms , since as a rule there was only one username throughout the community .
In fact , it was a standing in - joke on 4 chan and related sites that their collective output was the product of a single hive - mind entity , known by that same username : Anonymous .
Instead of a press release , Housh and the others made a video introduction in the name and voice of the hive mind itself .
Thrown together in a few days of furious collaboration , it appeared on YouTube on January 21 , titled " Message to Scientology . "
" Hello , leaders of Scientology .
We are Anonymous , " the clip began in a robotic , software - generated voice - over accompanied by stock footage of clouds rolling over desolate cityscapes .
" Your campaigns of misinformation , your suppression of dissent , your litigious nature :
All of these things have caught our eye , " the voice explained .
" For the good of your followers , for the good of mankind — and for our own enjoyment — we shall proceed to expel you from the Internet and systematically dismantle the Church of Scientology in its present form . "
The message ended , as it had begun , on a pitch - perfect note of sci - fi comic book menace : " We are Legion , " the robot voice intoned .
" We do not forgive .
We do not forget .
Expect us . "
The anonymous campaign against Scientology , better known among its participants as Project Chanology , continues to this day .
In the months since it launched " Message to Scientology , " Project Chanology has employed a variety of tactics , including pickets , pranks , and propaganda that ranges from the purely informative to the ferociously satirical .
It has waxed and waned and waned some more , and yet , improbably , it has endured , evolving into a peculiarly instructive case study in the dynamics of online protest .
Project Chanology may well be the first movement to realize the kind of ad hoc , loosely coupled social activism that many have hoped the ad hoc , loosely coupled architecture of the Internet would engender .
But it 's also the first one founded on the principles of the most obnoxious innovation that architecture ever produced : trolling .
To troll is to post deliberately incendiary content to a discussion forum or other online community — say , kitten - torture fantasies on a message board for cat lovers — for no other reason than to stir up chaos and outrage .
Trolling is ( for the troll , at least ) a source of amusement .
But for Anonymous it has long been more like a way of life .
Study the pages of the Encyclopedia Dramatica wiki , where the vast parallel universe of Anonymous in - jokes , catchphrases , and obsessions is lovingly annotated , and you will discover an elaborate trolling culture :
Flamingly racist and misogynist content lurks throughout , all of it calculated to offend , along with links to eye - gougingly horrific images of mutilation , sexual perversity , and , yes , kittens in blenders .
Here , too , are chronicled the many troll invasions , or " raids , " that Anonymous has inflicted on unsuspecting Web communities — like the Epilepsy Foundation 's online forums , which were attacked with flashing , seizure - inducing animations .
So , after the Tom Cruise video vanished and that first call to arms went out , the nameless multitudes of Anonymous — steeped in the theory and practice of trolling — were well prepared to answer it , even if some were n't convinced that they were up to the task .
" Anonymous will never take down a massive multimillion - dollar corporation like Scientology , " one Channer wrote .
" You 're not shutting down a fucking corporation with prank phone calls . "
Indeed , the inherent challenges faced by an activist movement made up of trolls emerged almost as soon as Project Chanology got under way .
In the IRC war rooms where the DDoS attacks were being coordinated , one Anonymous member redirected the fire of an entire raid onto what he said was a hidden Scientology IP address but turned out to be the Web site of a primary school in the Netherlands .
A few days later , a middle - aged couple in Stockton , California , misidentified as Scientology counterhackers , woke in the middle of the night to harassing phone calls and death threats .
As news of the raid filtered out into the world beyond Anonymous , these blunders did n't do much for its public image .
Not that Anonymous tended to care what others thought .
In trolling , as a rule , the more people you piss off , the better ; what matters are the lulz — the laughs you get from trashing someone 's peace of mind .
But this was a new game , in which public opinion seemed to matter , and so far Anonymous was n't on top of it .
A reflective mood seeped into the IRC channels ; fingers were pointed .
One participant said they could have done a lot more if they " were n't just a bunch of unorganized brats . "
With the lulz wearing thin , Project Chanology was approaching that moment when a typical raid calls it quits .
What Anonymous did next , however , was unprecedented in the annals of not just trolling but online activism in general :
It executed a major midcourse correction .
The site hacking stopped , and a new tactic was announced : A worldwide " RL raid " ( real - life protest ) on Scientology 's offices would take place on February 10 , 2008 .
When the day arrived , thousands of Anonymous members , many with their faces obscured by scarves or Guy Fawkes masks , turned out in scores of cities to protest lawfully and nonviolently ( depending , of course , on your definition of nonviolence :
In London , an Anonymous crowd carrying boom boxes subjected staffers in a Scientology building to a day of real - life rickrolling ) .
A second protest followed in March , with numbers matching the original .
Now looking less like a swarm and more like a network , Project Chanology moved onto message boards of its own .
Housh and others set up a site called Why We Protest , which has become a hub for planning and discussion , ruled by the time - honored hacker protocols of rough consensus .
" It 's the hive mind at work , " Housh says .
A new idea or call to action can come from anyone but is vetted by everyone : " If it 's bad , we laugh and make fun of you because that 's what we do , " Housh says .
" But if it 's good , it sticks . "
And as the movement 's tactics evolved , so did its goals , narrowing from the destruction of Scientology to more realistic aims , focused on broadly exposing the church 's alleged fraud and abuse .
Meanwhile , Scientology was hitting back .
Working with law enforcement , the church pressed charges where it could .
A New Jersey 18 - year - old named Dmitriy Guzner was indicted for taking part in the Chanology DDoS attacks ; he pleaded guilty this May .
Housh was barred from coming within 500 feet of Boston - area Scientology buildings for a year ( he cheerfully attends demonstrations in other cities now ) .
But on their own , Scientologists have mounted a more personal countercampaign .
Volunteer " handlers " have taken it upon themselves to monitor the actions of Anonymous , standing amid protesters and using video cameras to record anything incriminating or embarrassing .
Private detectives and law enforcement have named hundreds of the most active Chanologists , lawyers have sent warning letters not only to their homes but also to their parents , and Anons claim that church members have papered their neighborhoods with flyers identifying them by name and face as members of a " terrorist organization . "
" They are a terrorist organization , " says Tommy Davis , a church spokesperson .
" Their intention is to instill fear and incite hate .
There is no other explanation . "
Leaning back into a cushioned chair in a suite of the church 's posh Celebrity Centre in Hollywood , Davis holds in his lap a 2 - inch - thick binder of Anonymous - related material .
He has just finished reciting a litany of the bomb threats , death threats , arson threats , and acts of vandalism that were directed at Scientology churches and employees , including himself , in the first year of Project Chanology 's existence .
But he claims that , thanks largely to the church 's vigorous response , the protest movement is " in its death throes . "
If Chanology is dying , however , it 's being awfully leisurely about it :
After an early falloff , the numbers at the monthly protests have been roughly stable .
The question , it seems , is no longer how a half - baked mob of Internet jackasses ever thought they could take on an organization as powerful and vindictive as Scientology but how Scientology could have failed to squash them long ago .
And the answer may be that the church is incapable of following one simple bit of Internet wisdom : Do n't Feed the Trolls .
By taking Anonymous as seriously as it has , Scientology has nurtured the one thing Chanology depends on above all : the lulz .
That 's not to say Anonymous has n't faced some grave opposition , just that its toughest foe has turned out to be not Scientology but Anonymous itself .
It was early afternoon on January 8 , 2009 , almost a year after the birth of Project Chanology , when 18 - year - old Anonymous member Agent Pubeit emerged from a subway station in New York City 's Times Square clothed in nothing but a ski mask , shorts , sneakers , and surgical gloves .
The temperature was just above freezing , but it 's doubtful Pubeit felt the cold :
A thick layer of petroleum jelly covered his exposed upper body , and this was thickened further by a generous admixture of pubic hairs and toenail clippings .
Pubeit was not alone .
As he walked along the crowded sidewalk toward his destination — a Church of Scientology center on nearby West 46th Street — he was filmed by an accomplice with a video camera , and the two were in radio contact with more coconspirators .
As Pubeit got closer to his target , the remote team unleashed a rolling barrage of distractions on the Scientology center , tying up phone lines with prank calls and faxes .
In the midst of this , Pubeit burst into the center 's reception area and jogged around for a moment or two , leaving traces of hairy lube on whatever surfaces he could get close to .
From there he proceeded to a nearby Scientology management office .
Just inside the doorway , he found church materials loaded onto a cart , which he mounted for a few seconds of simulated man-cart love before fleeing into the city 's streets .
" Greasy Vandal in Hate Crime vs. Scientology , " read the New York Daily News headline .
Two weeks later , Davis was citing the stunt as proof that Project Chanology is no more legitimate a protest movement than the KKK .
" To have a man slathered in Vaseline and covered in pubic hair and toenail clippings storm in and begin desecrating a place of worship , " Davis said with quiet outrage .
" That puts it in perspective . "
But the main target of Operation Slickpubes , frankly , was n't Scientology at all .
It was Chanology .
Or more precisely , it was anyone in Chanology 's ranks who had forgotten this was a movement created by and for trolls .
Since the beginning of the campaign , there 'd been a tension between its " lulzfags , " who held that Anonymous must have no higher cause than its own cruel amusement , and the " moralfags , " for whom the cause of fighting an oppressive cult was an end in itself .
( Neither term is necessarily an insult .
In channer culture , the " fag " tag can be pejorative , neutral , or practically a term of endearment . )
The tensions deepened after publicity attracted an influx of people unfamiliar with the rules of Anonymous .
Not that these " newfags " turned the movement into a Boy Scout cookout .
( Some Chanologists who asked to remain unidentified for this article said it was less for fear of Scientology than of their fellow Anons : " They 'll call us ' egofags ' and fuck with us relentlessly . " )
But Chanology 's drift toward respectability has been more than some Anonymous traditionalists can bear .
Enter Operation Slickpubes , which , according to Michael Vitale , one of the New York City Anons who instigated the prank , was aimed squarely at reversing that drift .
Anonymous members , he says , are " the assholes of the Internet " and should play that up , because ultimately the movement survives on attention — from the media , from potential recruits — and only one thing is sure to keep the attention coming : Anonymous ' willingness to undertake what Vitale calls " any sort of motherfuckery . "
For him , it 's not that the movement 's ethical objectives do n't matter .
It 's that taking them too seriously may , paradoxically , kill Project Chanology before it has a chance to attain them .
OK , looks like the pressure is finally getting to Glenn Beck .
You can't watch this rant , from his show yesterday , without concluding that the big implosion is on its way .
Beck : Does sacred honor even exist in Washington anymore ?
Because I ratted out a self - avowed Communist in the administration in Van Jones , the same organizations , the same politicians , the same progressive media that are ignoring or standing for ACORN now , have called me Joseph McCarthy .
They have such little regard for your intelligence that they do n't think you 're going to figure out that Joseph McCarthy was a powerful senator !
Surrounded by the trappings of power of the United States government .
With the power of subpoena and the power of Congress !
The guy who stood against that was alone .
While everybody else wet their pants and cowered in fear !
You'd think the members of the media might remember his name .
It was Edward R. Murrow .
And while I am nowhere near an Edward R. Murrow , never claimed to be , let me use the words of , finally , somebody that stood up to the power , and these senators , and said , Senator , have you no shame ?
Have you no shame ?
Indeed , his critics have been making the all - too - accurate comparison to McCarthy , most notably Media Matters , who put together a handy side - by - side comparison that 's devastating .
Looks like Beck watched it and it made him cry .
Or maybe he saw the tallies from the latest set of advertisers to flee his sinking rat 's nest of a show : over 50 percent of his ad dollars have now gone elsewhere .
Bet that makes him cry too .
But really , Beck did make at least one accurate statement here :
He 's no Edward R. Murrow .
Hell , he 's not even a Krusty the Klown .
Perhaps you would be better about lowering your carbon footprint if lighting up your home required a sample of your own blood .
Designer Mike Thompson thinks so .

His concept Blood Lamp calls for users to break off the top of the bulb - shaped glass , cut their finger on the jagged edge and then mix a tablet in with their own blood .
Some sort of mysterious , unexplained chemistry ensues and the bulb glows .
Not exactly the most practical device ever — plus the lesson about reducing your carbon footprint might backfire in the long run .
Consider how many of these bulbs you would need , how many you would throw away and how many Band - Aids it would take to dress your wounds .
It seems that it would end up doing more harm to harm the environment than good .

Have you ever worked on a really successful project , one of the rare on time and on budget ones ?
Did you get a reward and a lot of praise in the end ?
Yeah I did n’t think so .
Now think back to a project where everything went wrong but through super - human efforts you were still able to get the beast into production .
Any accolades for this one ?
My guess is you probably got a few and if not you personally , than someone on or around your team did .
This seems to be a really common scenario with software projects ; people who are associated with highly successful projects are forgotten while people on “ death marches ” ( that are too expensive to cancel ) are praised and hailed as heroes .
The Well - Run Project
Really successful projects are few and far between but when they do happen they are a joy to work on .
Not only that , but the software delivered is higher quality and meets expectations .
Budgets and deadlines are adhered to and everyone associated with the project is happy ( more or less : ) ) .
Most of us dream of working on such a project .
So when a project like that finishes , how does the business show it ’s appreciation and express it ’s desire to see more projects of the same caliber ( i.e. what kind of positive reinforcement is used ) ?
Well , everyone gets a pat on the back and then moves on to the next thing .
A little anti-climactic would n’t you agree ?
You see , everyone expected the project to go well and when it did , noone was surprised , everything went according to plan , why would anyone reward or even acknowledge it when things go according to plan .
That my friends is what I call negative reinforcement .
The Crappy Project
Crappy , death - march projects are routine in software development .
Projects begin with unrealistic expectations , concrete commitments are made based on estimates and information that is far from concrete .
And when things inevitably go pear - shaped developers cop the brunt of the fallout .
We are forced to shortcut our process and compromise on quality and when that is not enough , well we just work longer and longer to make up the shortfall .
At the end everybody is stressed and tired , but sometimes the gargantuan efforts are enough to get the project ( or what ’s left of it ) into production .
When that happens , we crack open the champagne and hail the project as a miracle of modern software development .
Everyone shakes their heads and marvels at how the team was able to do the impossible .
Awards and praises are handed out and everyone is too happy to notice that the project was actually a year late and millions of dollars over budget .
I lie , everybody is well aware of the fact that the project was a complete debacle , but with so many people patting each other on the back , it just does n’t seem politic to say anything .
You would agree that this is the ultimate in positive reinforcement .
It Is A Bizarro Universe
The above scenarios strike me as being completely cuckoo .
We acknowledge and praise people who try ( and sometimes succeed ) to pull projects out of the jaws of failure but do n’t do the same for people who push project into the ‘ jaws of success ’ .
Have you ever tried to train a dog ?
Next time you do , try the following .
Every time a dog does something you like ( such as fetching a stick or rolling over ) , a positive behavior – just ignore it .
But every time the dog does something ‘ bad ’ ( like peeing on the carpet ) , a negative behavior – give it a treat .
My guess is you will quickly end up with one confused and badly behaved dog , and yet we do this on an industry - wide level .
It is truly bizarre .
This Culture Needs To Change
In an industry where project going pear - shaped is the norm , it really behooves us to look more closely at the ones that do n’t .
I for one would love to see a little bit more appreciation from everyone for projects where things go according to plan and especially for the people on those projects .
It might sound crazy but I do believe that delivering a year - long project on time while having all developers work at a sustainable pace ( oh I dunno , let ’s say 40 hours a week :) ) deserves at least an honorable mention for the people involved .
The other side of the coin is rather than celebrating the belated delivery of the latest death - march , how about digging into it and trying to figure out why it was 6 months late and why people had to work 80 hour weeks to keep it from complete disaster .
And when we do figure out what the problems were it may be worth it actually learning something and trying not to repeat the same mistakes rather than just writing it all up in a report and putting it on the wiki or in the document repository .
Because wikis and repositories are just some of the places where lessons go to die .

A couple who attracted the attention of police by having sex at a petrol station in a Northern Territory town have been arrested .
Police were called to the service station in Adelaide River , 110 kilometres south of Darwin , to move the couple on last night .
But they soon discovered the car had been stolen from Jabiru earlier in the day .
Watch Commander Bob Harrison says police also found the driver was heavily intoxicated .
" We received a call that two persons were having sexual intercourse in the passenger seat of a vehicle at the petrol bowser , " he said .
" We attended and we asked them to stop what they were doing and they did n't seem to want to , but they finally did .
" They were intoxicated and we arrested the driver for breath analysis and they gave a reading of 0.179 per cent . "
LOS ANGELES / NEW YORK ( Hollywood Reporter ) - Just days before the transition to digital television , 2.8 million households , or 2.5 percent of the TV market , are unprepared .
A discarded television is seen along a street in Miami , Florida February 23 , 2009 .

According to Nielsen , the latest tally is half of the 5.8 million that were unprepared in February , when the government postponed the transition by four months .
At a news conference Wednesday in Los Angeles , acting Federal Communications Commission chairman Michael Copps reiterated the importance of the transition and said the agency was expecting relatively minor problems when the switchover begins Friday .
“ This is the biggest transition in television , an even bigger transition than black - and - white to color , ” Copps said .
“ Our whole society is going digital , and broadcast needs to be a part of that transition . ”
Copps said the freed - up bandwidth will help establish a public safety network , as well as provide more room for wireless and broadband applications .
Yet Copps , who Barack Obama appointed as head of the FCC in January , also was critical of the government ’s handling of the transition during the past two years .
“ We ’ve got some humps and bumps to navigate ; there ’s still a number of people who do n’t know what to do , ” Copps said .
“ We knew this transition was coming ; the government was late getting itself organized ... but we are where we are and have to make this transition . ”
The FCC has employed 4,000 phone operators to be standing by through the weekend to handle calls coming through their information line ( 888-225-5322 ) .
Some broadcasters are layering on their own initiatives to help viewers make the switch .
For example , in Los Angeles , the TV stations have set up their own phone bank to help ease the transition .
Experts say problems are likely to be concentrated in markets that are least prepared .
The Albuquerque / Santa
Fe area of New Mexico is the least ready , with 7.6 percent of TV homes completely unprepared .
Several of the nation ’s largest markets -- including Dallas - Fort Worth , Seattle - Tacoma , Los Angeles and Phoenix -- have unprepared TV households in the 4 - 5 percent range .
How those percentages will translate into TV ratings is the big unknown .
“ This is the d - day , the week it is going to happen , ” said Stan Statham , president and CEO and California Broadcasters Association .
“ All Americans will receive better picture , better sound .
There is nothing negative about what ’s happening this week . ”
Another edition of favorite wedding photographs from our sweet and talented Art Director Kim … .
The artist : Elizabeth Messina
The adoration : Six years ago while planning my own wedding I came across the most charming and inspiring real wedding in Martha Stewart Weddings magazine .
I cut it out to put in my own wedding inspiration book along with fabrics , photos , sketches , color palettes , seating charts , and dozens of pages of stylish details .
In the end it was the only real wedding that made its way into my book .
I could have only dreamed that six years later I would meet the photographer and become her friend .
These photos by Elizabeth Messina are from her own grandfather ’s wedding .
No doubt you ’ll be as inspired as I was by the touchingly beautiful images .
We feel truly honored to be able to share them with you .
Anthony and Mae began their courtship after Anthony ’s friends recognized a kindred spirit in Mae and urged him to call her .
When Mae arrived for their blind date she was 20 minutes early and he was already there .
Both widowed , both Sicilian , and both longing to travel back to the island , they spent the next year traveling together and supporting one another as they faced life ’s challenges and fell in love .
One spring day Mae opened her door to find a giant bouquet of flowers and a note that said , “ I love you , I need you , let ’s get married ! ”
With enthusiastic blessings from their families , plans soon began for an intimate church ceremony and a cocktail reception for 50 guests .
Elizabeth fondly remembers the moments before the wedding when her grandfather , a former first - chair concert violinist , serenaded her alone as he waited to go to his bride .
With Anthony ’s son as their best man and Elizabeth ’s daughter as their flower girl , Anthony and Mae became husband and wife surrounded by their closest family members and friends .
Now that they are no longer on this earth , they still remind us that love is all there is .
These gorgeous images , full of joy and promise , were taken in and around the Santuario de Chimayo Church outside of Santa
Fe where it is said that miracles happen , and obviously they do .
Thank you again , Elizabeth , for sharing these treasured photos with us ; you are an endless inspiration and truly a miracle in our lives !
For more images from this incredible wedding visit Elizabeth ’s blog , Kiss the Groom , where she showcases her latest work and her own inspirations .
[ Ben ] and his associates over at the University of California at San Diego came up with a way to duplicate keys using a picture of them .
They developed an algorithm that uses measurements from known key blanks to extrapolate the bitting code .
Because the software is measuring multiple points it can correct the perspective of the photo when the key is not photographed on a flat surface , but from an angle .
They went so far as to test with cell phone cameras and using a telephoto lens from 195 feet away .
In most cases , correct keys were produced within four guesses .
Do n’t miss their wonderful writeup ( PDF ) detailing how key bitting works , traditional covert duplication methods , and all the details of their process .
The lack of available code prevents us all from playing secret agent ( or felon ) with this idea but [ Ben ] did mention that if there is sufficient interest he might release it .
Lock bumping showed us how weak our security is , but this is a bit scary .

Even though the process went smoothly , customers still found it unnerving .
“ People expect companies to go out of business , not banks , ” said James R. Fouts , the mayor of Warren , Mich. , whose working class city of 140,000 has had a front row seat to the collapses of General Motors and Chrysler .
“ That is something that you expect to hear about in the Great Depression , and it further exacerbates the feeling that financially , the country is not yet in stable shape . ”
The banking system may also be facing a long recovery .
About $ 870 billion , or roughly half of the industry ’s $ 1.8 trillion of commercial real estate loans , now sit on the balance sheets of small and medium - size banks like these , according to an analysis by Foresight Analytics , a research firm .
For most of the banks , this represents the biggest and riskiest part of their loan portfolio , since they lack the trading streams and fee businesses of their larger rivals .
And as a group , small banks have written off only a tiny percentage of the losses that analysts expect them to incur .
In fact , applying only the commercial real estate loss assumptions that federal regulators used during the stress tests for the big banks last spring , Foresight analysts estimated that as many as 581 small banks were at risk of collapse by 2011 .
By contrast , commercial real estate losses put none of the nation ’s 19 biggest banks , and only about 5 of the next 100 largest lenders , in jeopardy .
Even Citigroup , the biggest and most troubled of the banks , has a relatively small portion of its loans tied to commercial real estate and may begin to recover faster than other rivals .
Gerard Cassidy , a veteran banking analyst , said the problems call to mind the wave of small bank failures in Texas and New England two decades ago during the savings and loan crisis  only on a national scale .
Back then , regulators closed more than 700 lenders in those regions .
Today , Mr. Cassidy projects that as many as 1,000 small banks will close over the next few years and that their losses will be more severe .
“ It ’s a repeat on steroids , ” he said .

Shuttle ( red ) and station ( blue ) crewmembers participate in a joint crew news conference while aboard the International Space Station on Sept. 4 , 2009 during the STS - 128 shuttle flight .
WASHINGTON - For rookie astronauts flying aboard the International Space Station , the foodis good , the rocket thrusters are loud and there ?s an odd tang in the air - apparently from outer space .
? It ?s avery , verydifferent environment than I expected , ?
Discovery shuttle pilot Kevin Ford , a first - time spaceflyer , said from orbit late Friday .
One of things Ford was n?t ready for is the weird smell .
? From the [ spacewalks ] there really is a distinct smell of space when they come back in , ?
Ford said from the station in a Friday night news conference .
?
It ?s like ? something I haven?t ever smelled before , but I?ll neverforget it .
You know how those things stick with you .?
In thepast , astronauts have described the smellof space as something akin to gunpowder or ozone .
The soundsof spaceflight have also been surprising , especially when Discovery fires up itslarge maneuvering thrusters , Ford said .
? It definitelygives the shuttle a kick and you just feel a little twang throughout the wholeorbiter when they ?re firing to keep you in position , ?
he added .
Of the 13astronauts aboard the International Space Station and docked shuttle , nearly halfare taking their first trip to space .
For some , it ? s a short trip aboard theshuttle , which blastedoff last week with three rookies aboard .
Other first - timespaceflyers are on the station for the long haul .
Some have already been therefor months , so the term ?rookie ?
barely applies .
? The foodis wonderful , ? said rookie astronaut Nicole Stott , who arrived at the stationSunday on Discovery to begin a three - month stay .
?
Of course we have a mix fromall the partners now .?
The result , she said , is a sort of orbitalsmorgasbord that includes food from the United States , Russia , Canada , Japan and Europe .
? I thinkyou can find something for everyone , ?
Stott said .
Discovery ? sseven - astronaut crew is in the middle of a 13 - day mission to deliver freshsupplies and new science gear to the space station .
The astronauts ferried Stott to the outpost to replace another NASA astronaut who will come home onthe shuttle .
They alsodelivered a $ 5 million treadmill named after comedianStephen Colbert .
Even someof Discovery ?s grizzled veterans were surprised by the life aboard the station , which is the $ 100 billion product of 16 different countries .
?
It ? sreally awesome to see all the work that ? s been achieved up here since our lastflight , ? said Discovery commander Rick Sturckow , who is making his fourth flightto the station .
?
They ?ve added a new solar array and some new modules .
Thestation is something that all the international partners can be very proud offor their contributions .?

Like many fans of Maurice Sendak ’s classic 1963 children ’s book Where the Wild Things Are , I ’ve been curious about how Spike Jonze ’s upcoming live - action movie would expand the original 16 - sentence story to feature - film length .
We get our first extended glimpse of the answer to that question in this week ’s New Yorker , which publishes an excerpt from Dave Eggers ’ novelization of the screenplay that he and Jonze wrote for the movie .
( Eggers ’ McSweeney ’s imprint also announced plans to publish the novelization , titled The Wild Things , in a special $ 28 faux - fur - covered edition in October ; a PETA - approved non-fuzzy edition will cost $ 19.95 . )
In the New Yorker excerpt , “ Max at Sea , ” we get a good deal of backstory and many new names .
There are references to our hero
Max ’s third - grade science teacher , Mr. Malhotra ; to an older sister , Claire , whose tobacco - chewing friends bury Max in his own snow fort , prompting Max to seek prankish revenge ; to his parents ’ divorce some three years ago ; and to his mother ’s chinless new boyfriend , Gary .
Once Max runs away from home ( clad in his white wolf costume , which the much - reviled Gary mistakes for a bunny outfit ) and sails to a distant island , we also get names for some of the previously nameless Wild Things :
The giant rooster is Douglas , the horned creature with red hair is Judith , the bulbous - nosed one is Ira , and the main Wild Thing instigator with the horizontal stripes on his torso is named , improbably , Carol ( but he ’s a guy ) .
As you might expect in any Dave Eggers opus , the story is chock - a- block with the author ’s particular brand of whimsy , often presented in old - fashioned , sometimes precious locutions like this : “ Pâté was a regrettable name for an unfortunate food .
It seemed to Max a good idea to get up from the chair and to leap onto the counter .
Which he presently did . ”
It gets boring constantly beating on the Republican Party for their racism and general intolerance , but it ’s an important feature of our national political landscape .
The occasion of Sen. Edward Kennedy ’s death is an appropriate time to do retrospective pieces on the myriad ways that the upper chamber has changed in the last half - century , but such analysis should mention how the two major parties have changed during that time .
Take a look at the elected officials in the GOP .
There are no black Republican members of Congress .
With the retirement of Sen. Mel Martinez of Florida , there are no Latino Republicans in the Senate .
The only Latino Republicans in Congress are the three Cuban - American representatives from the Miami area .
There are no Mexican Republicans or Puerto Rican Republicans .
Now that Arlen Specter has switched parties , the only Jewish Republican in Congress is Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia .
I ca n’t think of any Republicans of East Asian ancestry other than freshman Rep. Joseph Cao of New Orleans .
There are no openly gay Republicans in Congress .
And consider this :
In the House there are 75 female Representatives .
The Senate has 17 females .
These are the highest numbers of women Members in the history of the Congress .
Of the 17 female Senators , 13 are Democrats and 4 are Republicans .
Of the 75 female Representatives , 58 are Democrats and 17 are Republicans .
The demographics of the country and the degree of female participation in politics have changed dramatically since 1962 when Ted Kennedy was first elected to the Senate .
So , too , has that tolerance for gays and the rights of racial and religious minorities .
But it seems like the Democratic Party has absorbed all of that change , while the Republican Party has been trapped in amber .
The two Muslims in Congress are Democrats .
The two Buddhists in Congress are Democrats .
The three Unitarians in Congress are Democrats .
The only averred atheist in Congress is a Democrat .
The Republican Party is hostile to non-white immigration .
It considers religious tolerance to be an infringement on the free exercise of Christianity .
It opposes gay rights and hate crimes legislation .
And it holds anachronistically paternalistic views of human sexuality and reproductive rights .
Overtly racist comments are made by Republican leaders ( usually unelected leaders ) on a regular basis .
And , finally , the party has an uneasy relationship with science since much of its base rejects basic scientific theories like of evolution , plate tectonics , and climate change .
All of this has resulted in a deeply divided political culture that is rife with the types of disagreements that cannot be resolved by debate and compromise .
When Teddy Kennedy came to the Senate , the two parties were internally split on both regional and ideological matters .
“ When Kennedy came , both political parties in the Senate were internally divided , ” said Don Ritchie , the associate Senate historian .
“ There were as many Eisenhower Republicans as Goldwater Republicans .
There were more liberal Democrats but a sizable number of conservative Democrats .
There was never a party line vote on anything .
There were ideological coalitions rather than partisan coalitions . ”
The Senate still has regional coalitions on many votes , but that is the only area where it still has split votes .
It ’s impossible to do almost anything in the Senate without filing for cloture ( the 60 vote requirement ) .
In 1963 , Mr. Kennedy ’s first full year in the Senate , the leaders filed just one “ cloture motion , ” Senate parlance for the procedure that can end a filibuster by cutting off debate .
Last year , 50 cloture motions were filed .
The emergence of CSPAN and the 24 - hour news cycle have certainly contributed to the breakdown in comity in our political arena .
But the failure of the Republican Party to attract anyone but white ( usually male ) Christians into their coalition is the primary driver of our divisions today .
There ’s nothing wrong with white men from a Christian background , but there is something wrong with a party that is made up almost exclusively of them .
When you add to this insularity a tendency to reject the most basic and important theories in geology , biology , and climatology , you have a party that is incapable of being an honest partner in setting fair and sensible policies for our nation .
In other words , the GOP is broken .
That the Senate is also broken is mainly just a derivative outcome .
Idaho politician wo n't apologize for remarks about hunting tags for President Obama
BOISE , Idaho ( AP ) — Idaho Republican Rex Rammell said Tuesday the hoopla over his remarks about hunting President Barack Obama has been a boon to his campaign , and he again refused to apologize for what he called a joke .
" This country needs to lighten up , " the GOP gubernatorial candidate said during a press conference in a Boise park Tuesday .
Last week , a GOP rally attendee shouted a question about " Obama tags " during discussion of Idaho 's upcoming wolf hunt , where hunters must purchase an $ 11.50 tag as a license to kill a wolf .
Rammell responded , " The Obama tags ?
We 'd buy some of those . "

Working in the dark , dry highlands of Chile with a Nikon D3 digital camera ( 50 mm lens open at f5.6 ) , Serge Brunier and Frédéric Tapissier patched together 1,200 photos of the night sky into the composite that you see above .
While many of the most stunning space images come from huge telescopes or Hubble , Brunier wanted to create photographs of space that were closer to the commonplace human experience of just going outside and looking at the sky .
“ I wanted to show a sky that everyone can relate to — with its constellations , its thousands of stars , with names familiar since childhood , its myths shared by all civilizations since Homo became Sapiens , ” Brunier said in a release .
“ The image was therefore made as man sees it , with a regular digital camera under the dark skies in the Atacama Desert and on La Palma . ”
Each exposure was six minutes long , and the project extended over several months .

The Perl community has a notion of " baby Perl " .
It 's the subset of Perl in which you can write useful , one - off programs without learning how to program Perl .
It 's okay to write baby Perl , but if you come back to a baby Perl program you wrote six months ago and you can't maintain it , that 's because you did n't learn how to write grownup Perl .
Now that 's a divisive , polemic statement -- but assume it 's true for the sake of a more interesting argument .
How can you tell if you 've written baby Perl ?
One tell - tale characteristic is that baby Perl is almost entirely ignorant of the notion of context .
Context is a linguistic component ( important in tagmemics , for future language archaeologists ) which means that the meaning of specific units of speech depends on the interpretation of surrounding units of speech .
There are deep parallels to draw between other computer programmy notions of genericity and polymorphism , but the important point right now in Perl is that the language will do its best to treat expressions as you 've treated them .
If you can parse that sentence , you can understand context in Perl .
( If you can find the single errors in this sentence , you 'll do just fine . )
There are many aspects to context , but one reliable indicator of baby Perl is trying to find the number of elements in an array :
sub count_elements { my $ count = scalar @_ ; return " You passed $ count elements ! " ; }
I 've emboldened the applicable line .
One axis of context in Perl 5 is the distinction between one and many .
You see something similar related to subject - verb number agreement in English : something seem wrong about this sentence , because the number of the verb ( to seem ) does not agree with the number of the noun ( something ) .
The markers for scalar / list context in Perl 5 are different .
In an assignment context , a list ( or aggregate variable ) on the left - hand side of the assignment induces a list context for the assignment .
A scalar on the left - hand side induces a scalar context for the assignment .
The context of the assignment governs the type of evaluation of the right - hand side of the assignment .
That is , if you assign an array to a list , the list will contain elements of that array .
If you assign an array to a scalar , the scalar will contain the count of the number of elements in the array .
There are other rules which govern how various Perl 5 constructs behave when evaluated in list versus scalar context , but I 'm focusing on the specific case of counting the number of elements in an array .
The scalar operator in the example code can serve to disambiguate context , but it 's unnecessary in this case -- clear evidence that someone copied and pasted code without necessarily understanding its purpose .
This code is more likely , however :
sub count_elements { my ( $ count ) = scalar @_ ; return " You passed $ count elements ! " ; }
Note the additional parentheses around $ count .
In Perl 5 , this turns the left - hand side of the assignment from a scalar into a one - element list , resulting in a list context for the assignment and evaluating the argument list in list context .
The scalar is there to disambiguate the context -- but that uses two unnecessary constructs .
My guess is that , in this case , the original author thought that my is a function that requires parentheses around its arguments .
Occasionally this construct appears :
my $ count = $ #array + 1 ;
I 'm not sure why there 's never a scalar there .
The $# sigil of an array produces the index of the final element of the array .
As Perl 5 arrays start at 0 by default ( do n't correct this in the comments -- this is n't PerlMonks ; there 's a karmic penalty here for showing off how clevre you are ) , adding one to that gives the number of elements in the array .
Sometimes it is necessary to find the index of the last element ( though it 's rare ) , but I 've seen books that recommend this idiom .
This is not a joke ; one of them recommended this approach over the documented , clearer , and Perlish " evaluate the array in scalar context " approach claiming that scalar context was " an apparent bug which will hopefully be fixed in a future version of Perl . "
If that 's not an argument for learning Perl before writing about Perl , I do n't know what is .

In an experiment that sounds like a deleted scene from one of the Terminator movies , robots with artificial animal - inspired brains quickly evolved to deceive one another .
The robots — soccer ball - sized assemblages of wheels , sensors and flashing light signals , coordinated by a digital neural network — were placed by their designers in an arena , with paper discs signifying " food " and " poison " at opposite ends .
Finding and staying beside the food earned the robots points .
At first , the robots moved and emitted light randomly .
But their innocence did n't last .
After each iteration of the trial , researchers picked the most successful robots , copied their digital brains and used them to program a new robot generation , with a dash of random change thrown in for mutation .
Soon the robots learned to follow the signals of others who'd gathered at the food .
But there was n't enough space for all of them to feed , and the robots bumped and jostled for position .
As before , only a few made it through the bottleneck of selection .
And before long , they 'd evolved to mute their signals , thus concealing their location .
Signaling in the experiment never ceased completely .
An equilibrium was reached in the evolution of robot communication , with light - flashing mostly subdued but still used , and different patterns still emerging .
The researchers say their system 's dynamics are a simple analogue of those found in nature , where some species , such as moths , have evolved to use a biologist - baffling array of different signaling strategies .
" Evolutionary robotic systems implicitly encompass many behavioral components ... thus allowing for an unbiased investigation of the factors driving signal evolution , " the researchers wrote Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" The great degree of realism provided by evolutionary robotic systems thus provides a powerful tool for studies that cannot readily be performed with real organisms . "
Of course , it might not be long before robots directed towards self - preservation and possessing brains modeled after — if not containing — biological components are considered real organisms .

« Problemi con Fini ?
Situazione evocata dal presidente della Camera , non da me »
Libertà di stampa , Berlusconi da Vespa :
« Troppi farabutti in politica stampa e tv »
« Delinquenziale dire che la libertà di stampa è in pericolo » .
« Su di me è stata lanciata spazzatura »
ROMA - La vera « distorsione » dell ' informazione sta nel fatto che « la Rai , pagata con i soldi dei cittadini , è l'unica azienda televisiva al mondo che attacca una sola parte politica , la maggioranza di governo » .
Non ha affrontato solo il tema della ricostruzione post - sisma in Abruzzo Silvio Berlusconi , ospite di Porta a Porta .
Il premier ha puntato il dito contro la Rai rispondendo a una domanda di Bruno Vespa , che gli chiedeva se non provochi una distorsione nel sistema dell ' informazione il fatto che il presidente del Consiglio , oltre ad esercitare la sua influenza , come altri nel passato su viale Mazzini , sia proprietario anche delle tre maggiori reti private .
Berlusconi ha citato in particolare « tutte le trasmissioni » di informazione , da Annozero a Ballarò a Report , « tutte trasmissioni contro la mia parte politica e contro di me » , ha voluto sottolineare il premier .
« Io ormai - ha aggiunto - non guardo nemmeno più la televisione , perché per la Rai sembra che Berlusconi sia diventato il simbolo di ogni male .
Ma gli italiani lo sanno e , per questo , mi assegnano il 68,4 % del consenso » .
Per questo , secondo il premier , « la manifestazione per la libertà di stampa che la sinistra promuove è veramente il contrario della realtà : siamo circondati nella stampa , nella tv , nella politica da troppi farabutti » è stato l'affondo di Berlusconi .
E poi ancora : elezioni anticipate ?
« Mai. Porterò avanti il mio mandato fino alla fine » .
Solo un accenno alla sua vicenda con le escort , definita « spazzatura che non corrisponde al vero , non ho mai partecipato a festini e non ho mai consentito che qualcosa di irregolare si svolgesse alla mia presenza , sono tutte infamie » .
E infine una spinta alla fiducia : « Gli italiani devono davvero essere sereni .
Siamo un Paese solido , e le banche sono un sistema solido , e stiamo cominciando a risalire » .
CONFLITTO DI INTERESSI -
« Se si riuscisse a individuare una serie di trasmissioni o azioni di attacco politico sulle reti Mediaset , allora si potrebbe dire che c’è un conflitto d’interesse per il premier » , ha continuato Berlusconi .
« Mediaset tratta tutti allo stesso modo , quindi si tratta di accuse comiche .
Dire che in Italia c’è un pericolo per la libertà di stampa » dimostra secondo il Cavaliere « uno spirito antiitaliano » , significa « diffamare la stampa e la democrazia » : « tutti i cittadini italiani di buonsenso credo che condannino questo atteggiamento delinquenziale nei confronti degli interessi di tutti noi e si sappiano regolare nell ’ orientare le loro letture » ha concluso il presidente del Consiglio .
DE GASPERI E FINI - Il premier è quindi tornato ad elencare i successi del suo governo : « Non ho sbagliato - ha detto - quando ho affermato che il mio governo è stato il migliore della storia d'Italia » : quanto fatto dai governi di Alcide De Gasperi , « un padre della patria che ha svolto un compito difficile , in politica interna non è paragonabile a quanto svolto dal mio governo , che in questi 15 mesi è stato il migliore di qualunque altro » .
In tv il premier è tornato anche sui suoi rapporti con il presidente della Camera Gianfranco Fini .
« Non ci sono problemi da parte mia .
È una situazione che è stata evocata dal presidente della Camera .
Io non ho problemi riguardo al funzionamento del Pdl .
Ci sono due concezioni diverse in campo » ha sottolineato .
NESSUN DIALOGO CON L'UDC - « Non c'è stato da parte mia nessun dialogo con Pier Ferdinando Casini e Lorenzo Cesa » ha detto Berlusconi , spiegando che il tema di un'eventuale alleanza con i centristi per le regionali sarà un tema in discussione da parte degli organi del partito » .
QUERELA A REPUBBLICA : «È IL MINIMO » - « Ho fatto un ricorso alla magistratura civile , chiedo i danni per affermazioni false nei miei confronti , e li verserò all ’Istituto San Raffaele .
E’ il minimo che potessi fare dopo cinque mesi di attacchi da un superpartito , con un editore svizzero e un direttore dichiaratamente evasore fiscale » .
Silvio Berlusconi ha spiegato così la querela nei confronti di " Repubblica " , e a Bruno Vespa che osservava come Ezio Mauro abbia già detto di non aver evaso il fisco , replica : « Da Repubblica mi aspetto tutto e il contrario di tutto » .
« AVREI PREFERITO GUARDARE IL MILAN » - Sulla questione di Porta a Porta in prima serata , senza trasmissioni concorrenti il premier si è detto « nettamente contrario allo spostamentoe volevo che si registrasse alle cinque e mezza di pomeriggio , come da accordi , perché sono il proprietario del Milan e il premier avrebbe grandemente voluto assistere alla partita di stasera di Champions League e trepidare per il Milan .
Figuratevi quanto interesse avessi ad avere la prima serata » .
SINISTRA VETEROCOMUNISTA
- Non è mancato , durante la puntata di Porta a Porta , un attacco alla sinistra : « I signori della sinistra sono dei vetero comunisti .
Erano , sono e saranno dei vecchi comunisti .
D'Alema è uno stalinista che è lì da 40 anni » .
Secondo Silvio Berlusconi « loro purtroppo non sono mai diventati socialdemocratici .
Ci vuole un ricambio generazionale e io sono più giovane di tutti questi signori grazie al cervello » .
The author of " The Skeptical Environmentalist , " Bjorn Lomborg , has had public disagreements with climate activists including Al Gore and Sir Nicholas Stern .
Lomborg 's harshest criticism , however , is aimed at the international community for spending billions on what he says are ineffective measures intended to fight climate change .
He talked to Deutsche Welle about ongoing climate negotiations and how economists at the Copenhagen Consensus Center , a think tank he heads , suggest spending aid and development money .
Deutsche Welle :
What do you think will emerge from the climate talks taking place at the United Nations on Tuesday ?
Bjorn Lomborg : First of all , I think it 's important to recognize that probably nothing will come out of this , simply because they are so far away from the different nations on what they want to achieve .
Lomborg , a Danish statistician , questions environmental orthodoxy
It 's always good to talk about the problem , and I think it 's good to reaffirm to everybody that we need a deal in Copenhagen by the end of this year .
The problem is the focus on cutting carbon emissions is actually one that both makes it very hard for everyone to agree because the Chinese and the Indians do n't want to cut and while the Europeans and the Americans claim they want to cut , they actually also know that it 's going to cost them a lot , and it 's going to have very little benefit even in the far - off future .
That 's why they are all playing for the gallery but nobody is actually willing to really commit .
The Chinese leader has said he will present China 's new plans for tackling global warming at the summit .
Is n't that a positive signal ?
It could be .
But let 's remember that the Chinese have been doing a lot of posturing on climate change and coming out and suggesting that we might even see China 's emissions maxing out in 2050 or maybe even in 2040 .
But let 's not base our hopes for a climate deal on things that will happen in 20 or 40 years .
If you had to give tips to the participants , what would you advise them to talk about ?
We 've run what we call the Copenhagen Consensus for Climate , where we ask top economists , including three Nobel laureates " Where do you do the most good for climate with the money you 're going to be spending ? "
Could salt particulates help cool the Earth in the short - term ?
What they told us was do n't focus on cutting carbon emissions .
It 's very expensive and does very little good for the climate even 100 years from now .
In the short and medium - term , we should recognize that nothing we do will change the temperature development except looking into geo-engineering , essentially making the planet cooler - for instance by spraying up salt particulates in the atmosphere , which will amplify natural processes , make more white clouds and hence make the world a little more reflective - especially over the South Pacific .
That would be very cheap and could potentially avoid global warming for the next 100 years .
This is still a Band - Aid , so what you also need to do is more toward a situation where we can actually get people to not just talk about cutting carbon emissions but actually doing so , and we will only do that if cutting carbon emissions and green energy technologies become much , much cheaper .
That 's why their second solution was to focus on making much cheaper green energy technologies - cheaper solar panels , cheaper windmills - that will actually work .
Those two in conjunction is what I would like to see world leaders focus on a lot more , if we actually care about fixing climate change not just making beautiful speeches .
At the moment we also have to concentrate on adaptation to climate change .
Its effects are already becoming very visible .
Where would your priorities lie in that area ?
I 'm referring to top economists , rather than my own private opinions .
What they found is we are very often being told that there is a huge amount of impacts from climate change right now , and it 's certainly true that there are a lot of good pictures out there where you can show here 's a catastrophe .
Lomborg says poverty impacts people 's lives more than climate change
But what we fail to recognize is that the vast majority of the impact that we are seeing right now - climate impacts and other impacts - are impacts that have been there for hundreds of years .
Most of this world 's population is poor and they 're ill - prepared to deal with any contingency that the world throws at them .
What we need to focus on is not just adaption specifically for climate change , which is a small part of the problems most people live with right now , but simply making better lives for people that is focusing on getting them more food , getting them better healthcare and making sure their kids get educated .
The world 's doctors have said failure to tackle climate change in Copenhagen could be catastrophic for health .
Is it possible to separate climate change from issues like health , food security or a safe water supply ?
We do n't need to separate them in the sense that we probably all agree we should tackle some of the really big problems that are out there right now .
I 'm simply concerned that many people latch on to talking about global warming and that the most important this is spending money on adaptation to global warming .
But the main problem in Bangladesh or Myanmar is not future sea - level rises , it 's the fact that the countries are so poor right now that they are already getting inundated .
It 's not about climate - proofing it in 100 years , it 's about dealing with the vulnerability to climate right now , which has nothing to do with climate change but simply something to do with them being very poor .
It 's more about an emphasis on focusing where you can actually deal with real problems right now rather than a possible problem in 100 years .

When ranking the Top 20 quarterbacks for 2009 ( click here to view ) , Carson Palmer came in at # 13 .
He was just outside being drafted as a starter in typical 12 - team formats with injury concerns being the biggest reason why .
He was limited to just four games in 2008 thanks to an elbow injury , which he opted to rehab instead of undergoing Tommy John surgery to correct .
Despite his claims that he ’s recovered from the injury , the fact that there was no surgery to correct the problem has to be a concern .
If that was n’t enough , he ’s been limited to just 11 pass attempts this preseason thanks to a high - ankle sprain he suffered in the opening game .
He claims he ’s prepared .
Coach Marvin Lewis claims he ’s prepared .
It really does n’t matter what everyone says , until he steps onto the field and proves his health , there are going to be questions surrounding his ability .
I ’m not talking about one game .
I ’m not talking about two games .
It ’s going to take a few weeks of good health and good play for him to convince me .
He has n’t had time to work with the new players being worked into the offense like Laverneous Coles , something he should have had in the preseason .
He has n’t had an opportunity to work off any rust he had from such a long layoff .
Basically , he is one long list of questions without any convincing answers .
From 2005 - 2007 he was among the leagues best QBs , making him an ideal gamble .
Anyone with 86 touchdowns and 45 interceptions with over 12,000 yards deserves that respect .
Still , the idea of rolling the dice on him over these first few weeks could be a crushing blow .
Many owners are doing just that , however , thanks to his current ADP of 91.24 , the twelfth QB coming off the board .
He ’s going before :
Ben Roethlisberger ( vs. Tennessee Week 1 )
Matt Hasselbeck ( vs. St. Louis Week 1 )
Eli Manning ( vs. Washington Week 1 )
Palmer , meanwhile , takes on the Broncos .
While he may ordinarily be the best option of this group , he ’d probably be the last one I ’d play this week .
With the length of his layoff , you really can’t expect much from him this first game back .
My prediction for Week 1 :
18 - 28 , 178 yards , 1 TD , 1 Interception .
That ’s an alright line , but it ’s not going to win you anything .
In two or three weeks , my projections for him would probably be significantly better , but you need to give him the time to adjust to the new players in the offense and the NFL game in general .
It ’s been way too long to expect huge things .
My suggestion would be to have him on your bench this week in one quarterback formats .
What about everyone else ?
What are you expecting from Palmer in Week 1 ?
Would you use him ?

VANCOUVER , British Columbia ( Reuters ) -
Three cougars have been killed near the Western Canadian town Princeton , British Columbia , this month while apparently stalking human prey , police said on Tuesday .
Police said that wildlife officers consider the cougars “ killer cats ” because they were young , hungry animals that had lost their fear of humans .
In one attempted attack , a Princeton resident spotted a cougar stalking two young children who were swimming in a river , but was able to shoot the cat before it pounced , the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said .
“ Given the young age of the children the chances of surviving the pending attack would not have been great , ” police said in a statement .
Another cougar was killed while prowling in a campground and another near a park swimming pool , where children were playing .
Princeton is a rural community in the mountains about three hours drive east of Vancouver .
Wildlife experts say that cougars seem to be attracted to young children , possibly by their high - pitched voices and erratic movements , and that the cats may confuse them with the wildlife prey they normally seek .
A two - year - old girl escaped with only minor injuries last month after her mother was able to beat away a cougar that had pounced on the child in Squamish , British Columbia , north of Vancouver .
Those who wish to secure America 's borders from ocelots , pronghorn antelopes , gray wolves , and bighorn sheep scored a victory earlier this month , as an amendment to a Homeland Security bill passed by the House mandates an additional 369 miles of fence that will prevent these animals from crossing the border .
The border wall , which was constructed after waiving three dozen federal environmental laws , is expected to be successful in reducing populations of these and other species , most of whom do not speak English or pay taxes .
The science news site PhysOrg reports on a study for the peer - reviewed journal Conservation Biology , which found that Sonoran bighorn sheep populations north of the border rely on contact with those on the other side of the border to maintain genetic diversity .
A 2007 report in Salon found that habitat fragmentation was also reducing populations of ocelots – a rare species of wildcat that some argue could potentially steal jobs from Americans .
Indeed , the only large mammal whose migration is largely unaffected by the border wall are H. sapiens , whose opposable thumbs and developed neocortex enable them to simply use ladders or dig tunnels under the fence .
Last year , the Federation of American Scientists reported that the US Border Patrol had discovered 93 cross - border tunnels since 1990 .
What 's more , almost half of illegal human immigrants avoided the border wall altogether by entering the US on a legal visa – an option not available to members of other species .
Still , by some measures , the border wall can be considered a success .
Since its construction , there have been no reports of pronghorn antelopes enrolling in public schools , and the number of ocelots working in service industries appears to have been sharply reduced .
according to the Pew Hispanic Center , as many as 45 percent of undocumented foreigners in the United States did n't creep through the desert or float across the Rio Grande in an inner tube : they just overstayed their visas ( the same thing done by at least six of the 9/11 hijackers ) .
Longtime Mathematica user Flip Phillips recently sent us this tremendously amusing error message generated by Mathematica .
Much as you might think when stumbling upon a pickup truck hanging from a tree , your first reaction is probably , “ How does something like that even happen ? ? ”
The answer is powerful , integrated design .
An error message like this is possible only in a system that deeply integrates graphical and symbolic environments , and goes to great lengths to ensure that everything that ought to work , does work .
Flip , unfortunately , did not save anything but a screen shot of the error , so we may never know the exact details of what happened , but it ’s not hard to figure out that a Rotate function was involved .
Rotate is a wrapper that makes a lot of sense in the context of graphics .
For example , you can rotate a rectangle :
You can even make a little slider interface to rotate it by different amounts :
But there ’s no fundamental reason why Rotate should n’t work on everything , including text and mathematical expressions completely outside the context of graphics .
And in Mathematica , we try to ensure that if something should work , it does work , because you just never know when it might come in handy .
So for example you can rotate the result of an integration :
The implementation of Rotate , and similar formatting constructs , is deep and complete .
Rotated objects , for example , are perfectly acceptable as variable names :
Yes of course you can make an interactive version of that too :
Clearly what happened in the case of this error message is something along these lines :
Seen in this context , there ’s really no mystery : this is simply an error message generated in the course of working with rotated objects , perhaps a raster image meant to go inside a graphics object ( which would explain the 2D array of numbers ) .
What the pickup truck is doing in the tree you will have to figure out on your own .
A man accused of a crime is brought into a police interrogation room and sits down at an empty table .
There ’s no polygraph equipment in sight , and the typical two - cop questioning team is n’t in the room either .
Instead , one officer enters the room with a piece of paper and a pencil in his hands .
He sets them in front of the suspect , steps back , and calmly says , “ draw . ”
That ’s a greatly oversimplified description of what could happen in actual interrogation rooms if the results of a recent study in the journal Applied Cognitive Psychology are widely adopted .
The study is the first to investigate whether drawing is an effective lie detection technique in comparison to verbal methods .
Researchers hypothesized that several tendencies would become evident in the scribbles and sketches of liars not found in those of non-liars .
For instance , they suspected that liars , when asked to sketch out the particulars of a location where they had n’t really been to meet someone they had n’t really met , would provide less detail in their drawings .
They also suspected that the drawing would seem less plausible overall , and would not include a depiction of the person they allegedly met .
Finally , they hypothesized that non-liars would use a “ shoulder - camera ” perspective to draw the situation – a direct , line - of - sight view that previous research suggests is more indicative of truth telling .
Liars , they suspected , would use an “ overhead - camera ” perspective , indicating a sense of detachment from the situation .
Subjects were given a “ mission ” that included going to a designated location and meeting a person with whom they would exchange information .
In all , four different missions were conducted .
The particulars of the missions were constructed such that about half of the participants would , when interviewed , be able to tell the truth about what happened , and half would have to lie ( the researchers used a fabricated espionage theme to work this out – very clever ) .
During the interview , subjects were asked questions about their experience , as would happen in a normal interrogation , and also asked to draw the particulars of their experience .
Results of the verbal responses could then be compared to the drawn responses to determine which were more effective in identifying liars .
Here ’s what happened :
No significant differences in level of detail were found between verbal and drawn statements , but the plausibility of truthful drawings was somewhat higher than deceptive drawings .
A similar difference in plausibility was not evident between truthful and deceptive verbal statements .
More interestingly , significantly more truth tellers included the “ agent ” ( other person in the situation ) in their drawings than did liars ( 80 % vs. 13 % ) .
In addition , significantly more truth tellers drew from a shoulder - camera view than liars , who by in large drew from an overhead view ( 53 % vs. 19 % ) .
In verbal statements , more truth tellers also mentioned the agent ( 53 % ) than liars ( 19 % ) .
Using the “ sketching the agent ” result alone , it was possible to identify 80 % of the truth tellers and 87 % of the liars – results superior to most traditional interview techniques .
The main reason drawing seems to be effective in identifying liars is that they have less time to work out the details .
Someone who is telling the truth already has a visual image of where they were and what happened ( even if it ’s not perfect , which of course it never is ) , but liars have to manufacture the details .
It ’s easier to concoct something verbally than to first visualize and then create it on paper .

ABC News reporter Terry Moran caused quite a commotion tonight on Twitter after writing the following : " Pres. Obama just called Kanye West a " jackass " for his outburst at VMAs when Taylor Swift won .
Now THAT'S presidential . "
Although it was n't long before Moran removed it , with over a million followers , the tweet quickly bounced around Twitter through various users .
( And it can still be found here ) .
Now , an ABC spokesperson explains to POLITICO what happened :
In the process of reporting on remarks by President Obama that were made during a CNBC interview , ABC News employees prematurely tweeted a portion of those remarks that turned out to be from an off - the - record portion of the interview .
This was done before our editorial process had been completed .
That was wrong .
We apologize to the White House and CNBC and are taking steps to ensure that it will not happen again .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Senate ’s top legislator on financial regulation favors reducing the number of bank supervisory agencies more sharply than the Obama administration proposes , said a senior Senate aide on Sunday .
Committee Chairman Sen. Christopher Dodd , ranking member Sen. Richard Shelby , and Sen. Robert Bennett gather to hear Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner 's testimony about regulatory reform before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington , June 18 , 2009 .

In a stance that could set up a protracted battle over bank regulation , Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd is among panel members planning to push for the merger of four existing bank supervisors into one , the aide said .
That approach could further delay President Barack Obama ’s drive to tighten oversight of banks and capital markets , a topic expected to headline the September 24 - 25 summit meeting of the leaders of the Group of 20 rich nations in Pittsburgh .
With the global financial system stabilizing after the crisis of late 2008 , world leaders want signs of U.S. progress toward a new regulatory regime , but a set of sweeping proposals from Obama is encountering stiff resistance in Congress .
The president and Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives are proposing a merger of two bank supervisory agencies -- the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Comptroller of the Currency .
They want to leave largely intact the bank oversight functions of two other agencies -- the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
But even this modest approach -- aimed at limiting banks ’ ability to shop around for the most lenient government regulator -- is under attack from bank lobbyists and turf - protecting federal authorities .
Dodd , a Democrat facing a tough reelection battle next year , has been expected by policy analysts to embrace more populist financial regulation reforms as he tries to win additional votes in his home state of Connecticut .
He opted earlier this month to stay on as banking chairman , rather than take over the chairmanship of the Senate health committee left vacant when Senator Edward Kennedy died .
During Kennedy ’s illness , Dodd stood in for his close friend and led Senate Democrats ’ fight for healthcare reform .
He has pledged recently to stay deeply involved on that issue , in addition to tackling financial regulation reform .
White House spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki underscored the White House ’s commitment to doing financial reform this year .
She said , “ President Obama and Senator Dodd share a commitment to passing a bill that will usher in a stronger regulatory structure that closes loopholes , focuses on systemic risk and creates a more robust regulatory agency on behalf of consumers .
“ We recognize there will be many ideas put forward and we look forward to continuing to work with the leadership of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee to get a bill done that accomplishes those goals this year . ”
On other reforms , Dodd has long been skeptical of giving the Fed the job of regulating systemic risk in the economy , another reform proposed by Obama .
Dodd has not ruled out giving the Fed a role in this area , but is still leaning toward a strong role for an inter-agency council of financial regulators , the aide said .
The committee chairman also still strongly supports setting up an independent consumer protection regulator , a position that matches up with that of Obama , who is calling for creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency .

My wife and I are currently in the middle of planning a week long vacation to the east coast .
We ’re doing a driving tour of New England , starting in Niagara Falls , New York , and making our way towards Bar Harbor , Maine .
As we ’ve been planning this trip , I ’ve never been more aware of the fact that sometimes managing money is both an analytical and a psychological pursuit .
I ’ve come to realize more and more that while you can plan for something – budget for it , save up your money , find great deals and be frugal about your expenses – that managing money and making spending decisions also has an emotional and psychological component to it .
If you ’re not careful , one or the other component can take over – and make your decisions become the wrong decisions .
Managing Your Money Analytically
In our family I tend to be the one that likes to look at our finances from a strictly analytical viewpoint .
I like setting up a budget , setting spending and savings goals , and then working towards those goals without thinking about the emotions behind them .
I do n’t like to think about emotions having a role in the family ’s financial decisions , I just want to make decisions based on what is mathematically the best .
What route will mean that we have the most money in retirement ?
Which car will give us the best gas mileage at the lowest price ?
Or in the case of our vacation , what decisions will mean that our trip costs the least amount of money ?
Managing Your Money Emotionally
My wife on the other hand tends to think more about our money decisions in the context of relationship , and how they will affect us emotionally and relationally .
She thinks about the experiences we can have while on vacation , and how it will draw us closer together .
She thinks about the fun we can have doing those activities , regardless of how much they might cost .
She values things to the degree that they are valuable for growing our relationship , and how much they contribute to our emotional well being .
Finding A Balance Between The Two Extremes
I think my wife and I look at money from different viewpoints , and often times those two viewpoints can come into conflict .
I simply want to find the best deal , make analytical decisions and build our bank account .
She on the other hand wants to do things that are fun , grow our relationship and give us common experiences that we can share together .
Both of us can get a bit two focused on our own viewpoint , and not realize that both of our viewpoints are valid , and are necessary in order to have a strong marriage and strong finances .
We both bring things to the marriage that are important and without those things our marriage would n’t be complete .
It brings to mind this verse :
Have n’t you read , ” he replied , “ that at the beginning the Creator ‘ made them male and female , ’ and said , ‘ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife , and the two will become one flesh ’ ?
So they are no longer two , but one .
Therefore what God has joined together , let man not separate . ”
Matthew 19:4-6
The two become one flesh , and through their union they become one complete whole – through Christ .
To me this verse also illustrates how God brings us together and how we designs us to complement each other .
While I may be more analytical about our finances , my wife balances me out and reminds me that sometimes you have to focus on more than just dollar signs .
Sometimes building the relationship is just as important .
My wife likes to focus on the emotional side of money , and building the relationship – but I ’m here to remind her that sometimes we need to be careful about how much we spend .
All of us need to be careful about where we find ourselves in life , and we need to make sure that we ’re not getting too far to one extreme or the other .
We need to watch what we ’re spending , but we also need to take time to enjoy life – and each other .
The key to being successful both in life and in your finances is to find a balance between the two , where you realize the importance of making sound financial decisions , while also being able to sometimes let loose , enjoy each other and just have a good time .
Find a balance between making analytical decisions , and allowing your emotions to play a role , and you ’ll be on your way to success .
What do you think about the balance between analytical decision making and allowing your emotions to play a role as well ?
Do you swing towards one end of the spectrum or the other ?
Do you have someone that helps to balance you out ?
If not , do you think you should ?

Imagine that .
As I thought , " independent " ACORN filmmaker James O'Keefe has a right - wing sugar daddy - Peter Thiel , one of the founders of PayPal .
Via the Village Voice :
James O'Keefe , the activist filmmaker who achieved sudden fame for a series of undercover videos recording ACORN workers , has repeatedly said that he is " absolutely independent " and received no outside funding to make his films .
But the Voice has learned that O'Keefe , in fact , has had heavyweight conservative backers who funded the young filmmaker as recently as a few months before his ACORN films were made .
The ACORN videos are actually just the latest of several films O'Keefe has produced and uploaded to YouTube .
An earlier film posted in February , " Taxpayers Clearing House " featured nonwhite , working class people being duped by O'Keefe , who led them to believe they had won money in a sweepstakes .
That video was produced with the help of a grant -- said to be about $ 30,000 [ Thiel 's spokesman says closer to $ 10,000 -- see update ] -- from Peter
Thiel , one of the founders of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook -- an investment which made him a billionaire .
Thiel is one of Silicon Valley 's more interesting figures : a gay man ( according to Gawker 's " Valleywag " ) who has railed against the evils of " multiculturalism . "
He lives in San Francisco and today runs a hedge fund .
O'Keefe is now well known as the young man who dressed up as a pimp with a colleague , Townhall.com blogger Hannah Giles , who was dressed like a prostitute .
The pair traveled around the country , seeking advice from ACORN workers about how to hide prostitution money for tax purposes .
At five of the offices they visited , ACORN workers gave such advice while O'Keefe 's hidden camera was rolling .
The videos have cost ACORN the support of Congress , the U.S. Census and the White House , and the organization stands to lose tens of millions of dollars in government grants .
O'Keefe , meanwhile , has repeatedly claimed to be financially independent .
In an interview with the New York Post shortly after the ACORN videos hit the Internet , O'Keefe claimed to be " absolutely independent . "
Giles said she had " drained my entire savings " to spend the summer making the undercover videos .
O'Keefe estimated his budget at $ 1,300 , and said that Giles had paid for her own plane ticket to California .
The couple said they lived off of Power Bars and Subway sandwiches for two months .
But O'Keefe turns out to have a substantial history of being funded by conservative figures .
In February , a video called " Taxpayers Clearing House " was posted to YouTube .
In it , O'Keefe and others drive around in a van with a logo on the side that looks like the " Publishers Clearing House " vehicle known for showing up and surprising sweepstakes winners with oversized checks .
In O'Keefe 's video , working class Blacks are shown jumping up and down in excitement - until they learn that O'Keefe is actually delivering a bill for $ 28,000 , their share of the federal banks bailout .
O'Keefe told a friend , Liz Farkas , that he had approached Thiel with the idea for the video , and had walked away with " approximately $ 30,000 " to produce it .
Farkas told the New York Times this week that she and O'Keefe , who met at Rutgers University , clashed over publishing incomplete transcripts from another sting involving an abortion provider .
Through a representative , Peter Thiel confirmed that he had funded " Taxpayers Clearing House " through a " small - government group , " but denied having any involvement with the ACORN videos .
The representative says
Thiel first learned of the new O'Keefe videos after they hit the Internet , and having " watched them on YouTube ... he shares the view that taxpayer money should not promote human trafficking . "
Manchester Airport will be taking legal advice on proposals to send children through its new X - ray scanners .
This is a change from its position , reported in The Register yesterday , that they did not believe the images created by the new scanning technology ( the slightly unfortunately named Rapiscan ) would fall foul of child pornography laws , because they use X - rays and therefore " they do not make an image " .
A spokesman for Manchester airports talked to El Reg this morning .
" Our view is that it does not break the law , " he told us .
" However , since a number of people have been in touch and pointed out that there might be a problem , we have ourselves been in touch with charities working in this area to take further advice .
" We have spoken to Shy Keenan , co-founder of Phoenix Chief Advocates , which works with child abuse survivors .
She agreed that this was a difficult area and that there might be an issue .
" As far as Manchester airport is concerned , we are not in the business of endangering children - our only interest is in making sure all passengers get on the plane safely .
We will abide by the advice given by experts in this area . "
The problem is that the practice of scanning – and checking - children brings together in one activity several of society ’s current obsessions and moral panics .
On the one hand , in order to protect children from the prying eye of paedophiles , the Protection of Children Act 1978 ( pdf ) makes it a strict liability offence to " make " an indecent image of a child .
Indecency is not defined absolutely in law – that is a matter for a jury to decide .
However , the lowest level of " indecency " would not even require nudity , but could consist solely of images deemed to consider " sexual posing " .
" Making " , in law , can cover the simple action of downloading an image from the internet on to a PC .
For most effective use of Rapiscan technology , subjects are likely to be required to keep their legs slightly apart and raise their arms in a near - salute – a pose that devotees of a certain form of NSFW art may well recognise as potentially pornographic .
However , it is likely that the authorities would firmly resist arguments to the effect that sensitivity over child - related issues must lead to a softening of counter - terror measures when it comes to searching children .
In law , a child is any individual under the age of 18 , and in many theatres of terrorist activity , 16 and 17 - year - olds have proven more than old enough to be active participants – while younger children can be used for concealment .
Thus , despite public objections to the searching of chldren , the Met has steadfastly asserted its right to continue to do so .
If children are not scanned at Manchester Airport , they will be frisked in full view of parents and other staff .
All Manchester security staff are security and CRB - checked to the highest level . ®
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Another day , another 7,000 people run out of unemployment benefits .
One month after the House passed a bill extending unemployment benefits , the issue is still being debated in the Senate .
Democratic leaders in the Senate introduced a bill two weeks ago to lengthen benefits in all states by 14 weeks .
Those that live in states with unemployment greater than 8.5 % would receive an additional six weeks .
Senate Republicans want to add several amendments , including one that would pay for the extra benefits with stimulus funds rather than by extending a federal unemployment tax .
While leaders in both parties are trying to negotiate a compromise , Senate Democrats Wednesday took a step to bring the bill to the floor as early as the end of next week .
If it passes , the Senate legislation must then be reconciled with the House version , which extends benefits by 13 weeks in high - unemployment states .
Meanwhile , the bickering has cost people like Crystal Jordan of Dolton , Ill. , their benefits .
The single mother of three ran out in late September .
She is one of the 1.3 million people set to lose their benefits before year 's end if Congress does n't act , according to the National Employment Law Project , an advocacy group .
In October alone , more than 200,000 people will fall off the rolls .
Lawmakers twice lengthened the time people can receive checks to as much as 79 weeks , depending on the state .
Jordan lost her administrative support job in the spring of 2008 .
She had never been unemployed before and has n't been able to find work since , despite sending out 10 resumes a day .
Jordan is also finishing her bachelor 's degree in business management .
She hopes that will give her the edge she needs to find a job in 2010 .
The $ 1,000 check she received every two weeks allowed her to pay the rent and feed her family .
Now , she does n't know how she 'll cover next month 's bills .
" I am fearful we will all end up on the street because I can't find a job and have no income , " Jordan said .
" Everyone 's household is extremely tight at the moment so I cannot lean on friends or family for any support . "
More Americans than ever before are in Jordan 's situation .
More than one in three people who are unemployed have been out of work for at least six months , according to the law project .
The unemployment rate hit a 26 - year high of 9.8 % in September .
" We 're talking about people who 've been unemployed for well over a year , " said Judy Conti , federal advocacy coordinator at the law project .
" If they had savings , it 's gone .
This is their last lifeline . "
Gregg Rock , a business strategy consultant , drained his savings after joining the ranks of the unemployed in summer 2008 .
He was forced to move back to his mother 's home in Huntington , N.Y. , for the first time in more than 20 years .
With so many people looking for work , Rock feels his best chance is land a new job is through networking .
But it costs him $ 18 just to trek into Manhattan , not to mention $ 4 for a cup of coffee at Starbucks , where he often meets people who he hopes will lead him to a job .
Rock 's benefits ran out last week .
Now , he says , he 'll be forced to drive a cab at night or take a bartending job just to earn enough to keep job hunting .
" Unemployment is what allows you to afford to be out there networking , " Rock said .

Long - time readers of Get Rich Slowly know that I 've been waging an ongoing battle against Stuff — the clutter and crap I managed to collect during 20 years of wanton spending and debt .
Though I 've managed to curb my spending ( and have slowed the influx of Stuff ) , I 'm still surrounded by constant reminders of my old habits .
Last week , Colleen wrote to ask for an update on this seemingly - endless war :
I was wondering if you would update us soon on your battle with “ Stuff ” .
I , along with others I 'm sure , struggle with this , and reading your blog has been a great help .
I 'm curious how you 've progressed since the last post when you decided to clean the workshop .
I 'm pleased to report that over the past two months , I 've launched a number of successful campaigns to take control of clutter .
There 's still much work to be done , but I can finally envision a future that is n't filled with useless Stuff .
Here are a few examples of my progress :
Guarding the Guest Room
On Saturday , Kris and I spent several hours cleaning our “ guest room ” .
I put guest room in quotes because for the past two years , it 's been incapable of housing guests .
Instead , it 's been a home for my photography equipment , Kris ' cooking magazines , my board game collection , upcoming Christmas gifts , and more .
It 's just a holding place for Stuff .
This weekend , we decided we'd had enough .
We sorted and purged .
We cleaned .
We re-arranged the furniture .
The toughest part for me was culling my board game collection .
I had to admit that although we used to play games once a week ( or more ! ) , we 're now lucky to play them once a year .
I do n't need 50 board games .
In fact , I 'm sure that next September , I 'll be wondering why I kept 25 board games .
After a few hours of work , we 'd managed to turn a dumpy useless room into an actual guest room .
( We also managed to move all of the science fiction books and comic books into the guest room , freeing up space elsewhere in the house . )
Conquering the Closet
In June , based on a GRS reader suggestion , I set up a year - long experiment .
I moved all of my nice shirts and sweaters from the hall closet to the guest room closet .
Whenever I need something , I go to the hall closet first .
If what I need is there , I wear it .
If not , I pull it from the closet in the guest bedroom .
After I 've worn something ( and it 's been cleaned ) , it 's hung in the hall closet .
After a year has elapsed , the guest bedroom will contain a bunch of clothes I have not worn for twelve months .
I 'll take these things to Goodwill .
Note :
There 's a subtle side - benefit of doing this .
When I can't find what I want in the hall closet , checking the guest room closet is very much like shopping .
This may sound crazy , but it 's true .
Same feelings .
This trick is awesome .
It 's surprisingly liberating .
When I open the hall closet , there are only a handful of shirts — the eight shirts I wear most often .
This makes me realize that most of the other 25 + shirts hanging in the guest room are nothing but clutter .
( I can't evaluate the sweaters yet because the cold weather has n't arrived .
Still , I think it 's safe to assume I do n't need 19 of them . )
Waging War in the Workshop
My biggest victory so far — one that I hope to finally achieve later today — has been the reclamation of my workshop .
When we moved into this house five years ago , I had dreams of learning carpentry in the shop .
Or converting it to a photo studio .
Or something .
Instead , the workshop became a dumping ground for all the crap I 'd managed to accumulate .
( And continued to accumulate . )
At the beginning of this summer , the building was packed to the gills with computer parts , record albums , magazines , and boxes of useless junk .
After weeks of slow progress , however , I 've managed to reduce the mess to a single bench .
It will take me several hours to sort these last few difficult piles — but once I do , the workshop will be a homey place to pursue my hobbies .
Fighting the Good Fight
Though I 've achieved some major victories in recent months , my war against Stuff is not over .
There are some tough battles ahead .
But I 'm a veteran now .
I 'm confident that I 'll emerge victorious .
It seems like I always end these posts with a list of lessons learned .
Today is no different .
Here are some of the things I 've been thinking about lately :
The best way to fight the battle against Stuff is to prevent new Stuff from entering your home .
If you continue to acquire new Stuff , you just make it that much more difficult to turn things around .
( It was difficult for me to learn that “ free ” Stuff is rarely actually free . )
It 's best to convert your Stuff to cash , no matter how little that cash might be .
I used to think I had to get what my Stuff was “ worth ” .
This is a great idea , and I encourage those who have time to do so , but extracting maximum value from Stuff requires a lot of effort .
I 'd much rather sell my Stuff on Craigslist or on eBay or at a garage sale .
Do n't be afraid to give your Stuff away .
Though it 's best to get money for it , there 's nothing wrong with donating your Stuff to charity — or giving it to friends who can use it .
One man 's Stuff is another man 's treasure ( or something like that ) .
If it 's possible to outsource your Stuff , then do so .
Why should I own thousands of books when there 's a public library down the street ?
Why buy DVDs when I can use Netflix ?
Why purchase CDs when I can buy songs through iTunes ?
By outsourcing my Stuff , there 's less clutter in the house .
However …
Beware : Digital Stuff can be almost as insidious as physical Stuff .
I have thousands of digital photographs , tens of thousands of mp3s ( legal mp3s ) , 20 + years of Word and text documents , as well as a vast array of other data .
This digital Stuff is nearly impossible to organize .
If possible , organize your digital Stuff as you go .
Focus on quality .
Sometimes there 's a thin line between stuff that is Stuff and stuff that is useful .
The difference often comes down to Quality .
I 've learned that I 'd much rather pay more for Quality that will last a lifetime ( or most of one , anyhow ) than to save a bit now but end up with Stuff later .
When I started this battle two years ago , it was difficult for me to imagine getting rid of any of my Stuff .
At that time , I had over 3000 books .
Since then , I 've managed to trim my library by more than half .
But this did n't happen all at once .
Every six months or so , I get rid of another batch of books .
Purging Stuff is like peeling the layers of an onion .
You gradually shed layer after layer after layer .
As you strip away the trappings of your old life , you come to realize that all you really need are the bare essentials .
Everything else is just Stuff .

Autistic player 's dream comes true as he scores his first touchdown
Winfred Cooper , an Elgin High School student scored the game - tying touchdown during a JV football game last weekend against Lake Park High School .
Winfred Cooper , an severely autistic Elgin High School student , scored his first - ever touchdown during a JV football game against Lake Park High School last weekend .
During a junior varsity football game between Elgin and Lake Park high schools , Elgin would sometimes put in a player who lined up far off the line of scrimmage .
Lake Park coach Nana Agyeman noticed this , and during halftime , he talked to Elgin 's head coach , Dave Bierman , about it .
He learned the player , Winfred Cooper , has severe autism .
" Well , " Agyeman told Bierman , " if you want to throw him the ball , just let us know . "
Bierman was skeptical , questioning whether Cooper would catch the ball .
But he and the coaches decided to give him a shot .
After all , Cooper is a beloved member of the team , it 's his senior year and he rarely gets to play .
So the coaches from both teams concocted a play called " Driver Driver , " named after Green Bay Packers wide receiver Donald Driver .
In the second half of the Sept. 12 contest , with Lake Park leading by a score of 6 - 0 , Cooper was put in the game .
The Driver Driver play was called .
The ball was snapped .
Cooper ran to an open spot , and a wobbly pass was thrown his way .
The coaches cringed as their eyes followed the ball into the air .
Cooper extended his arms ... and caught it .
Elgin 's sideline erupted with cheers , and his teammates jumped up and down and screamed as Cooper raced full - sprint down the field .
The fans , and even the Lake Park coaches , were cheering , too .
Cooper wove past a few Lake Park defenders , avoided a well - choreographed tackle attempt by Lake Park 's Mike Schenone , and went 67 yards into the end zone to tie the game 6 - 6 .
All of Cooper 's teammates ran into the end zone after him , jumping up and down and slapping his helmet .
The coaches choked back tears as they watched Cooper celebrate in the end zone with his teammates , doing his trademark dance , something called " The Winfred Shuffle . "
Some players danced along with him .
" It was the best thing I 'd ever seen , " said his father , Winfried Cooper Sr. of Elgin , who got teary - eyed watching his son's first - ever touchdown from the stands of Elgin 's Memorial Stadium and the " Rudy " - like scene that followed .
" That was his moment , right there .
Everyone hugged him as he came off the field , and he just would n't let go of that ball . "
" Just his face , " added Bierman .
" You want to see a picture of happiness and joy ?
There it was . "
Cooper - or " Coop " as his teammates call him - was given the game ball .
His dad said he 's slept with it in his arms every night .
He 's also re-watched the highlight tape from that game dozens of times .
While at first his coaches were hesitant to publicize the touchdown , not wanting to lessen Cooper 's sense of accomplishment , his father said his son was excited to share his story .
" I ran really fast .
When I scored a touchdown , I was excited that I scored a touchdown , " said the 18 - year - old Cooper .
" Some people are talking about my touchdown at school .
They respect me and like me . "
Cooper was the big man on campus in the week that followed , as his classmates congratulated him on his big play .
Cooper tells everyone he 's going to the University of Michigan on a football scholarship now ( he 's not , but he is applying to the school ) , and he told his dad he 's ready for an athletic shoe endorsement deal .
Winfred Cooper is the middle child of three boys .
He did n't speak or make eye contact as a child , and at age 2 he was diagnosed with severe autism .
He entered a special school , but as he got older , his father pushed for him to be in the mainstream classes .
At Elgin High School , he 's worked hard to achieve his 3.6 GPA , which landed him in the National Honor Society .
He gets extra time to take tests , but that 's the only special concession he gets , his father said .
Cooper is a popular student and volunteers in the lunchroom , runs on the track team , raises money for children with autism ( he 's doing a T - shirt sale later this fall ) , and leads his football team in prayer during their weekly team dinners .
" He is a really great kid , " his father said .
" There 's nothing in the world he would n't do to help people . "
Given all the bad sportsmanship that 's made headlines recently , the coaches saw this as a teaching opportunity for the players .
It taught them that winning does n't matter if you can provide someone with a moment like that .
" There was a greater victory that morning , " Lake Park head coach Andy Livingston said .
Lake Park did end up winning the game 13 - 6 , and afterward , Livingston could n't hold back tears as he talked to his players .
He shared the words Bierman said to him after the game : " Thank you .
You made that young man 's career . "
" I 've been doing this a long time , and I do n't think I 've ever seen anything cooler than this , " Livingston said .
" Vince Lombardi would crack a smile , and probably a tear , at this . "
( CNN ) --
The ever - changing cast of " Saturday Night Live " is getting two new faces , but losing a couple of current members .
Michaela Watkins was known for her impressions of Barbara Walters and " Today " show co-host Hoda Kotb .
Michaela Watkins and Casey Wilson have been dropped from the show , while Jenny Slate and Nasim Pedrad are joining the cast , Entertainment Weekly reports .
Watkins -- who joined " SNL " mid-season last year and was known for her hilarious impersonations of Barbara Walters and Kathie Lee Gifford 's suffering " Today " show co-host Hoda Kotb -- said she was shocked by the firing .
In an interview with EW , she recalled getting the news from Lorne Michaels , the creator and executive producer of " Saturday Night Live . "
" I do n't think anyone knows what Lorne Michaels was thinking , " Watkins told the magazine .
" The only explanation I got from him -- and he's not known to say things just to make people feel better -- was that he felt deep down that I should have my own show .
And I agreed .
' SNL ' was a dream come true for me .
It was a fantastic year .
I do n't have any regrets . "
Watkins told EW she thinks the new hires will be " exquisite " on the show and said she would take Michaels ' advice to pursue her own show .
Meanwhile , " SNL " veteran Darrell Hammond is still negotiating for a return to the show , Variety reports .
" Saturday Night Live " kicks off its 35th season on September 26 .

Barack Obama , winner of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize , is planning another war to add to his impressive record .
In Afghanistan , his agents routinely extinguish wedding parties , farmers and construction workers with weapons such as the innovative Hellfire missile , which sucks the air out of your lungs .
According to the UN , 338,000 Afghan infants are dying under the Obama - led alliance , which permits only $ 29 per head annually to be spent on medical care .
Within weeks of his inauguration , Obama started a new war in Pakistan , causing more than a million people to flee their homes .
In threatening Iran - which his secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , said she was prepared to " obliterate " - Obama lied that the Iranians were covering up a " secret nuclear facility " , knowing that it had already been reported to the International Atomic Energy Authority .
In colluding with the only nuclear - armed power in the Middle East , he bribed the Palestinian Authority to suppress a UN judgment that Israel had committed crimes against humanity in its assault on Gaza - crimes made possible with US weapons whose shipment Obama secretly approved before his inauguration .
The old dog whistle test
At home , the man of peace has approved a military budget exceeding that of any year since the end of the Second World War while presiding over a new kind of domestic repression .
During the recent G20 meeting in Pittsburgh , hosted by Obama , militarised police attacked peaceful protesters with something called the Long - Range Acoustic Device , not seen before on US streets .
Mounted in the turret of a small tank , it blasted a piercing noise as tear gas and pepper gas were fired indiscriminately .
It is part of a new arsenal of " crowd- control munitions " supplied by military contractors such as Raytheon .
In Obama 's Pentagon - controlled " national security state " , the concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay , which he promised to close , remains open , and " rendition " , secret assassinations and torture continue .
The Nobel Peace Prize - winner 's latest war is largely secret .
On 15 July , Washington finalised a deal with Colombia that gives the US seven giant military bases .
" The idea , " reported the Associated Press , " is to make Colombia a regional hub for Pentagon operations . . . nearly half the continent can be covered by a C - 17 [ military transport ] without refuelling " , which " helps achieve the regional engagement strategy " .
Translated , this means Obama is planning a " rollback " of the independence and democracy that the people of Bolivia , Venezuela , Ecuador and Paraguay have achieved against the odds , along with a historic regional co-operation that rejects the notion of a US " sphere of influence " .
The Colombian regime , which backs death squads and has the continent 's worst human rights record , has received US military support second in scale only to Israel .
Britain provides military training .
Guided by US military satellites , Colombian paramilitaries now infiltrate Venezuela with the goal of overthrowing the democratic government of Hugo Chávez , which George W Bush failed to do in 2002 .
Obama 's war on peace and democracy in Latin America follows a style he has demonstrated since the coup against the democratic president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , in June .
Zelaya had increased the minimum wage , granted subsidies to small farmers , cut back interest rates and reduced poverty .
He planned to break a US pharmaceutical monopoly and manufacture cheap generic drugs .
Although Obama has called for Zelaya 's reinstatement , he refuses to condemn the coup - makers and to recall the US ambassador or the US troops who train the Honduran forces determined to crush a popular resistance .
Zelaya has been repeatedly refused a meeting with Obama , who has approved an IMF loan of $ 164 m to the illegal regime .
The message is clear and familiar : thugs can act with impunity on behalf of the US .
Obama , the smooth operator from Chicago via Harvard , was enlisted to restore what he calls " leadership " throughout the world .
The Nobel Prize committee 's decision is the kind of cloying reverse racism that has beatified the man for no reason other than he is a member of a minority and attractive to liberal sensibilities , if not to the Afghan children he kills .
This is the Call of Obama .
It is not unlike a dog whistle : inaudible to most , irresistible to the besotted and boneheaded .
" When Obama walks into a room , " gushed George Clooney , " you want to follow him somewhere , anywhere . "
Extreme and dangerous
The great voice of black liberation Frantz Fanon understood this .
In The Wretched of the Earth , he described the " intermediary [ whose ] mission has nothing to do with transforming the nation : it consists , prosaically , of being the transmission line between the nation and a capitalism , rampant though camouflaged " .
Because political debate has become so debased in our media monoculture - Blair or Brown ; Brown or Cameron - race , gender and class can be used as seductive tools of propaganda and diversion .
In Obama 's case , what matters , as Fanon pointed out in an earlier era , is not the intermediary 's " historic " elevation , but the class he serves .
After all , Bush 's inner circle was probably the most multiracial in presidential history .
There was Condoleezza Rice , Colin Powell , Clarence Thomas , all dutifully serving an extreme and dangerous power .
Britain has seen its own Obama - like mysticism .
The day after Blair was elected in 1997 , the Observer predicted that he would create " new worldwide rules on human rights " while the Guardian rejoiced at the " breathless pace [ as ] the floodgates of change burst open " .
When Obama was elected last November , Denis MacShane MP , a devotee of Blair 's bloodbaths , unwittingly warned us : " I shut my eyes when I listen to this guy and it could be Tony .
He is doing the same thing that we did in 1997 . "

Phoenix , AZ -
The virus research team at anti-virus software maker Symantec announced the first sighting of the kanye.w virus in the wild .
The virus uses a JavaScript exploit in Internet Explorer 8 to infect the user 's computer .
Tom Stillman of Symantec said , " The virus has been spread in an email that says ' click this link if you think Kanye is a jackass . '
The virus so far has a 98 % click rate among users exposed to the email .
I mean even Obama thinks he 's a jackass , he 'll probably get infected too . "
The virus infects the user 's media player be it iTunes , WinAmp or Windows Media Player and randomly interrupts songs with a rude message from Kanye West , like " Beyonce has a much better song than this " or " You do n't care about black people " or one of many other Kanye catch phrases .
Stillman said that interrupting a media player to play a Kanye clip is a first for a virus .
" These days viruses just try to turn your computer in an arm of a botnet , or spam node .
This virus is just cruel .
What kind of virus writer is this ?
How could he be so heartless ? "
Microsoft and Apple are promising patches for their media players , and anti-virus makers are updating their virus definition files to take care of the virus , but the infestation is expected to be widespread .
Related News Jury Clears " Email Forwarder " Killer on Justifiable Homicide Serial Killer Trademarks " iPhone Killer , " Wants Abuse of Term to Stop Blue Screen of Death Wanted in Murder of Overclocker " Face it , most computer users are morons who can't update their software without calling in the Geek Squad .
How can we expect them to avoid such a clever virus as this ? " said Stillman .

The big investment banks , and Goldman Sachs is the biggest of them , have feasted on public money and , now , restored to strength , are throwing themselves back into the markets as recklessly as ever - only more so .
The big US investment banks are not just symbolic of the greed and excess of the pre-crisis craze .
They were instrumental .
They created , sold and traded the derivatives the world later came to know as " toxic assets ' ' .
But now , after restoring themselves with emergency government loans , they have repaid the US Treasury and rushed back into the markets .
Goldman reported a record profit for the three months to the end of June of $ US3.4 billion ( $ 3.9 billion ) .
And the company - where average employee pay is $ US700,000 - set aside a record $ US11.4 billion for staff bonuses for the first half of the year alone .
Guess where the firm made its biggest profit ?
From trading all the Treasury bonds the US Government issued to pay for the $ US787 billion stimulus it injected into the economy to save it from the financial crisis .
Criticism of its bonuses sent Goldman 's chief , Lloyd Blankfein ( 2007 salary plus bonus : $ US70 million ) , out to give a contrite speech .
But behind the facade , his firm was betting the bank once again .
The percentage of the firm 's assets that could be wiped out in a single day - a metric known as " value at risk " - zoomed up by 20 per cent in the first quarter of this year and by a further 33 per cent in the second , to reach a new record high for the company .
This illustrates the first of the great systemic problems .
It 's called " moral hazard " .
Meaning ?
If you think you are completely safe from any risk , you will behave recklessly .
Goldman's , like most banks and investment banks around the world , has just seen what happens if you take absurdly dangerous risks .
Answer : you make out like bandits .
The Government rescues you if anything goes wrong and the boss even gets to keep his job .
One US investment bank was allowed to fail outright .
Lehman Brothers .
This was the event that took a Wall Street crisis and made it a global one .
Officials will be extremely wary about letting any big institution fail in future .
Moral hazard , already big before the crisis , has become giant .
The G20 will pretend that curbing bankers ' pay and raising capital requirements will solve the problem .
It will not .
The incentive to take maximum risk has only increased .
The other great flaw is the problem of bubbles .
Every decade or so , a huge asset bubble develops .
That is , a dangerously big bulge in the price of shares or real estate .
Japan 's land and share bubble of the 1980s wrecked the world 's second biggest economy .
The US housing bubble of 2003 - 07 wrecked the world 's biggest economy , taking the global economy down with it .
Each bubble formed when central banks allowed money to become too cheap .
When interest rates are so low that money is , essentially , free , people abuse it .
A bubble follows .
Disaster is only a matter of time .
The world 's central bankers have been programmed to be vigilant against inflation in the prices of goods such as bread and petrol , but to ignore inflation in the price of assets such as shares or real estate .
They must be reprogrammed .
But they are deeply invested in the old orthodoxy .
Australia 's Reserve Bank has been one of the most forward thinkers on this .
The president of the New York Federal Reserve , Bill Dudley , is also campaigning on it : " I think that this crisis has demonstrated that the cost of waiting to clean up asset bubbles after they burst can be very high , " he said in June .
" That suggests we should explore how to respond earlier . "
Eminently sensible .
But he is having great difficulty persuading the majority of the members of the central bank fraternity , who prefer to dwell in doctrine than reality .
And this problem is not even in the purview of the G20 leaders .
It 's a failure of central bankers around the world .
So guess who has been left to fix it ?
Central bankers .
So far , they are not making much headway .
Yet until these problems are fixed , we simply guarantee that , in five or 10 years , we will see another global financial crisis , but probably on a bigger scale .

In the vast majority of instances where an application is removed from Windows Marketplace for Mobile , users of this application will continue to be able to use these applications on their phones .
In the rare event an application from Marketplace exhibits harmful behavior or has unforeseen effects , Marketplace has the capability to remotely uninstall these applications .
While we hope to avoid this scenario , we will make refunds available in such cases .
As part of their upcoming launch of Marketplace for Mobile , Microsoft will be including a kill switch .
However , unlike Apple , who has a similar tool for their App Store , Microsoft is removing the application from the phone if the application becomes unapproved in the Market .
Quote : –
If an application is approved but later removed from the marketplace it will then be automatically removed from all mobile devices .
In the past , any application downloaded to a Windows Mobile phone would continue to be there , regardless of the application .
It was possible for the creator to kill the application if they so chose , but it was common knowledge that the user who downloaded that application still had the rights to use it .
While any user or developer who goes through Marketplace will agree to such a feature when they accept the EULA , this will create some serious questions when a paid - for app is wiped clean .
Will a user who paid for an app receive a refund if their application is wiped clean ?
Will the developer or Microsoft be responsible for the refund ?

David Miliband thrusts himself back into the debate over Labour 's future today as he puts forward " my pitch " and issues a coded message to the 58 - year - old Prime Minister : " ' Future ' is the most important word in politics . "
The Foreign Secretary , who remains one of the most likely people to lead Labour after the election , challenged Gordon Brown to use his last conference before the vote to show the " vision " necessary to avert catastrophic defeat .
And on the eve of the conference in Brighton , it emerged that Sue Nye , the closest member of the PM 's inner circle beyond his wife , Sarah , is planning an exit from Downing Street amid claims that she is unhappy about the increasing influence of a younger member of the No 10 war room .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Ms Nye , at Mr Brown 's side for more than a decade , is being lined up for a peerage and is in need of " some distance " and a " change of scenery " from the tension of Downing Street .
Insiders said the PM's gatekeeper and head of government relations was " really fed up " with the promotion of Kirsty McNeill , 28 , from speechwriter to head of external affairs .
Mr Miliband made clear in an interview with The Independent on Sunday that he was positioning himself at the front of the pack in the event of the Prime Minister 's resignation .
While insisting he was " joining the Gordon Brown stays as PM campaign " , his use of the word " future " will be seen as a thinly veiled challenge to Mr Brown to start preparing for a succession .
Mr Miliband 's comments – at the start of a week in which Mr Brown will try to position himself to fight off another possible coup attempt – echo his challenge to the PM in the summer of 2008 when he called for " renewal " .
At conference this week , the Foreign Secretary said , the party needs to " fight the myth that New Labour does n't have ideas and that the Government has not got serious and innovative thoughts about the future " .
The Prime Minister is under pressure to hand the leadership over to a younger , fresher successor and , in what will be seen as a pointed message to Mr Brown , Mr Miliband said : " I now think ' future ' is the most important word in politics . "
He added that " my pitch " for the future of Labour and the country was to satisfy the " modern aspiration for control " .
The Foreign Secretary said that the Brighton conference was an opportunity for Mr Brown to " show what you stand for for the future " .
He added : " The future is the key , and that means having a mental map that is looking forwards not backwards . "
The Chancellor , Alistair Darling , joined in the grim warnings about the future , warning that Labour – from Mr Brown down – has lost " the will to live " and risks handing power to the Tories without a fight .

Mr Brown reveals today that he will legally oblige all future governments to reduce Britain 's debt mountain in an attempt to achieve a sustainable recovery .
But , while building in years of severe spending cuts – and potential tax rises – he will also pledge to help the " squeezed middle classes " who , he claims , have suffered most in the recession .
" These are the people who I identify with , " the Prime Minister told the Sunday Telegraph .
But the latest attempt to revive Labour came as a survey suggested that the party could be permanently out of power .
You Gov claimed a haul of only 200 seats at the next election , combined with Tory plans to slash the number of constituencies , and the loss of dozens more Labour seats if Scotland gains independence , could leave the party with no chance of forming a majority again .
Fellow cabinet ministers will use the conference to demand that Labour get ready to " fight " the toughest election campaign against the Tories in 18 years .
The Secretary of State for Wales , Peter Hain , writing in the IoS , says Labour is not ready for the fight .
Ed Balls , the Secretary of State for Children , said : " What we need is more fighters , not quitters . "
Ms Nye 's name is said to be on a provisional list of Labour peers , which has been delayed for months , allowing her departure from No 10 .
A Downing Street spokesman said : " It 's not true that she is leaving .
She is going to be planning the election campaign .
She is not thinking of an exit , and has no active plans for a peerage . "
However , after the story broke last year that Stephen Carter , then head of strategy at No 10 , was planning to leave and was in line for a peerage , Downing Street issued a denial .
Yet a month later , Carter was moved to a ministerial post in the House of Lords .
Meanwhile , the profitable post - Downing Street life of Tony Blair goes on .
According to a report in The Sunday Times , devotees and admirers who attend his lecture tour events are paying £ 180 a pop to have their photographs taken with the Great Man .
On Oct. 1 , the United States and other great powers will restart talks with Iran , a new round in a long and so far fruitless effort to stop Tehran ’s march toward nuclear weapons .
This may be the most important diplomacy President Obama has attempted -- a test of his policy of “ engagement ” with adversaries , with war and peace in the balance .
The negotiators have been here before .
In earlier rounds , the Iranians made vague statements about world peace , said they needed more time to consider U.N. Security Council demands that they stop enriching uranium and then , after several months , quit returning the West ’s phone calls .
( Literally .
According to one diplomat , European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana placed call after call to Tehran and got no answer . )
This time , though , the Obama administration and its allies say they ’re determined to prevent a repeat performance .
“ We are not willing to be played , ” said a top U.S. official involved in the talks but not authorized to speak publicly .
How will the U.S. and its allies make this round different ?
First , by insisting on action , not words .
Iran will have to slow its work on nuclear technology in some tangible way -- if not the full enrichment freeze the West has been asking for , something else .
“ The measure of [ the negotiating process ] is that it affects their nuclear clock , ” the U.S. official told me .
Second , the negotiators will set a deadline for Iranian action : the end of the year , with no wiggle room .
“ The end of the year means the end of the year , ” the official stressed .
Advertisement
That remorseless nuclear clock is very much on the administration ’s mind .
U.S. officials say they believe Iran could achieve “ breakout capability ” -- the ability to quickly build a nuclear weapon -- in one to three years .
There ’s also an Israeli clock .
When Iranian leaders say they ’d like to remove Israel from the map , Israelis -- a sensitive people when it comes to their existence -- take it literally .
Israel - watchers believe Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will give the great powers until next summer or fall to get results .
After that , the likelihood of an Israeli military strike against Iran goes up .
Is the Israeli threat real ?
Nobody knows .
But the U.S. and its allies are using it to concentrate everyone ’s mind , like the prospect of a hanging .
The October talks are designed to enable the Western powers to start a clock of their own : action from Iran or else “ crippling sanctions , ” in Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s words .
That message is n’t directed only at Iran but to the players who have been reluctant to impose sanctions in the past : Russia , China and the European countries whose banking , insurance and oil companies would lose business as a result .
On that front , there are signs that more nations are seeing things our way .
Germany , once balky , has joined hawkish France and Britain to support tougher measures .
Even Russia , officially opposed to sanctions , is keeping its options open ; President Dmitry Medvedev said last week that he could imagine circumstances in which more sanctions would be needed .
Obama ’s decision to scrap missile defense projects in Poland and the Czech Republic appears to have brought the Russians a little closer on the Iran issue , although the administration insists that was n’t the reason for the move .
Advertisement
The problem with sanctions , though , is that nobody knows whether they will work .
The Iranian regime , now thoroughly in the hands of hard - liners who do n’t rely on the business class for political support , seems to care even less about the damage wrought by sanctions than it did before .
“ They just do n’t give a damn , ” said Ray Takeyh , an Iran expert at the Council on Foreign Relations .
But when sanctions are the main tool in your toolbox , sanctions are what you use .
The Obama administration has been waging Iran diplomacy on other fronts .
The Security Council is likely to pass a U.S. - backed resolution stating that countries that violate U.N. rulings on nuclear proliferation ( as Iran has ) will lose their right to pursue peaceful nuclear energy .
The point is to strengthen the argument for more sanctions and show Iran that it ’s running out of friends .
Also , the U.S. and Israel believe they have won Russian agreement to hold off on selling advanced antiaircraft missiles to Iran .
Netanyahu reportedly made a secret trip to Moscow to warn that those missiles would force Israel into a “ use it or lose it ” situation : strike at Iran ’s nuclear installations now or lose its chance forever .
The Russians backed off for now .
The October talks will draw controversy over whether they help legitimize the Iranian regime .
Obama ’s GOP critics , stepping up their overall critique of his foreign policy as too soft , will accuse him of making concessions to Iran , just as they accused him of making concessions to Russia on missile defense .
Obama aides say these are n’t concessions , they ’re decisions based on the U.S. national interest .
The legitimacy of Iran ’s regime , they add , will be determined on the streets of Tehran , not in a European conference room .
Advertisement
Those are defensible positions .
But there ’s nothing wrong with concessions if they lead to greater results in return .
The confrontation with Iran is moving into a critical period .
To Iran ’s nuclear technology clock , and Israel ’s existential threat clock , add a third clock : Obama ’s promised results clock .
The clocks are running .

US Supreme Court term begins with more threats to democratic rights
By John Andrews
12 October 2009
With the traditional opening of the new term on the first Monday of October , the United States Supreme Court , now firmly under the control of right - wing Chief Justice John G. Roberts , Jr. , is poised to overrule decades of established precedent .
The court appears ready to dismantle many of the remaining protections for democratic rights established during the middle of the twentieth century , one of the few periods when the high court did not function openly as an instrument of political and social reaction .
Ignoring tradition , on September 9 the court heard re-arguments in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission , a case remaining from last term .
As noted by the World Socialist Web Site and other publications , several justices seem ready to declare unconstitutional any attempt by Congress to limit political contributions by corporations , although such laws have been upheld since they were first enacted in 1947 .
( See : “ US Supreme Court set to ease rules on corporate campaign cash ” . )
With newly confirmed Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor holding the seat vacated by David Souter , the Supreme Court began with oral arguments on October 5 in Maryland v. Shatzer , yet another vehicle for the high court to cut back on the landmark Miranda v. Arizona ruling of 1966 by allowing police to return and question criminal suspects who previously invoked their constitutional right to remain silent .
The case follows on last term ’s Montejo v. Louisiana , which overruled precedent that prohibited police investigators from interviewing a criminal suspect who already had legal representation .
The conventional wisdom is that Sotomayor will not affect the court ’s ideological balance because , like Souter , she is considered a judicial “ moderate ” by contemporary standards .
There is some reason to believe , however , based on her background as a prosecutor and her decisions when a judge on the federal Court of Appeals , that she will vote more favorably than Souter for police powers and against the rights of those accused of crimes .
The most significant case for democratic rights argued last week is Salazar v. Buono .
The plaintiff sued for the removal of an eight - foot - high cross erected years ago as a memorial to US war dead on a remote desert outcropping in the massive Mojave National Preserve — federal land located in Southern California .
A United States district judge issued an injunction to remove the cross .
To avoid the ruling , in 2004 Congress passed a law conveying the land directly under the cross to the Veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) , with a provision that the land will revert to the United States if no longer maintained as a war memorial .
Elena Kagan , the Obama administration ’s new solicitor general , argued in favor of maintaining the blatantly sectarian religious symbol on what remains , effectively , federal land .
The purpose of the 2004 enactment is obviously to skirt the First Amendment , which opens the US Constitution ’s Bill of Rights with the statement , “ Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . ”
Salazar is the first “ Establishment Clause ” dispute to be heard by the Roberts court .
Joined by the other George W. Bush appointee confirmed by the Democratic - controlled Senate , Associate Justice Samuel Alito , as well as Associate Justices Antonin Scalia , Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy , Roberts seems to have a clear five - vote majority in favor of scuttling decades of precedent enforcing the “ wall of separation between church and state , ” as Thomas Jefferson described the Establishment Clause in a famous 1802 letter .
While most of the justices at the October 7 oral argument seemed to be groping for a narrow , technical ground on which to base a decision , Scalia bullied his way forward in the typical result - oriented , intellectually dishonest and highly offensive manner one expects from this so - called intellectual leader of the Supreme Court ’s right - wing bloc .
This included the following remarkable exchange with the plaintiff ’s lawyer , Peter Eliasberg , of the Southern California American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) .
Eliasberg : I think it would be very odd indeed for the VFW to feel that it was free to take down the cross and put up , for example , a statue of a soldier which would honor all of the people who fought for America in World War I , not just Christians , and say : “ Well , we were free to do that because even though there ’s the sign that says this cross is designated to honor all the — ”
Scalia :
The cross does n’t honor non ‑Christians who fought in the war ?
Is that — is that —
Eliasberg : I believe that ’s actually correct .
Scalia :
Where does it say that ?
Eliasberg :
It does n’t say that , but a cross is the predominant symbol of Christianity and it signifies that Jesus is the son of God and died to redeem mankind for our sins , and I believe that ’s why the Jewish war veterans —
Scalia :
It ’s erected as a war memorial .
I assume it is erected in honor of all of the war dead .
It ’s the — the cross is the — is the most common symbol of the resting place of the dead , and it does n’t seem to me — what would you have them erect ?
A cross —some conglomerate of a cross , a Star of David , and , you know , a Moslem half moon and star ?
Eliasberg : Well , Justice Scalia , if I may go to your first point .
The cross is the most common symbol of the resting place of Christians .
I have been in Jewish cemeteries .
There is never a cross on a tombstone of a Jew .
( Laughter . )
So it is the most common symbol to honor Christians .
Scalia : I do n’t think you can leap from that to the conclusion that the only war dead that that cross honors are the Christian war dead .
I think that ’s an outrageous conclusion .
Eliasberg :
Well , my — the point of my — point here is to say that there is a reason the Jewish war veterans came in and said we do n’t feel honored by this cross .
This cross ca n’t honor us because it is a religious symbol of another religion .
Scalia , who claims to be guided exclusively by the original intent of the framers and a “ strict construction ” of the Constitution , has no problem with congressional approval of a Christian symbol on federal land .
Rulings in Salazar and the other cases argued so far are expected early next year .
There are about 50 more pending matters on the Supreme Court docket , which is less than usual at the outset of a term .
The number of high court cases has been declining for years .
Attracting the most media interest so far is McDonald v. City of Chicago , in which the Supreme Court will decide whether its recent decision that the Second Amendment “ right to bear arms ” prohibits the District of Columbia from banning handgun ownership applies to state and local governments as well .
( See “ The reactionary politics of the Supreme Court ’s ‘ gun rights ’ decision ” . )
It seems unlikely that the Supreme Court majority will pass up this new opportunity to give a political boost to the reactionaries who comprise the Republican Party “ base . ”
There is only one national security case thus far , Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project , which turns on the constitutionality of laws criminalizing “ material support ” to foreign groups labeled terrorist organizations by the US government .
Such statutes have been used repeatedly in political prosecutions over the last decade , particularly to victimize Muslim charities , which provide relief to Palestinians and others oppressed by imperialism and Zionism .
Migliaccio v. Castaneda is a particularly horrific case .
A man detained on immigration charges died due to the deliberate failure of federal prison authorities to treat a cancerous lesion on his penis for eleven months .
The Obama administration is arguing that the responsible federal officials cannot be sued individually even if the denial of medical care violated the Constitution .
There are two cases , Graham v. Florida and Sullivan v. Florida , in which juveniles were sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole , one for a crime committed at 16 and the other at age 13 .
Neither offense was murder .
The punishment is being challenged as violating the “ cruel and unusual ” provision of the Eighth Amendment .
That such a question can even be debated among high court judges demonstrates the erosion of democratic rights in the US .
The outcome is unclear .
Four years ago the Supreme Court held by a narrow 5 - 4 vote that the death penalty cannot be applied to juvenile offenders .
One notable feature of this term ’s docket is the high number of cases — almost half — involving seemingly esoteric business issues , such as whether hedge fund strategies can be patented and whether court rulings denying corporate claims of attorney - client privilege are immediately appealable .
Many of these cases are of immense importance to corporate interests , which see in the new court an opportunity to further weaken legal restraints on their profit - making activities .

A T - cell infected with HIV ( Image : LBN )
Almost 26 years after HIV was discovered to be the cause of AIDS , a vaccine has at last shown signs of protecting people .
Results of the RV144 trial on 16,000 volunteers in Thailand show that those receiving the vaccine reduced their risk of HIV infection by about a third – the first evidence that a vaccine might work .
The two largest previous vaccine trials , in 2003 and 2007 , failed , and that had researchers wondering if there would ever be an effective vaccine .
So is this result – announced on Thursday by the US National Institutes of Health , which funded the trial – the momentous breakthrough we ’ve been waiting for , or are the results too modest to get excited about ?
New Scientist takes a look .
How excited should we be ?

It is extremely encouraging that , at last , a vaccine has shown signs of providing protection .
The reduction in risk of infection is not huge – 31 per cent : male circumcision reduces the risk of infection by double that , for comparison .
The real significance is that there was any measurable effect at all after researchers had begun to lose hope that a vaccine would ever work .
Why did they think a vaccine would never work ?
HIV continually mutates and evolves , so even if someone had been vaccinated against earlier variants , subsequent mutants may go unnoticed , multiply and overwhelm the immune system .
Also , HIV is unusual in that it attacks the very white cells that are meant to fight disease .
One fear from the earlier “ STEP ” vaccine trial – now dispelled – was that by stimulating the immune system , vaccines simply generate extra white blood cells for HIV to infect , making the situation worse .
To the relief of vaccine researchers , more recent investigations showed this was n’t what happened , reviving hopes for vaccines generally .
How powerful is the new vaccine ?
The figures indicate only a slender protective benefit ( PDF ) .
Of 8197 vaccinated volunteers , 51 became infected , compared with 74 of the 8198 who received a dummy vaccine .
The investigators say that the 31 per cent reduction risk is statistically significant , however , meaning that it was probably down to the vaccine – not other , random factors that raised protection in the treated group , such as better self - protection with condoms and avoiding unsafe sex generally .
Do they know yet how it protected people ?
No .
The next step is to find out by analysing samples from volunteers .
One slightly worrying finding is that people who did become infected had similar levels of virus in their blood whether or not they ’d been vaccinated .
This suggests that if vaccinated people do get infected , their immune systems still struggle to combat the virus .
Subsequent investigations by the researchers should reveal what effect , if any , the vaccine had on people ’s immune systems .
How was the vaccine meant to work ?
The vaccine was a combination of two separate components .
The first , called Alvac , is a harmless form of the virus that causes canarypox loaded with genes that make three key HIV proteins : env , gag and pol .
The hope is that the immune system produces white blood cells which recognise these viral proteins in a real infection and make antibodies to combat HIV .
As well as four shots of Alvac , volunteers received two booster shots of the second component , Aidsvax , a genetically engineered version of the gp120 protein found on the surface of HIV .
Was the vaccine safe ?
Yes .
No side effects .
When did the trials start , and who organised them ?
The trials began in 2003 and ended in 2006 , and were run by the Thai Ministry of Public Health in collaboration with the US Military HIV Research Program , based in Rockville , Maryland .
The trial was paid for by the office of the US army Surgeon General , with logistical and research support from the NIH .
The main vaccine , Alvac , was produced by Sanofi Pasteur , the French - based pharmaceutical giant , and Aidsvax by Genentech of the US .
Ironically , Aidsvax used alone was one of the earlier vaccine failures .
What happens next ?
The researchers will analyse the results in detail to assess how the vaccine worked , if at all : the results will have to be peer - reviewed and published to convince other AIDS researchers that the effects were genuine .
The investigators will also need to assess how many HIV strains the vaccine will protect against – it was designed against the subtype B and E strains of HIV common in Thailand , although B is also the commonest in the US .
Clearly a vaccine is still some time away , and this one may only be effective against a limited number of strains .
Indeed .
We do n’t know exactly how the vaccine performed , and whether other factors may have played a part in the result .
For example , how much of the difference in infection rates was simply down to chance ?
And a big worry about any vaccine is that it will encourage recipients to mistakenly think they ’re immune , so they engage in riskier sex .
So , a vaccine ’s some time off .
What do we do in the meantime ?
There are other types of treatment and protection under investigation .
Antiretroviral drug treatment ( ART ) already provides excellent protection to those who receive it , virtually eliminating the virus from the body .
The problem has been making sure that all infected individuals receive ART , especially in Africa .
One proposal that has great potential but is very expensive is to give people ART as soon as possible after they ’ve been infected , instead of waiting until the concentrations in their blood of the CD4 cells targeted by HIV fall below a pre-selected threshold .
Backers of the “ instant treatment ” approach say that it would eliminate the virus from circulation far faster , reducing the opportunities for infected people to infect others .
ART could even be taken prophylactively , before infection .
Any other promising treatments ?
One of the most encouraging approaches is to try to stop the virus getting into white blood cells via a molecule on the surface called CCR5 .
If cells lack this molecule , the virus ca n’t invade them .
So some companies are developing drugs and treatments based either on blocking CCR5 with drugs or eliminating it from people ’s white blood cells through gene therapy , effectively rebuilding people ’s immune systems from scratch so that HIV ca n’t invade their cells .
Another novel gene - therapy approach tried recently is to inject muscles with viruses carrying genes for antibodies that are especially potent against HIV .
So can we beat HIV ?
Probably , but it ’s an open question how long it takes to produce a “ universal ” vaccine that works against all strains of HIV .
Even aside from today ’s encouraging result , there are other rays of hope .
One recent breakthrough was the discovery of an extremely vulnerable region of the HIV virus , providing a target for new and far more effective vaccines .
But it will take years and lots of research to get there .
In the meantime , the virus marches on .
Every day , 7000 people become infected , and thousands more lack the ART drugs they need to survive , especially in sub-Saharan Africa .
Only last month , the conventional wisdom was that North Korea was showing promising new signs of moderation , what with Kim Jong Il 's parley with Bill Clinton , the release of two American journalists and some South Korean hostages , and a highly publicized meeting between a Pyongyang diplomat and New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson .
On Friday , the charm offensive ended .
In a letter to the U.N. Security Council , the North announced that " reprocessing of spent fuel rods is at its final phase and extracted plutonium is being weaponized . " ...
Congratulations !
You ’re out in the real world , living on your own , holding down your own job , building your career one day at a time .
You made it through high school , through college , through the job hunt , and now you ’re here : at work !
But you ’re not entirely comfortable , are you ?
Something is slightly wrong with the world , but you ca n’t put your finger on it .
You like your job , more or less .
You like your company and coworkers , more or less .
Your career seems to be on track .
And yet you feel anxious , out of place , rudderless .
I think I know what ’s bothering you .
The Past
The first twenty years of your life have almost no similarity to the rest of your life , and the rest of your life can be a very long time .
The crucial difference is that for the first twenty years of your life , your existence is highly structured , more than you ever realized .
Every year , you move up a grade in school .
Every year , you get a “ promotion ” complete with a new job title : Freshman , Sophomore , Junior , Senior .
You get a new set of classes with new teachers , with new classmates .
You get to choose some or all of your classes , every semester .
You receive individual grades for each class , for each paper and test !
Middle school , high school , college , grad school .
You know the whole process from an early age , and there ’s little question about your future .
You can look ahead five , ten , fifteen years and know exactly where you ’ll be .
And there is a profound security in that kind of knowledge .
The Present
You ’re at work .
You were hired for a particular job for a particular boss at a particular company … and nothing ’s changing .
Title
You have the same job title , year after year .
If you are just starting out as a Junior Researcher or Assistant Developer , then maybe after one or two years you ’ll get to be a regular Researcher or Developer .
But then what ?
You may go five or ten years before you get another change in job title : Senior Researcher , Special Developer , etc .
In school , your “ title ” changed every year , and that change carried with it a sense of progress , a sense of change and growth and importance .
Now , you have no idea when you might be promoted , and it depends on the economy , on your coworkers , on your boss or clients or a hundred other things you ca n’t control .
This can be frustrating .
Feedback
In school , you got grades on everything .
Gold stars , check marks , letter grades , numerical grades , report cards , SAT scores .
Constant , measurable feedback on how well you were doing on every little thing .
You can develop a very clear picture of yourself with that much feedback .
Good or bad , the knowledge is reassuring .
But now , there are no grades .
You submit reports and hear nothing back .
You write drafts and get minor editorial notes .
You develop software applications and just get tasks crossed off your To - Do list .
At most , your boss says , “ Good work ” in passing .
An entire year passes in this manner , during which time you feel adrift , nervous , uncertain .
Hoping that you ’re doing well , hoping your contributions are being noticed and will be rewarded .
Finally , you have a performance review , an awkward and semi - formal meeting in which your one little mistake is blown out of proportion and you ’re too nervous to remember all of your accomplishments .
Activities
Your life in school prepared you in just the wrong way for your life at work .
In early school , your classes are chosen for you , the class material is outlined by the government ( of all things ) .
In later schools , you have some say in which classes you take , and what sports or arts you ’re involved in .
Then in college , a world a freedom !
Of choice !
You can pick all of your classes , pick your major , even invent a major !
Study abroad , switch from economics to veterinary science just by filling out a form , play sports , start clubs , join a fraternity , take summer and winter classes .
You ’re in charge of everything !
Then you get a job , and suddenly , all of that freedom is gone .
At work , you do what you are told to do , on someone else ’s schedule , to someone else ’s standards , regardless of whether you think it ’s the right thing in the right way .
You have just fallen from the pinnacle of being in control to the depths of being controlled .
The Future
As I said , back in school you knew the shape of your future : where you would be , and when .
But now , who knows ?
You can hope for a cost - of - living raise , you can hope for a performance bonus , you can hope for a promotion , but the bottom line is that you do n’t know if they will ever happen , not for certain .
Sometimes at interviews , you ’re asked , “ Where do you see yourself in five years ? ”
This is one of the most ridiculous questions imaginable in our day and age .
When you consider the unpredictable nature of our global economy , and the radical impacts of new technologies , it becomes more and more impossible to predict the future .
Whole industries are springing into existence every day , and whole industries are becoming obsolete , albeit a bit more slowly .
Unless you work in the military or the government , there is a high likelihood that you will work for many different companies in many different roles , reinventing your career and your goals as often as every five years .
Some people find that fact unsettling , even frightening .
Others find it exciting .
The bottom line is that you start working as early as 20 and could still be working at 70 , or later .
That ’s 50 years of totally unstructured career time .
50 !
Take a moment to consider how much time that really is , how much time you will spend muddling along and figuring things out for yourself .
How to Cope
Be patient .
The first thing you need to do is accept the fact that working life plays out much more slowly than school life .
There are fewer changes , and they can be quite far apart .
This is normal .
The first thing you need to do is accept the fact that working life plays out much more slowly than school life .
There are fewer changes , and they can be quite far apart .
This is normal .
Be yourself .
Stop comparing your career path to those of your friends , your peers , and especially your parents .
You are none of those people ; you are you .
It does n’t matter if you ’re in the exact same job as someone else .
Your life , your work , your career is a completely unique thing of your own creation .
It will play out at its own rate , in its own way .
Focus on yourself , and let others take care of themselves .

Your life , your work , your career is a completely unique thing of your own creation .
It will play out at its own rate , in its own way .
Focus on yourself , and let others take care of themselves .
Be flexible .
There is no way to predict what sorts of challenges or opportunities will arise for you , personally .
Just being in the right room at the right moment could mean the difference between getting an exciting new assignment , or suddenly ( and unpleasantly ) realizing that you want to find a new job , or a new career path .
Pay attention to the big picture , and remain open to the possibilities that present themselves .
Want something more concrete ?
Here are two examples from my own life :
I went to college to become an aerospace engineer , and left with a BA in English Literature .
I have no idea whether one is any better than the other .
I only know that I graduated with the skills and knowledge to support myself and my family in a career I enjoy , which is really all that matters .
I took a job as an executive assistant .
It was just supposed to be a way to pay the bills until I found a “ really good ” job , but I discovered a way to turn it into a “ really good ” job and spent the next six years publishing books and journals as an editor and artist for that same company .
Take the time to reassess what you are doing and your reasons for doing it .
Where do you think your career is going , and why ?
Are you happy with where you are and your apparent progress along your career path ?
School taught you to follow a plan .
But in life , and at work , no plan survives first contact with reality .
The ability to adapt ( and a sense of humor ) will take you farther than any plan .

Worried about nasty tropical weather ?
Be glad you 're not on Saturn 's moon Titan .
Astronomers have discovered a storm system on Titan the size of India .
It popped up in April 2008 in the moon 's tropics , a latitude belt not known for cloudiness .
The storm , reported in the latest edition of the journal Nature , is another " a- ha " moment as scientists try to figure out how Titan 's bizarre atmosphere works and the forces responsible for sculpting the moon 's surface .
" These types of dramatic global weather events on Titan are rare and only last a few weeks , " notes Henry Roe , an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona and member of the team reporting the results .
The events suggested an atmosphere whose storm systems can significantly disturb Titan 's equivalent of Earth 's jet streams , triggering cloudiness elsewhere .
It also helps explain why the surface in the tropics appears heavily sculpted by liquids despite the general dearth of clouds , the team suggests .
The European Space Agency 's Huygens probe in 2004 returned pictures of what looked liked stream beds and other features seemingly carved by liquid on Titan 's surface .
Their structures implied they had formed under heavy downpours , much like what one sees in the US 's desert Southwest .
An early Earth ?
Indeed , the longer researchers stare at Titan , the more Earth - like its processes appear – processes playing out right before their telescopes ' and spacecraft 's sensors .
" It 's really surprising how closely Titan 's surface resembles Earth's , " noted Rosaly Lopes , a planetary scientist at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , Calif . , at a recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Brazil .
" Titan looks more like the Earth than any other body in the solar system , despite the huge differences in temperature and other environmental conditions . "
Titan is bigger than Mercury .
It 's the only moon with a dense atmosphere – 98 percent nitrogen .
And it 's bitterly cold .
The average temperature at the surface is - 179 degrees Celsius ( - 290 degrees Fahrenheit ) .
On Earth , water is a major sculpting agent .
On Titan , water is frozen hard as a rock ; the sculpting agent is liquid methane and ethane , which rains out of clouds composed of these hydrocarbons .
The moon 's atmosphere is thought to resemble that of Earth early in its history .
This has raised the question of whether Titan is a spot in the solar system where chemical reactions that form the foundation for organic life are taking place .
Some researchers suggest that simple forms of microbial life could exist beneath Titan 's crust .
Cloudbursts of liquid methane
Clouds are important tools for studying a planet 's atmosphere , but on any given year , clouds cover roughly 1 percent of Titan 's disk versus 65 percent for Earth .
After noteworthy sightings of clouds on Titan in 1995 and again in 2004 , a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii , the Lowell Observatory , and the California Institute of Technology mounted a two - year program to track the moon 's clouds .
They used NASA 's Infrared Telescope Facility on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano .
In April 2008 , a large cloud system appeared , the team reports .
For lead investigator and University of Arizona planetary scientist Emily Schaller , " it was Titan 's little present to me . "
Her newly minted PhD from Caltech involved the study of Titan 's clouds , but for most of the time she was gathering data for it , " nothing much happened , " she recalls .
Then , the day she handed in her work , the storm appeared .
To the researchers ' surprise , the vast storm system appeared in the tropics where it is rarely cloudy – its trigger unknown .
In addition , it apparently spawned cloud formation near the south pole – during a season when the south polar region should be cloud - free .
Cloudbursts of liquid methane are not the only forces shaping Titan 's surface .
At last week 's IAU meeting , scientists described volcanic activity , with slush - like mixtures of water ice and ammonia – a natural antifreeze – replacing scorching lava .
In addition , researchers presented models for mountain - building on Titan where mountain ranges resulted from the surface getting squeezed as it cooled and contracted .
The surface also hosts the Titan equivalent of wind - drive sand dunes , as well as hydrocarbon lakes .
Hot -rodding Factor with typed functions , SIMD , and data-map
Factor 's gained a number of features and libraries recently to help it deal efficiently with large sets of binary data .
Typed functions
Factor 's compiler can take advantage of all the type information at its disposal to eliminate type checks and dynamic dispatch .
However , since Factor is a dynamic language , very little type information usually survives past a function call ; values can't walk across the function 's borders as free integer s or float s but must be smuggled through the call site inside hidden compartments of vans labeled object .
Factor has some existing features to avoid this :
For small functions , you can tear down the wall by inline - ing the function at its call site .
However , inlining is inefficient for large functions that get used in multiple places .
If you like to play fast and loose , the Factor compiler has some hooks to let you make unchecked assertions about the types of values in your code , but these hooks are unsafe , and no one should use them or know about them .
Forget I said anything .
Given these inadequate choices , I wrote a typed library which wraps the aforementioned compiler hooks in a safe and easy to use syntax .
You can define a TYPED : function like so :
USING : typed math ; IN : scratchpad TYPED : add - floats ( a : float b : float -- c : float ) + ;
The add - floats function will check its inputs before executing , converting them to float s if it can and throwing an error otherwise :
( scratchpad ) 1 2+1/2 add - floats .
3.5 ( scratchpad ) " lol " " wut " add - floats .
Generic word > float does not define a method for the string class .
Dispatching on object : " lol "
When add - floats is called from another function , its type checks are inlined into the caller , so if the compiler can see that add - floats ' inputs are going to be float s , it can eliminate the checks .
The actual body of the function is compiled under a hidden name with the unsafe type declarations applied .
After the call to the hidden typed function , the output value types are declared in the calling function , allowing the compiler to further optimize the caller 's code .
We can see the compiler in action using its optimized .
diagnostic function :
( scratchpad ) USE : compiler.tree.debugger ( scratchpad ) [ 2.0 3.0 add - floats 5.0 * ] optimized . [ 2.0 3.0 ( typed add - floats ) 5.0 float * ]
The compiler knows that 2.0 and 3.0 are float s , so it does n't emit code to check them before calling ( typed add - floats ) ( the hidden function that implements add - floats with type specializations ) .
The compiler likewise knows that the result of add - floats will be a float , so multiplying it with 5.0 can be done with the specialized float * function instead of the generic * operator .
One cute thing to note is that typed is a completely self - contained Factor library .
Nothing needed to change in the Factor VM or compiler to make it work .
SIMD support
Slava and I worked together to add support for hardware vector types to the language and compiler .
Applying Factor 's library of vector operations to objects of special fixed - size array types such as float - 4 or short - 8 now generates code that uses the SSE machine instructions of modern Intel processors .
Together with first - class struct and binary array objects and typed functions , it 's possible to write reasonably - performing vector code in a high - level style .
For example , the new math .
matrices .simd library implements fast 4x4 matrix math using code like this :
STRUCT : matrix4 { columns float - 4 [ 4 ] } ; : columns ( a -- a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 ) columns >> 4 firstn ; inline TYPED : : m4.v ( m : matrix4 v : float - 4 -- v' : float - 4 ) m columns :> m 4 :> m3 :> m 2 :> m1 v first m1 n*v v second m2 n*v v+ v third m3 n*v v+ v fourth m4 n*v v+ ;
We can load math .
matrices.simd and look at the compiler 's code generation for m4.v with the test - mr. function :
( scratchpad ) USING : math.matrices.simd typed.debugger ; ( scratchpad ) \ m4.v typed - test-mr .
=== word : ( typed m4.v ) , label : ( typed m4.v ) _label 0 _prologue
T{ stack - frame { total - size 32 } } _label 1 ##gc RAX RCX 32 { } { } f ##peek RAX D 1 ##peek RCX D 0 ##unbox - any - c-ptr RBX RAX RDX ##alien - vector XMM0 RBX 0 float - 4- rep ##alien - vector XMM1 RBX 16 float - 4- rep ##alien - vector XMM2 RBX 32 float - 4- rep ##alien - vector XMM3 RBX 48 float - 4- rep ##alien - vector XMM4 RCX 10 float - 4- rep ##shuffle - vector - imm XMM5 XMM4 { 0 0 0 0 } float - 4- rep ##mul - vector XMM5 XMM5 XMM0 float - 4- rep ##shuffle - vector - imm XMM0 XMM4 { 1 1 1 1 } float - 4- rep ##mul - vector XMM0 XMM0 XMM1 float - 4- rep ##add- vector XMM5 XMM5 XMM0 float - 4- rep ##shuffle - vector - imm XMM0 XMM4 { 2 2 2 2 } float - 4- rep ##mul - vector XMM0 XMM0 XMM2 float - 4- rep ##add- vector XMM5 XMM5 XMM0 float - 4- rep ##shuffle - vector - imm XMM4 XMM4 { 3 3 3 3 } float - 4- rep ##mul - vector XMM4 XMM4 XMM3 float - 4- rep ##add- vector XMM5 XMM5 XMM4 float - 4- rep ##inc-d - 1 ##allot RAX 32 byte- array RCX ##load - immediate RCX 128 ##set- slot-imm RCX RAX 1 6 ##set - alien - vector RAX 10 XMM5 float - 4 - rep # #replace RAX D 0 _label 2 _epilogue T{ stack - frame { total - size 32 } } ##return _spill - area - size 0
( typed - test - mr . is a version of test - mr . that examines the secret function for a TYPED : definition . )
The preamble and postamble code are a bit bulkier than they would be for a similar C function , setting up GC roots at the beginning and allocating a new memory block at the end , but the heart of the function is about as good as it gets : load the four matrix columns and vector into registers ( # #alien - vector ) , broadcast each element of the vector in turn ( # # shuffle - vector - imm ) , multiplying it against the corresponding matrix column ( # #mul - vector ) and summing the results ( # #add - vector ) , finally storing the final result in the newly allotted memory block ( # #set - alien - vector ) .
The vector values fly around in vector registers until it 's time for the final result to land in its final memory location .
Doug Coleman has also used Factor 's SIMD support to implement the SIMD Fast Mersenne Twister algorithm in the random .
sfmt library .
He purports to get performance within a fraction of a second of an equivalent C++ implementation .
data-map
4x4 matrices and random number generators are nice , but the bread and butter purpose of SIMD is to accelerate the processing of large amounts of data .
Slava plans to add some auto-vectorization support so that operations like v+ on packed binary arrays use SIMD operations .
But as a general solution , auto - vectorization gets tough for both the compiler and developer to deal with .
Even in mature vectorizing compilers , if you plié when the compiler expects you to jeté , the compiler will throw up its hands and vomit scalar code in disgust .
As an alternative to auto-vectorization in Factor , I 've been experimenting with a macro to make it easy to write explicitly vectorized code , which I 've given the working title data - map .
It can take objects of any of Factor 's packed binary array types as inputs and map over their contents from any C type to any other C type .
You can also grab input values in groups and map them to groups of output values .
This makes it easy to express tricky vector operations that would be tough or impossible to trick a C compiler into auto-vectorizing .
Here 's an example that packs an array of floating - point pixel values into byte - sized pixel values :
USING : alien.c-types alien.data.map generalizations kernel math.vectors math.vectors.conversion math.vectors.simd specialized - arrays typed ; SIMDS : float int short uchar ; SPECIALIZED -ARRAYS : float float - 4 uchar - 16 ; IN : scratchpad TYPED : float - pixels > byte- pixels ( floats : float - array -- bytes : byte-array ) [ [ 255.0 v*n float - 4 int - 4 vconvert ] 4 napply [ int - 4 short - 8 vconvert ] 2 bi@ short - 8 uchar - 16 vconvert ] data - map ( float - 4[ 4 ] -- uchar - 16 ) ;
The above code grabs four float - 4 vectors at a time from the input array and crams them into one uchar - 16 vector , first scaling the four inputs from 0.0 – 1.0 to 0 – 255 ( 255.0 v*n float - 4 int - 4 vconvert ) , then packing both pairs of int vectors into two short vectors ( int - 4 short - 8 vconvert ) , and finally packing the two short vectors into a single uchar vector .
The machine instruction that the vconvert operation maps to handles saturating values below 0 and above 255 for us .
data - map can also iterate over multiple input arrays in parallel .
Here 's another pixel - pushing example that folds planar R , G , B , and A data into a single RGBA image :
USING : alien.c-types alien.data.map kernel locals math.vectors math.vectors.simd specialized - arrays typed ; SIMDS : uchar ; SPECIALIZED -ARRAYS : uchar -16 ; IN : scratchpad :: vmerge - transpose ( a b c d -- ac bd ac bd ) a c ( vmerge ) b d ( vmerge ) ; inline TYPED : RGBA - planes > RGBA ( r : byte - array g : byte - array b : byte - array a : byte- array -- rgba : byte - array ) [ vmerge - transpose vmerge - transpose ] data - map ( uchar - 16 uchar - 16 uchar - 16 uchar - 16 -- uchar - 16 [ 4 ] ) ;
The ( vmerge ) function maps to SIMD instructions that interleave the contents of two vectors .
By applying it twice to our four input vectors we get four interleaved vectors we can store to the destination buffer .
data - map still has some shortcomings .
All the above examples assume that the input arrays are an evenly divisible size of the input grouping .
data - map does nothing to deal with the tail end ; currently , you 'd need to find and handle it yourself .
data - map also does n't offer a solution for iterating over potentially misaligned subsequences of packed arrays , where you would also want to handle the unaligned head of the incoming slice separately before passing the aligned part the vectorized main loop .
However , as is , it 's been useful enough to accelerate the terrain generation demo from needing a five - second warmup to starting nearly instantly .
As I try to apply it to more complex problems , I 'll be tweaking the design to make it more general .
✻ ✼ ✻
Of course , Factor is still primarily a dynamic language , and it does nothing to stop you from slipping a type - opaque function call into your inner loop and kicking its performance down from C++ to Python levels .
It still takes some arcane knowledge of the compiler 's abilities to get it to generate fast code .
But having typed function definitions , a rich set of object types that map to CPU types , and control flow constructs that work with typed data makes Factor 's fast path a lot easier to access .
Workplace Discrimination : Transgender Woman Urges Lawmakers to Pass Reforms Should Discrimination on Gender Identity Be Legal ?
Ga. Court to Decide .
Sept. 25 , 2009  --
When Vandy Beth Glenn , formerly Glenn Morrison , was summoned to her boss 's office Oct. 16 , 2007 , she was not prepared for the exchange that followed .
" He asked me if what he had heard was true : did I really intend to come to work as a woman ?
I told him yes , it was true . "
Glenn , a transgender woman preparing for a sex - change procedure at the time , told ABCNews.com she expected her boss would " do the right thing . "
Instead , Sewell Brumby , legislative counsel for the Georgia General Assembly allegedly told Glenn she was no longer suitable for her job .
" Mr. Brumby told me that people would think I was immoral .
He told me I would make other people uncomfortable , just by being myself .
He told me that my transition was unacceptable .
And over and over , he told me it was inappropriate . "
Then , Brumby fired Glenn .
" I 'm not sure I was really thinking anything in that moment other than utter shock , " Glenn told ABCNews.com .
" That he was so matter of fact about it blew my mind . "
The subsequent federal lawsuit brought by Glenn and Lambda Legal , a gay , lesbian and transgender advocacy group , has drawn national attention and renewed debate over the necessity of the Employment Non-Discrimination
Act currently pending in the House of Representatives .
The bill would make discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity illegal across the country .
By all accounts , Glenn , 30 , had performed well in her role as a legislative editor , proofing Georgia bills and resolutions for grammar and readability for over two years .
" Everyone agrees her performance was good , " said Glenn 's attorney Cole Thaler .
This firing was " not performance based ... and the other side agrees . "
Now , Glenn wants her job back and is awaiting a decision in her case from the Federal District Court in Atlanta .
" I am not seeking any money in my lawsuit , " she told House lawmakers Wednesday at a hearing on employment discrimination .
" I am asking for just one thing : to be given my job back .
I love that job , I can do it well , and I never want another transgender person to experience the discrimination I 've endured . "
Reached at his Georgia office by phone Thursday , Brumby declined to comment on the case or the events that led to it .
Brumby 's lawyer did not return calls from ABCNews.com for comment .
Lawmakers Weigh Expansion of Anti-Discrimination Law
At issue in Glenn 's case is whether or not discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity is unconstitutional .
Georgia law does not explicitly prohibit the practice .
Existing federal law prohibits employer discrimination based on age , sex , race , religion , national origin and disability -- but not sexual orientation or gender identity .
Still , Glenn 's attorney says those protections apply in this case .
He argues Glenn faced discrimination based on sex or " sex stereotypes " and based on her diagnosed medical condition -- situations which are prohibited under existing law .
Glenn currently receives treatment for " gender identity disorder " – a classification recognized in the American Psychological Association 's " Diagnostic and Statistical Manual " – and is undergoing treatment to transition to living as a woman .
" It 's a misconception that gender transition is a one - step process , " Thaler told ABCNews.com .
" The timing varies from person to person , and Vandy Beth had been in counseling and receiving hormone therapy , " prior to her firing .
Her immediate supervisor had been aware of Glenn 's condition and was " supportive . "
But in October 2007 , as Glenn prepared to " present 24/7 as the woman she identifies with , " her supervisor informed Brumby that Glenn intended to come to work dressed as a woman .
It was shortly thereafter that Brumby summoned Glenn to his office and fired her .
House lawmakers are currently considering the Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- a bill that would make discrimination against gays , lesbians and transgender people explicitly illegal .
" The law really needs to be explicit , " Thaler told ABCNews.com .
" Otherwise , we have to fight in every jurisdiction from scratch . "
House Bill Would Give GLBT Employment Protections
The proposed Employment Non-Discrimination Act , H.R. 3017 , is similar to federal sex and disability discrimination laws already on the books .
It also includes an exemption for faith - based employers .
The Obama administration supports the bill .
But some of its provisions -- like whether to include both sexual orientation and gender identity as protected categories -- have been the center of considerable debate and hindered the bill 's progress through Congress .
Some lawmakers question the extensiveness of exemptions for religious schools and other faith - based employers and wonder whether the law , as written , is too nebulous to be enforced .
One group opposed to the legislation , Focus on the Family , says the bill will create a " litigation minefield " and pose a " direct threat to religious liberty in the workplace . "
In a letter sent to House lawmakers Sept. 2 , the group also said forcing companies to protect against sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination would " harm American businesses " by increasing " compliance costs . "
But advocacy groups , like Thaler 's organization Lambda Legal , disagree .
" We 've had federal sex discrimination laws since 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act , " said Thaler .
" I do n't think we 've seen any suppression of employers ' rights or confusion raining in the courts . "
As the debate continues , Glenn , who is currently freelance editing and temping in Atlanta , says she is optimistic about the outcome of her case and broader acceptance of transgender people .
She says she believes her outspokenness is helping to put a human face on the issue .
" It 's human nature to fear things we do n't understand or know about , " she said .
" In the past , it was African Americans , Jewish people , even the Irish , at one point .
If you do n't know about the ' other , ' it 's easy to demonize the ' other . ' "
ABC News ' Lisa Chinn contributed to this report .
I was at Congressman Bill Pascrell 's town - hall meeting on health care reform at Montclair State University last week when I turned on my laptop and discovered an e-mail from my nephew Tim .
He lives in California and is in his mid 20s .
And that means he is among the many young Americans who will be forced to finance health - care reform -- whether they like it or not .
As I 've noted in prior columns , the Democrats do not hide the fact that the young will be the cash cow for any reform scheme .
Because young people are healthier than average , they will pay more in premiums than they consume in services .
That 's great for guys in their late 50s like me , but not so great for people in their 20s .
And some of them are figuring it out .
The e-mail contained a link to an article posted on a couple of progressive blogs .
The author was Robert Cruikshank , whose biography identifies him as " an activist on progressive California causes . "
Left - wing he may be , but Cruikshank 's not stupid .
After noting that Obama 's health care reform plan is most popular among those in the 18 - to - 29 demographic , he notes the effect that plan would have on young people .
He compares the views of a liberal think tank to those of the free - market Cato Institute .
" As much as it pains me to say this , the guy from Cato is right , " Cruikshank writes .
" Mandated insurance without a public option offers nothing of value whatsoever to younger people .
That 's because it 's not designed to help us .
It 's designed to extract even more money from our already meager bank accounts and deliver us virtually nothing in return . "
Precisely .
Many young people have the mistaken belief that the Democratic plan would provide them cheap health insurance .
Nope .
That 's the Republican plan .
And I could n't help but note how skillfully Pascrell dodged a question on that exact point .
When a woman asked why the plan does n't permit people to buy health insurance across state lines , Pascrell ignored that part of her question and instead focused on something she 'd said about tort reform -- an issue he also dodged with consummate skill .
The man 's a pro .
But the question of why the Democrats do n't want to see an open market in health insurance is crucial to the plan 's effect on the young .
So after the hearing I called the guy from Cato , Michael Tanner , to discuss this .
Tanner told me that if young people could buy coverage across state lines , they could get some really good deals .
That 's because some states , such as Idaho , have few if any mandates for what is covered .
A healthy 25 - year - old can buy coverage from an Idaho company for a mere $ 37.50 a month .
That insurance has a very high deductible , $ 5,000 , and does n't cover much .
But young people do n't need much coverage .
" Obama keeps talking about how little competition there is in the health - insurance market , " said Tanner .
" Well if he opened it up , young people who are computer savvy would go and buy insurance in Idaho . "
Instead , the Democrats ' plan call for setting a minimum standard that would apply in every state in the nation .
It also calls for community rating , a system under which young people are charged an artificially high price so we oldsters can pay an artificially low price .
Bye - bye bargains .
The kids become cash cows .
So why was the hall packed mainly with older people while the college kids outside walked by blissfully unaware of their fate ?
Perhaps the kids were n't pondering the effect the plan would have on another issue crucial to their lives : pizza .
One questioner told the congressman that all the pizzeria owners she knew said they'd be driven out of business by the cost of providing health insurance to their workers .
Pascrell assured her that he himself is a pizza lover and that the bill would have no such effect .
Tanner disagrees .
The two versions of the bill now in House committees would set a very low threshold for mandatory coverage by businesses .
A pizzeria with an annual payroll as low as $ 200,000 could be required to provide its employees with health insurance or face a tax equal to 8 percent of payroll , Tanner said .
And pizzerias would n't be the only small businesses hit by this provision .
Pizza may be more of a Jersey issue , but do those California kids ever think about whether Silicon Valley would have come into existence if all of those start - ups had to pay an 8 percent payroll tax ?
More to the point , do they realize that this plan puts them at the mercy of the very same public and private bureaucracies they spend most of their time decrying ?
Obviously not .
There 's a great opportunity for Republicans to make inroads among young voters on this issue .
Unfortunately , the national GOP leadership is on life support .
Where are those death panels when you need them ?
Clueless liberal alert : I note that various clueless liberals have been commenting on the public option as mentioned by Cruikshank and asking why I did n't explain why it 's a better alternative for the young .
Because it 's not .
It would be just as heavily weighted against the young , for reasons that should be obvious to any intelligent person .
And because I have already written extensively about that , quoting another Cato scholar .
I would strongly recommend that Cruikshank and every young person in America stop listening to Barack Obama and start listening to Jogadeesh Gokhale .
Here 's an excerpt .
Read the whole thing before commenting on the public option : :
That 's the theory of an economist who 's been studying this issue very intently , Jogadeesh Gokhale of the free - market Cato Institute .
The real reason the Democrats want to push young people into the public option , says Gokhale , is that their premiums can be used to put a Band - Aid on Medicare , which is going broke .
" This is basically generational warfare , " he said .
In Gokhale 's opinion , and mine , opponents of the plan are making a mistake by focusing on the public option .
The real problem is the individual mandate .
" Without the mandate , the young wo n't sign up , " he said .
But once the mandate 's in place , the feds can keep ratcheting up the requirements for private health plans so that young people are forced to take the public option .
And then the kids become the cash cows for us baby boomers .

If scientists have their way , we may someday be tapping maples — not for pancake fixin’s , but for power .
Because researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle have found there ’s enough electricity flowing in trees to run an electronic circuit .
If you ’ve ever made a potato battery , you know that plant material can generate current .
But the energy in trees is something else entirely .
The potato experiment uses electrodes of two different metals to set up a charge difference that gets local electrons flowing .
But in the current study , researchers use electrodes made of the same material .
Sticking one electrode into a tree and another in the soil , they found that big leaf maples generate a steady voltage of up to a few hundred millivolts .
That ’s way less than the volt - and - a - half provided by a standard AA battery .
So the scientists designed a gadget so small , with parts just 130 nanometers in size , that it can run on tree power alone .
Their results appear in the journal IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology .
If you ’re nuts for renewable energy , you probably ca n’t get much greener than a forest full of electrici- tree .

Tired of your wimpy laptop battery kicking out too early ?
I , for one , have just about had it with my two - year - old Vista - equipped HP laptop , which practically laughs at me every time I attempt more than twenty - five minutes of work sans power cord .
In an attempt to help ramp up excitement for its upcoming Windows 7 , Microsoft has now promised that their new Windows 7 Operating System ( OS ) could help improve the battery life of your PC .
If a recent Microsoft demo is to be believed , the improvements could be dramatic .
When the company used two identical laptops running the same DVD in a demonstration this past Tuesday , the one with Windows 7 installed ran for 20 per cent longer than the one equipped with Windows Vista , released in early 2007 .
" Significant Amount of Battery Savings "
According to Microsoft , users who make the upgrade from Vista to Windows 7 can expect anywhere from a ten to twenty per cent boost in the battery life of their systems -- at least , when they 're watching a DVD .
" We 're achieving a very significant amount of battery savings , " quipped Microsoft 's program manager Ruston Panabaker .
( Source : cnet.com )
Still , the company has n't yet pinpointed exactly how much battery life a user who employs Windows 7 rather than Vista can save , and they have n't gone on to say whether functions other than merely watching a DVD have improved either .
Demos Suggest Win7 Might Beat XP , Too
The demonstration took place at an event held by both Microsoft and Intel in hopes of demonstrating the advancements the two companies have made in the transition to Windows 7 .
Specific areas of interest include overall performance , system virtualization , and power management .
Of course , the more fascinating comparison may be the one recently reported by PC Magazine : in a comparison of two identical IBM ThinkPad T400s , one running Win7 and the other XP SP2 , the former lasted an additional 1.4 hours .

PEELING THE SHIELD
Wait , wait .
Look closer .
The federal “ shield ” law could endanger national security , say those who fret that the “ Free Flow of Information Act ” on parade Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee is not the virtuous guardian of First Amendment rights and journalists everywhere .
The legislation , which protects reporters who chose not to reveal confidential sources , has hidden perils , critics say .
It also enjoys strong support and keen interest from Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy , Vermont Democrat - and other big cheeses .
But a senior Republican aid with the Judiciary Committee somberly tells Inside the Beltway that weighing the merits of the bill is no simple matter .
“ The debate on this issue comes down to a simple proposition .
Federal law makes it a felony for anyone with classified information to provide it to unauthorized people - and that includes reporters .
You either believe it ’s a crime , or you believe the press should have an unfettered right to seek out and publish classified information .
That ’s the fundamental difference between Republicans and Democrats on this bill , ” the source says .
“ The federal government has a duty to protect national security and classified information .
The bill could inhibit federal investigation of leaks , or cases when a reporter has information related to a terrorist plot , or an act that has already occurred .
And the bill is not clear in some respects .
It is intentionally not clear .
That is to allow First Amendment lawyers to argue their cases in court , ” the source continues .
“ It puts the protection of classified information in the hands of federal judges .
And they are not necessarily the most qualified to do this .
That duty and responsibility should rest with the executive branch . ”
Currently , 49 states offer some form of protection for journalists , but there is no definitive federal legislation to shield those who choose not to reveal their sources in court .
Many news organizations , meanwhile , applaud the bipartisan bill .
Judiciary Committee members Sens. Arlen Specter , Pennsylvania Democrat ; Amy Klobuchar , Minnesota Democrat ; and Lindsey Graham , South Carolina Republican , are among the original co-sponsors of the bill .
HERE’S YOUR PAPERS
Seems like old times .
When in doubt , FOIA them .
Or sue .
Larry Klayman , founder of Judicial Watch and former Clinton administration gadfly , is still in attack mode .
Mr. Klayman plans to personally serve “ fraudulently elected ” Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with a class action complaint .
Himself .
Like , “ Here you go , sir . ”
Well , sure .
OK .
“ It ’s filed on behalf of imprisoned student protester Akbar Mohammadi and all oppressed , tortured and murdered Iranians seeking freedom , by Nasrin Mohammadi , the sister of Akbar , ” Mr. Klayman tells Beltway .
Mr. Klayman plans to make his move when the Iranian president visits the United Nations on Sept. 23 .
“ Thus far , the Obama administration has not even paid lip service to the freedom movement in Iran , but instead seeks to negotiate with these terrorist despots .
The quickest way to bring freedom to Iran , remove the nuclear threat , and bring greater stability and security to the Middle East and the world is to bring these Islamic fascists to justice and remove them from power , ” Mr. Klayman says .
THE GRAYING LADY
It ’s official .
The New York Times selectively ignores its foes much of the time .
Asked by a reader how the Times would cover a Rush Limbaugh - lobbed attack on columnist Maureen Dowd , Craig R. Whitney - “ assistant managing editor overseeing journalistic standards ” - answered this way :
“ The Times is attacked pretty much every day by commentators like Rush Limbaugh and Bill O’Reilly , who even declared war against us .
That ’s not news , so we do n’t ‘ cover ’ it , but when they point out errors we have actually made , or other lapses , we correct them just as we do when others call them to our attention . ”
Mr. Whitney later added , “ If we live up to our vows of political celibacy in the news columns , you should n’t be able to say a news article in The Times has a liberal bent - or a conservative one . ”
FOX WORTHY
Inquiring minds have asked Beltway whether war has broken out between Fox News and the White House .
Well , maybe - though both sides have more pressing things to worry about .
For those of you keeping track : President Obama will not appear on Fox News this Sunday when he makes the rounds of five other political talk shows .
Since he was elected , in fact , Mr. Obama has not made an appearance on “ Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace . ”
The president did show up on the set when he was campaigning in early 2008 .
That only happened after Mr. Wallace conducted a 772 - day “ Obama Watch , ” publicly tracking the number of days that elapsed since he extended an invitation to the president - to - be during a 2006 Gridiron Dinner .

Microsoft 's motion to stay an injunction has been granted ; the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has allowed the company to keep selling Word as it appeals a patent ruling .
The injunction had an effective date of October 10 , but the motion to stay blocks the injunction until the appeal process is complete .
If upheld , the injunction would n't stop existing users from using Word , but it could prevent the software giant from selling Word 2003 or Word 2007 , the most common versions of Word currently on the market , and would require the company to significantly tweak Word 2010 , which is slated for the first half of next year .
The victory is a small one for Microsoft ; the company still has the whole appeals process to go through .
" We are happy with the result and look forward to presenting our arguments on the main issues on September 23 , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
Microsoft asked for the stay two weeks ago by filing an emergency motion .
Canadian - based i4i , the company that owns the patent that Microsoft has been found to be infringing , claims in the lawsuit that its business shrank significantly when Microsoft added custom - XML support to Word .
" Microsoft 's scare tactics about the consequences of the injunction cannot shield it from the imminent review of the case by the Federal Circuit Court of Appeal on the September 23 appeal , " said i4i chairman Loudon Owen in response to the court 's decision .
" i4i is confident that the final judgment in favor of i4i , which included a finding of willful patent infringement by Microsoft and an injunction against Microsoft Word , was the correct decision and that i4i will prevail on the appeal . "
In August 2009 , a federal court in Texas issued an injunction that gave Microsoft 60 days to stop shipping any recent version of Word , based on a patent that was found to cover the XML formatting used by the software .
The ruling , which followed one from May 2009 where Microsoft was found to be infringing one of the patents and asked to pay up $ 200 million , was in favor of i4i .
Word 2003 and Word 2007 were both found to be infringing on i4i's patent by using extensible markup language ( XML ) for encoding and customizing XML in a specific way ( US Patent No. 5,787,449 ) .
Microsoft still feels that i4i's patents are invalid .

The wall of dust marching across the Australian outback to turn the skies over Sydney blood red

It is a city that usually wakes to brilliant blue skies .
But dawn broke with a dramatic difference in Sydney yesterday .
Pulling back their blinds , residents were greeted with an eerie reddish - orange cloud cloaking all around them .
Early - morning commuters stared in disbelief at the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge , whose normally striking outlines were rendered ghostly by the shroud of dust .
Visible from space : A beige wall of dust can be seen stretching over Queensland and out to see in this Nasa image taken yesterday
Apocalyptic :
The dust quite literally formed a wall that marched over parts of Queensland , such as in this image taken on Broken Hill
The outback dust storm has swept across eastern Australia , shrouding Sydney in a dramatic red glow .
It 's also been wreaking havoc , disrupting transport and placing health authorities on alert for widespread respiratory illness .
International flights were diverted from Sydney , ferries on the harbour were suspended , and motorists were warned to take care on roads as visibility was dramatically reduced .

Crimson tide : A surfer heads for the water as a dust storm blankets Sydney 's Bondi Beach yesterday Like an image of a sci- fi film , two swimmers trudge back from the sea over Bondi Beach
However , the eerie scenes have n't caused all activities to cease - the iconic Bondi beach still had its surfers and children continued to play on swings in the city 's parks .
The storm , which blacked out the mining town of Broken Hill on Tuesday before sweeping east , was caused by a major cold front whipping up the dust from the drought - stricken hinterland .
The gale force winds - measuring in excess of 60 mph - also fanned bush fires in the state .
By noon on Wednesday the storm , carrying an estimated 5 million tonnes of dust , had spread to the southern part of Australia 's tropical state of Queensland .
The dust storms stripped valuable topsoil from farmlands .
At one stage up to 75,000 tonnes of dust per hour was blown across Sydney and dumped in the Pacific Ocean .
' We 've got a combination of factors which have been building for ten months already - floods , droughts and strong winds , ' said Craig Strong from DustWatch at Griffith University in Queensland .
' Add to these factors the prevailing drought conditions that reduce the vegetation cover and the soil surface is at its most vulnerable to wind erosion . '

Health authorities , meanwhile , have urged people with asthma or breathing difficulties to stay indoors .
The official air quality index for New South Wales recorded pollutant levels as high as 4,164 in Sydney .
A level above 200 is considered hazardous .
In Sydney 's central business district the dust has even begun to set off smoke alarms .
' People at risk are children , elderly , pregnant women , people with heart and lung diseases .
Dust particles can increase the risk of people with these conditions becoming unwell , ' said Wayne Smith from the New South Wales state health department .
Sydney residents told local radio that they woke to scenes from a Hollywood disaster movie , while many contacted emergency services fearing a major bush fire in the city .

The blanket of dust stretched hundreds of miles along the coast , from the coal port of Newcastle north of Sydney to the steel city of Wollongong in the south , and hundreds of miles inland to farming towns like Dubbo and Tamworth .
Weather officials said the blanket of dust would remain for several hours , until winds eased .
Further cold fronts are expected later in the week and could bring not only more strong winds , with the chance of dust storms , but also snow falls higher up on Australia 's mountain region , said weather officials .

Dust storms in Australia are not uncommon but are usually restricted to the inland .
Occasionally , during widespread drought , dust storms reach coastal areas .
Australia is the driest inhabited continent and only Antarctica is drier .
The NSW state government recently cut the state 's 2009 / 10 wheat crop estimate by 20 per cent because of hot , dry weather across the grain belt .
The country is one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change , but also the world 's biggest greenhouse gas emitter per capita as it relies on coal - fired power stations for the bulk of its electricity .
Australia is battling one of its worst droughts and weather officials say an El Nino - a periodic change in the atmosphere and ocean of the Pacific - is slowly developing which will mean drier conditions for eastern states .
The country is one of the most vulnerable nations to climate change , but also the world 's biggest greenhouse gas emitter per capita as it relies on coal - fired power stations for the bulk of its electricity .
Scientists are reluctant to directly link climate change with extreme weather events such as storms and drought , saying these fluctuate according to atmospheric conditions , but green groups link the two in their calls for action .
But crop analysts said the storm is unlikely to have an immediate impact on wheat crops , in the country 's second - largest grain producing state .
The crop is due to be harvested next month .
Harman 's crusade to jail more rapists : Human rights peer to lead justice system review
Harman 's review was to have been announced six weeks ago when she was in charge of the Government
Harriet Harman has launched a sweeping review designed to increase the number of men found guilty of rape .
The women and equality minister declared that rapists ' are getting away with it time and time again ' .
To lead her review of rape and the criminal justice system she has chosen a human rights campaigner who has backed the idea of setting targets for numbers of men brought to court on rape charges .
Baroness Stern , a veteran prison reform activist , took part in an inquiry by a feminist pressure group which also said police and prosecuting lawyers should be retrained to ' change attitudes ' .
Miss Harman 's review of rape complaints was to have been announced six weeks ago when she was in charge of the Government while Gordon Brown was on holiday .
But it was held back , apparently because of protests by Justice Secretary Jack Straw .
The launch of the review means a renewal of hostilities between the Government and the judiciary .
Senior judges have been deeply wary of ministerial attempts to ratchet up numbers of rape convictions and have rejected a number of initiatives they have seen as attempts to sway juries or introduce unfair rules .
Miss Harman said yesterday that the inquiry would cover how rape complaints are handled from when they are made until the court reaches a verdict .
It is also intended to examine ' professionals ' attitudes to rape ' ; ensure that more cases progress further through the criminal justice system , and ' fairly increase conviction rates ' .
The minister said : ' Convictions for rape have increased 50 per cent since 1997 , but with less than 7 per cent of reported rapes leading to a successful prosecution we clearly must do more .
' Many more women are reporting rapes , but the Reid and Worboys cases show that despite this these men were getting away with it time and time again .
' We must have a systematic examination of the way rape complaints are handled .
' The Stern Review will help identify good practice and where those failures are happening so that we can take action . '
The cases of John Worboys , a taxi driver who was convicted of 12 attacks on women and may have committed more than 100 , and Kirk Reid , suspected of 71 offences , have raised questions about the effectiveness of police investigations into attacks on women .
But the controversy over rape law has centred not on the handling of cases against men who attack women , but on those where women complain of rape by acquaintances .
Critics believe political pressure has driven prosecutors to bring rape charges against men whose behaviour is unlikely to be seen as rape by judges or juries .
Earlier this year 26 - year - old chef Peter Bacon was cleared of rape charges by a jury in just 45 minutes .
Mr Bacon was charged with a crime that usually attracts a five - year jail sentence after a drunken one - night stand with a lawyer who told the court she could remember nothing of the alleged rape .
The lawyer was protected by lifelong anonymity , as are all women who make accusations of rape .
Criminologist Dr David Green , of the Civitas think - tank , said : ' It is hard for a man to say anything is wrong with this inquiry .
' You will always be accused of being a man who thinks women deserve it for drinking or dressing wrongly and so forth .
' The trouble with this whole campaign is that it means to interfere with the system of justice by which you are innocent until proven guilty .
' However you dress it up , they are trying to water down the protection against conviction of the innocent . '
If we were stuck on a desert island with only one book , this recently unveiled solar e-book would be at the top of our list .
Designed by LG Display , the sleek reader features a wafer - fin photovoltaic cell that provides it with a steady stream of solar energy .
Whereas most e-books run the risk of losing juice mid-sentence through your next novel , this solar reader 's omnipresent energy source makes it a winning design in our book .
At first glance e-readers offer a great set of benefits over paper - bound books – they 're light , versatile , and a great alternative to lugging around a tote full of dead tree tomes on your next trip .
The rise of e-readers also stands to stem the environmental repercussions of the publishing industry , as books can be released online rather than incurring the energy , materials , and cost that it takes to manufacture , print , and ship them across great distances .
However these new reading mediums have one glaring fault – can you imaging the frustration of running out of juice mid-sentence and halfway through Infinite Jest ?
LG 's new solar e-book aims to address this issue by harnessing the sun 's rays to power its display .
The device features a 10 centimeter wide thin - film panel that is .7 mm thin – the width of a credit card .
Energy efficiency is a strong concern with portable readers , and it looks like LG may have hit on a winning feature set with their e-book – 4 - 5 hours spent sitting in the sun will provide a full day 's worth of reading time .
Ki Yong Kim , head of the Solar Cell Office at LG Display has stated that " ebooks are attracting a lot of attention because they offer the advantage of storing thousands of books ' worth of contents in an easy - to - carry device .
The idea of ebook combined with solar cell will offer users the added benefit of longer usage .
We will continue to provide users with enhanced convenience and value to solidify our lead in next - generation , environmentally friendly products . "
Everyone knows that trying to read a computer screen outdoors can be a total pain , so we hope that LG has included a passively - lit e-paper display option in the device .
A working prototype of the solar ebook will be on display at the International Meeting on Information Display ( IMID ) this week in Seoul .

Class BreakIterator
All Implemented Interfaces : Cloneable
public abstract class BreakIterator extends Object implements Cloneable
The BreakIterator class implements methods for finding the location of boundaries in text .
Instances of BreakIterator maintain a current position and scan over text returning the index of characters where boundaries occur .
Internally , BreakIterator scans text using a CharacterIterator , and is thus able to scan text held by any object implementing that protocol .
A StringCharacterIterator is used to scan String objects passed to setText .
You use the factory methods provided by this class to create instances of various types of break iterators .
In particular , use getWordIterator , getLineIterator , getSentenceIterator , and getCharacterIterator to create BreakIterator s that perform word , line , sentence , and character boundary analysis respectively .
A single BreakIterator can work only on one unit ( word , line , sentence , and so on ) .
You must use a different iterator for each unit boundary analysis you wish to perform .
Line boundary analysis determines where a text string can be broken when line - wrapping .
The mechanism correctly handles punctuation and hyphenated words .
Actual line breaking needs to also consider the available line width and is handled by higher - level software .
Sentence boundary analysis allows selection with correct interpretation of periods within numbers and abbreviations , and trailing punctuation marks such as quotation marks and parentheses .
Word boundary analysis is used by search and replace functions , as well as within text editing applications that allow the user to select words with a double click .
Word selection provides correct interpretation of punctuation marks within and following words .
Characters that are not part of a word , such as symbols or punctuation marks , have word - breaks on both sides .
Character boundary analysis allows users to interact with characters as they expect to , for example , when moving the cursor through a text string .
Character boundary analysis provides correct navigation through character strings , regardless of how the character is stored .
The boundaries returned may be those of supplementary characters , combining character sequences , or ligature clusters .
For example , an accented character might be stored as a base character and a diacritical mark .
What users consider to be a character can differ between languages .
The BreakIterator instances returned by the factory methods of this class are intended for use with natural languages only , not for programming language text .
It is however possible to define subclasses that tokenize a programming language .
Examples :
Creating and using text boundaries :
public static void main ( String args [ ] ) { if ( args.length == 1 ) { String stringToExamine = args [ 0 ] ; // print each word in order BreakIterator boundary = BreakIterator.getWordInstance ( ) ; boundary.setText( stringToExamine ) ; printEachForward ( boundary , stringToExamine ) ; // print each sentence in reverse order boundary = BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance( Locale.US ) ; boundary.setText( stringToExamine ) ; printEachBackward ( boundary , stringToExamine ) ; printFirst ( boundary , stringToExamine ) ; printLast ( boundary , stringToExamine ) ; } }
public static void printEachForward ( BreakIterator boundary , String source ) { int start = boundary .
first ( ) ; for ( int end = boundary .
next ( ) ; end != BreakIterator .
DONE ; start = end , end = boundary .
next ( ) ) { System.out.println(source.substring ( start , end ) ) ; } }
public static void printEachBackward ( BreakIterator boundary , String source ) { int end = boundary .
last ( ) ; for ( int start = boundary . previous ( ) ; start != BreakIterator .
DONE ; end = start , start = boundary .
previous ( ) ) { System.out.println(source.substring ( start , end ) ) ; } }
public static void printFirst ( BreakIterator boundary , String source ) { int start = boundary .
first ( ) ; int end = boundary .
next ( ) ; System.out.println(source.substring ( start , end ) ) ; }
public static void printLast ( BreakIterator boundary , String source ) { int end = boundary .
last ( ) ; int start = boundary .
previous ( ) ; System.out.println(source.substring ( start , end ) ) ; }
public static void printAt ( BreakIterator boundary , int pos , String source ) { int end = boundary .
following ( pos ) ; int start = boundary .
previous ( ) ; System.out.println(source.substring ( start , end ) ) ; }
public static int nextWordStartAfter ( int pos , String text ) { BreakIterator wb = BreakIterator.getWordInstance ( ) ; wb.setText ( text ) ; int last = wb.following ( pos ) ; int current = wb.next ( ) ; while ( current != BreakIterator .
DONE ) { for ( int p = last ; p < current ; p++ ) { if ( Character.isLetter(text.codePointAt( p ) ) ) return last ; } last = current ; current = wb.next ( ) ; } return BreakIterator .
DONE ; } ( The iterator returned by BreakIterator.getWordInstance ( ) is unique in that the break positions it returns do n't represent both the start and end of the thing being iterated over .
That is , a sentence - break iterator returns breaks that each represent the end of one sentence and the beginning of the next .
With the word - break iterator , the characters between two boundaries might be a word , or they might be the punctuation or whitespace between two words .
The above code uses a simple heuristic to determine which boundary is the beginning of a word :
If the characters between this boundary and the next boundary include at least one letter ( this can be an alphabetical letter , a CJK ideograph , a Hangul syllable , a Kana character , etc. ) , then the text between this boundary and the next is a word ; otherwise , it 's the material between words . )

SOME OF THE most courageous actions for equality in the United States and South Africa have come from children - from the thousands who marched in Birmingham , only to have been met with fire hoses and police attack dogs , to the students who integrated Southern schools to the Soweto child uprising over the brutalities of apartheid .
Now children are teaching new lessons in South Africa .
Last week , thousands marched peacefully outside Cape Town City Hall demanding better schools , libraries , quality teachers , and teachers who simply show up for work .
The New York Times featured a school in a Cape Town township where the students were teaching themselves because of chronic absenteeism and loafing by teachers .
Newspapers throughout South Africa have been noting brewing youth anger over education for the last several years .
In 2007 , 80 students in a Johannesburg school demanded the removal of “ bad ’’ teachers citing the school ’s 95 percent failure rate .
Last year , students in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha , with the help of law school graduates in a movement that has become known as Equal Education , successfully protested to get over 500 broken windows replaced .
Ninth - grader Phatiswa Shushwana told South Africa ’s Financial Mail , “ I did n’t really think we could get the windows fixed , but afterwards I realized that we do have the ability and the power . ’’
We need students in the United States to find their ability and power to change education in this nation .
Despite being the wealthiest nation on earth , the United States is only 36th in science proficiency and 35th in math scores , behind several former communist countries , in rankings by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development .
The World Economic Forum ranks the United States only 30th in overall quality of primary education , 45th for education expenditure .
One reason is that the United States permits one of the largest gaps in educational outcomes between rich and poor .
Millions of youth are barely better off than those in South Africa , consigned to desolate urban schools and forgotten rural districts in a modern version of race and class segregation .
South Africa ’s education leaders and President Jacob Zuma at least admit their education system is broken and that it can no longer be blamed on the legacy of apartheid .
They feel the pressure coming from the townships .
Graeme Bloch of the Development Bank of Southern Africa told The New York Times , “ If you ’re in a township school , you do n’t have much chance .
That ’s the hidden curriculum - that inequality continues , that white kids do reasonably and black kids do n’t really stand a chance unless they can get into a formerly white school or the small number of black schools that work . ’’
Here at home , we know the system is broken , but we never remotely come close to doing something about it .
President Obama said in his recent back - to - school address , “ I ’m working hard to fix up your classrooms and get you the books and the equipment and the computers you need to learn .
But you ’ve got to do your part too .
So I expect all of you to get serious this year . ’’
Obama may honestly wish to be educator - in - chief , but it is hypocritical to ask students to get serious when Congress is not .
Our version of broken windows was the miserly debate over the stimulus package that continued to trivialize school repairs .
Repairs are merely an optional part of the $ 53.6 billion in state fiscal stabilization funds for education .
But the price tag alone for repairs was $ 127 billion in a government estimate a decade ago .
Education advocacy groups claim the figure is now $ 322 billion .
In August , the Daily News in Durban , South Africa , quoted weary first - grade teacher Linda Ntuli , who said her cacophony of 128 students is a “ nightmare . ’’
She said , “ These kids do n’t have desks or chairs , they do n’t have stationery , so they get bored easily and lose concentration . ’’
In South Africa , the students are rising up against the nightmare .
There are plenty of American classrooms that are horrific in their own right .
A child uprising might be one thing that embarrasses the adults into restoring this part of the American Dream .

A new species related to the shark has been discovered in Southern California .
Not only does this bad boy have a venomous spine and retractable sexual appendages on the forehead , but it 's got one bad ass name : meet Ghostshark .

Physorg has the report from the Zootaxa journal detailing this clever little descendant from the sharks , chimaera , who has been around since the days of the dinosaurs .
The new chimaera has been found off the coast of Southern California and Baja California , Mexico .
More about the new species , technically called Hydrolagus melanophasma :
Like sharks , chimaeras have skeletons composed of cartilage and the males have claspers for internal fertilization of females .
Unlike sharks , male chimaeras also have retractable sexual appendages on the forehead and in front of the pelvic fins and a single pair of gills .
Most species also have a mildly venomous spine in front of the dorsal fin .
Chimaeras were once a very diverse and abundant group , as illustrated by their global presence in the fossil record .
They survived through the age of dinosaurs mostly unchanged , but today these fishes are relatively scarce and are usually confined to deep ocean waters , where they have largely avoided the reach of explorers and remained poorly known to science .

WASHINGTON -- Ten House Democrats , voicing concern that the government strike the right balance between individual rights and collective security , have asked for sweeping congressional hearings on how the Justice Department has made use of the Patriot Act and other antiterrorism powers .
In a letter to be delivered today , Representatives Martin T. Meehan of Lowell and William D. Delahunt of Quincy , along with eight other Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee , ask chairman James Sensenbrenner Jr. , Republican of Wisconsin , to hold hearings next year " on the war on terrorism 's impact on civil liberties . "
" Critics representing a wide range of ideological perspectives have raised serious questions about how the Justice Department has used its legal tools , including the Patriot Act , to investigate individuals with no apparent link to terrorism , " the lawmakers write .
" At a time when the department is seeking additional powers in the name of fighting terrorism , we think the committee should review the impact of existing investigative authority and tactics on
innocent individuals and important political freedoms , including the rights to privacy and free speech . "
As chairman , Sensenbrenner has the sole authority to schedule hearings of the House Judiciary Committee , which has legislative jurisdiction over the Justice Department .
It is uncertain whether a Republican would call attention to a politically charged issue in a presidential election year , when Democrats plan to target the Bush administration 's record on civil liberties .
A committee spokesman said Sensenbrenner was out of town and unavailable for comment .
Meehan , however , said that informal talks between staff members have given him some optimism that the chairman may be open to calling some form of an oversight hearing .
" There are a lot of Republican members who , I think , want to do something with this , " he said .
But Meehan conceded that he had not found one willing to co-sign his letter .

Are you struggling to get more clicks and bookmarks on your articles ?
Possibly there is one area in which your content is letting you down .
Even the best blog post writers sometimes make this mistake .
One aspect of your writing requires a great deal of effort getting right , and it is so obvious it is commonly overlooked .
What is the first thing a social media user sees ?
“ I glance at the headlines just to kind of get a flavor for what ’s moving .
I rarely read the stories , and I get briefed by people who probably read the news themselves . ”

Yes , you guessed it .
It ’s the headline .
Without a compelling headline , you will not attract attention , and your article will not spread as easily .
If you do write a killer headline then you will get more clicks , more bookmarks , and your readers will be compelled to share it with their friends and contacts .
Creating Compelling Headlines
Take a look at the last article you wrote that did spectacularly well ( or if you do not have a great example , choose a disaster ) .
Does it grab attention ?
The first job you have to get right when producing a new article is to get it read , and your first task toward getting your article read is grabbing the reader ’s attention .

News — Particularly breaking news , is very popular .
Announce something , share a piece of gossip , and let people know what is happening now .
Social news has made traditional news media look slow and dated because by the time the news has spread around the social sites , mainstream media is only just picking it up .
The downside of this , of course , is that your content is not going to be perceived as evergreen — there will always be something newer , shinier , and trendier .
For example : “ Breaking News : White House Moves to Ban Bacon ” Goals —
Offer a way to achieve a goal , get more , be more powerful , wealthy , attractive , healthier … whole magazines are full of this stuff .
Just take a look next time you are at the supermarket checkout .
For example : “ 101 Tried and Tested Dating Secrets to Win the Partner of Your Dreams ” Problems — The flipside to the goal is the problem .
Fear sells just as well as positives ; just ask the newspapers .
The economy , health , worries about global politics , you name it .
For example : “ Finally !
Make Your Computer Virus - Free With Open- Source Software ” How - to — Share a technique , tutorial , recipe or formula to achieve something practical and beneficial .
It is kind of the same as the goal , but rather than a dream , it gives you the steps to create something in reality .
For example : “ How to Win Friends and Influence People ” Entertaining — Social media is full of pure entertainment .
It might be a funny video , a cute picture , a joke or even a link to an accidentally funny forum thread .
This is the coffee break content that social media was built upon .
For example : “ Nasty or Nice ?
Take The Ultimate Personality Test ”
Most of all , you need to trigger an emotional reaction .
Remember we do not just want “ interest , ” we want the reader to take an action — even if that action is just to hit the vote - up button .

The Obama Administration wanted to send a message with the President ’s first nomination to a federal court .
“ There was a real conscious decision to use that first appointment to say , ‘ This is a new way of doing things .
This is a post - partisan choice , ’ ” one White House official involved in the process told me .
“ Our strategy was to show that our judges could get Republican support . ”
So on March 17th President Obama nominated David Hamilton , the chief federal district - court judge in Indianapolis , to the Seventh Circuit court of appeals .
Hamilton had been vetted with care .
After fifteen years of service on the trial bench , he had won the highest rating from the American Bar Association ; Richard Lugar , the senior senator from Indiana and a leading Republican , was supportive ; and Hamilton ’s status as a nephew of Lee Hamilton , a well - respected former local congressman , gave him deep connections .
The hope was that Hamilton ’s appointment would begin a profound and rapid change in the confirmation process and in the federal judiciary itself .
Sonia Sotomayor may be a template for Obama nominations .
Illustration by John Cuneo
The power to nominate federal judges is one of the great prizes of any Presidency , and Obama assumed office at a propitious moment .
After Democrats won control of the Senate in 2006 , the new chairman of the Judiciary Committee , Patrick Leahy , of Vermont , significantly slowed down the confirmation process for George W. Bush ’s appointees to the federal appeals courts .
In addition , many federal judges appointed by President Clinton were waiting for the election of a Democratic President in order to resign .
Now vacancies abound .
Just eight months into his first term , Obama already has the chance to nominate judges for twenty - one seats on the federal appellate bench — more than ten per cent of the hundred and seventy - nine judges on those courts .
At least half a dozen more seats should open in the next few months .
There are five vacancies on the Fourth Circuit alone ; just by filling those seats , Obama can convert the Fourth Circuit , which has long been known as one of the most conservative courts in the country , into one with a majority of Democratic appointees .
On the federal district courts , there are seventy - two vacancies , also about ten per cent of the total ; home - state senators of the President ’s party generally take the lead in selecting nominees for these seats , but Obama will have influence in these choices as well .
Seven appeals and ten district judges have been named so far .
George W. Bush , in the first eight months of his Presidency , nominated fifty - two .
But Obama , unlike Bush in his first year , has had the opportunity to place his first Justice on the Supreme Court , Sonia Sotomayor — and her confirmation has opened up another seat on the Second Circuit court of appeals .
Justice John Paul Stevens , who is eighty - nine , has hired only one law clerk for the next Supreme Court term , so a second Obama appointment to the Court may be imminent as well .
“ The unifying quality that we are looking for is excellence , but also diversity , and diversity in the broadest sense of the word , ” another Administration official said .
“ We are looking for experiential diversity , not just race and gender .
We want people who are not the usual suspects , not just judges and prosecutors but public defenders and lawyers in private practice . ”
Yet Hamilton and Sotomayor are the usual suspects — both sitting judges , who had already been confirmed by the Senate .
Of Obama ’s seven nominees to the circuit courts , six are federal district - court judges .
The group includes Gerard Lynch , a former Columbia Law School professor and New York federal prosecutor , and Andre Davis , who was nominated to the Fourth Circuit by Bill Clinton .
( At the time , Republicans blocked any vote on Davis . )
Two of the seven are African - American ; two are women ; all but one are in their fifties .
( None are openly gay . )
The one non-judge is Jane Stranch , who has represented labor unions and other clients at a Nashville law firm and is nominated for the Sixth Circuit .
They are conventional , qualified , and undramatic choices , who were named , at least in part , because they were seen as likely to be quickly confirmed .
But then , as the first White House official put it , “ Hamilton blew up . ”
Conservatives seized on a 2005 case , in which Hamilton ruled to strike down the daily invocation at the Indiana legislature because its repeated references to Jesus Christ violated the establishment clause of the First Amendment .
Hamilton had also ruled to invalidate a part of Indiana ’s abortion law that required women to make two visits to a doctor before undergoing the procedure .
In June , Hamilton was approved by the Judiciary Committee on a straight party - line vote , twelve to seven , but his nomination has not yet been brought to the Senate floor .
Some Republicans have already vowed a filibuster .
( Republican threats of extended debate on nominees can stop the Democratic majority from bringing any of them up for votes . )
“ The reaction to Hamilton certainly has given people pause here , ” the second White House official said .
“ If they are going to stop David Hamilton , then who wo n’t they stop ? ”
Republicans in the Senate have not allowed a vote on any of the other nominees , either .
So far , the only Obama nominee who has been confirmed to a lifetime federal judgeship is Sotomayor .
The stalemate provides a revealing glimpse of the environment in Washington .
Obama advisers ( and Democratic Senate sources ) aver that all the nominees , even Hamilton , will be confirmed eventually , but contrary to the President ’s early hope the struggle for his judges is likely to be long and contentious .
“ The President did not set a good example when he was in the Senate , ” Orrin Hatch , the senior Republican senator from Utah , told me , pointing to Obama ’s votes against the confirmation of John G. Roberts , Jr. , and Samuel A. Alito , Jr. , to the Supreme Court .
“ You have to be a partisan ideologue not to support Roberts , ” Hatch said .
“ There is a really big push on by partisan Republicans to use the same things that they did against us . ”
Hatch himself , who had voted for Ruth Bader Ginsburg , Stephen G. Breyer , and every other Supreme Court nominee in his Senate career , voted against Sotomayor .
( The vote for her confirmation was sixty - eight to thirty - one . )
There is a certain irony in this , because Obama has long sought to define himself as something other than a traditional legal liberal .
Starting about fifty years ago , after Earl Warren became Chief Justice , the concept of legal liberalism developed a clear meaning : a belief in what came to be called judicial activism .
Liberals believed that the Constitution should be read expansively , and that the Supreme Court should recognize newly defined rights — the right , say , to attend an integrated public school , or , later , the right to choose abortion .
Conservatives in this era believed in what they called judicial restraint , which suggested that courts should refrain from overruling decisions made by the elected parts of the government .
Obama appears to be trying to move away from these old categories , which have , in any case , become scrambled in their meaning .
Both sides now claim to embrace restraint and eschew activism .
Obama and his judge - pickers define their choices with the same post - partisan vocabulary that the President uses with most issues : excellence , competence , common sense .
And so far Republicans have regarded Obama ’s claims in this realm with the same skepticism that they have displayed for his arguments on the economy and health care .
Still , this is not just a replay of the usual ideological debate .
Obama ’s choice of judges reflects ferment in the world of legal liberalism , which is tied ever more closely to the fate of Democrats in the executive and legislative branches of government .
Liberals who once saw judges as the lone protectors of constitutional rights are now placing their hopes on elected politicians like Obama .
At its core , Obama ’s jurisprudence may rest less on any legal theory or nomenclature than on a more primal political skill — the ability to keep winning elections .
Last August , after Obama had clinched the Democratic nomination for President , a lawyer in New York received a confidential assignment from the transition team .
Preeta Bansal , who was then a partner at the law firm Skadden , Arps and formerly a solicitor general of New York State , was asked to prepare a series of memorandums about how a President Obama might transform the federal judiciary .
She projected the number of likely vacancies , examined the ethnic and professional backgrounds of current judges , and compiled the first list of possible nominees for the new President to consider .
Through the final weeks of the campaign , Bansal refined and expanded her memos , and after Obama ’s victory she moved to Washington to work on the transition .
There , joined by former campaign staffers , among them Danielle Gray and Michael Strautmanis , Bansal waded into the details of the project .
Should Obama announce his first nominations as a group , as Bush did , or one at a time ?
( Obama chose one at a time . )
Should the new Administration coöperate with the American Bar Association , which had traditionally rated nominees but which had been pushed out of the process by recent Republican Administrations ?
( Obama ’s team decided to reëstablish the connection , but only after securing a pledge from the A.B.A. that the group would act quickly . )
A statistical analysis showed that Republican judicial appointees tended , on balance , to be younger than their Democratic counterparts — a finding that interested the future judge - pickers .
( Soon after the Inauguration , the authors scattered : Bansal became general counsel and senior policy adviser at the Office of Management and Budget ; Gray joined the staff of Gregory Craig , the White House counsel ; and Strautmanis serves as chief of staff to Valerie Jarrett , a senior aide to Obama . )
John Podesta , the White House chief of staff under President Clinton , who was running Obama ’s transition process , arranged a few meetings for the President - elect to familiarize himself with judicial - selection issues .
At one of these sessions , in the transition headquarters , on Sixth Street , the subject was possible Supreme Court vacancies , and Obama made a specific request .
He wanted more information on a federal appeals - court judge in New York named Sonia Sotomayor .
It was no surprise that Sotomayor had caught Obama ’s eye .
First appointed to the district court by George H. W. Bush , on the recommendation of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan , she had been promoted to the Court of Appeals by Bill Clinton , in 1998 .
At the time , her confirmation was stalled by Republicans who were concerned , even then , that she might make an appealing Democratic appointee to the Supreme Court .
Raised poor in the Bronx , Sotomayor had an inspiring life story , experience as both a prosecutor and a judge , and the potential to be the first Hispanic on the High Court .
To those inside the White House who followed the search process after David H. Souter announced his resignation , this spring , Sotomayor was the front - runner all along .
In recent years , the introduction of a Supreme Court nominee has become a major political undertaking .
By the time the President announced his choice of Sotomayor , on May 26th , “ there were two story tracks — ‘ eminently qualified ’ and ‘ an American story , ’ ” an official who was involved with the rollout said .
“ The first part related to her judicial experience , which was more time as a federal judge than any nominee in a hundred years , but we also raised as a subtext her experience as a big - city prosecutor ” — early in her career , Sotomayor was an assistant district attorney in Manhattan .
“ You always have to worry that a Democrat is going to be called soft on crime , but it ’s harder to do that if people know she was a big - city prosecutor . ”
The American story related to her childhood , in public housing , followed by her academic success at Princeton and Yale Law School .
At the time , several White House officials noted the similarities between Sotomayor ’s life story and that of Michelle Obama , who also had a working - class upbringing in an inner city and graduated from Princeton , nine years after Sotomayor .
On the question of Sotomayor ’s ideology — what she stood for — Administration officials used what may become the Obama template .
A Supreme Court nomination , almost by definition , raises divisive social issues , like abortion and gay rights , but the White House tried to make Sotomayor sound like a post - partisan figure , much as Obama has tried to position himself .
Part of Sotomayor ’s appeal to Obama was that she was not a law professor or a legal theorist , and on the bench she had written opinions that avoided broad pronouncements and stuck closely to the facts of each case .
“ Her judicial philosophy was to follow the rule of law , apply it in each case , ” the official said .
“ She was not going to be painted as an ivory - tower judge , but a real - world judge .
I do n’t think that she has an ideology — that ’s what was so great about her . ”

Time to leave ( story and shout outs ) .
I bought the game in April 08 .
It was my first ever experience with a music game .
I can still remember playing it for the first time .
Grabbed drums and played medium ( because nobody else was playing hard or expert due to the difficulty ) .
I kept overhitting because I was playing the song in my head and adding extra hits .
Got tired of seeing the combo break so , I went straight to expert .
I got like a 92 % on Dani California , 94 % on Blitzkrieg Bop and an 89 % on Say it Aint So. Meh .
I was bored .
Picked up a guitar and well ...
I guess I became alright at it .
I never tried very hard .
The scores just came to me .
I never pathed .
Squeezing and double squeezing were things that I just did n't care about .
It came to the point that I had over 200 bass FC videos on my first YouTube channel and things seemed alright .
I was going for all bass songs FC'd on video and half of them on guitar .
I lost it a bit after that .
I realized that RB was taking up way too much time in my life .
Recording , editing , playing , score tracking etc .
It was taking time away from my wife , my family , my job and my health was changing .
Anywho .
I decided to delete all of my friends list , all of my videos and several of my websites ( YouTube , Twitter , Facebook etc ) .
About a month later , I realized that I still had the urge to record and play .
That 's when I came up with the idea for the band .
I will go to my grave knowing that we were one of the top three bands in the whole world .
Raw talent , consistency , humour and the scores were there .
Had we played every song , ( even without pathing ) we would have been the best in the world .
No doubt .
Things got in the way though .
TJ had work , women and family .
Tim had work and woman issues .
Toast had school , family and life issues .
I had work and woman issues .
So , today is my 30th birthday and I recently told my wife of 3 years to get the fuck out of my life .
My job sucks huge balls and I 'm so broke you would cry ( No .
Not like , " ca n't get that new something this pay ' cause I need the money for car / gas / date whatevs " .
It 's more like , " If I eat more than twice this week , I will have to short the bills at the end of the month " kinda broke ) .
Real human survival type shit .
It 's time for me to grow up .
Get a grip on this spinning rock and get my poop in a group .
Rock Band has no part in that play .
It 's boring , not funny , same shit over and over and I do n't see an end to it .
I have an extremely obsessive compulsive nature and feel like it may be time to get a new game .
I 've absolutely crushed so many complete libraries of titles and genres , it 's funny .
EA NHL , Tony Hawk , EA skate , Rock Band , Bond , Mario , anything racing etc etc etc .
There are quite a few people here that deserve a good shout out .
Even if we never played , you still affected me somehow .
Those who know me , know that I love my drummers .
Please , dear God , I hope I can remember them all .

You were always there with kind words , comments , ratings , videos , help and information .
I will always remember every video ( from the meh , to the widescreen , to the 3 stars , to the FCs , to the HD and on and on ) .
I hope that you and Isabel stay together for a very long time and make some chubby , caramel coloured babies that will have wonderful heads on their shoulders , excellent knowledge of music and will pwn Rock Band 12 .
For the love of God , if I forgot anyone , I am beyond sorry .
I just realized that I still have 2 weeks of DLC left to play and I still need to redux like 8 Beatles songsâ¦â¦.awkwardâ¦â¦ .
Peace out , everyone .

After sleeping on it , I realized that my announcement was a little short and decided that , if I 'm to go away , some people needed to hear some things .
I bought the game in April 08 .
It was my first ever experience with a music game .
I can still remember playing it for the first time .
Grabbed drums and played medium ( because nobody else was playing hard or expert due to the difficulty ) .
I kept overhitting because I was playing the song in my head and adding extra hits .
Got tired of seeing the combo break so , I went straight to expert .
I got like a 92 % on Dani California , 94 % on Blitzkrieg Bop and an 89 % on Say it Aint So. Meh .
I was bored .
Picked up a guitar and well ... I guess I became alright at it .
I never tried very hard .
The scores just came to me .
I never pathed .
Squeezing and double squeezing were things that I just did n't care about .
It came to the point that I had over 200 bass FC videos on my first YouTube channel and things seemed alright .
I was going for all bass songs FC'd on video and half of them on guitar .
I lost it a bit after that .
I realized that RB was taking up way too much time in my life .
Recording , editing , playing , score tracking etc .
It was taking time away from my wife , my family , my job and my health was changing .
Anywho .
I decided to delete all of my friends list , all of my videos and several of my websites ( YouTube , Twitter , Facebook etc ) .
About a month later , I realized that I still had the urge to record and play .
That 's when I came up with the idea for the band .
I will go to my grave knowing that we were one of the top three bands in the whole world .
Raw talent , consistency , humour and the scores were there .
Had we played every song , ( even without pathing ) we would have been the best in the world .
No doubt .
Things got in the way though .
TJ had work , women and family .
Tim had work and woman issues .
Toast had school , family and life issues .
I had work and woman issues .
So , today is my 30th birthday and I recently told my wife of 3 years to get the fuck out of my life .
My job sucks huge balls and I 'm so broke you would cry ( No .
Not like , " ca n't get that new something this pay ' cause I need the money for car / gas / date whatevs " .
It 's more like , " If I eat more than twice this week , I will have to short the bills at the end of the month " kinda broke ) .
Real human survival type shit .
It 's time for me to grow up .
Get a grip on this spinning rock and get my poop in a group .
Rock Band has no part in that play .
It 's boring , not funny , same shit over and over and I do n't see an end to it .
I have an extremely obsessive compulsive nature and feel like it may be time to get a new game .
I 've absolutely crushed so many complete libraries of titles and genres , it 's funny .
EA NHL , Tony Hawk , EA skate , Rock Band , Bond , Mario , anything racing etc etc etc .
There are quite a few people here that deserve a good shout out .
Even if we never played , you still affected me somehow .
Those who know me , know that I love my drummers .
Please , dear God , I hope I can remember them all .
This list will be in NO PARTICULAR ORDER ( if you 're at the top / bottom , it does n't mean that you 're my best / worst friend ) .

Windows Mobile is just plain awful .
There .
I 've said it , and I feel pretty good .
No , wait .
Actually , I do n't because those words are n't strong enough .
Windows Mobile is a scourge , an embarrassment .
It 's a mass of over - engineered effluvia that only serves to slow you down , get in your way , and make you miserable .
Considering that Microsoft is ever so close to launching one of its best desktop operating systems in years , this is simply unconscionable .
When I attended the Windows 7 Professional Developers Conference in 2008 , I wondered if I would hear anything about the similarly named Windows Mobile 7 .
I knew that Microsoft was working on the mobile OS .
There 'd long been great anticipation that it would be a significant leap forward for Microsoft 's mobile efforts an honest to goodness and much needed reboot .
The reality , however , was beyond disappointing .
No , Microsoft could not talk about Windows Mobile 7 at the conference .
They could n't describe how and the mobile OS might work together .
In essence , Microsoft 's Windows group seemed to know nothing about Windows Mobile 7 .
Even worse , they confirmed my greatest fears : Windows Mobile 7 was n't even on the same development track as Windows 7 .
No one could tell us for sure when it would release .
Now , a year later , we know even less about the mobile OS .
Sure , Steve Ballmer recently talked about renaming Windows Mobile Phones " Microsoft Phones . "
That 's great , Steve .
That should make a big difference .
In the meantime , we 'll suffer with Windows Mobile 6.1 devices ( and , which should arrive next month , and addresses interface issues but leaves the guts intact ) .
Up until last week , I 'd spent only limited time with Windows Mobile phones .
I 've used Palm OS - driven phones , spent considerable time with the iPhone , fiddled with Symbian , and have grown to love my .
Just last week I traveled to South Korea where , unfortunately , my phone is not provisioned to work .
I needed a loaner , so I took the with me .
It 's a lovely , blue phone , with a full qwerty keyboard and an attractive , high - res touchscreen .
Considering how much I missed the touchscreen from my old , I should have loved this phone .
I did n't .
For those of you who have n't used a Windows Mobile phone , you should understand that unless a carrier or phone manufacturer does a lot of work , the WinMo environment is a lot like an itty - bitty version of Windows .
That , on many levels , is a bad thing .
Yes , the Windows Mobile phone multitasks naturally .
It also does about as bad a job as Windows of managing multiple tasks and limited system resources ( Windows 7 promises to be better ) .
At one point , I tried to launch my Saga 's camera and was confronted by a message telling me the phone was collecting resources to launch the camera .
I 've never seen anything like that on any other platform .
When you switch from app to app , or simply launch an app , you see Windows Mobile 's color wheel spinning and spinning .
I rarely see my Blackberry Bold churning like this .
Since Windows
Mobile leaves everything running unless you shut it down , it can drain power faster than beer at a frat party .
My Blackberry
Bold easily lasts the day ( and more ) on a single charge .
Even my Treo 700 p could make it through the day ( even after 3 years of use ) .
The Saga never did .
That , partially , is the hardware 's fault , but it 's also up to the OS to manage processes and power consumption .
Windows Mobile simply did n't do this .
Speaking of useless , the Saga 's low - battery message always told me that " the main battery " was low on power .
Um , there 's only one battery .
Why call it " main ? "
Startup and shut down are equally slow .
What is Windows Mobile doing ?
The Windows Mobile 6.1 homepage , desktop , or whatever you want to call it , is okay .
I mean , it 's passable but not exactly an elegantly - designed mobile interface .
Icons are too small , and the tabbed interface is a bad idea for a mobile phone .
I had the choice of navigating with a traditional mouse pointer or by Navigation mode .
The latter made no sense because it simply hid the mouse and made you guess what you were highlighting .
It was almost like a game .
The Windows Start button on all Windows Mobile phones is an embarrassing misunderstanding of the mobile interface an environment most people navigate with their index finger or thumb .
The browser was useless .
I could n't even figure out how to copy and paste a URL to my Twitter app .
By the way , if you think it 's just me , take a look at how many manufacturers , like Samsung , try and hide the Windows Mobile interface .
Usually they do a pretty good job .
In fact , some of the Samsung phones I saw in Korea last week were particularly impressive .
Still , the spinning color wheel keeps show up , a clear sign that this is still cruddy , old Windows Mobile underneath .
Windows Mobile 6.5 does improve on this situation somewhat .
There are nice , big words on the screen .
The browser will even feature nice , big buttons .
It all looks rational , except that the " Start " menu is still there .
Microsoft needs to kill that before it makes it to Windows Mobile 7 .
I 'm looking forward to Windows Mobile 7 , but I can't help but think about what a monumental missed opportunity this mobile OS has been for Microsoft .
When WinMo 7 arrives next year ( we hope ) , it could be too little , too late .
The iPhone OS keeps getting better and better .
Symbian has Nokia firmly behind it , Android is finally gathering steam , and some partners , including Samsung , are building their own open - source mobile OSes .
Microsoft could have used the Windows 7 roll - out as a launching pad for a whole new mobile initiative .
Instead , that strategy is riding along , decoupled from Microsoft 's most important product .
Steve Ballmer and company had time to fix this .
They could have forced the mobile and desktop teams to work together .
They clearly did n't , and that mistake could doom Windows Mobile .
I honestly do n't know why Microsoft did n't scrap the whole WinMo interface and system years ago .
Seriously , what 's stopping them ?
They can't use the same excuse they use for Windows : there 's too much legacy hardware and software that relies on , for instance , the Registry to do away with it .
Yeah , there are a bunch of WinMo phones out there , but people do n't have whole businesses , major apps , and peripherals tied to them .
It 's not the first time Microsoft has misread a market sector .
Look at how it 's handled the Internet .
Up until this year , it 's been a disaster .
Now , the company has some good products think  and another chance at online success .
I do n't know if there 'll be the same kind of second act for Windows Mobile .
Becoming the Story
On television or in print , Mr. Novak had uncanny access to top officials in many administrations .
Yet Mr. Novak did not rely solely on senior officials .
“ He may be the only major syndicated columnist in Washington who regularly had a meal with the assistant minority staff director of House subcommittees , Mr. Shields said .
“ His sources were n’t status sources . ”
Mr. Novak exulted in his broadcast success .
“ Now strangers come up to me and they say , ‘ I love you on television , ’ ” he told The San Diego Union - Tribune in 1985 .
So when Mr. Novak became embroiled in perhaps the messiest story of his career , Americans had a face on which to focus .
The episode began on July 14 , 2003 , when , acting on a tip , Mr. Novak published the name of a C.I.A. officer , Valerie Wilson .
Her husband , the former diplomat Joseph C. Wilson IV , had made public assertions that the Bush administration had justified the invasion of Iraq by distorting intelligence about Iraqi efforts to acquire unconventional weapons .
Referring to Ms. Wilson by her maiden name , Plame , Mr. Novak disclosed her identity as “ an agency operative on weapons of mass destruction . ”
A federal investigation began ; federal law prohibited the disclosure of the identities of C.I.A. officers in some circumstances .
And it led to the conviction of I. Lewis Libby Jr. , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s chief of staff .
Mr. Libby was charged not with leaking Ms. Wilson ’s name but with perjury , for lying about his conversations with reporters about Ms. Wilson , and obstruction of justice .
President Bush later commuted Mr. Libby ’s 30 - month prison term .
( Mr. Novak himself was at little risk of prosecution under the disclosure law , which applies mainly to people who have authorized access to classified information . )
Some reporters were pressured to identify sources with whom they had discussed Ms. Wilson .
But to the consternation of some liberals and news media critics , there seemed to be little focus on Mr. Novak .
Judith Miller , then a reporter for The New York Times , went to jail for 85 days before she agreed , with Mr. Libby ’s permission , to testify to a grand jury about her conversations with Mr. Libby .

In interviews , Mr. Novak seemed to rub salt into the wounds of the other journalists .
“ I do n’t know why they ’re upset with me , ” he told Brian Lamb of C - Span in 2004 .
“ They ought to worry about themselves .
I worry about myself . ”
I love the look of the original Samoas Girl Scout Cookies , but making them from scratch can be a little bit time consuming .
This is largely because the dough must be rolled out , cut out and then each of the cookies has to be handled individually for topping .
The results are well worth it , in my opinion , but we do n’t always have time to make a labor - intensive recipe – no matter how bad a craving for Girl Scout cookies gets .
Bar cookies are the perfect solution .
This is basically a shortcut recipe that still delivers all the great samoas flavor without some of the more tedious parts of cooking making .
These bars have a buttery shortbread base that is topped with the caramel - coconut samoas topping and chocolate .
It is made in three stages .
First , the shortbread is baked and cooled .
Then , the coconut topping is applied .
Put the coconut on while it is hot , so it will be fairly easy to push it around .
It ’s a thick mixture , but a spatula is all you need to press it into an even layer .
The bars should be cut after the topping has been applied , and even though the shortbread has a melt - in - your mouth quality to it , the topping holds the bars together well .
I recommend using a large knife or a pizza cutter to slice up the bars easily and neatly ; small knives do n’t work quite as well .
The final step is to dip these in chocolate once the topping has set .
Since samoas have chocolate on the bottom and a chocolate drizzle on top , I kept that same look for my bar cookies .
If you want something a bit simpler , just dip half that bars in chocolate – or skip the dipping in favor of a drizzle .
The important thing is that all the flavors get into the batch .
And that you have some friends to share these with , because they can be quite addictive .
Homemade Samoas Bars
Cookie Base :
1/2 cup sugar
3/4 cup butter , softened
1 large egg
1/2 tsp vanilla extract
2 cups all purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
First , make the crust .
Preheat oven to 350 F .
Lightly grease a 9×13 - inch baking pan , or line with parchment paper .
In a large bowl , cream together sugar and butter , until fluffy .
Beat in egg and vanilla extract .
Working at a low speed , gradually beat in flour and salt until mixture is crumbly , like wet sand .
The dough does not need to come together .
Pour crumbly dough into prepapred pan and press into an even layer .
Bake for 20 - 25 minutes , until base is set and edges are lightly browned .
Cool completely on a wire rack before topping .
Topping
3 cups shredded coconut ( sweetened or unsweetened )
12 - oz good - quality chewy caramels
1/4 tsp salt
3 tbsp milk
10 oz . dark or semisweet chocolate ( chocolate chips are ok )
Preheat oven to 300 .
Spread coconut evenly on a parchment - lined baking sheet ( preferably one with sides ) and toast 20 minutes , stirring every 5 minutes , until coconut is golden .
Cool on baking sheet , stirring occasionally .
Set aside .
Unwrap the caramels and place in a large microwave - safe bowl with milk and salt .
Cook on high for 3 - 4 minutes , stopping to stir a few times to help the caramel melt .
When smooth , fold in toasted coconut with a spatula .
Put dollops of the topping all over the shortbread base .
Using the spatula , spread topping into an even layer .
Let topping set until cooled .
When cooled , cut into 30 bars with a large knife or a pizza cutter ( it ’s easy to get it through the topping ) .
Once bars are cut , melt chocolate in a small bowl .
Heat on high in the microwave in 45 second intervals , stirring thoroughly to prevent scorching .
Dip the base of each bar into the chocolate and place on a clean piece of parchment or wax paper .
Transfer all remaining chocolate ( or melt a bit of additional chocolate , if necessary ) into a piping bag or a ziploc bag with the corner snipped off and drizzle bars with chocolate to finish .
Let chocolate set completely before storing in an airtight container .
Makes 30 bar cookies .
Note :
You can simply drizzle chocolate on top of the bars before slicing them up if you ’re looking for yet an easier way to finish these off .
You wo n’t need quite as much chocolate as noted above , and you wo n’t quite get the Samoas look , but the results will still be tasty .
HOOD
HOOD is a method of hierarchical decomposition of the design into software units based on identification of objects , classes and operations reflecting problem domain entities or more abstract objects related to digital programming entities .
It is intended for the Architectural Design , Detailed Design and coding for software to be developed in programming languages such as Ada , C , or FORTRAN , as well as in object oriented languages such as C++ , Ada95 or Eiffel .
The HOOD method comprises textual and associated diagrammatic representations allowing formal refinement , automated checking , user customizable documentation generation and target language source code generation .
The HOOD method was developed in 1987 under European Space Agency ( ESA ) contract A0/1-1890/86/NL /
MA by a consortium of CISI , CRI A/S and Matra Marconi Space .
HOOD has been selected by ESA projects as the design method for the Architectural Design phase .
Since , HOOD has been selected by large , complex or long lived project from aerospace , defense and industry .
Since 1989 the HOOD Manuals have been developed , in response to user experience , by the HOOD Working Group comprising representatives of ESTEC , Columbus and Hermes projects and later under control by the HOOD USER GROUP ( HUG ) .
In 1991 , the HUG was setup as a non profit organisation aiming to provide support for sharing experience and to control the evolution of the method .
The HUG was organized in a STEERING GROUP ( HSG ) in charge of administrative issues , and in a TECHNICAL GROUP ( HTG ) in charge of all technical issues possibly delegating work to specific WORKING GROUPs .
The HOOD REFERENCE MANUAL Issue 3.1 was further developed in 1991 by the HOOD TECHNICAL GROUP and approved for two years by vote by the HOOD USER GROUP at the Pisa ( Italy ) april 3rd 1992 HUG meeting .
The HOOD REFERENCE MANUAL Release 4 was further developed in 1994 by the HOOD TECHNICAL GROUP and approved for two years by vote by the HOOD USER GROUP at the London ( UK ) HUG meeting in februray 1995 .
Initially developed for Ada83 program developments , HOOD is now targeting Ada95 as well as more classical and object oriented languages and systems .
HOOD puts the emphasis on interface and behaviour definition and mastering , some issues that were rather neglected by other design methods .
Moreover HOOD is the framework for mastering and integration of the development of software components which may be developped with different target language and technologies ( MMI generators , DBMS interface generators , rule system and KBS generators ) .
HOOD is thus supporting complex programming and development in the large , relying on code generator technology from high level and when possible , formal notations .
As a result HOOD fills primarily the needs of prime contractors and integrators .
Providing a standard inter -change format , the HOOD method addresses also pragmatic reuse , tool inter-operability and design perenniality .
HOOD is thus the method of choice for large , long - lived projects where reuse , reliability and maintenability are key issues .
Since 1999 , the method is considered stable .
The UML wave has hidden the HOOD methods , but many UML profiles have borrowed the best of HOOD ( HRT - UML , AADL ) .

Some Star Trek fans were upset that J.J. Abrams made crucial edits to his reboot movie .
There was no William Shatner .
No birth of Spock .
And , no hyperkinetic rap songs sung in Klingon .
Fortunately , YouTube exists to solve these problems .
The above montage features one of Europe 's lesser - known pop culture phenoms , Klenginem .
He evidently travels the Euro- convention circuit performing Eminem songs in the native tongue of the planet Kling .
His website includes albums and several MP3s for the aficionado of crinkle - headed rappers .
Sadly , the site 's tour dates page has n't been updated in three years , so the recession must 've crippled the fictional sci- fi language pop music - based economy .

HARRIMAN , Tennessee ( CNN ) -- Pamela Hampton stands at the kitchen sink , her gaze trained out of the window of her family 's small hillside home .
The disaster site is not visible from where she stands , but she knows it is there , down the hill , around a short stretch of highway , less than a mile away .
On December 22 , 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash sludge smothered 300 acres in East Tennessee .
more photos »
Six months after the largest industrial spill in U.S. history , Hampton , her husband , Charles , and their three young children say they still do not feel comfortable going outside .
" Everything here is changed , " Hampton said , her eyes glistening .
" [ The landscape ] reminds me of what you see on the moon .
It breaks my heart . "
A few hours before dawn on December 22 , the walls of a dam holding back billions of gallons of coal ash waste trembled and , finally , crumbled .
The waste , a toxic soup containing ash left over from burning coal , which is then mixed with water , was stored at the Tennessee Valley Authority coal power plant in neighboring Kingston , Tennessee .
On that cold morning , 1.1 billion gallons of coal ash sludge barreled through this community , covering 300 acres .
Sarah McCoin , who lives about a mile from the spill site , awoke to a community in shambles : homes and trees uprooted and a once - lush , green landscape turned to sludge .
" It makes you want to cry , knowing what has been lost , " McCoin said .
" I want my life back . "
Residents are afraid of the chemicals that were released into the environment : arsenic , selenium , lead and radioactive materials including chromium and barium .
" It 's like dumping the periodic table into everyone 's drinking water , " said Anna George , a scientist with the Tennessee Aquarium Research Institute who has for months been testing the waters and fish near the spill site .
Watch more from Dr. Sanjay Gupta 's investigation »
The TVA says contact with wet coal fly ash does not present a serious health risk , though direct skin contact may cause localized irritation .
In a statement on its Web site the authority says : " Testing of the Kingston ash samples shows that concentrations of metals are well below the limits for classification as a hazardous waste . "
It also says there 's been rigorous testing of public drinking water supplies , private wells , river water - and all have met safety standards .
But the mounds of dark , viscous coal ash are sapping the spirit of this community .
" I walked outside [ after the spill ] and said , ' Where did the lakes go ? ' " McCoin said .
The lakes , she added , had been the heart of this once - beautiful community .
" The mental agony alone is enough to put people here over the edge . "
McCoin is a founding member of a support group formed in the wake of the spill , the Tennessee Coal Ash Survivors Network .
She says that many here feel trapped , scared and -- worse -- ignored by the TVA and the government agencies meant to protect them .
" We do n't know what to do or where to turn , " McCoin said .
" It 's pulling families apart because you do n't know , ' Is it safe for me to stay here ? '
And for those who have children , ' Am I poisoning my kids ? ' "
The TVA and the Environmental Protection Agency have released reports indicating that the air , water and general environment here are safe .
They say the levels of toxic chemicals found in coal ash do not exceed federal standards .
As of mid-May , the TVA said it had taken 44,000 air samples ; none had indicated health concerns .
In fact , coal ash is not considered by the EPA to be a hazardous material .
Designation as hazardous material would make coal ash waste -- and its storage -- subject to more stringent federal regulation .
" Over time , EPA 's regulations have treated it as a solid waste , equivalent to household garbage , but not as a hazardous waste , " EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said .
" We know that there are potentially high levels of metals in that ash . "
Jackson has promised that the EPA will revisit the potential hazards of breathing in coal ash .
" We 've promised that we will address regulation for coal ash by the end of the year , " Jackson said .
" And so , by the end of the year , we 'll make that regulatory determination as to whether or not it 's hazardous . "

Whatever the official reports say , the Hamptons believe that the air outside their home could be toxic to their children .
Pamela Hampton says she first noticed that her children were having health problems only days after the spill .
First , 11 - year - old Monica started complaining about headaches .
Then , all three children -- Monica , 6 - year - old Noah and 3 - year - old Joshua -- began to experience upper - respiratory problems , fevers , ear infections , runny noses and red eyes .
" You 're taking your child to the doctor yet again , or two children , and then in a week , the next child is sick , " Hampton said .
" After about the third or fourth time , that 's when I started realizing that this is not a coincidence .
It 's like being sucker - punched . "
Noah Hampton 's ear infections were so persistent , his ears so inflamed , Pamela Hampton says , the family 's doctor said it looked like he had growths in his ears resembling small grapes .
The doctors ' visits over the past six months have been frequent , expensive and inconclusive .
" We 're stuck .
We 're stuck .
For however long , we do n't know , " Pamela Hampton said .
" And what 's going to happen with the future symptoms ?
Is this stuff going to cause permanent DNA damage to our children ?
Death ?
Cancer ? "
Two miles away from the Hamptons , Pam Phillips is also feeling trapped .
For the past nine years , Phillips has suffered from debilitating seizures , the cause of which her doctors could never quite pinpoint .
What seems to trigger them , she says , is stress and fatigue .
For years before the spill , Phillips says , her seizures were under control , striking once every two or three months .
After the December deluge , her seizures started to get worse and come more frequently .
" Now I have them every other day , " Phillips said , adding that increasingly , she awakens from seizures in more and more perilous situations .
" I 've passed out on the ground and hurt my shoulder , fell down the steps in the basement . "
Phillips believes that her stress and anger about the spill and her family 's health are triggering the seizures .
Phillips says that since the spill , her 9 - year - old son , Steven , has had a relapse of chronic bronchitis he had not experienced in several years .
Other family members , including Phillips ' husband and daughter , complain about headaches , problems breathing and nosebleeds .
Like Hampton and McCoin , Phillips says the TVA has failed to respond to community concerns .
The TVA has said that it will set up clinics to test community members ' blood for potential toxics .
McCoin says those clinics have been promised for months .
" We recognize that people may have difficulty trusting TVA since we were the ones who caused the -- we did n't cause it -- we were the ones who experienced this spill , " said Anda Ray , senior vice president of the TVA 's Office of Environment and Research .
" We are committed to a long - term cleanup of this area because the environment was impacted .
There 's habitat that 's no longer there , and we will work with that . "
The TVA has begun dredging the Emory River and by mid-May had purchased about 100 affected properties .
But locals say they want more than cleanup .
They want answers about their health problems .
" TVA is denying health issues , yet they tell us ' do n't breathe it , do n't touch it , do n't let kids near it , ' " McCoin said .
" I know darn well that stuff 's hazardous , and you know what , they know it too , " McCoin said .
In the immediate aftermath of the spill , a Duke University study concluded that toxic elements in the coal ash could be suspended into the atmosphere , posing a health risk to local communities .
The study also concluded that the coal ash caused contamination in surface waters and that accumulation of toxic contaminants in river sediment could poison fish .
Anna George and colleagues have found high levels of potential toxics , including arsenic and selenium , in the tissues of fish still swimming amid the coal ash in the Tennessee , Clinch and Emory rivers .
George calls fish a " canary in a coal mine " when it comes to forecasting eventual human health problems .
An issue among the fish , which could have implications for humans , is breathing problems .
" We 've seen some fish where the gills were completely coated in [ coal ash ] sediment , " George said .
" Fish absorb oxygen right across their gills the same way we absorb oxygen right across our lungs .
In a community desperate for answers , it turns out that science offers very few , at least about long - term health impact of breathing in contaminants .
Studies show that ingesting arsenic , an ingredient in the coal ash that spilled from the TVA site , at certain levels could cause cancer .
In fact , a study released by environmental groups and universities in May found levels of arsenic 260 times the federal drinking water standard -- and lead levels at least 16 times the drinking water standard .
There was also a higher than normal level of selenium which in high doses could cause neurological problems ; the International Agency for Research on Cancer describes it as a " probable human carcinogen . "
George says that although the risk to fish and wildlife in the area is becoming clearer , the impact on humans may take decades to sort out .
And many other communities may find out as well : an EPA report last month identified 44 more sites like the TVA 's that pose a " high hazard " to nearby communities if they leak or fail .
The Hamptons , the Phillipses and the McCoins have no choice but to stay here .
All three families are participants in lawsuits filed against the TVA so that they can be compensated -- so that they may have the funds to leave the area .
" We 're like a leper colony that 's been lost , " McCoin said .
" People think they 're going to die before they 'll see results , " Hampton said .

For PC gaming , this week was the best of times and the worst of times — new graphics hardware on display from AMD and Intel , but aimed at an ailing PC gaming market that 's in its worst shape ever .
At AMD 's big VISION event earlier this month , the company gave a technical deep dive on its next - gen GPU family , codenamed Evergreen .
The embargoes are now up on the technical details and reviews of the first product in this family , the Radeon 5870 , an embargo lift that was no doubt timed to take a little of the wind out of Intel 's long - awaited Larrabee reveal yesterday .
The verdict ?
AMD 's debut DirectX 11 GPU now has the single - GPU performance crown by a comfortable margin , and with a significant timing lead on NVIDIA 's upcoming DX11 hardware .
A single new 5870 outperforms two 4870s , and without a major increase in power or cooling requirements .
A 2X performance boost versus the previous generation in the same thermal envelope is quite an achievement , and it reinforces yet again the fact that the real action at AMD is on the ATI side of the campus .
As for Larrabee , Intel 's Sean Maloney showed a real - time ray - tracing demo that seemed to run at somewhere around 25 FPS or less .
The demo was interesting graphically the way that , say , solo bassist Stanley Clark is interesting musically — you 're mightily impressed by the sight of something so difficult being done with such speed , but the end result is n't really the kind of thing you want to rock out to on a regular basis .
The real - time ray tracing stuff just does n't look that great yet , and it probably wo n't look as good as rasterized graphics anytime soon .
Of course , Larrabee will also do rasterized graphics , and probably about as well as a midrange GPU from ATI or NVIDIA .
But running games that use the traditional rasterization pipeline is n't where Larrabee is designed to shine .
Intel really needs two things to happen with Larrabee : 1 ) a killer app , like GLQuake was for 3Dfx , and 2 ) a console win .
I can't really speak to # 2 ( I think it 's going to happen , but what do I know ) , and for # 1 , all I can say is that Tim Sweeney is pretty fired up about being the guy who codes that killer app .
And what Tim Sweeney codes , the rest of the industry licenses .
All of this power and potential , though , is a moot point if game developers continue to target consoles and then port their games to the PC .
Scott Wasson goes on a little mini-rant about this subject at the end of his Radeon 5870 review , and I also heard quite a bit about this problem from some other prominent PC hardware personalities at IDF .
Current PC CPU + GPU combinations are already at some large theoretical multiple of the performance of gaming consoles , but you 'd never know it from looking at 3D PC games , all of which are written with the console market in mind .
It 's to the point where there 's almost a chicken - and - egg problem , where nobody shells out for a PC gaming rig because the games do n't look that much better than their console counterparts , and nobody develops PC - only titles because gamers are n't shelling out for PC gaming rigs .
All of this is compounded by the downturn , which has hit the high - end GPU market especially hard .
I 'm personally coming around to the idea that something like OnLive / OTOY / Gaikai is where the market is headed , because when the client market totally dries up there will be a " game server " market for GPUs waiting in the wings , and GPU vendors will push it like crazy .
But that 's a topic for another day .
Worms Eat My Garbage
by Mary Appelhof
Rating : *****
Synopsis :
Appelhof 's classic guide to vermicomposting is the definitive resource for anyone interested in starting a worm bin .
Short and easy to read with clever illustrations , Worms Eat My Garbage includes information on what kind of container and worms to use , how to set up a worm bin , how to feed your worms , and how to harvest your compost .
As a bonus , Appelhof also includes frequently asked questions about worms , including how they eat , poop , and reproduce .
This is definitely the only book about vermicomposting you will ever need .
Here 's just a sampling of the information in this book :
Why choose a worm bin ?
Because of the worms ' high rate of digestion , a worm bin can be much smaller than a regular compost bin , and you can keep it indoors , enabling you to compost year round .
Composting allows you to turn your kitchen food waste into valuable fertilizer for your garden rather than adding it to a landfill .
You can also save energy and water through composting by avoiding use of a garbage disposal .
What size container should I use ?
" Plan on one square foot of surface for each pound of garbage per week . "
How many worms do I need ?
Appelhof recommends a 2:1 ratio of worms to garbage .
In other words , you need 2 pounds of worms for every pound of garbage you produce a day .
What can I put in my worm bin ?
Yes !.... vegetables , fruits , coffee grinds , tea leaves , pulvarized egg shells
No !... too much citrus , meat , bones , feces , preferably no dairy ( stinky and attracts flies , mice , ants , and rats )
How do I use my compost ?
top dressing
transplants ( sprinkle in the bottom of each hole )
seed beds ( spread in a row )
potting soil ( mix with peat moss , perlite , and sand or garden soil )
Worms Eat My Garbage
My Opinion
Related Posts :
Note that this is just a tiny example of the information in .
I strongly recommend reading this book yourself if you are interested in worm bins .
This book was even better than I expected .
It 's a perfect introduction and guide to vermicomposting , and I now feel ready to get my worm bin started .
Right now , the thing holding us back is the amount of newspaper we need .
We do n't subscribe to the local paper , so it 's a matter of saving up the bits of junk newspaper that come in the mail .
Appelhof says you can use regular printer paper but that newspaper works better , and since I 've read of others who failed at vermicomposting , I want to make sure I do it right from the start .
Would it be worth subscribing to the newspaper just to get paper for my worm bin ?
Or does anyone else know of a good source of newspaper ?

A Guide To Vastu Vidya
Vastu vidya is the science of architecture .
It originated in India about five thousand years ago .
The sages of ancient times studied nature , especially the movements of the sun , and set down certain principles regarding the construction of temples and palaces .
Later , vastu principles were applied to buildings of all types .
There are a number of influences that form the basis of vastu vidya .
Let 's take a look at some of them .
The Sun
Solar influence plays a very important role in vastu .
The rays of the rising sun are very good for the growth of all life .
Therefore , the east is a direction that is considered to be very auspicious .
The rays of the setting sun , on the other hand , emit harmful ultra violet rays .
This is why walls in the south - west corner of a building should be thicker than usual .
The Five Elements
The five basic elements are earth , fire , wind , sky and water .
All these elements are in constant interplay .
A balance is needed between them for a happy and harmonious life .
Positive And Negative Energies
Vastu believes that there are two strong forces that are in constant motion in the cosmos .
The union of these two energies brings about the birth of a third energy called Prana or life .
When you build a structure over a plot of land , these energies are disturbed .
They enter the building and continue their interaction .
A problem occurs if the negative energy is greater than the positive one .
Vastu helps to rebalance the flow of both the energies so that the vibrations in the building are more positive .
Directions
A lot of importance is placed on the eight directions .
In fact , vastu vidya is based on directions .
The eight directions are north , south , east , west , north - east , north - west , south - east and south - west .
The north and east , in particular , are thought to be of great significance .
Natural Law
Vastu vidya is a science .
This can be proven by the fact that it is based on the theory of Natural Law .
Natural Law is the intelligence that is the cause of all life in the universe .
The principles of vastu are such that you make the best possible use of Natural Law .
Vastu also takes into account the theory of electromagnetism .
Apart from noise , air and water pollutants , electromagnetism also pollutes the environment .
According to Vastu , space is used to decrease our exposure to electromagnetism .
Vastu principles state that human beings must live in harmony with their environment .
Any imbalance in this relationship affects the quality of life .
Therefore , vastu is applied to every aspect of building - from choosing the plot of land , the construction , and interior decoration to the actual time of relocation .
Using vastu principles ensures that a building has good ventilation , nice d�cor and is a pleasure to live in .
You do n't have to break down an existing structure to follow vastu .
A few simple modifications to the house or the different placement of objects can change the energy of your home or office .
Trick or Tweet ?
Twitter launches crackdown after millions are duped by fake accounts
The social networking site Twitter is clamping down on fake celebrity accounts after being sued in America .
Thousands of famous names have fallen victim to impostors , including Britney Spears , Foreign Secretary David Miliband , the Dalai Lama and even the Queen .
This summer , Mr Miliband was forced to deny quotes widely attributed to him after the death of Michael Jackson .
The comments had been written on a seemingly plausible Twitter account under his name .
Twitter has decided to act after Tony La Russa , the coach of an obscure American baseball team , launched a legal action over a fake account .
He claimed that postings in which he appeared to make light of the death of two of his players had been ‘ hurtful ’ .
Twitter , which has six million users who can send instant blogs on their activities to anyone who chooses to follow them , denies it has any legal case to answer .
But it is now testing a new system to ensure that users can identify genuine celebrity accounts .
In future , a tick alongside a name will guarantee it is genuine .
Until recently , Twitter has had a liberal attitude towards celebrity impostors as long as it was clear that the postings were not genuine .
One blogger claimed to be jailed record producer Phil Spector , writing from his prison cell .
Among the fake Spector ’s comments were : ‘ People ask me for my opinion of American Idol .
It ’s a total insult to music .
Not my thing . ’
A phoney account under the name of film star Christopher Walken and bearing his picture is still regularly read by more than 90,000 people .
And in March this year , actor Ewan McGregor ’s spokesman claimed the star was considering legal action to remove a fake Twitter account that had attracted 20,000 followers .
The Mail on Sunday ’s own Piers Morgan has also been targeted by an impostor who has accumulated a following of 17,650 .
One of the more recent postings has the Britain ’s Got Talent judge saying : ‘ Well done everyone for backing Susan [ Boyle ] , such a talented lady . ’
Jonathan Ross recently unmasked an impostor claiming to be comedian Jack Dee .
The BBC presenter phoned Dee to check if the postings were really his .
A fake account in the name of Girls Aloud singer and X Factor judge Cheryl Cole was so convincing that Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles was duped into becoming one of her more than 31,000 followers .
Star Trek star William Shatner told an interviewer who asked him about his hugely popular Twitter account : ‘ I do n’t even know what Twitter is . ’
But 116,000 people still follow the fake William Shatner .
A fake Twitter account for George W. Bush has 1,100 followers , and recently had the former President saying of the Queen ’s birthday : ‘ Queenie Lizzie ’s birthday party today .
She ’s lookin’ good for 110 years old , or however old she is . ’
One of several fake Gordon Ramsays regularly swears at his 6,700 followers .
In June , as the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray , Berkshire , suffered from an outbreak of food poisoning , the fake Ramsay wrote about the owner : ‘ Feel sorry for Heston [ Blumenthal ] .
F****** bad luck . ’
The number of fake accounts has led to British website Valebrity offering its own verification service .
Its founder , Steven Livingstone , said many fake accounts were set up to carry out direct marketing .
He said : ‘ People are making a lot of money out of it .
Nobody knows who ’s who on these sites . ’
Typically , social networking sites remove fake accounts if there are complaints or fraud is suspected .
But Twitter is unable to track impostors because no proof of identity is ever requested from its users .
A Twitter spokesman said : ‘ We ’re working to establish authenticity , starting with well - known accounts that have had problems with impersonation or identity confusion . ’
This post has now moved to http://www.codebuddy.co.uk/4-things-to-consider-when-fixing-a-bug/
So , you ’ve just spent a few hours , days , or maybe weeks ( ! ) tracking that down that bug .
You ’ve finally found it – what do you do ?
The fix is trivial , its a one line change , you can fix it right now , have it committed to source control , picked up in the next software release and move on to reading slashdot .
But before you go ahead and change that line of code , there are a few questions you should be asking yourself :
# 1 How hard was it to track this bug down ?
If you ’ve been crawling over broken for a couple of days the chances are you ’ve been adding some extra diagnostics to the system – these should be committed as part of the bug fix .
Do not underestimate the importance of an easily diagnosable system , it will save you lots of time in the long run , not just for bug fixing , but during general development as well .
# 2 Can I prevent the bug from being reintroduced in the future ?
Now you can reproduce the bug ( you have reproduced it before your claiming its fixed right ? ) – you need to write some form of test , why ?
The tests will first expose the bug , then prove the fix .
The test will act as an insurance policy on your fix , as long as no one removes the test , the bug will stay fixed .
Ideally you ’ll expose this via a unit test .
This is the quickest form of feedback a developer can be given about the state of the system and will allow you to develop the fix with a very short feedback loop .
If this is not possible , then a regression test is your next best bet .
# 3 Have I had it code reviewed ?
A code review need only take a few minutes of another developers time , and will double the number of people that inspect the code before you commit , not a bad return really .
If the code review takes longer , then the changes must be significant , or the problem domain suitable complex that running the change by another devloper really is a no brainer .
# 4 Do I have a bug number to commit the change against ?
Be sure to reference the bug number when you commit your fix .
You do n’t need to detail the symptoms of the bug in the commit , that is what a bug tracking system is for .
Not only will this prove useful to other devlopers when they see your changes go in , it will also allow those that raised the bug see that work is happening on it .
Conclusion
These are the questions I go through in my mind before committing a fix – let me know yours !

* Microsoft introduces “ Project Natal ”
* Controller - free technology for Xbox 360 game system
* Microsoft integrates Facebook , Twitter into Xbox Live ( Recasts ; adds Project Natal details , executive comment )
LOS ANGELES , June 1 ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp MSFT.O on Monday offered a glimpse into a future where the Xbox 360 console is the centerpiece of any living room , and games , social interaction and communications are controlled with the wave of a hand .
At a star - studded event at the annual E3 video game conference that drew appearances by Paul McCartney and Steven Spielberg , the company unveiled “ Project Natal , ” which uses a camera to track a user ’s movements via full skeletal mapping .
It also recognizes voices and vocal commands .
The technology obviates the need for a controller or remote device to enable a player for instance to drive a car in a game , interact with a character on screen or show pictures and information to other Xbox 360 users over the Internet .
“ You are the controller , ” Shane Kim , Microsoft ’s vice president of strategy and business development for videogames , said in an interview in Los Angeles .
“ That ’s a very powerful piece of technology -- full body gesture tracking , not just two hands . ”
On Monday , Microsoft also said it planned to boost its Xbox 360 gaming console by integrating music - streaming service last .
fm , Web social network Facebook and microblogging site Twitter into its Xbox Live online community .
The announcements underscore how the interactive gaming industry , a growing business with estimated annual sales of about $ 50 billion despite the economic downturn , is looking into ways to attract new gamers while retaining their core audience .
Perhaps with an eye on the economy , Don Mattrick , senior vice president of Microsoft ’s Interactive Entertainment Business , said the “ Natal ” technology can refresh the gaming experience without making consumers buy a new device , which typically costs $ 250 to $ 500 .
Microsoft would also avoid hefty manufacturing and marketing costs .
“ We can leap into a new era of interactive entertainment without launching a new console , ” Mattrick told reporters .
Kim declined to detail when “ Project Natal ” games and service will be available , saying only that “ it ’s not a 2009 thing . ”
IN LIVING COLOR
Phil Spencer , the head of Microsoft ’s Game Studios , said the technology has been well received by software developers .
“ It ’s pretty obvious that the controller is not going away , but the ability to augment the gaming experience that people are used to is one of the paths that people will take , ” he said .
For now , Microsoft is focusing on beefing up its fledgling Xbox Live service .
Users of Xbox Live will be able to keep tabs on and communicate with friends using popular Internet services such as Facebook and Twitter , without needing to use a computer .
The move broadens Microsoft 's goal of transforming the console system -- a distant No. 2 to Nintendo Inc 's 7974.OS
Wii machine -- into the center of the living room and more than just a game - playing box .
That goal is echoed by Sony Corp 6758.T , whose PlayStation 3 console also hosts community and entertainment features as well as game playing .
“ This expands the reach of Xbox live , ” Kim said .
“ We have had an effort of making Xbox live a next - generation social and entertainment network .
The event was kicked off by a demonstration of the upcoming version of Viacom Inc's VIAb.N MTV Networks ' Rock Band franchise featuring songs by The Beatles .
Taking the stage briefly were surviving Band members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr , and Yoko Ono and Olivia Harrison , widows of John Lennon and George Harrison , respectively .
For more details of Microsoft 's event , click twitter.com / MediaFile ( Additional reporting by Kemp Powers ; Editing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang )
An administration official said tonight that Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius " misspoke " when she told CNN this morning that a government run health insurance option " is not an essential part " of reform .
This official asked not to be identified in exchange for providing clarity about the intentions of the President .
The official said that the White House did not intend to change its messaging and that Sebelius simply meant to echo the president , who has acknowledged that the public option is a tough sell in the Senate and is , at the same time , a must - pass for House Democrats , and is not , in the president 's view , the most important element of the reform package .
A second official , Linda Douglass , director of health reform communications for the administration , said that President Obama believed that a public option was the best way to reduce costs and promote competition among insurance companies , that he had not backed away from that belief , and that he still wanted to see a public option in the final bill .
" Nothing has changed , " she said .
" The President has always said that what is essential that health insurance reform lower costs , ensure that there are affordable options for all Americans and increase choice and competition in the health insurance market .
He believes that the public option is the best way to achieve these goals . "
When Facebook first introduced status updates , it was interesting reading the continuous updates of people in my friends list .
Different people used it in different ways ; most used it to inform others about their current status , but some took it too far and were – ridiculously – reporting nearly every single action they do .
Then Twitter appeared with the question “ What are you doing ? ” , and took the obsession of status updates to a whole new level .
Today , not only people report what they do , but also objects , appliances and even animals do as well !
We looked around the Web for non-human twitterers beside the commonly known news ( and spam ) bots and brought you the following list – some ridiculous and some useful :
1. Tweeting Plant :
You do n’t have to worry – anymore – about knowing when your plant is thirsty and in need of water , it will tell you by itself !
@ Pothos is a tweeting plant that sends status updates to Twitter and defines a new way of communication between plants and human beings !
2. Tweeting Toilet :
Yes !
Your toilet can post to Twitter every flush – that is if you want the world to know about it -!
Follow @hacklabtoilet for this guy ’s toilet updates !
3. Tweeting Office Chair :
This @ OfficeChair tweets whenever it detects “ natural gas ” such as that produced by human flatulence ( trying to be professional ; ) ) .
Its inventor claims that this is a part of his commitment to accurately document and share his life as it happens !
I , personally , would rather skip that part when documenting my own life !
4. Babies Tweeting from the Womb :
Well , actually it is a device that contains vibration sensors and is strapped over a pregnant woman ’s belly to detect each kick and then send it to Twitter .
Basically babies can start tweeting from their mother ’s wombs before they even take the first breath of fresh air !
You can get more info about the device through its Twitter account : @kickbee
5. Tweeting Heart Beats :
It is a device that tracks your heart beats and post them to Twitter so that people know that you are still alive .
But what happens when Twitter goes down – as it usually does -?
People freak out !
6. Tweeting Bakery :
Yummy !
What is better than fresh baguettes , tin loaves and date and pecan bread just out of the oven ?
That is the type of messages you would expect to read on Twitter from @AlbionsOven .
Albion Cafe , located in London , is the first cafe to install the BakerTweet device , which is a device that ’s meant to help busy bakers by telling the world that something hot and fresh has just come out of the oven .
7. Tweeting Toaster :
Hans Scharler enjoys letting people know that he is toasting at home !
He invented this tweeting toaster ( @MyToaster ) which now enjoys more Twitter followers than he does !
8. Tweeter Popcorn Robot :
It is as simple as this , send a tweet to your Twitter Popcorn Robot before you leave your work and enjoy it when you get home , all ready to be served !
Follow the updates of its brilliant inventor here ( @robedorobotics )
9. Tweeting Remote Control :
IBM is creating a new remote control that tweets your TV watching automatically !
So in a few months you will be able to let your friends know what you are watching instantly and without interrupting your favorite shows .
10 . Home Light Switches Twitter Reader :
Not only your popcorn robot can read your tweets and act accordingly , but your home light switches can as well .
Today you can switch you home lights off / on remotely through your Twitter account .
I just hope that your neighbors wo n’t freak out and claim that your house is haunted by ghosts !
11 . Tweeting House :
The house of Andy Stanford - Clarke ( @andy_house ) located on the south coast of the Isle of Wight tweets about the status of many of its resources including its bathrooms heater , its gym temperature , its doors and water consumption !
I like that !
12 . Tweeting Power Usage Detector :
Are you looking for a way to limit your house power consumption ?
There is no better way to do so than letting each room of your house report its own power consumption , right ?
And yes , you can do that now !
Tweet - a- watt ( @tweetawatt ) is the device that does that , it can tweet the status of your power usage for every single room in your house .
13 . Tweeting Washing Machine :
We all forget our laundry in our washing machines , do n’t we ?
You do n’t have to worry anymore , today , you can enjoy reading your friend ’s tweets knowing that your washing machine will send you a tweet ( see @PiMPY3WASH ) when it is done .
Check out how it works on Vimeo .
14 . Tweeting Cat Door / Tracker :
Do you want to monitor your pet ’s activity ?
You can do that now using this device that logs the entrance and exit of your pets activity and send it to twitter ( see @bobbinandtuffin ) !
Wonderful , is n’t it ?
15 . Tweeting Bridge :
London ’s Tower Bridge is the first bridge on this planet that informs people when it is going to open and when it is going to close via Twitter .
Twitter makes bridges talk !
How awesome is that ?!
If you happen to ship in London ’s River Thames and want to check when the Tower will open before it does , then follow its Twitter updates here : @towerbridge .
I ’m sure there is a more reliable system though !
16 . Tweeting Telescope :
For over 50 years the giant Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank has been a well - known feature of the Cheshire landscape and an internationally renowned landmark in the world of astronomy .
Today , it has the ability to talk to us via Twitter ( @LovellTelescope ) and tell us where exactly it is pointing to in space .
17 . Tweeting Cars :
Did you watch 7 pounds for Will Smith ?
It ’s a great movie that is built on the idea of how risky it is to write a text message while driving .
ATX Group came up with a solution by inventing a device that is capable of taking your words and sending your message without you having to type anything .
So , basically , you can now tweet while you are driving !
18 . Tweeting Sonar Distance Buzzer :
Joshua McGinnis has invented a device that can detect his distance from his laptop and send it to Twitter ( @hereandaway ) .
It may sound useless now , but I am sure that others can find different ways to implement it in useful applications .
19 . Matt ’s Office :
Matthew Morey came up with a two way communication system between his devices via Twitter .
He can retrieve information about the status of different devices in his office and at the same time send them Twitter commands to take actions !
You can follow his flow of tweets on @ MattsOffice .
Impressive , is n’t it ?
20 . Tweeting Beer Robot – Wired.com ’s Kegerator :
As it sounds , a robot that serves beers and tweets about it ( @beerrobot ) !

Events at the Creation Museum
From hands - on science programs to presentations from our engaging speakers , there 's always something happening at the Creation Museum .
Enhance your time with these fun learning experiences , whether it ’s your first , fifth , or fifteenth visit !
The main focus of skepticism about how long people lived in the Bible has focused mainly on the genealogies listed in the first several chapters of Genesis .
Adam lived to be 930 years old ( Genesis 5:5 ) and Methuselah , the oldest human , lived 969 years ( verse 27 ) .
Noah , who was already 600 years old when the flood came , lived a total of 950 years .
What are we to make of all these advanced ages ?
Although undoubtably humans before the flood lived very long lives , those living after the deluge experienced lifespans that were significantly shorter .
For example , Moses lived to the age of 120 , which is slightly less than Jeanne Calment who in 1997 died at the age of 122 years .
The ancient Roman historian Varro asserted that to understand the REAL age of the patriarchs one must divide their lifespans by 12 ( i.e. , substitute lunar months for solar years ) .
This , however , does not work when one considers the age at which the patriarchs sired their first son .
For example , if we divide the age at which the Bible says Enoch had Methuselah ( 65 - see Genesis 5:21 ) by twelve , we end up having him become a father just after he turned five years old !
What might have caused the decline in lifespans to what we now accept as normal ?
There are ways to attempt to explain the difference in longevity although they are somewhat speculative .
For example , Henry Morris and John C. Whitcomb in the seminal scientific creationist book " The Genesis Flood " promote the idea that because the earth 's water was suspended above it ( see Genesis 1:6 - 7 ; cf. 7:11 ) before the great Flood , it helped protect the patriarchs from ultraviolet radiation .
Such water in the atmosphere made for a better , more even and temperate climate throughout the earth .
After climatic conditions radically changed after the Deluge , people on average lived shorter and shorter lives ( assuming they were not cut down by childhood diseases , etc. ) to where a ' good long life ' was considered living to the age of 70 or 80 ( Psalm 90:10 ) .
Much like the belief that God ( re ) created the world in six days in Genesis 1 , it 's easy today to be skeptical that the pre-flood patriarchs lived an average of more than 800 years .
But , if we remember that an all - powerful , all - knowing God could have remade the world faster than we could snap our fingers , we should not think the information in Genesis is so far - fetched .
Ultimately , it comes down to belief , a reasonable but not blind faith .
If the Bible is reliable in what can be checked , it 's reasonable to believe in what can not be checked .
It 's much like questioning a witness in a court room during a trial .
If the witness ' story checks out in parts that can be checked , and is not contradictory , etc. , then it 's reasonable to believe his or her testimony on matters that can not be verified .
This explanation of pre-flood lifespans may not seem fully plausible to our rationalistic minds , but that is where faith comes in .
Piratenpartei und Sexismus Fritz Effenberger
Ist die junge Piratenpartei eine enttäuschte Liebe oder sitzt sie nur in der Statistikfalle ?
Bleibt die aktuelle Piraten - Sexismusdiskussion ein Bauchnabelproblem des äußersten linken Randes unserer Gesellschaft oder erleben wir hier einen handfesten ideologischen Generationenkonflikt ?
Ich tippe natürlich auf letzteres .
In den letzten Tag kocht im Read - Write - Web , also dem Teil der Interwebitubes , wo man auch mitmachen darf , ein Thema hoch , das ich so nicht erwartet hätte : Diskriminierung von Frauen , a.k.a.
Sexismus bei der Piratenpartei .
Doch , wirklich , mich hat es überrascht , hier ausgedehnte Betroffenheitserklärungen zu lesen .
Dass man die Piraten nicht wählen könne , obwohl ja eigentlich alles richtig sei , was in ihrem Programm stünde .
Weil sie darauf verzichtet haben , explizit auf Gleichstellungsforderungen hin zu weisen , ja sogar auf die Unterscheidung zwischen Pirat und Piratin , und das auch noch auf dem Parteitag , per basisdemokratischen Beschlusses .
Sowohl Piratinnen als auch Piraten haben dort nämlich für die geschlechtsneutrale Anrede " Pirat " gestimmt .
Darf das sein ?
Hoffnungen und Statistiken
An manchen Stellen wird diese Diskussion emotional : " Es ist fast wie eine enttäuschte Liebe : Da ist eine neue Partei , rebellisch , wild und entschlossen im Kampf gegen die alten Knochen – und dann stellt sie sich als zutiefst sexistisch heraus ... "
An anderen kommen Sachargumente auf den Tisch : " Der Frauenanteil ist bei der PP signifikant geringer als in anderen Parteien . "
Die Angesprochenen geben sich aufklärerisch : " Wer also Quoten , Sonderrechte oder sprachliche Artefakte wie Binnen - Kapitälchen will , der ist bei uns fehl am Platz . "
Oder auch ganz unverblümt : " Nur rumzicken gilt nicht ! "
In die Neue Welt segeln
Jetzt muss ich etwas tun , von dem ich ebenfalls nicht gedacht hätte , dass ich es jemals würde tun müssen .
Nämlich einen Willkommensgruss aussprechen .
So wie zuvor schon an die Medienindustrie .
Oder andere .
Diesmal : Willkommen im 21sten Jahrhundert ( bzw. 3ten Jahrtausend ) , liebe GleichstellungskämpferInnen .
Und gleichzeitig meine Gratulation dafür , liebe FeministInnen , dass euer Einsatz so reiche Früchte getragen hat .
Gleich in der ersten Dekade des jungen Jahrhunderts ( bzw. Jahrtausends ) hat sich nämlich eine Partei gebildet , die alles , wofür ihr gekämpft habt , als Selbverständlichkeit betrachtet .
Natürlich sind Frauen und Männer gleichberechtigt , natürlich ist sexuelle Orientierung Privatsache .
Und nur wenn man das nicht in jedem zweiten Nebensatz betont , heißt das nicht , dass man ( als Pirat ) sich in die gesellschaftliche Steinzeit zurückwünscht .
Nein .
Die Piraten sind die Folgegeneration der Bürgerrechtsbewegung und stellen sich zusätzlich der Herausforderung der digitalen Revolution , des Umbruchs unserer Gesellschaft , die gerade in ihre eigene Zukunft stürzt .
In die Informationsära .
Diese Herausforderung wird von der " alten " Generation der BürgerrechtkämpferInnen ( und hier sind alle Altersgruppen vertreten ) mangels Verständnisses ihrer Tragweite nicht wahrgenommen .
Deswegen musste auch eine eigene Partei her .
Die Bürgerrechtsbewegung der 80er und 90er ( a.k.a. " Grüne " ) hat Unersetzliches für unsere Gesellschaft geleistet , muss aber jetzt einsehen , dass es neue Aufgaben zu lösen gilt .
Gleichstellung und Umweltbewusstsein sollten zumindest innerhalb des Bürgerrechts - Milieus als Standard gelten .
Und zur Überschrift dieses Beitrags : Eigentlich gibt es kein Problem zwischen Frauen und Piraten .
Nur zwischen den beiden Generationen der Bürgerrechtsbewegung .
Und auch hier nur , weil die ältere sich ( wie immer ) anstellt .
Das aber ist eine Position , die so nicht von allen verstanden wird .
Im Gegenteil , man wird dafür erstmal beschimpft : " Wenn ich Deine Ergüsse so lese , kriege ich das Kotzen ... " und " Insofern betrachte ich deine Meinung nur als unerleuchtetes , dummes Geschwätz . " ]
Meinungsfreiheit über alles , aber trotzdem ist es erfreulich , dass sich hier " nur " die Frauen - Gleichstellungs - KämpferInnen aufregen .
Schließlich ignorieren die jungen Piraten auch die Errungenschaften früherer Bürgerrechtsbewegungen wie der SPD , nämlich gleiches Wahlrecht für alle - und Arbeitnehmerrechte dazu .
Weil uns allen , die wir zur Zeit am Leben sind , diese Rechte als selbstverständlich gelten .
Obwohl sie es , im Falle der Arbeitnehmer , in Problemsituationen genauso wenig sind wie im Falle der weiblichen Bürger .
Und jeweils auch aktiv eingefordert werden müssen .
Nur muss man eben unterscheiden , und dazu sollten erwachsene Leute fähig sein , wo gegen Diskriminierung gekämpft werden muss , und wo sie schon überwunden ist .
Meine Bitte also an die Bürgerrechts - " oldschool " : Seid netter zu euren Töchtern und Söhnen , den Piratinnen und Piraten , und tadelt sie nicht für ihr freies Denken .
Das haben sie nämlich von euch gelernt .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Senate passed groundbreaking legislation Thursday that would make it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity .
President Obama has said the country must make significant changes to ensure equal rights .
The expanded federal hate crimes law now goes to President Obama 's desk .
Obama has pledged to sign the measure , which was added to a $ 680 billion defense authorization bill .
President George W. Bush had threatened to veto a similar measure .
The bill is named for Matthew Shepard , a gay Wyoming teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in October 1998 , and James Byrd Jr. , an African - American man dragged to death in Texas the same year .
" Knowing that the president will sign it , unlike his predecessor , has made all the hard work this year to pass it worthwhile , " said Judy Shepard , board president of the Matthew Shepard Foundation named for her son .
" Hate crimes continue to affect far too many Americans who are simply trying to live their lives honestly , and they need to know that their government will protect them from violence , and provide appropriate justice for victims and their families . "
Several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate - crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality .
Attorney General Eric
Holder has asserted that any federal hate - crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias , as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs .
Holder called Thursday 's 68 - 29 Senate vote to approve the defense spending bill that included the hate crimes measure " a milestone in helping protect Americans from the most heinous bias - motivated violence . "

" The passage of this legislation will give the Justice Department and our state and local law enforcement partners the tools we need to deter and prosecute these acts of violence , " he said in a statement .
Joe Solmonese , president of the Human Rights Campaign , called the measure " our nation 's first major piece of civil rights legislation for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people . "
" Too many in our community have been devastated by hate violence , " Solmonese said in a statement .
" We now can begin the important steps to erasing hate in our country . "
This month , Obama told the Human Rights Campaign , the country 's largest gay rights group , that the nation still needs to make significant changes to ensure equal rights for gays and lesbians .
" Despite the progress we 've made , there are still laws to change and hearts to open , " he said during his address at the dinner for the Human Rights Campaign .
" This fight continues now , and I 'm here with the simple message : I 'm here with you in that fight . "
Among other things , Obama has called for the repeal of the ban on gays serving openly in the military , the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy .
He also has urged Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act .
The Defense of Marriage Act defines marriage , for federal purposes , as a legal union between a man and a woman .
It allows states to refuse to recognize same - sex marriages .
The Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations
Act would extend family benefits now available to heterosexual federal employees to gay and lesbian federal workers .
More than 77,000 hate - crime incidents were reported by the FBI between 1998 and 2007 , or " nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade , " Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee in June .
The FBI , Holder added , reported 7,624 hate - crime incidents in 2007 , the most current year with complete data .

Cambridge , Mass .
Last August the president of Harvard University , Drew Gilpin Faust , set up a committee to respond to the concerns of black faculty members and students who were uneasy , and in some cases upset , about the treatment of blacks by the campus police .
The arrest last month of Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. did not occur in a vacuum .
While his encounter was not with the Harvard University Police Department ( he was arrested by a member of the Cambridge force ) , it was the latest in a series of troubling incidents that have left law - abiding members of the Harvard community feeling as though they were unfairly targeted and humiliated because of their race .
The incident that ultimately led Ms. Faust to establish the committee concerned a black high school student who was working in a youth employment program at Harvard .
The Harvard police , responding to a phone call , spotted the youngster attempting to remove a lock from a bicycle .
He tried to explain that the bike was his and that his key had broken off in the lock .
One of the officers reportedly pulled a gun and pointed it at the teenager .
The frightened youngster said he did not have any photo identification , but he showed the officers his library card .
Traumatized , he started to cry at one point .
When the boy ’s story was eventually confirmed , he was allowed to leave with his bike .
OUT OF OUR MINDS : HOW DID HUMANS COME DOWN FROM THE TREES AND WHY DID NO ONE FOLLOW ?
[ VANESSA WOODS & BRIAN HARE : ]
Mikeno sits with his chin resting on his right hand , in a startling imitation of Rodin 's Thinker .
His left arm is thrown over his knee , and his eyes are slightly out of focus , as though he 's deep in thought .
With his black hair parted carefully down the middle and his rosy pink lips , Mikeno looks human .
But he is n't .
Mikeno is a bonobo — an inhabitant of Lola ya Bonobo , one of a number of African sanctuaries for apes orphaned by the bushmeat trade , this one in the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Bonobos share more DNA ( 98.7 percent ) with us than they do with gorillas — enough so that under his glossy black hair Mikeno has the body of a young athlete , complete with chiseled biceps and a developing six - pack .
The question is : where among the three billion nucleotides of his genome is the 1.3 percent that makes Mikeno a bonobo instead of a human ?
We have been seeking to define our humanity for thousands of years .
Plato described a human being as a featherless creature that walks on two legs ; in response , Diogenes turned up at one of Plato 's lectures holding a plucked chicken .
Other
definitions have come and gone :
Only humans use tools .
Only humans intentionally murder one another .
Only humans have souls .
Like mirages in the desert , the definitions are always shifting .
In the six million years since hominids split from the evolutionary ancestor we share with chimpanzees and bonobos , something happened to our brains that allowed us to become master cooperators , accumulate knowledge at a rapid rate , and manipulate tools to colonize almost every corner of the planet .
In evolutionary time , our progress has been swift and ruthless .
What allowed us to come down from the trees , and why ?
Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking ?
When children turn four , they start to wonder what other people are thinking .
For instance , if you show a four - year - old a packet of gum and ask what 's inside , she 'll say , " Gum . "
You open the packet and show her that inside there 's a pencil instead of gum .
If you ask her what her mother , who 's waiting outside , will think is in the packet once it 's been reclosed , she 'll say , " Gum , " because she knows her mother has n't seen the pencil .
But children under the age of four will generally say their mother will think there 's a pencil inside — because children this young cannot yet escape the pull of the real world .
They think everyone knows what they know ,
because they cannot model someone else 's mind and in this case realize that someone must see something in order to know it .
This ability to think about what others are thinking about is called having a theory of mind .
Humans constantly want to know what others are thinking : Did he see me glance at him ?
Does that beautiful woman want to approach me ?
Does my boss know I was not at my desk ?
A theory of mind allows for complex social behaviors , such as military strategies , and the formation of institutions , such as governments .
Throughout the 1990s , scientists ran dozens of pioneering experiments in an attempt to determine whether chimpanzees — who , like bonobos , share 98.7 percent of our DNA — possess a theory of mind .
An experiment conducted by Daniel
Povinelli of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette gave chimpanzees the choice of using a visual gesture to request food from someone who was blindfolded , someone with a bucket over his head , someone whose hands were over his eyes , or someone who could actually see them .
The chimps did n't discriminate ; they made the begging gesture at people who obviously could n't see them just as often as they begged from people who were looking straight at them .
If chimpanzees have no theory of mind , which this set of findings suggested , then that could be what distinguishes humans from other animals .
That was before Brian and two colleagues , Josep Call and Michael Tomasello , began working with Jahaga , a female chimpanzee at the Wolfgang Köhler Primate Research Center of the Leipzig Zoo .
The experiment went like this :
In a room at the center , you sit behind a Perspex panel with a tray extending from it that holds a banana .
Jahaga sees the banana .
She can also see you watching , and knows that if you see her coming , you 'll pull in the tray , because you 've already kept food from her like that .
Instead of simply rushing for the banana , Jahaga casually walks to the back of the room , as though she did n't want your measly banana and was bored by the whole game .
She continues along the back wall , slinking around a partition until she 's out of sight .
Then , when she knows the partition is blocking your view of her , she walks low and fast behind it and swipes the banana off the tray .
This was the first experiment to investigate whether chimpanzees will actively deceive another individual based on what that individual can or cannot see .
Deception can be one important test of whether or not you possess a theory of mind , because , in many cases , in order to deceive someone you have to know what they 're likely to be thinking and then try to manipulate the situation such that their thinking changes in your favor .
Jahaga 's behavior in this experiment — and later that of other chimpanzees — seemed deceptive , not just because she slinked to a place where she knew you could n't see her ( that is , she was sensitive to what you were thinking ) but also because she seemed to be deceptive about being deceptive : she looked as though she were pretending not to be interested in the banana ( that is , she may have been trying to manipulate what you thought about her intent ) .
After Jahaga , a whole range of experiments have shown that in a number of contexts chimpanzees do think about what others are thinking about .
Low - ranking chimpanzees will always go for the food that 's hidden from a dominant chimpanzee 's view , because they know the dominant has not seen it .
If you suddenly look up , a chimpanzee will follow your gaze , wondering what you 've seen .
If you delay giving chimpanzees food , either by teasing them or accidentally dropping it , they know when you 're being intentionally mean , and they act more frustrated than they do when you 're just being clumsy .
But does this mean that chimpanzees have the same theory of mind that we do ?
Point It Out
Even though Jahaga and other chimpanzees exhibit a sophisticated theory of mind on one level , on another level they 're hopeless .
If you hide a banana under one of two cups in such a way that Jahaga cannot see which cup you 've chosen , and then you point to the cup where the banana is ; Jahaga can't use your gesture to find it .
You can tap on the cup , put a bright - colored block on it , maybe even dance around it , but Jahaga wo n't pick the correct cup any more often than she picks the wrong one .
Dozens of trials later , she might start guessing the pattern , but if you change the cue from pointing to , say , tapping , she does n't realize that the new cue will help her find the food .
She has to learn to make use of your new gesture all over again .
However , human children under the age of two can use your pointing to find food .
Even if you just look at the correct cup , children will follow your gaze and use it to gain information about what you know .
They understand that you 're trying to help them by communicating the location of the hidden goodie .
From these types of experiments with chimpanzees , it seems reasonable to conclude that using communicative gestures is something that evolved in our species after our lineage split from the other apes .
Perhaps sharing information in this way enabled early humans to develop a much more complex form of culture than that seen in other animals .
But if that 's so , then how might such an ability have evolved in the first place ?
Go Fetch
Oreo was the best dog any kid could wish for .
He would take you to your friend 's house and sit outside until it was time to ride your bike home again .
He would let you give him as many hugs as you wanted when you were at an age when it was n't cool to hug anyone except your dog .
Most important , Oreo loved to play fetch .
He would play fetch until your arm fell off , because he could easily carry three tennis balls in his mouth at once .
The problem was , he usually could n't keep up with where all the balls were going ; after collecting the first two , he would n't have a clue where the third one had landed .
After a few moments of frantic searching , he would race back to eye you , panting expectantly , waiting .
If you pointed in the right direction , he would be back seconds later , with all three balls covered with slobber and ready for throwing again .
Anyone with a dog knows that when they want something and they know that you know where it is , they will watch your body language like a hawk for the slightest clue .
Sure enough , when Brian and colleagues played the cup game with a myriad
of dogs , they could point to , gaze at , or tap with a toe on the hiding place and the dogs would immediately find the hidden treat ( and not because of their powerful noses — in these experiments , dogs cannot determine which cup hides the food without a visual cue ) .
Why does an animal like a dog succeed where our closest living relative fails ?
One idea is that dogs live with us , so over thousands of hours of interacting with us , they learn to read our body language .
Another idea is that the pack lifestyle and cooperative hunting of wolves , the canids from which all dogs evolved , made all canids , dogs included , more in tune with social cues .
To test the first idea , you need to play with puppies .
If nineweek - old puppies pass the cup test , then perhaps reading human gestures is n't something dogs learn as they grow older but something they 're born with .
Brian and colleagues found
that such puppies passed the test , but there was still the question of whether their first nine weeks had been enough to pick up human communicative gestures .
So puppies reared in a kennel , with very little exposure to humans , were tested , too .
The kennel puppies passed .
As for the second idea , you need to spend some time with the big bad wolves .
When Brian and colleagues tested wolves at a wolf sanctuary and compared their accomplishments with those of a group of pet dogs , it became obvious that wolves were no better than chimpanzees at acting on human social cues .
Thus it seems that dogs must have evolved to act on human social cues within the last forty thousand years — that is , since they split from their wolf ancestor through the process of being domesticated .
The implications are exciting : a social skill that is an important developmental basis for human culture , cooperation , and language — a precursor and component of the human theory of mind — may have evolved in the dog as a result of interacting with us over many generations .
Could it really be that domestication can lead to such a change in problem - solving abilities ?
So it would seem , but to test this idea you have to go to the middle of Siberia .
Clever Fox
The train ride from Moscow to Novosibirsk in summer is two days of green meadows filled with bright flowers .
Once you get to Novosibirsk , you journey another half hour or so to Akademgorodok , the home of one of the greatest experiments in modern genetics .
Dmitri Belyaev was fired from a research laboratory in Moscow because his Mendelian view of genetics conflicted with that of Trofim Lysenko , the great Soviet scientist .
Belyaev was lucky that his punishment ended with losing his Moscow job ; under Stalin , dissent from Lysenko's theories of environmentally acquired inheritance was against the law , and many prominent scientists died in the Gulag .
In 1958 , Belyaev moved to Novosibirsk , where he became director of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics and , in the following year , began breeding 130 silver foxes in a kind of Mendelian experiment .
He put one group under severe selection pressure using a simple method : those foxes that approached an experimenter lived to breed for another generation ; those that snarled at humans or showed aggression toward them were turned into fur coats .
The other group , a control , was bred randomly with regard to how they behaved toward humans .
After only forty generations , the selected foxes began to display changes you ( and Darwin , too ) might think would take millions of years to evolve .
As expected , they became incredibly friendly toward humans .
Whenever they saw people , they barked , wagged their tails , sniffed the people , and licked their faces .
But even stranger were the physical changes , which occurred at a higher frequency than in the control group .
The ears of the selected foxes became floppy .
Their tails turned curly .
Their coats lost their camouflage and became spotty , with a star pattern appearing on the forehead .
Their skulls became smaller .
In short , they looked and behaved remarkably like their close relative the domestic dog .
Now came the big test .
If dogs had acquired social skills in the process of domestication , then perhaps the selected silver foxes acquired those skills , too .
And they did .
Domesticated silver foxes could read human body language as well as any dog .
The control lineage could not .
The skill of silver foxes at reading human social cues is a crucial piece of the puzzle .
People ( including the authors ) had supposed that the unusual social skills found in dogs had probably evolved because smarter dogs had been more likely to survive and reproduce during domestication .
But Belyaev 's foxes were n't bred to be smarter than the average fox , just friendlier .
It seems that the selected foxes are more skilled at reading human cues as a by - product of a loss of fear of humans , which was replaced by an intense interest in interacting with us .
The social skills of dogs may have evolved through a similar process during their domestication .
In order to avail themselves of garbage around human settlements , protodogs had to lose their fear of us .
Subsequently , and by accident , while interacting with us they began deploying the social skills they were using to interact with one another — as if we were just part of the pack .
Most important ( and controversial ) , something similar may have happened in human evolution .
Instead of getting a jump start with the most intelligent hominids surviving to produce the next generation , as is often suggested , it may have been the more sociable hominids — because they were better at solving problems together — who achieved a higher level of fitness and allowed selection to favor more sophisticated problem - solving over time .
Humans got their smarts only because we got friendlier first .
The Chimpanzee Deficit
Cooperation is a cornerstone of human achievement , in part dependent on our sophisticated theory of mind and use of social cues .
But humans are not the only species to be skilled cooperators .
What is it about humans that makes us such flexible cooperators ?
Or , put another way : what goes wrong with chimpanzee cooperation ?
They live in highly social groups , hunt food together , maintain political relationships .
What stops them from becoming as flexible as humans ( or dogs , for that matter ) at solving problems involving cooperation and communication ?
Ngamba Island Chimpanzee Sanctuary is a sprawling hundred acres of primary forest in the middle of Lake Victoria , in Uganda .
On a clear day , you can hear the pant hoots of chimpanzees across the water .
In the chimps ' night enclosure , Kidogo and Connie are faced with a dilemma .
A wooden plank just out of reach is piled high with food on either end .
To bring it within reach , they each have to pull on a rope threaded through metal loops on the plank .
If only one of them pulls , the rope comes unthreaded and the plank stays where it is .
Kidogo , a dominant female , pushes Connie out of the way and pulls on Connie 's end of the rope — which then whizzes out of the loops so that no one gets any food .
This behavior is puzzling , because chimpanzees in the wild are great cooperators , frequently hunting for food in what appears to be a complicated and organized fashion .
But perhaps there is not much thinking going on behind this kind of cooperation ; it could simply be that because each animal wants the same thing and all are at work at the same time , success happens by accident and just looks like a cooperative endeavor .
But if you watch Kidogo and Connie at feeding time , you will notice that they do n't share food .
If Connie has a piece of food and Kidogo is around , Kidogo will most likely steal it from her .
On the other end of the spectrum , Sally and Becky have grown up together in the sanctuary and are like sisters .
They share food peacefully , all the time .
When you give them the rope test , they succeed on the first trial .
Clearly , if you allow for tolerance , chimpanzees can cooperate spontaneously .
Not only do they know when they need someone , they also remember who 's a good partner .
Mawa , another dominant chimpanzee , is not a very good cooperator .
He does n't wait for his partner to pick up the other end of the rope and instead pulls it free of the plank .
Bwambale , on the other hand , is a great cooperator ; he waits for his partner , and they are nearly always successful in getting the food .
At first , the other Ngamba chimps chose Mawa and Bwambale equally , but after Mawa botches it , most chimps chose Bwambale on the next trial .
However , such cooperation in chimpanzees is highly constrained .
Chimpanzees will cooperate only with familiar group members , with whom they normally share food .
If they do n't know or like a potential partner , they wo n't cooperate no matter how much food is at stake .
Humans , however , make a living collaborating , even when it's with people they do n't know and in many cases do n't particularly like .
( Do you have a boss ? )
This high level of social tolerance is likely one of the building blocks of the unique forms of cooperation seen in humans .
So perhaps a lack of tolerance is one of the main constraints on chimpanzees ' developing more flexible cooperative skills .
But humans have another closest relative , one who is usually forgotten and may be more like us than we know .
Long - Lost Cousins
In contrast to chimpanzees , who live in male - dominated societies with infanticidal tendencies and other forms of lethal aggression , bonobos live in societies that are highly tolerant and peaceful thanks to female dominance , which maintains group cohesion and regulates tensions through sexual behavior .
Since bonobos are more tolerant than chimpanzees , what does this mean for their cooperative abilities ?
Further tests were done with the chimpanzees at Ngamba Island .
As long as the food was in two separate piles on either end of the plank , most of the chimps could cooperate fine .
But as soon as you put the food in one monopolizable pile in the
middle , chimpanzee cooperation fell apart .
Even though chimpanzees participating in the test were relatively tolerant of each other and had passed the rope / plank test many times before , whenever the food could be monopolized by a dominant chimp , the other chimp generally refused to pull .
When we gave the same test to bonobos , they played and had sex to negotiate with each other — even though this was their first run-through .
Bonobos are notorious for their sexuality .
Females rub their clitorises together ; males have sexual activity with males .
Neither age nor gender seems to matter .
Sex is a tension - relieving activity in the group , used to soothe ruffled tempers or form alliances .
It also appears to be a negotiating activity , engendering a high level of tolerance in bonobos .
So what we have are chimps who cooperate but are n't very tolerant , and bonobos who are very tolerant but do n't really cooperate in the wild .
What probably happened six million years ago , when hominids split from the ancestor we share with chimpanzees and bonobos , is that we became very tolerant , and this allowed us to cooperate in entirely new ways .
Without this heightened tolerance , we would not be the species we are today .
Finding Our Minds in Africa
Spontaneous cooperation is not the only way in which bonobos are more like humans than chimpanzees are .
As with humans , gender differences in bonobos are less pronounced .
The males are not physically very different from the females .
Female bonobos , like human females , develop strong bonds , whereas female chimps generally do n't .
Humans and bonobos have similar temperaments , in that we are both risk averse and wary of the new .
Understanding bonobos is crucial to understanding what makes us human .
Unfortunately , their numbers are dwindling fast .
The only country where they 're indigenous is the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and the various wars that periodically break out there have made studying them difficult .
Africa 's ape sanctuaries , including Lola Ya Bonobo , Ngamba Island , and the Tchimpounga Sanctuary for chimpanzees in the Republic of the Congo , offer an exciting opportunity to probe the minds of our closest relatives .
Unlike lab animals , who are likely to suffer chronic psychological and physical problems in captivity , sanctuary apes live in large social groups in vast areas of tropical rain forest .
The semicaptive apes can be tested in indoor enclosures , similar to conventional laboratories but much less costly .
Sanctuary animals show no aberrant behavior ( e.g. , rocking or feces eating ) , and preliminary data suggest they may outperform captive apes in a variety of physical tasks , presumably because of the richness of their everyday environment .
Mikeno , the bonobo who sat like a Rodin sculpture , died in September 2006 .
An autopsy revealed a contusion on his brain , which suggests he died of a concussion after falling from a tree .
Mikeno's close friend Isiro sat by him and refused to leave the body .
Did she understand death ?
Did she feel a humanlike grief ?
We 're still a long way from discovering exactly what makes us human , but even if we do , there will still undoubtedly be a thousand more questions to answer about what makes a chimpanzee a chimpanzee and a bonobo a bonobo .
That the elderly of all groups of Americans most strongly oppose President Obama on health care reform shows the success of Republican fear - mongering over supposed Medicare cuts and " death panels " .
And on Monday , the Washington Post did the GOP a great service in a piece titled , " On Medicare Spending , a Role Reversal . "
While exploring the impact of projected savings in the program that serves 46 million Americans , the Post left unchallenged the Republicans ' laughable claim to be the new protectors of Medicare after decades of war against it .
Readers who stopped after the first two paragraphs could be forgiven for wrongly assuming that the party that brought you Medicare would now kill it but for the stalwart defense of the Republican Party .
After the subhead declaring , " Republicans , Not Interest Groups , Fight Plans to Cut $ 400 Billion Over 10 Years , " the Post 's Lori Montgomery concluded :
After years of trying to cut Medicare spending , Republican lawmakers have emerged as champions of the program , accusing Democrats of trying to steal from the elderly to cover the cost of health reform .
It 's a lonely battle .
The hospital associations , AARP and other powerful interest groups that usually howl over Medicare cuts have also switched sides .
To her credit , Montgomery details the backing for Democratic - lead health insurance reform from AARP , the Federation of American Hospitals and other groups , support which comes precisely because new gains for American seniors will not result in benefit cuts under any of the proposals now on the table .
The majority of the estimated in $ 400 billion in savings comes from reducing the overpayments private insurers under the Medicare Advantage program .
As the AARP 's David Sloane concluded , " We believe " that the insurance companies would " continue to deliver Medicare benefits at the same level they do now . "
As the Commonwealth Fund 's Stuart Guterman similarly concluded in an analysis compiled by Politifact , " in no case will [ Advantage patients ] get less Medicare benefits than people in the rest of the program . "
But nowhere in the Washington Post 's article is there any mention that Republicans tried to block the creation of Medicare in the 1960's and unsuccessfully sought to gut its budget by 15 % in the 1990's .
The words of Republicans past and present tell the tale .
Before his later canonization by the GOP faithful , Ronald Reagan announced in 1961 that the failure to stop Medicare meant " you and I are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children 's children what it once was like in America when men were free . "
Three years later , his future successor George H.W. Bush decried it as " socialized Medicine . "
Just this July , Georgia Rep. Tom Price , a one - time orthopedic surgeon and current chairman of the Republican Study Group , proclaimed :
" Going down the path of more government will only compound the problem .
While the stated goal remains noble , as a physician , I can attest that nothing has had a greater negative effect on the delivery of health care than the federal government 's intrusion into medicine through Medicare . "
Throughout the 1990's , Newt Gingrich , Mitch McConnell and their Republican colleagues continued the GOP war on Medicare .
Hoping to slowly but surely undermine the program by shifting its beneficiaries to managed care and private insurance , in 1995 McConnell was among the Republican revolutionaries backing Gingrich 's call to slash Medicare spending by $ 270 billion ( 14 % ) over seven years .
As Gingrich put it then :
" We do n't want to get rid of it in round one because we do n't think it 's politically smart , " he said .
" But we believe that it 's going to wither on the vine because we think [ seniors ] are going to leave it voluntarily . "
When President Clinton and his Democratic allies in Congress rushed to defend Medicare from the Republican onslaught , Gingrich launched a blistering assault :
" Think about a party whose last stand is to frighten 85 - year - olds , and you 'll understand how totally morally bankrupt the modern Democratic Party is . "
Fast forward to 2009 and Gingrich 's Republicans are precisely that morally bankrupt .
Throughout August , GOP demagogues falsely claimed Democratic health care proposals would gut Medicare benefits .
Sarah Palin and Obama negotiating partner Chuck Grassley warned about mythical government " death panels " which would " pull the plug on grandma . "
Amazingly , a recent poll showed that 59 % of self - identified conservatives and 62 % of McCain voters believe that the government should " stay out of Medicare . "
As for Mitch McConnell , who a decade ago wanted to take a butcher knife to Medicare , the Senate Minority Leader is using a rhetorical scalpel to slash Democrats :
" Some in Congress seem to be in such a rush to pass just any reform , rather than the right reform , that they 're looking everywhere for the money to pay for it -- even if it means sticking it to seniors with cuts to Medicare . "
( Earlier this month , RNC chairman Michael Steele reflected incarnate the GOP contradictions - and hypocrisy - over Medicare .
He called for " no cuts to Medicare to pay for another program , " only to announce just days later , " You 've got to deal with those inefficiencies , absolutely . " )
And so it goes .
Republicans are worried not that Obama 's health care reform might fail , but that it would succeed , and thus for years make Democrats the party of choice for grateful Americans .
So the GOP pretends to now defend the Medicare program it has always opposed and doubtless will again in the future .
But reading the Washington Post , you 'd never know .
( This piece also appears at Perrspectives . )
UPDATE : It is worth noting , as Steve Benen does , that far from protecting Medicare , Republicans in Congress are actively intent on " privatizing it out of existence . "
As he points out , " this year , 137 Republicans -- more than three - fourths of the caucus -- voted in support of a GOP alternative budget plan that called for ' replacing the traditional Medicare program with subsidies to help retirees enroll in private health care plans . ' "
And in a jaw - dropping Wall Street Journal op - ed just three weeks ago , Sarah Palin called for fundamentally altering the program by " providing Medicare recipients with vouchers that allow them to purchase their own coverage . "

Conclusions
My new Guardian column , " The BBC is encrypting its HD signal by the back door , " describes a petition from the BBC to Ofcom , the UK telecoms regulator , seeking permission to encrypt its broadcast signals , something it is prohibited from doing .
The BBC proposal goes like this : Hollywood studios are blackmailing us and demanding this .
But the encryption wo n't be bad , since it 'll only affect a few programmes and only in small ways .
It 's simply not true .
The BBC is being deliberately misleading and extremely naive here .
Naive because it 's just not credible that the Hollywood studios and other rightsholders will boycott broadcast TV without encryption .
They made exactly the same threat in the US , saying that without the Broadcast Flag , they 'd stop licensing sport and movies to broadcast TV .
There 's no Broadcast Flag in the US .
The broadcasts of sports and new release movies go on .
Misleading because the BBC 's proposal turns over control of the design of TV receivers and recorders in the UK to an offshore consortium called DTLA , effectively turning it , not Ofcom , into the British regulator .
DTLA and its guidelines will determine what you can do with your TV signals , not Parliament and copyright law .
DTLA prohibits the use of open source drivers , which means that this will render obsolete all cards and other devices with that can be used with free / open software .
It also prohibits unencrypted digital outputs , which means that you wo n't be able to buy a converter box that sends a HD digital signal to your SD Freeview box , so you 'll have to throw out the old box .
Be sure to check out the comments where I 'm debunking the BBC 's talking points directly .
Some background : licence - fee - paid television must be free to receive in the UK .
Unlike cable and commercial satellite signals , free - to - air television is carried on public airwaves , which broadcasters are allowed to use for free .
In return , broadcasters are expected to provide programming on those airwaves , for free .
And not just free as in " free beer " , but also free as in " free speech . "
The terms and conditions for free - to - air telly are " Do anything you want with this , provided it does n't violate copyright law . "
But big rightsholder groups – US movie studios , mostly – object to this .
They 'd prefer a " copyright - plus " regime , in which they get to invent a bunch of new copyrights for themselves , without the inconvenience of public debate or parliamentary lawmaking .
The way they do this is by slapping restrictive licence agreements on their media , or rather licence " agreements , " in inverted commas .
You do n't get to negotiate these " agreements , " they 're imposed on you , and are sometimes even invisible to you .
The BBC is encrypting its HD signal by the back door
Got a bullying boss ?
Take solace in new research showing that leaders who feel incompetent really do lash out at others to temper their own inferiority .
“ Power holders feel they need to be superior and competent .
When they do n’t feel they can show that legitimately , they ’ll show it by taking people down a notch or two , ” says Nathanael Fast , a social psychologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles , who led a series of experiments to explore this effect .
In one , Fast and his colleague Serena Chen , who is at the University of California , Berkeley , asked 90 men and women who had jobs to complete online questionnaires about their aggressive tendencies and perceived competence .
The most aggressive of the lot tended to have both high - power jobs and a chip on their shoulder , Fast and Chen found .
To see if a bruised ego can actually cause aggression , the researchers manipulated people ’s sense of power and self - worth by asking them to write about occasions when they felt either empowered or impotent and then either competent or incompetent .
Previous research has suggested that such essays cause a short - term bump or drop in feelings of power and capability , Fast says .

Feel - bad factor
Next , Fast and Chen asked their volunteers to select a punishment to be given to university students for wrong answers in a hypothetical test of learning .
Volunteers chose between horn sounds that ranged from 10 decibels to a deafening 130 decibels .
The volunteers who felt the most incompetent and empowered picked the loudest punishments – 71 decibels on average .
Workers who felt up to their jobs , selected far quieter punishments , between 55 and 62 decibels , as did those primed to feel incompetent yet powerless .
Flattery seems to temper the aggressive urges of insecure leaders .
When Fast and Chen coaxed the egos of these volunteers by praising their leadership skills , their aggressive tendencies all but disappeared .
This is proof that leaders are aggressive because of a hurt ego , not simply a threat to their power , Fast says .
This might also explain why leaders of organisations both big and small surround themselves with yes - men and women , he says .
Blind flattery may not be the best solution for the 54 million US citizens estimated to have experienced workplace bullying ( PDF ) .
But easing leaders into new positions of power , or telling them that it ’s natural to feel daunted , could prevent future outbursts , says Adam Galinsky , a social psychologist at Northwestern University ’s Kellogg School of Management in Evanston , Illinois .

Scientists at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease ( GICD ) have traced the evolution of the four - chambered human heart to a common genetic factor linked to the development of hearts in turtles and other reptiles .
The research , published in the September 3 issue of the journal Nature , shows how a specific protein that turns on genes is involved in heart formation in turtles , lizards and humans .
" This is the first genetic link to the evolution of two , rather than one , pumping chamber in the heart , which is a key event in the evolution of becoming warm - blooded , " said Gladstone investigator Benoit Bruneau , PhD , who led the study .
" The gene involved , Tbx5 , is also implicated in human congenital heart disease , so our results also bring insight into human disease . "
From an evolutionary standpoint , the reptiles occupy a critical point in heart evolution .
While bird and mammalian hearts have four chambers , frogs and other amphibians have three .
" How did hearts evolve from three to four chambers ? " Bruneau said .
" The different reptiles offer a sort of continuum from three to four chambers .
By examining them , we learned a lot about how the human heart chambers normally form . "
He explained that with four chambers — two atria and two ventricles — humans and all other mammals have completely separate blood flows to the lungs and to the rest of the body , which is essential for us to be warm - blooded .

When it comes to reptiles , such as turtles and lizards , there is debate about whether they have one or two ventricles , which are the pumping chambers .
" The main question for us to understand the evolution of the heart was to identify the true nature of these early reptile ventricles and to figure out what controls the separation of the heart into left and right sides , " said Dr. Bruneau .
To better understand reptile heart evolution , Dr. Bruneau 's team used modern molecular genetics to examine Tbx5 .
Mutations in the human gene that encodes Tbx5 result in congenital heart disease and , in particular , defects in the ventricular septum , the muscular wall that separates the ventricle into two sections .
Tbx5 is a transcription factor , a protein that turns other genes on or off .
In humans and other mammals , Tbx5 levels are high in the left ventricle and low in the right .
The boundary of high and low levels is right where the septum forms to divide the ventricle into two parts .
" Based on these observations , " said Dr. Bruneau , " we thought Tbx5 was a good candidate as a key player in the evolution of septation . "
The team looked at Tbx5 distribution in the turtle and the green anole lizard .
During the early stages of heart formation in both reptiles , Tbx5 activity is found throughout the embryonic ventricular chamber .
In the lizard , which forms only one ventricle , this pattern stays the same as the heart develops .
However , in the turtle , which has a primitive septum that partially separates the ventricles into left and right sides , distribution of Tbx5 is later gradually restricted to the area of the left ventricle , resulting in a left - right gradient of Tbx5 activity .
This meant that the gradient of Tbx5 forms later and less sharply in the turtle than in species with a clear septum , such as mammals , providing a tantalizing clue about how septation evolved .
They then wanted to determine whether Tbx5 was really a main regulator of septation or merely a bystander .
Mice were genetically engineered to express Tbx5 at a moderate level throughout the developing heart , just like in turtle hearts .
By mimicking the turtle pattern , mouse hearts now resembled turtle hearts .
The offspring from these mice died young and had only a single ventricle .
This striking result conclusively showed that a sharp line delineating an area of high level of Tbx5 is critical to induce formation of a septum between the two ventricles .
" This really nailed the importance of Tbx5 in patterning the heart to allow septation to occur , " said Dr. Bruneau .
advertisement
During evolution , new genetic regulatory elements evolved to tell the Tbx5 gene to form a sharp boundary of Tbx5 expression .
This resulted in two ventricles .
Researchers will now work to identify those genetic regulatory mechanisms during the evolution of reptiles .
The work also has important implications for the understanding of congenital heart defects , which are the most common human birth defect , occurring in one out of every one hundred births worldwide .
Humans born with only one pumping chamber , resembling frog hearts , suffer the highest mortality and require extensive surgery as newborns .
" Our study provides exciting new insights into the evolution of the heart , which had not been examined in over 100 years , " Dr. Bruneau explained .
" In a larger context , it provides good support for the concept that changes in the expression levels of various regulatory molecules are important in evolution .
From these studies we also hope to understand further how defects in septation occur in humans with congenital heart disease . "

This 65 - metre - wide hole in the lunar surface extends at least 80 metres down and could be an opening into a larger lunar cave ( Image : ISAS / JAXA / Junichi Haruyama et al . )
Update 4 January 2010 : The paper has now been published in Geophysical Research Letters ( DOI : 10.1029/2009GL040635 ) .
A deep hole on the moon that could open into a vast underground tunnel has been found for the first time .
The discovery strengthens evidence for subsurface , lava - carved channels that could shield future human colonists from space radiation and other hazards .
The moon seems to possess long , winding tunnels called lava tubes that are similar to structures seen on Earth .
They are created when the top of a stream of molten rock solidifies and the lava inside drains away , leaving a hollow tube of rock .

Their existence on the moon is hinted at based on observations of sinuous rilles – long , winding depressions carved into the lunar surface by the flow of lava .
Some sections of the rilles have collapsed , suggesting that hollow lava tubes hide beneath at least some of the rilles .
But until now , no one has found an opening into what appears to be an intact tube .
“ There ’s sort of a chicken - and - egg problem , ” says Carolyn van der Bogert of the University of Münster in Germany .
“ If it ’s intact , you ca n’t see it . ”
Finding a hole in a rille could suggest that an intact tube lies beneath .
So a group led by Junichi Haruyama of the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency searched for these “ skylights ” in images taken by Japan ’s Kaguya spacecraft , which orbited the moon for almost two years before ending its mission in June .
Deep cave
The team found the first candidate skylight in a volcanic area on the moon ’s near side called Marius Hills .
“ This is the first time that anybody ’s actually identified a skylight in a possible lava tube ” on the moon , van der Bogert , who helped analyse the feature , told New Scientist .
The hole measures 65 metres across , and based on images taken at a variety of sun angles , the the hole is thought to extend down at least 80 metres .
It sits in the middle of a rille , suggesting the hole leads into a lava tube as wide as 370 metres across .
It is not clear exactly how the hole formed .
A meteorite impact , moonquakes , or pressure created by gravitational tugs from the Earth could be to blame .
Alternatively , part of the lava tube ’s ceiling could have been pulled off as lava in the tube drained away billions of years ago .
Radiation shield
Finding such an opening could be a boon for possible human exploration of the moon ( see What NASA ’s return to the moon may look like ) .
Since the tubes may be hundreds of metres wide , they could provide plenty of space for an underground lunar outpost .
The tubes ’ ceilings could protect astronauts from space radiation , meteoroid impacts and wild temperature fluctuations ( see Can high - tech cavemen live on the moon ? ) .
“ I think it ’s really exciting , ” says Penny Boston of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro .
“ Basalt is an extremely good material for radiation protection .
It ’s free real estate ready to be exploited and modified for human use . ”
Blocked passage ?
But even if astronauts were to rappel into the hole , they might not be able to travel far into the tube it appears to lead into .
“ I would bet a lot of money that there ’s a tube there , but I would not bet nearly so much that we could gain access to the tube , ” says Ray Hawke of the University of Hawaii at Manoa , who has also hunted for lunar lava tubes .
Rubble or solidified lava might block up the tube .
“ It could be closed up and inaccessible , ” Hawke told New Scientist .
NASA ’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , which should be able to snap images of the area that are at least 10 times as sharp , could help reveal more about the hole .
And more lava tube openings may be found .
The Kaguya team is still combing over images of other areas in search of additional skylights .
And Hawke says a proposal is in the works to use LRO ’s main camera to snap oblique shots of the lunar surface .
This could help reveal cave entrances that are not visible in a bird ’s - eye view .

The right wing has designed an insidious new way to allow many rich contributors to fund unlimited spending on political message campaigns , all orchestrated by one PR firm , thus avoiding most existing FEC laws for reporting and disclosure .
The bottom line ?
Massive propaganda blitzes with virtually no limits , and no accountability .
Buried deep within the Internet , there is a place called the Federal Election Commission .
Buried deeper within the Federal Election Commission , there is a place where any interested party can view requests for advisory opinions , read both sides ’ arguments for and against , comment , and listen to the audio of public hearings .
Buried deeper still , are the seeds of a plan to circumvent all election finance law and everything we know right now about so - called ‘ astroturf organizations ’ in a perfectly legal , United States Federal Election Commission - approved kind of way .

Some notable possibilities : Steve Forbes , Charles Koch , Richard Mellon Scaife , Betsy DeVos , James Dobson , and just about anyone listed on the board of the US Chamber of Commerce , their friends , and their friends ’ friends , as well as a network of less - wealthy but nevertheless committed internet denizens , led by people like Tea Party Guy Eric Odom .

Anyone with the money to play .
There is only one requirement :
They must be willing to use their own money , act on their own , and hire Black Rock Group as their consultant .
The Plan
People who might otherwise make donations to 527 groups ( which are subject to campaign disclosure laws ) , will instead form as Limited Liability Companies ( LLCs ) .
Each company will advertise , take polls , or conduct direct media campaigns for or against Federal candidates as they choose .
The company will not accept any funds from any outside sources .
Simply put , wealthy donors will no longer be restricted to current contribution limits or disclosure laws because they will be acting individually as a company to put their message on the air .
This has long been held to be a First Amendment right of individuals .
They ’re allowed to spend whatever they want .
It is n’t new .
Black Rock Group will act as advisor to these groups .
From their original request for an advisory opinion :
BRG may encourage its individual clients to establish LLCs with the above characteristics .
BRG also may be approached by clients who have already established , or are contemplating establishing , an LLC with the above characteristics .
BRG will advise these LLCs on the development of messages that expressly advocate the election or defeat of the Federal candidates chosen by the client .
BRG ’s role will be to advise each LLC concerning how best to communicate its sole member ’s views on these Federal candidates .
And this :
Each LLC will spend more than $ 1,000 per calendar year on independent expenditures for television , radio , direct mail , phone bank , and print advertisements .
In no case , however , will any communication be funded by more than one individual … BRG , its LLC clients , and any other vendor providing services to each LLC will not coordinate any communications with any Federal candidate or political party committee .
The key here is not the message .
It ’s the messenger , and the advisor behind the messenger .
It ’s not difficult to imagine 100 different Swiftboat ads , each with the same message but a different messenger , a messenger who is a client of Black Rock Group and involved in the same campaign against the same candidate .
So what ?
This is n’t new , right ?
Well , yes .
And no .
It ’s about networks and identity .
As Politico noted back in June :
When rich players have run into trouble for their political dabbling , it ’s usually been because they got creative or sneaky in an effort to hide their identities or pool resources in a way they hoped would avoid the $ 5,000 donation limit for political committees .
This is different , because each person will be acting as their own company with one common link : Black Rock Group , where Black Rock Group fully intends to be the central hub crafting the central message , no matter what small differences may emerge in the final presentation by each company .
Moreover , it is anticipated that BRG will facilitate communication among various LLCs by scheduling conference calls or meetings between certain LLCs or passing along messages between LLCs .
Black Rock Group has asked the FEC to rule on whether their role , as stated above , would cause these individual companies to be deemed a “ political committee ” , which would then be subject to FEC disclosure and limits .
Has this been approved ?
FEC has issued two Draft rulings .
The first one blesses the arrangement as being completely legal and permissible , including BRG ’s involvement .
The second rules that if BRG facilitates communication , there will be a “ group of persons ” subject to the 527 reporting and disclosure requirements .
A final decision is pending .
However , even if Draft ruling B is adopted , all that really means is that BRG may not communicate with these LLCs as a group , but only on an individual basis .
There is nothing really stopping them from communicating the same message to each client separately rather than as a group .
It seems clear that the only indecision at the FEC right now concerns whether BRG can communicate with these companies as a group via conference call or other means .
The fundamental structure does n’t appear to be an issue at all .
What that means to voters is that we will be inundated with negative campaign ads funded by shadow entities who will be shielded from the light of day .
They will say whatever they want to say in whatever fashion they want to say it , including the usual smear tactics , but will never have to own one word of what they ’ve said , because they are shielded by a legal entity surrounding the individual .
That ’s the real problem here .
If a Goldman Sachs executive wants to go negative on a candidate and has the funds to pay for it , no one will ever be able to point back to Goldman Sachs , nor will that executive ever have to own the words .
Now multiply that by a factor of many , all blasting the same message over radio , tv , push poll , polls , and other means .
It ’s lucrative for Black Rock Group , shields candidates from associations they ’d rather not disclose , and inundates the rest of us with a barrage of ‘ nattering nabobs of negativity . ’
This is n’t astroturf .
It ’s a concrete firewall , intended to shield and protect the messenger who brings destructive messages .
In a day and age where transparency and disclosure have cast light on the interests of those carrying the message , this plan seeks to drop a lightproof curtain over the process , with the full consent and blessing of the Federal Election Commission .
It is the equivalent of a full - scale Google bomb via direct mail , television , radio , and your telephone ( via pollsters ) .
Networks are networks , no matter how small …
But what about the Internet ?
I see the same plan being hatched here , too .
Eric Odom ’s recent Project 73 announcement indicated some similar characteristics .
He ’s planning a news portal with a for - profit business model , similar to the Huffington Post , which appears to be an aggregator .
We ’ve already seen sites turn up that are nearly impossible to trace , such as the recent “ US Citizens Association “ , which appears to have been created solely to broadcast an anti-Obama and anti-health care reform ad while claiming to be a ‘ grass - roots organization . ”
Under the arrangement described by BRG , there will no longer be a need for any such claim .
All anyone will need to do is buy a domain , put up a turnkey site ( presumably assisted by Odom ’s firm ) , and slap their last - aired video , full - page print ad , article , or blog post up there , which Odom can then aggregate via his American Liberty Alliance site .
Presumably , the message could be crafted by BRG , and the clients “ advised ” to put up a site .
This tracks with some of the recent activity I ’ve seen just in California .
LLCs created in the past three months with LegalZoom or a different online legal service as the agent for legal process , with a domain name associated , but no site launched .
As Odom says ,
We have the branding , we have the domains …
Same network , different venue .
Stay tuned .
The message will be the same , but the messenger will be cloaked and masked , wrapped in a shell entity advised by the architect of some of the most destructive messages this country has seen yet .
Update
11/27/2009 : The FEC made a decision to ( sort of ) allow these networks to populate .
This is why the second FEC link does n’t work anymore .
The first link goes to the ‘ compromise decision ’ which essentially allows a tentative go - ahead with caveats for future rulings if they see a problem .
Funny , I see a problem right now .
By the time FEC gets around to it , it ’ll be a crisis .

What did you do this summer ?
Flat World Knowledge stayed busy on campus and now has 40 times as many students and more than 10 times the colleges using their freemium , open - source digital textbooks as they did spring semester .
And they did it the old - fashioned way — one professor at a time .
After a sort of beta earlier this year , Flat World is set to announce Thursday that more than 40,000 college students at 400 colleges will use their digital , DRM - free textbooks fall semester , up from 1,000 in 30 colleges in the spring .
Digital textbooks remain a nascent business and a tough market to enter .
At an average cost of $ 100 , textbooks command the highest cover prices in publishing , outside of only some art and coffee - table books .
Demand is artificially inelastic as students are indentured to cost servitude at the whim of college professors who blithely assign titles a student must own if she hopes to do well in a given course .
Now , multiply that by four , five or even six courses a semester and you are talking big bucks .
By comparison , Flat World has a pricing scheme that starts at zero for online access using a browser , and $ 20 for a PDF , which they believe will be the most popular format .
Printed versions of their textbooks cost up to $ 60 .
Perhaps best of all : Textbooks are available a la carte , chapter by chapter .
But the key buy - in has been from teachers who make the assignments and who , in my college days , could not care less how much the textbooks cost .
What 's changed ?
" There has been a mind shift , " co-founder Eric Frank told Wired.com .
A tipping point came a couple of years ago when faculty began to consider the financial burden on students because many of them ( Frank estimates a third ) did n't bother to get the texbook at all .
Perhaps more to the point , open - source textbooks — which are Creative Commons - licensed to allow unencumbered non-commercial use — make it possible to graft supporting material to the curriculum , rather than the other way around .
" Faculty are notorious for wanting to do things their way , " said Frank .
" But they always had to cut the foot to fit the shoe .
Now , with open source , they can cut the shoe to fit the foot . "
There is virtually no friction involved .
A professor can register on Flat World 's site and let students know that the book is available there .
No cooperation from a school district or college administration is required .
" Every single class is a fiefdom , and they are kings and queens of their domain , " Frank jokes .
Like any freemium retailer , Flat World depends on enough people buying something , because clearly the business cannot be sustained if everyone just opts for free web access .
" What we 're counting on is that people will be willing to pay for different packaging . "
( Frank proudly notes his company is on page 160 ( .pdf ) of Wired magazine editor in chief Chris Anderson 's Free . )
And it will come down to the price points , Frank acknowledges , even when the company develops formats for the Sony e-book reader and Amazon Kindle , as they hope to this year .
It makes as much sense to equip students with a device that makes all their reference materials available on demand as to offer a casual reader a complete portable library — perhaps more .
This is a classic chicken - and - egg scenario in which a device - dependent culture needs to evolve alongside new content formats .
For this and a variety of other reasons , including the cost of e-readers and for the media they serve up , Frank thinks the PDF will remain the format of choice for students for some time to come ( and the ubiquitous and DRM - free Portable Document Format is readable on the Sony and Amazon devices , anyway ) .
" They 'll move forward , " Frank says of device - specific e-reader formats .
" But there is so much irrational pricing right now that they 'll move forward much more slowly than they probably should . "
For now , expect a PDF revolution .
And what better back - to - school present can you think of for 40,000 hard - up college students in the midst of a recession ?

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former President Bill Clinton urged people to accept themselves and others in a world system that is " unstable , unequal and unsustainable . "
In a speech on Saturday , former president Bill Clinton urged people to embrace who they are .
Clinton gave the keynote address Saturday to members of the American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington .
The organization gave the 42nd U.S. president its global leadership award .
The world is an " interdependent " system where an event in one country , such as an economic collapse , can affect the entire globe , Clinton said .
The former president said recent events such as the swine flu outbreak prove the system is unstable .
Inequalities in health care worldwide show the system is unequal and recent trends in global warming show it is unsustainable , Clinton said .
Global cooperation is crucial for the survival of mankind , he added .
" If we have a chance , it has to begin by people accepting that they can be proud of who they are without despising who someone else is , " Clinton said .
To foster this cooperation , people should focus on their similarities because we are genetically " 99.5 percent " the same , the former president said .
" From time immemorial , people have fought over identity rooted in that ( half percent ) , " Clinton said .
" We should have spent more time thinking about that other 99.5 percent of ourselves . "
Clinton also urged the audience to embrace who they are .
" You teach your children their ethnic heritage ; their religious heritage ; their cultural heritage with no negative reference to anyone else because it 's the only shot we 've got to make the most of our interdependent world , " he said .
The American - Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee was founded in 1980 to protect the civil rights of Arabs .

John Burns Consulting sent out a note today titled : FHA Likely To Be The Next Shoe To Drop
" The FHA 's aggressive lending programs have continued throughout the housing downturn , causing its market share of the mortgage industry to grow from 2 % in 2005 to 23 % today .
...
The FHA insurance fund , however , is likely running dry .
...
While almost all of the experts believe that Congress would support the FHA if necessary ( it 's currently self - funded ) , we wonder if FHA officials will be under pressure to continue tightening their lending policies , which currently allow 96.5 % mortgages to people with 600 FICO scores .
...
Claims against the insurance fund have climbed , with roughly 7 % of all FHA - insured loans now delinquent .
The Federal Housing Administration ... is in danger of seeing its reserves fall below the level demanded by Congress , according to government officials , in a development that could raise concerns about whether the agency needs a taxpayer bailout .
...
Resulting FHA losses are offset by premiums paid by borrowers .
Federal law says the FHA must maintain , after expected losses , reserves equal to at least 2 % of the loans insured by the agency .
The ratio last year was around 3 % , down from 6.4 % in 2007 .
...
Officials said as recently as May that they did n't expect to fall below the 2 % limit , but home price declines have exceeded those used to model their expected losses .
Given the pace of those declines , " there is no way they will make the 2 % " if the current study follows last year 's methodology , says [ Thomas Lawler , an independent housing economist ] .
[ W ] atch the growing controversy regarding the FHA very carefully .
The decisions made to allow the FHA to continue lending will have a huge impact on the housing market , particularly when so few entry - level buyers have a substantial down payment .
And from the WSJ : Loan Losses Spark Concern Over FHA
Based on the issues at the FHA , the end of the tax credit , and more supply coming on the market , Burns concluded that " housing could see another leg down later this year or early next year " :
On March 23 2009 , Dr. Nina Fedoroff , the US State Department chief scientist and adviser of Hillary Clinton , stated : " famines that strike a billion people are quite possible in a world where climate change has damaged food production and the human population has risen to nine billion . "
http://www.care2.com/c2c/groups/disc.html?gpp=3626&pst=1013288
Dr. Fedoroff echoes comments by John Beddington , Britain 's chief scientist , who forecasts a " perfect storm " of food , water and energy shortages by 2030 , when she told BBC One , that humans had exceeded the Earth 's " limits of sustainability " .
" We need to continue to decrease the growth rate of the global population ; the planet can't support many more people , " Dr Fedoroff added , stressing the need for humans to become much better at managing " wild lands " , and in particular water supplies . "
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7974995.stm
Dr. Fedorrof is right ; we need to be responsible on this issue .
And rather quickly .
SAN FRANCISCO , California ( CNN ) --
A man snuck into the grizzly bear exhibit at the San Francisco Zoo Saturday but was rescued immediately afterward without incident , authorities said .
A zoo visitor alerted the facility 's staff about the 27 - year - old man 's presence inside the enclosure , said spokeswoman Gwendolyn Tornatore .
Staffers fired a warning shot to keep the two bears away from the man , before securing them inside their dens , Tornatore said in a statement .
The man , who was not identified , was conscious but unresponsive when he was rescued .
He did not show any apparent signs of injury , Tornatore said .
It was not clear how the man got inside the enclosure , or what prompted him .
Watch barriers man had to get past »
The man has been charged with misdemeanor trespassing and harassing an animal in captivity , said CNN affiliate KRON - TV .
He was taken to San Francisco General Hospital for an evaluation .
The zoo made international headlines on Christmas Day in 2007 when a Siberian tiger apparently scaled a 12 - and - a - half - foot wall surrounding its enclosure , killing a 17 - year - old man and wounding two of his friends .
Following the incident , the zoo overhauled its safety procedures .
Construction crews raised the walls of the enclosure to help keep the big cats in .
The one - acre Hearst Grizzly Gulch at the zoo is home to its two female grizzly bears , Kachina and Kiona .
It is equipped with a 20,000 - gallon pool , herb garden , and a waterfall , according to the zoo 's Web site .
CNN 's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report .

Miskolczy Csaba múltkori , a Kreatív Online - on megjelent cikkében arra szólított fel , hogy a nagy globális szolgáltatások helyett a hazaiakat kellene támogatnia a magyar netezőknek , hirdet őknek , ügynökségeknek .
Peresztegi Zoltán , a Google magyarországi vezetője a publicisztikához írott hozzászólásában a következ őket írja :
ÉBRESZTŐ : ideje lenne valami ú jat kitalálni és megpróbálni nem 10 milliós piacban gondolkodni , amikor közel 2 Mrd internetező van ma már .
Nem másolni kell a kitalált közösségi site - okat ( iWiW Open Social nyitás ) , copycat videomegosztókat indítani ( ha jól számoltam Magyarországon van vagy 7 - 8 ) , hanem itt lenne az ideje valami kreatív ötlettel előjönni , valami ú jat kitalálni .
Láss csodát , fogadni merek , hogy ( 1 ) nagyon előnyös vételi ajánlatot fogsz kapni vagy ( 2 ) sikerre fogod tudni vinni a vállalkozásodat .
De hagyjuk már ezt a " magyar nemzeti hip - hop témát " békén és foglalkozzunk olyan területtel , ami nincs lejátszva .
A Google magyarországi vezetője tehát szokatlanul sok nagybetűvel éles hangon reagált arra a publicisztikára , mely a hazai fejlesztéseket és webes szolgáltatásokat szeretné előtérben látni a globális szolgáltatásokkal szemben .
( Például Peresztegi céloz arra is , hogy Konrád postjai elfogultak a Google- lal , hiszen a blogot az eTarget " szponzorálja " .
Nem pontosan értem , hogy hogy jön ez ide , de mindegy . )
A magyar googler szerint a kitörési pontot nem a lokálisan erős szolgáltatásokban kellene keresni :
Miért is kellene megmaradnia Magyarországon piacvezetőnek az iWiW -nek , ha nem tudja felvenni a versenyt a Facebook - kal , vagy miért kellene a Blogternek fennmaradnia , ha nem tud semmivel se többet nyújtani , mint a versenytárs globális márkák ?
Nem , nem hiszem , hogy itt kellene keresgélnünk , hiszen ahogyan azt Te is látod , a helyi játékosok ( pl. a globalizáció miatt ) nem tudják felvenni a harcot a nagyokkal .
Tegyük hozzá , hogy a Blogtert nem egy globális szolgáltatás ( mint például a Google Blogger.com - ja ) , hanem egy száz százalékban magyar konkurens , a Blog .hu előzte be tartósan .
És nem úgy tűnik , - globalizáció ide vagy oda - , hogy a Blog. hu-t képes lenne megszorongatni a rettegett Google blogszolgáltatása .
Amúgy Peresztegi ezúttal sem nyilatkozott arról , hogy a Google egyes szolgáltatásai milyen látogatottsági adatokkal rendelkeznek a magyarországi felhasználók körében .
Nyilván érdemibb vitát lehetne folytatni , ha mindenki nyílt lapokkal játszana .
Sajnos azonban a vita a fenti csörtével teljesen más mederbe terelődött .
ÉBRESZTŐ : tessék lehiggadni , és értelmesebb , szakmai alapú párbeszédet folytatni a hazai termékek kontra globális nagyok témakörben .
Épp ideje lenne .
Kezdjünk is bele .
Keep it real :
1 . Nem gondolom azt , hogy helyi szintről ne lehetne lenyomni helyi piacon egy nagy multit .
( Lásd : 4 . pont . )
2. Látni kell , hogy a hazai stratupoknak sokkal kevesebb pénzük , tőkéjük van , mint egy amerikai multinak .
S ezzel együtt lehet őségeik is sokkal behatároltabbak .
Így meglehet ősen gúnyoros dolog egy amerikai multi részéről azzal visszavágni , hogy győzzön a jobbik .
3 . A Google vagy a Facebook jelenléte a magyar piacon véleményem szerint egyáltalán nem ártalmas .
Sőt !
Ha idehaza egészséges a versenyszellem , e két amerikai nagyvállalat egyre erőteljesebb jelenlétének ispirálnia kellene a magyar fejlesztői közösségeket , cégeket .
4. Érdekesnek tartom , hogy a Google magyarországi vezetője egyszer saját vetélytársa , a Facebook védelmére kel , majd ezt követően kiemeli az iWiW OpenSocial - támogatását , mint nem eredeti ötletet .
( Jó tudni : az OpenSocial a Google szabványa . )
Jó tudni azt is , hogy a zárt Facebook Platformmal szemben éppen a nyitott OpenSocial jelentette az innovációt .
Már amennyiben egy szabvány kapcsán van értelme innovációról beszélni .
A Facebook az ezt követő időszakban inkább a kisalkalmazások elmeszelésére törekedett redizájnjaival .
Ezek a redizájn - projektek amúgy a Twitter működési elvét és felületi megoldásait " nyúlták " .
A Twitter meg a Jaikut .
Mi következik ebből ?
Az eredetiség és ötletesség kritériuma egyáltalán nem olyan egyértelmű , mint ahogy Peresztegi felvázolja .
Ha csak a blogszolgáltatásokat veszem , ilyen alapon mindenkinek fejet kellett volna hajtania a Blogger.com piacra lépésekor .
De a Blog.hu fejlesztői és az Index például nem ezt tették .
Úgy gondolták , hogy tudnak jobbat , mást .
És mint kiderült , igazuk volt .
A Google ellenében is .
Itt nem a szolgáltatás eredetisége döntött , hanem sokkal inkább a szolgáltatás jó pozícionálása és kommunikációja .
Azt már nem is említem , hogy mi újság a Google közösségépítő szájtjával , az Orkuttal a magyar piacon .
Lehet itt dobálózni azzal , hogy győzzön a jobbik .
Csakhogy , mint a mellékelt ábra mutatja , a Google - nak sem a Freemailt , sem az iWiW -et , sem a Blog. hu-t nem sikerült megszorongatnia a magyar piacon .
5 . Az éles hangú kirohanások és anyázások ( főként piaci konkurens cégek vezetői részéről ) kifejezetten ártalmasak .
És inkább a Blikk címlapjára valók .

Georgia O’Keeffe : Pioneering Abstractions , Before the Desert
Georgia O’Keeffe is about to enjoy quite the cultural moment .
In a high / low play of historic proportions , this month will see the opening of an exhibition of the late artist ’s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art and , just a couple of days later , the premiere of a Lifetime cable network biography that traces her artistic development and tumultuous personal life .
There are two Georgia O’Keeffes ; the story of the first begins in 1915 , when she was a young art teacher in rural South Carolina and produced her first abstract drawings , which were also among the first fully abstract images by any American artist .
O’Keeffe leaped into abstraction with a group of charcoal drawings that were among the most radical creations produced in the United States at that time .
Three years later she had her first encounter with the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz , who set her up in New York and initiated a long personal , professional and mutually promotional partnership .

• ' It has to be Chelsea as the main threat ' says Ferguson • ' We knew we could never replace Cristiano Ronaldo '
Sir Alex Ferguson has effectively written off Liverpool 's title chances and said that he sees Chelsea as the main threat to his hopes of winning the Premier League for the fourth year in a row .
The Manchester United manager does not believe the impending departure of Xabi Alonso to Real Madrid will affect Liverpool , saying that Rafa Benítez 's team are far more reliant on the input of Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres .
But he sees little chance of the squad at Anfield improving on last season 's second place .
" Liverpool have just had probably their best season for 20 years , finished up with 86 points and still finished four adrift , " he said .
" It will be hard for them to match that , let alone improve .
Other teams will read Liverpool better . "
He is more concerned by Chelsea , who have a new manager in Carlo Ancelotti , the winner of two European Cups and a Serie A title with Milan .
" It has to be Chelsea as the main threat , " he said .
" Ancelotti will change the way Chelsea play .
There is plenty of flexibility in what he 's got and he should get goals from Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka .
" They will play the Milan way .
It brought him two European Cups – it should have been three because they should never have lost to Liverpool [ in the 2005 final ] .
So why should he change ? "
Ferguson admits United will miss Cristiano Ronaldo , who has joined Madrid , but has backed his young players to shine and help make up for the winger 's absence .
" We knew we could never replace Ronaldo , " he said .
" No matter what anyone says about the lad , for me he is the best footballer in the world .
When you 've had someone who is the best at what he does , it is no good trying to find someone to do the same job .
" And when you know you can't replace someone or something , you look for a different way .
People have misread our situation and they have underestimated our ability to improve players .
That is an area where we have proved successful in the past .
" We are expecting a lot from [ Jonny ] Evans , [ Danny ] Welbeck , [ Darron ] Gibson , [ Federico ] Macheda and the Da Silva brothers .
And Nani and Anderson have already shown good things but they will improve next season . "
LA LETTERA - la Rai ha l'intenzione di togliere la tutela legale a report
Ho una trentina di cause .
E non riesco
ad avere una polizza per le spese legali
Solo una compagnia inglese e una americana disponibili a rifondere il danno , ma non le spese
Milena Gabanelli ( Emblema ) Luigi Ferrarella , sulle pagine di questo giornale , ha sollevato un problema che condivido e mi tocca da vicino : la pressione politica ( che in Italia è particolarmente anomala ) sul condizionamento della libertà d’informazione forse non è l’aspetto più importante , anche se ciclicamente emerge quando coinvolge personaggi noti .
Per questo facciamo grandi battaglie di principio e ignoriamo gli aspetti « pratici » .
Premesso che chiunque si senta diffamato ha il diritto di querelare , che chi non fa bene il proprio mestiere deve pagare , parliamo ora di chi lavora con coscienza .
Alla sottoscritta era stata manifestata l'intenzione di togliere la tutela legale .
La direzione della terza rete ha fatto una battaglia affinché questa intenzione rientrasse , motivata dal dovere del servizio pubblico di esercitare il giornalismo d’inchiesta assumendosene rischi e responsabilità .
Nell ’incertezza sul come sarebbe andata a finire ho cercato un ’assicurazione che coprisse le spese legali e l’eventuale danno in caso di soccombenza dovuta a fatti non dolosi .
Intanto sul mercato italiano , di fatto , nessun operatore stipula polizze del genere , mentre su quello internazionale questa prassi è più diffusa .
Bene , dopo aver compilato un questionario con l’elenco del numero di cause , l’ammontare dei danni richiesti e l’esito delle sentenze , una compagnia americana e una inglese , tenendo conto del comportamento giudicato fino a questo momento virtuoso , si sono dichiarate disponibili ad assicurare l’eventuale danno , ma non le spese legali .
Sembra assurdo , ma il danno è un rischio che si può correre , mentre le spese legali in Italia sono una certezza : le cause possono durare fino a 10 anni e chiunque , impunemente , ti può trascinare in tribunale a prescindere dalla reale esistenza del fatto diffamatorio .
A chi ha il portafogli gonfio conviene chiedere risarcimenti miliardari in sede civile , perché tutto quello che rischia è il pagamento delle spese dell ’avvocato .
L’editore invece deve accantonare nel fondo rischi una percentuale dei danni richiesti per tutta la durata del procedimento e anticipare le spese ad una montagna di avvocati .
Solo un editore molto solido può permettersi di resistere .
Quattro anni fa mi sono stati chiesti 130 milioni di euro di risarcimento per un fatto inesistente , e la sentenza è ancora di là da venire .
Se alle mie spalle invece della Rai ci fosse stata un’emittente più piccola avrebbe dovuto dichiarare lo stato di crisi .
Visto che ad oggi le cause pendenti sulla mia testa sono una trentina , è facile capire che alla fine una pressione del genere può essere ben più potente di quella dei politici , e diventare fisicamente insostenibile .
Questo avviene perché non esiste uno strumento di tutela .
L’art .
96 del codice di procedura civile punisce l’autore delle lite temeraria , ma in che modo ?
Con una sanzione blanda , quasi mai applicata , che si fonda su una valutazione tecnica « paghi questa multa perché hai disturbato il giudice per un fatto inesistente » .
Nel diritto anglosassone invece la valutazione è « sociale » , e il giudice ha il potere di condannare al pagamento di danni puntivi « chiedi 10 milioni di risarcimento per niente ?
Rischi di doverne pagare 20 » .
La sanzione è parametrata sul valore della libertà di stampa , che viene limitata da un comportamento intimidatorio .
La condanna pertanto deve essere esemplare .
Ecco , copiamo tante cose dall ’America , potremmo importare questa norma .
Sarebbe il primo passo verso una libertà tutelata prima di tutto dal diritto .
Al tiranno di turno puoi rispondere con uno strumento politico , quale la protesta , la manifestazione , ma se sei seppellito dalle cause , anche se infondate , alla fine soccombi .
Michael Moore is in town to promote his film ' Capitalism : A Love Story , ' and while his movie is already being mocked by Republicans , Moore 's real targets are Democrats .
Michael Moore targets Blue Dogs
This one has all the makings of a perfect Washington media frenzy .
Throw in a few liberal activists , a steel union official and filmmaker Michael Moore , invite the press to the headquarters of consumer watchdog Public Citizen for a press conference on the evils of capitalism — and voilà , instant cable candy .

Moore is in town to promote his film “ Capitalism : A Love Story , ” and while his movie is already being mocked by Republicans , Moore ’s real targets are Democrats .
A press release promoting the Tuesday event says the purpose is “ to challenge President Barack Obama and Democratic members of Congress to get tough — really tough — on health care reform . ”
The group will call for a single - payer , government - run health care system — something that is n’t even on the table in the current health care debate .

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - World leaders face pressure to find a new policy for dealing with Iran following its disputed presidential election and crackdown on protesters , but are unlikely to tighten sanctions any time soon .
The United States and the European Union want to encourage democratic change but will also try to avoid doing anything that could block the way to dialogue with Tehran when the crisis ends or be portrayed by Iranian leaders as interference , experts say .
They are likely to hold back the threat of tighter sanctions for use in discussions on Iran ’s nuclear program .
Agreement on trade sanctions would be unlikely anyway because of opposition from U.N. Security Council members China and Russia .
But they may also avoid embarking on any new strategy for now while the situation in Tehran remains fluid .
“ The dynamics of the ruling establishment have changed , the dynamics of the opposition have changed .
We are dealing with a totally new scenario , ” said Mehrdad Khonsari , an analyst at the Center of Arab and Iranian Studies in London .
World leaders may have been caught off guard because they expected former prime minister Mirhossein Mousavi to win the June 12 election .
In the event , he was declared a distant second behind President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , prompting street protests and a crackdown by the Iranian authorities in which about 20 people have been reported killed and hundreds have been arrested , and exposing deep rifts in the ruling elite .
“ What we are seeing has completely changed the dynamics in which we were hoping to engage in dialogue with Iran , ” said Clara O’Donnell of the Center for European Reform in London .
“ For the moment , we are still seeing what we have seen before -- leaders holding back , trying to see what is happening , trying to make sure they are not seen as meddling in the system and not making matters worse for the protesters . ”
CONCERNS OVER NEW SANCTIONS
The 27 - nation EU has been fiercely critical of Iran in the crisis , and often more outspoken than Washington , which has been trying to engage with Iran under President Barack Obama .
But , like the United States , the EU has avoided talk of new punitive measures .
“ My worry is that talk of sanctions , talk of a tougher line , might just be the start of an excuse for the Iranian leadership not to listen in to what is now being said by the Iranian people , ” Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt , about to take the EU presidency for six months , told Reuters in an interview .
The United States and the EU have scant leverage on Iran , which limits their options to condemnations of the repression and calls for the people ’s democratic will to be respected .
In addition , they fear that Russia and China are seeking to use their good relations with the authorities in Tehran as a pawn in a geopolitical game with the West .
The EU and the United States also know they will need to talk to whoever is in power to try to halt a nuclear program that they fear could produce a nuclear bomb , although Iran denies it has any plans to do so .
BIG STICK ON NUCLEAR ISSUE
Obama is reluctant for now to upset his policy of encouraging dialogue with Iran .
“ They ( the Americans ) do n’t want to prejudice the future and want to keep open the possibility of dialogue with Iran once the internal crisis is over , ” said Clement Therme , an analyst at the French Institute of International Relations in Paris .
“ There ’s only a certain window of opportunity if they want to get Iran to stop its nuclear program and all the time this situation is evolving that window of opportunity gets smaller . ”
For this reason , Washington is likely to want to keep the threat of fresh sanctions in reserve .
United Nations sanctions on Iran already cover weapons , nuclear materials , the travel and finances of individuals and firms , and other financial and trade measures .
The EU has frozen the assets of Iran ’s biggest bank , Bank Melli , and imposed visa bans on some officials .
The United States has banned most U.S. - Iran trade and imposes sanctions on foreign companies that invest more than $ 20 million a year in Iran ’s energy sector .
Options for more sanctions could range from more individual travel bans on Iranian officials to putting pressure on European oil companies to quit Iran and , ultimately , trying to embargo the supply of gasoline to Iran , which lacks refining capacity despite being the world ’s biggest oil exporter .
The Europeans have cut back on export credit guarantees for trade with Iran and could cut them further , although Germany , Italy and Austria are reluctant , especially when their exporters are struggling in the global economic crisis .
It is a small set of options , and would be a harder starting point for any engagement with Iran on the nuclear issue .

The simple answer is that when Neil took the original photograph , AS11 - 40 - 5903 , the top of Buzz 's OPS was at the top edge of the field - of - view and , therefore , that the original image necessarily does not include the antenna .
When the image was prepared for release for publication soon after the mission , it was cropped at the bottom and sides , and a black area was added at the top to give the released version visual balance .

NASA Headquarters release 69 - HC - 684
The other day I was asked by a writer for a mainstream French newspaper to say something about the " return " of the neoconservatives .
His thesis seemed to be that the shambles of Barack Obama 's foreign policy had , after only nine months , made what was thought to be the most discredited wing of an ostensibly brain - dead conservative movement relevant again .
And France — no longer straining at the sight of Michelle Obama shopping in Paris 's 6th arrondissement — is taking notice .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A legal battle has put the future of Skype in jeopardy , according to eBay , which owns the online communications system .
Skype 's online phone and video communication service has been incredibly popular .
If Skype loses the right to use a key part of its software and can't create an adequate replacement , " Skype 's business as currently conducted would likely not be possible , " eBay said in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
There is no sign of Skype disappearing soon -- a relief to the more than 480 million registered users who have video or telephone conversations online through the technology .
But the battle with Joltid , the company that created the piece of technology at issue , shows no sign of being resolved anytime soon , either .
Joltid complains that Skype broke its licensing agreement to use the technology .
Skype filed suit against Joltid in Britain , saying it could not terminate the license agreement ; Joltid struck back with a counterclaim saying Skype had broken the agreement .
A trial is scheduled for June 2010 , eBay said in the SEC filing .
" Although Skype is confident of its legal position , as with any litigation , there is the possibility of an adverse result if the matter is not resolved through negotiation , " eBay writes .
" Skype has begun to develop alternative software to that licensed through Joltid .
However , such software development may not be successful , may result in loss of functionality or customers even if successful , and will in any event be expensive . "
In an e-mail to CNN , Joltid said Skype " accessed Joltid 's source code and modified it -- Joltid then claimed a breach of license . "
Skype denies any breach .
" Joltid is enforcing its rights in the courts , " Joltid said in the e-mail .
" Like any member of the creative industries , Joltid will defend its innovations with determination . "

Mortgage cure rates have fallen off a cliff .
For those unfamiliar with the term , a " cure rate " pertains to those who go delinquent on loans then catch up and become current .
Late payments that do n't " cure " have a tendency to get later and later over time , before they eventually default .
Fitch ratings notes Cure Rates Plunge Among Prime RMBS .
According to Fitch , cure rate on prime mortgages plunged to 6.6 % from an average 45 % during 2000 - 2006 .
Alt - A cure rates plunged to 4.3 % from an average 30.2 % and subprime cure rates fell to 5 . % from an average 19.4 % .
A couple of charts can help put this in context .

In regards to the above chart I said .
The area in pink represents potential foreclosure demand .
Not all of that area will be foreclosed , but some of it sure will .
The " Hidden Backlog " mentioned above ( and highlighted in red ) is within that pink area .
One thing missing from the chart is pent - up demand from those who are not delinquent yet have a huge incentive to walk because of massive negative equity .

Prime Delinquencies and Foreclosures
Let 's focus on GETTING OUT THE TRUTH more and BLAMING THE PRESIDENT less !
President Obama is going to be JUST FINE no matter how this all turns out . . . it is an ABSOLUTE WASTE OF TIME to constantly " critique " his " performance " like this is some type of parlor game !
This is real serious stuff and we need to act accordingly and quit getting baited into these meaningless commentaries that do NOTHING to advance the truth .
I find it simultaneously ridiculous and hilarious that the media has steadfastly refused to debunk all the lies being spread about the health insurance reform measures that are before Congress , and then the punditocracy sits around smugly on Sunday Morning shows and questions the President ’s " leadership " and " message discipline " on healthcare .
Huh ?
The President gives a press conference on healthcare , and the media loudly proclaims how they are " bored " and he looks " tired " .
Not a word about the actual policies being discussed .
At this same press conference , the President says the police acted " stupidly " when they arrested a man in his own home for " disorderly conduct " .
The media goes bonkers and treats us to three weeks ( and counting ) of race baiting and hysteria .
When the President moves in to diffuse the situation and invites both the policeman in question and the professor who was arrested to the White House for beer , we get more analysis of what their beer choices meant than we have about health insurance reform .
However , this same media barely bats an eye when the President is compared to Hitler , when a former Vice Presidential candidate calls health care reform " evil " because a " death panel " will kill her special needs child , and as Congress people continue to flat out LIE about old people being euthanized to save money .
We have gotten coverage of President Obama ’s birth certificate ( Hawaiin and Kenyan ) , the President ’s poll numbers , obsessive and unscientific grading of the President ’s " second one hundred days " , questions about if the President was honoring Michael Jackson ’s memory properly , how often ( and what brand ) does he smoke , is he being " bipartisan " enough , how authentic are the angry town hall mobs , and is it appropriate for the President to respond to all the lies that are being told about him .
And yet not a word about soaring health insurance premiums , record health insurance profits , the thousands of people being bankrupted by medical expenses , all of the Congress people in the pocket of the health insurance industry , all of the people being DENIED CARE by the health insurance industry AFTER they have PAID their premiums FOR YEARS .
One can only conclude that the media is in no way interested in " the truth " , and just like the health care industry that pays for their existence with advertising revenue , is just another for - profit boondoggle masquerading as a " journalists " .
NO so - called liberal pundit should ever go on ANY program without mentioning that there is NO DEATH PANEL and NO EUTHANASIA in the bill .
There is NO GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER of ANYTHING - just a LIFELINE to the folks who are currently being DISCRIMINATED against because they are SICK , DENIED CARE because they are unemployed , and BANKRUPTED to save their own lives or the lives of loved ones .
We have got to STAY FOCUSED on the TRUTH just as agressively as the opposition stays focused on lies .
This is NOT about President Obama , this is about US !
Note : Corrected spelling in title ! :)
Not a week passes , it seems , without a big - picture thinker releasing a big - picture book or giving a big - picture sermon describing the gradual eclipse of American hegemony in Asia .
True , American power will inevitably decline in relative terms as Asian giants such as China and India rise .
But , at least as far as Asia is concerned , arguments about the end of American hegemony ring hollow .
For one thing , the United States was never a hegemon in Asia .
Only some American post - Cold War triumphalists thought it was .
The nature of US power and the exercise of its influence was always much more clever and subtle than most assume .
In fact , as India and China rise , the US could actually find itself in a stronger position .
How can this be ?
After all , power and influence are built on the back of economic success .
The Chinese economy has been doubling in size every 10 years since 1978 .
The Indian economy has been doing the same since 1991 .
In contrast , it takes about two decades for the US economy to double in size .
Does n't this surely mean that Asia is rushing toward a state of multi-polarity -- a configuration of roughly equal great powers balancing against each other -- while American influence is on the wane ?
The seemingly obvious conclusion would be true but for the fact that Asia has a unique kind of hierarchical security system that came about partly by accident and partly by design .
No power can be pre-eminent if it cannot maintain its military advantage over rivals .
Yet , despite the fact that America spends more on defense than the next 10 powers combined , it has never been a regional hegemon because it actually relies on the cooperation of other states to remain predominant .
Without cooperation from allies such as Japan , South Korea , Singapore and the Philippines , the US could not retain its forward military positions in the West Pacific .
Likewise , the US needs the cooperation of Indonesia , Malaysia and Thailand to host its critical radar infrastructure .
Moreover , in remaining pre-eminent , America requires other key states and regional groupings , such as ASEAN , to acquiesce in its security relationships .
Thus , there is broad - based regional approval of US alliances with Japan , South Korea and Australia , as well as with partners such as the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and India .
The key to the effectiveness of these bilateral relationships is that they enjoy widespread support ( and thus legitimacy ) in the region as stabilizing arrangements .
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts .
Combined with the raw military capacity that the US brings to the table , this means that America is powerful enough to enforce the peace and provide stability for commerce to thrive .
America 's presence and bilateral partnerships are complementary to Asian states ' obsession with counter - dominance and non-interference in the region .
This dynamic " liberal order " -- largely fair , flexible and open enough to welcome new entrants as they rise -- will continue to serve Asia well .
For example , even China has been a major beneficiary of the public goods provided by the US - led hierarchical system .
This interdependent relationship means that the US is not so powerful that it can readily ignore the wishes of key states , and it is here that its apparent weakness is actually strength .
America is not a Hobbesian Leviathan with absolute authority and power .
Indeed , China 's strategists are frequently puzzled by the lack of " balancing " that takes place against the US in the region .
But it is puzzling only if we characterize Asia as being multi-polar rather than hierarchical .
In fact , any balancing tends to take place in order to preserve the hierarchy , not to replace or supersede it .
Other states tend to resist bids by any Asian power -- be it Japan , China or India -- to rise to the top of the pyramid .
As a foreign - based power , the US needs the cooperation of Asian partners .
This keeps the top dog in check .
Were an Asian country like China to rise to the top , it would not need the same level of regional cooperation and acquiescence to maintain its position and military footholds .
As China and India rise , and Japan becomes more " normal , " they will balance each other within the US - led hierarchy to ensure that the US remains on top and one or the other does n't dominate .
If China makes a bid for regional hegemony , it will find it difficult to resist the structural constraints placed on it within this hierarchy .
US power is in relative decline , but that is no bad thing .
False triumphalism breeds poor discipline .
But a sense of strategic vulnerability breeds interdependency , which has always been the key to successful US leadership in Asia .

Vanquishing infinity

Quantum field theoretic extensions of Einstein ’s theory of gravity tend to suffer from incurable infinities , but a theory called N = 8 supergravity may actually avoid them — against expectations held for almost 30 years .

Gravity is different .
It is mediated by particles ( gravitons ) of spin 2 , unlike the other known forces in nature ( electromagnetism and the strong and weak interactions ) , which are carried by particles of spin 1 .
This explains why like gravitational charges ( that is , masses ) attract , whereas in electrostatics , like charges repel , thereby accounting for the fact that gravity dominates physics at large distances , despite its incredible weakness in comparison with the other fundamental forces ( think of a little magnet whose force on a safety pin beats the gravitational pull of the whole planet Earth ) .
Modern understanding of gravity rests on Einstein ’s theory of general relativity .
This theory is based on the principle of general covariance ( according to which , the laws of physics should not depend on which coordinate system is used to formulate them ) and the principle of equivalence , enabling Einstein to write down “ in one stroke ” his gravitational field equations and thereby to revolutionize our understanding of gravity , replacing Newtonian gravity by a theory based on spacetime geometry and curvature .
There is another key aspect in which gravity differs .
Matter is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics , but so far , Einstein ’s theory has resisted all attempts to reconcile it with quantum mechanics .
Our understanding of subatomic phenomena is encoded in the standard model of elementary particle physics ( based on an extension of quantum electrodynamics called Yang - Mills theory ) which , for all we know , correctly describes the interactions of known matter within relativistic quantum field theory .
This is an elaborate mathematical framework , which took many decades to develop and still presents many difficulties .
These are due in particular to the necessity of having to deal with infinite expressions appearing at intermediate stages of every calculation , and their removal by a procedure referred to as renormalization .
Infinities generally arise because of the pointlike nature of elementary particles , implying short distance singularities in the formulas ( or “ ultraviolet infinities ” in momentum space ) .
To this day we are not sure whether quantum field theory makes sense as a mathematical theory , but we do know that it works exceedingly well in perturbation theory , yielding spectacular agreement between theory and experiment .
However , applying the established rules of quantum field theory to Einstein gravity and its generalizations results in complete failure — with one possible exception :
As Zvi Bern , John Carrasco , and Henrik Johanssen at UCLA , Lance Dixon at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center , and Radu Roiban at Pennsylvania State University , all in the US , report in Physical Review Letters , N = 8 supergravity , distinguished among all other field theories by its maximal supersymmetry , may evade this dilemma [ 1 ] .
The inconsistencies of perturbatively quantized gravity appear in the form of nonrenormalizable infinities .
This means that in order to remove the divergent expressions resulting from standard Feynman diagram ( Fig. 1 ) computations , one must modify the Einstein equations by new types of interactions ( counterterms ) involving higher and higher powers of the curvature tensor at each order in perturbation theory — unlike for renormalizable matter interactions , where infinite renormalizations are only necessary for a finite number of parameters ( masses and coupling constants ) , but no new types of interactions are needed .
As a consequence , one must specify an infinite number of parameters and couplings if one wants finite results to any given order .
But such a theory has no predictivity whatsoever , because every physical prediction would depend on an infinity of parameters .
Any hopes that miraculous cancellations might prevent this disaster for pure gravity were shattered by an impressive calculation [ 2,3 ] .
In the late 1970s physicists set out to find an extension of Einstein ’s theory that would be free of ultraviolet ( UV ) infinities .
The idea was to modify gravity by the inclusion of matter couplings finely tuned to cancel the infinities ( and thereby perhaps also identify a raison d’être for the existence of matter in the world ) .
First of all this requires fermionic matter , because fermions contribute with a relative minus sign from bosons for each closed loop inside a Feynman diagram .
In addition , the requisite extension of Einstein ’s theory must possess a new type of symmetry — local supersymmetry — relating bosons and fermions , and thus forces and matter particles .
It was soon realized that such supersymmetric extensions of Einstein ’s theory become rarer and rarer with increasing number of supersymmetries N .
The maximally supersymmetric extension of Einstein ’s theory , N = 8 supergravity , was finally constructed in Ref. [ 4 ] and , in its more general “ gauged ” version , in Ref . [ 5 ] .
Naturally , these developments raised hopes that N = 8 supergravity was at last the looked - for theory that would tame the infinities of perturbatively quantized Einstein gravity .
A brief period of intense activity followed to find out whether this theory might actually be finite to all orders .
These investigations were mostly based on superspace , an extension of spacetime by fermionic coordinates [ 6 ] .
Unfortunately , when applied to N = 8 supergravity , this method has a major drawback : it works only at the level of the equations of motion , but does not allow setting up a scheme for computing Feynman diagrams .
The outcome of all these efforts , then , was disappointingly inconclusive .
After much work , it was shown in Refs . [ 7,8 ] that there do exist counterterms compatible with N = 8 supersymmetry .
However , because of the lack of a workable off - shell formalism , no one was able to calculate the coefficients of the relevant counterterms ( the first of which appears at three loops [ 9 ] ) and thereby definitely rule them in or out .
Most researchers therefore concluded that the theory was doomed , in line with the rule of thumb that an infinity that cannot be excluded by symmetry arguments actually does appear with a nonvanishing coefficient ( just like the two - loop counterterm for pure gravity [ 2,3 ] ) .
Many turned to superstring theory , which appeared to offer much better prospects for constructing a perturbatively finite theory of quantum gravity and for explaining the observed features of low - energy particle physics from a unified theory .
As a result , a general conviction took hold that the issue of UV finiteness of N = 8 supergravity was not only hopelessly difficult to settle once and for all , but more importantly , not a truly relevant question anymore .
And so it might well have languished forever in the no man ’s land of undecidable propositions , had it not been for the recent progress reported by Bern et al . [ 1 ] .
To understand why an approach based on standard Feynman diagram techniques is so forbiddingly complicated , let us recall two simple facts .
First , the particles circulating in Feynman diagrams are off - shell , that is , they do not obey the usual relativistic dispersion relation p μ p μ = m 2 c 4 .
Secondly , in order to keep Lorentz invariance manifest , one must sum not only over physical polarizations , but also over a host of unphysical excitations ( for instance , in QED the photon is described by a four vector A μ , and thus comes with four polarizations instead of just the two physical helicities ) .
For gravity , calculational complexity increases enormously : the calculation [ 2,3 ] involves hundreds of thousands of Feynman diagrams .
A cursory glance at the N = 8 Lagrangian [ 4,5 ] will probably suffice to dissuade anyone from even trying to think about doing the calculation in this way !
The progress that started the long march towards the computation of Bern et al . [ 1 ] originally grew out of attempts to simplify the computation of multiparticle scattering amplitudes in particle physics , and QCD in particular .
A main novelty of this approach was to bring in string theory in an essential way , consistently exploiting the fact that quantum field theory amplitudes can be derived by taking special limits of string amplitudes ( where the string degenerates to a point ) .
The latter often turn out to be “ easier ” to calculate , precisely because their computation does not involve unphysical intermediate states .
As a crucial further ingredient [ 10 ] , this program revived methods from an old approach to particle physics ( going by the name of S - matrix theory ) that had flourished in the 1960s .
To extend these considerations to gravity required the ingenious exploitation of another key feature of string theory .
String theory describes massless spin - 1 and spin - 2 particles as excitations of open and closed strings , respectively .
In the computation of amplitudes this feature is mirrored in the fact that on - shell gravity amplitudes can be obtained by “ squaring ” on - shell Yang - Mills amplitudes ; the precise recipe for doing this was devised by Kawai , Lewellen , and Tye — the KLT rules [ 11 ] .
String theory can thus substantiate the idea that gravity is , in some sense , the “ square ” of Yang - Mills theory .
Despite its obvious appeal and simplicity , however , the idea goes much deeper : no amount of fiddling with the Einstein - Hilbert action ( which is nonpolynomial ) will reduce it to the square of a Yang - Mills action .
To bring the crucial factorization property out into the light of the day , much more work is required [ 12 ] .
In fact , to understand how that happens one better forget just about everything one has learnt in quantum field theory textbooks !
More specifically , the method employed in [ 1 ] proceeds by “ gluing ” on - shell amplitudes of yet another prominent supersymmetric theory : N = 4 Yang - Mills theory .
Being UV finite and exactly conformal , it is a very rare specimen in the zoo of quantum field theory models .
The gluing technique thus permits one to build the finiteness properties of N = 4 Yang - Mills theory into the calculation of the gravity amplitudes right from the start , thereby saving a lot of sweat ( which is still needed in other places ) .
However , putting together all the pieces that culminated in the calculation of Bern et al . [ 1 ] took more than ten years of hard work , and we cannot even begin to describe here the bag of tricks required to carry it to successful completion .
Still , and quite amazingly , in the end the whole calculation can be reduced to the computation of about 50 scalar four - loop integrals involving only cubic vertices .
All these diagrams must conspire to give the requisite cancellations and the finite end result .
To be sure , these results do not yet constitute a proof that N = 8 supergravity is truly a perturbatively finite theory of quantum gravity ( nor can they be easily generalized to gauged supergravity ) .
Nevertheless , the computation of Bern et al . [ 1 ] actually goes much farther than would be needed to establish the stated finiteness result , in that it also supplies subleading contributions ( in fact , the Feynman integrands ) rather than just the finite value of the integral .
All these results indicate that finiteness will persist to yet higher orders .
Before contemplating a five - loop computation , however , it is perhaps time now to search for a deeper underlying reason that might possibly explain finiteness .
Many suspect that this reason has something to do with an as yet undiscovered symmetry of N = 8 supergravity , and , in fact , a symmetry beyond maximal supersymmetry .
Indeed , there is one obvious candidate , namely the “ hidden ” symmetry called E 7 discovered long ago by Cremmer and Julia [ 4 ] .
Reconciling known on - shell counterterms with this symmetry remains a thorny problem , but it is most doubtful whether E 7 alone can do the job of explaining finiteness .
There are yet larger ( infinite dimensional ) hidden symmetries of exceptional type in maximal supergravities that might eventually become relevant here , but this remains a speculation for the moment .
In a wider perspective , what do these results mean for superstring theory and its claim to be the sole pretender to the throne of a perturbatively consistent extension of Einstein ’s theory ?
String theory differs from field theory in that , on top of its pointlike excitations , it has an infinite tower of massive states corresponding to the quantized vibrational modes of the string .
However , a closer look reveals that its ( still conjectural ) finiteness hinges not so much on the presence of these extra states , but rather on a new type of symmetry ( called modular invariance ) , which has no field theory analog .
This suggests that the new symmetry that may ultimately explain finiteness must act in a way very different from known realizations of spacetime and internal symmetries .
Accordingly , we should view the coexistence of several possibly finite candidate theories only as a first step towards the future construction of an underlying theory of quantum gravity , where classical space and time are only emergent concepts , and which would also be viable nonperturbatively .
At present we are still far from having such a theory , but Ref. [ 1 ] will surely remain as a milestone in this ongoing search .
It is a stunning achievement .

BERKELEY , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Various economic reports have come and gone over the past few months , but the worst so far , at least for California , is the latest UCLA Anderson Forecast .
It painted a grim picture for the Golden State , with unemployment going above 12 % and lingering in the double digits until 2012 .
The Anderson report , which comes out quarterly , pretty much says the state is in a tailspin -- something we 've actually known all along .
Read the full report .
Only the technology sector is likely to grow and serve as the foundation of California 's overall recovery , according to the report 's authors .
Most of the great high - tech companies in the United States are scattered around Palo Alto , such as Apple Inc. AAPL , +1.50 % in Cupertino ; Oracle Corp. ORCL , +0.38 % in Redwood Shores ; and Intel Corp. INTC , +1.15 % in Santa Clara .
Hewlett - Packard Co. HPQ , +0.37 % is in Palo Alto itself .
“ The University of California at Berkeley has one of the greatest engineering departments in the world .
Now name one high - tech company in Berkeley . ”
When you include parts of Silicon Valley stretching from San Francisco down to Los Gatos and back up through Milpitas , there are literally thousands of companies , big and small , involved in high - tech development and manufacturing .
There even are pockets of similar tech - related companies throughout California in somewhat remote spots , such as Carlsbad .
The state is awash in technology .
But will the all - important tech firms abandon the state if the situation continues to deteriorate ?
This should be a major concern .
I was alarmed visiting the once - bustling 4th Street corridor in Berkeley , where the largest restaurant in the area was shuttered , as were numerous boutiques and small shops .
This has driven all the stores to adopt shorter hours , so by 6 p.m. on weekdays it 's a ghost town .
Except for the University of California itself , the city of Berkeley seems as if it 's decaying .
I 'd advise a drive along University Avenue from the freeway up to the campus .
I 've been on dirt roads in Mexico that are in better condition than much of University Avenue .
In fact , the entire street looks and feels more like the outskirts of Henderson , Nev. , than anything in the San Francisco Bay Area .
It 's scary .
This is due in part to the antibusiness policies long employed and revered by Berkeley .
The resulting mix of businesses includes tattoo parlors , fortune tellers , check - cashing joints and struggling small storefronts .
A couple of strip clubs would fit right in .
UC Berkeley has one of the greatest engineering departments in the world .
Now name one high - tech company in Berkeley .
You can't ; tech companies scramble out of there as fast as they can .
( There is a burrito place called High Tech Burrito .
That 's about it . )
But the city is a microcosm of the state 's larger problems and of the great Catch - 22 .
California cannot get out of debt without drastic cuts in spending , meaning layoffs and higher unemployment , meaning less cash flow back into businesses .
The state cannot get out of debt without higher taxes , which means borderline businesses folding , creating more unemployment and depressing revenues .

California already has issued IOUs to employees , which were eventually refused by the banks and ironically refused by the state itself .
The only real solution to save California from the inevitable actually is the inevitable : Declare bankruptcy , and reset the system .
What will then emerge will be as important as the process and recovery .
We will finally get to see , as the saga unfolds , what we saw in the city of Vallejo , Calif. , during its bankruptcy proceedings -- a pattern of corruption , cronyism , abuse and the defrauding of the taxpaying public .
City officials making more than $ 300,000 a year , firemen making more than $ 200,000 , friends hiring friends .
Government work should be a refuge , not a gold mine .
California is being broken by its own government , state and local .
You can see it when you live in other states .
I have a place in Washington state .
There is no personal income tax ; property taxes are lower , and the sales tax is lower .
The government services are better and more efficient , and the roads are nothing like University Avenue or the Nimitz Freeway .
The public schools are not in shambles .
There is a recurring thought when comparing the Golden State to Washington : " What 's wrong with this picture ? "
UCLA 's Anderson report finally concludes that California will not recover as quickly as the rest of the nation .
Gee , I wonder why ?
Bankruptcy should help .
Just do it .

Yesterday , I was updating my local checkout of WebKit and I noticed a few tests for " WebGL " scroll by ( view commit ) .
Apparently , a big WebGL patch has quietly landed .
With a name like " WebGL " , I could n't help but investigate .
What is WebGL ?
WebGL is basically an initiative to bring 3D graphics into web browsers natively , without having to download any plugins .
This is achieved by adding a few things to HTML5 , namely , defining a JavaScript binding to OpenGL ES 2.0 and letting you draw things into a 3D context of the canvas element .
What does that mean exactly ?
Here 's a video of the initial WebGL layout tests included in WebKit r48331 .
Be sure to watch them in HD !
These demos are very simple , but they 're a great start .
I 'm sure we 'll see some complicated OpenGL scenes pop up soon , and I 'm curious to see how complex they can get before FPS becomes a factor .
Maybe I 'll make a WebGL mini - game in some spare time !
Why is this cool ?
This has a million applications - I 'm obviously biased towards gaming though .
Basically , imagine playing Lugaru or Black Shades instantly in your browser , on any platform , without having to install anything .
In the same way Gmail is killing desktop mail applications , full - fledged 3d video games could start migrating to the web .
Flash gaming would have a serious run for its money as more advanced , standards - based , hardware - accelerated games started popping up .
This would have huge implications for the entire PC gaming market , which I might explore in a separate blog post .
Of course , this utopia of browser - based OpenGL gaming will require the cooperation of all major browser vendors .
When will we start to see WebGL outside of isolated , developer previews ?
When can we actually use it ?
This is a brand new web technology , we wo n't be seeing this for another 10 years right ?
Well , this actually has the potential to show up in browsers in the not - so - distant future .
As you 've seen above , this is already significantly developed in WebKit .
It will take a little while before it 's enabled by default in the nightly WebKit builds and longer still for Safari to adopt it , but that could theoretically be as soon as six months from now .
The same goes for Google , FireFox , and Opera , who are part of the WebGL working group .
Google Chrome , of course , is based on WebKit and has pledged to support this ( in addition to its own O3D , which hopefully will be standard soon as well ) .
FireFox has an extension which enables an implementation of Canvas 3D , and Opera has supported its own ( albeit different style ) canvas 3D for a while .
What about Internet Explorer , which hardly supports existing standards , let alone up and coming ones ?
Given Microsoft 's history , I would n't hold my breath , but there will undoubtedly be some kind of extension that simulates WebGL , like there is for the canvas element .
Until then , it will be yet another awesome WebKit feature for people who are developing specifically on the WebKit platform to brag about .
It will be pretty cool when Awesomium updates to the latest WebKit and we can render 3D scenes inside of our own 3D scene !
As California lawmakers struggle with a budget gap that has now grown to $ 26.3 billion , one of the hottest topics for many taxpayers is the cost to the state of illegal immigrants .
The question of whether taxpayers should provide services to illegal residents became a major political issue in California ’s last deep recession , culminating in the ballot fight over Proposition 187 in 1994 .
That history could repeat itself in the current downturn , as activists opposed to illegal immigration have launched a campaign for an initiative that would , among other things , cut off welfare payments to the U.S. - born children of illegal immigrants .
Those children are eligible for welfare benefits because they are U.S. citizens .
State welfare officials estimate that cutting off payments to illegal immigrants for their U.S. - born children could save about $ 640 million annually if it survives legal challenges .
California has roughly 2.7 million illegal residents , according to an April 2009 report from the authoritative Pew Hispanic Center , accounting for about 7 % of the state ’s population .
State officials estimate that they add between $ 4 billion and $ 6 billion in costs , primarily for prisons and jails , schools and emergency rooms .
Beyond those services , the illegal population adds to the overall cost of other parts of local government , from police and fire protection to highway maintenance and libraries .
Advertisement
On the other side of the ledger , illegal residents pay taxes -- sales taxes on what they buy , gasoline taxes when they fuel their cars , property taxes if they own homes .
The total is hotly debated , although most researchers agree that the short - term costs to state and local government are bigger than the revenues .
Many companies that hire illegal workers also withhold Social Security and income taxes from their paychecks , based on workers ’ invalid Social Security numbers .
That money goes mostly to the federal government , not to localities .
The Social Security Administration estimates that in 2007 , illegal residents nationwide contributed a net of $ 12 billion to the system .
The largest costs to California ’s budget from its illegal residents are in three areas :
* Education :
The state has no official count of how many students are in the country illegally because school districts do not ask .
But the state legislative analyst estimated , based on data from the Pew Hispanic Center , that the state ’s 6.3 million public school students include about 300,000 illegal residents .
At an annual cost of about $ 7,626 each , the total comes to nearly $ 2.3 billion .
Advertisement
* Prisons :
In fiscal year 2009 - 10 , California expects to spend about $ 834 million to incarcerate 19,000 illegal immigrants in the state ’s prisons .
In Los Angeles County , illegal immigrants add between $ 370 million and $ 550 million annually to criminal justice costs , including prosecution , defense , probation and jails , according to Supervisor Mike Antonovich .
* Healthcare :
The expected state tab for healthcare in fiscal 2009 - 10 is $ 703 million for as many as 780,000 illegal immigrants .
Of that , $ 486 million goes to emergency services .
But low - income illegal residents are also eligible for some nonemergency health services , including prenatal and postpartum care , abortions , breast and cervical cancer treatment and certain types of long - term care , such as stays in nursing homes .
Most of the nonemergency care for illegal immigrants was authorized by the Legislature in the 1980s .
Much of those costs are beyond the control of state officials .
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1982 that the Constitution forbids school districts to turn away children who are illegal immigrants .
And federal law requires emergency rooms to treat everyone , regardless of citizenship .
How serious a problem those costs are is a subject of constant debate .
“ It is a catastrophic hit . . . on every level of government , ” Antonovich said .

State Sen. Denise Moreno Ducheny ( D - San Diego ) who heads the Senate budget committee , counters that illegal immigrants are net contributors through their taxes and labor in farming and other industries .
Cutting services to illegal residents is “ penny wise and pound foolish , ” Ducheny said .
The Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy , based in Palo Alto , has analyzed research on the costs of illegal immigration .
Most studies show that at least in the short term , illegal immigrants , who tend to be poorer and have more children than average , use more in public services than they contribute in taxes , the center found .
But the center ’s director , Stephen Levy , said some of the long - term effects were positive .
Educating illegal immigrant children , for instance , helps them eventually land better jobs and higher salaries , benefiting Californians with increased tax payments and more sophisticated work skills .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said it is wrong to blame illegal immigrants for the state ’s fiscal problems .
He has , however , proposed to limit welfare and nonemergency healthcare for illegal immigrants and their families .
So far , the Legislature has rejected his plans .
Advertisement
One of the governor ’s proposals would place a five - year limit on state welfare payments to the U.S. - citizen children of illegal immigrants .
That would affect approximately 100,000 U.S. - born children in about 48,000 California households headed by illegal immigrants , who receive a monthly average of $ 472 .
The measure could save $ 77 million annually , according to the governor ’s office .
Under another proposal , the governor could commute the sentences of some illegal immigrant felons in state prisons and shift them to federal detention centers .
It costs the state $ 48,000 to incarcerate a prisoner , and the federal government reimburses about 12 cents on the dollar , according to state finance officials .
The administration estimates that commuting sentences of 8,500 felons , along with other sentencing changes , could save $ 182 million , although other state analysts question that .
State cuts in health services could shift costs to counties , some of which have begun denying treatment to illegal immigrants to close their own budget gaps .
“ It really is a punt , ” said Farra Bracht of the Legislative Analyst ’s Office .
“ We just keep shoving more and more to the counties .
. . .
They are the providers of truly last resort . ”
Many state officials have called on the federal government to increase the payments it makes to the state for costs associated with illegal immigrants , because controlling the borders is a federal responsibility .
So far , however , Washington lawmakers , faced with large deficits of their own , have not been willing .
Advertisement
And others say the nation ’s humanitarian traditions and long - term interests compel extending a helping hand to people such as Delia Godinez .
Godinez , a 43 - year - old undocumented Mexican immigrant , left an abusive family and lives in transitional housing .
Four of her five children are citizens and receive a total of about $ 650 each month from the state ’s CalWorks program .
She also receives about $ 500 in federal food stamps and other vouchers .
Without the aid , the unemployed Godinez said , she would n’t be able to provide for her family .
She is studying English and hopes one day to open a business and get off welfare .
“ I do n’t want to be my whole life with that help , ” she said .
Advertisement
Many advocates say the ultimate solution is to reduce illegal immigration , not to cut off critical services that could jeopardize public health and safety .
“ When people come into the U.S. , even illegally , they cross more than a physical barrier ; they cross a moral barrier , ” said Steven Camarota of the Washington - based Center for Immigration Studies , which advocates immigration restrictions .
“ We do n’t like it if someone ca n’t go to the emergency room .
That ’s just our way . ”

You would n’t know it to look at me , but I go running several times a week .
My favorite route , because it ’s so flat , is from the Lincoln Memorial to the U.S. Capitol and back .
I was there last Saturday and found myself plodding through tens of thousands of anti-government “ tea party ” protesters .
They were carrying “ Do n’t Tread on Me ” flags , “ End the Fed ” placards and signs condemning big government , Barack Obama , socialist health care and various elite institutions .
Then , as I got to where the Smithsonian museums start , I came across another rally , the Black Family Reunion Celebration .
Several thousand people had gathered to celebrate African - American culture .
I noticed that the mostly white tea party protesters were mingling in with the mostly black family reunion celebrants .
The tea party people were buying lunch from the family reunion food stands .
They had joined the audience of a rap concert .
Because sociology is more important than fitness , I stopped to watch the interaction .
These two groups were from opposite ends of the political and cultural spectrum .
They ’d both been energized by eloquent speakers .
Yet I could n’t discern any tension between them .
It was just different groups of people milling about like at any park or sports arena .
Cargo lorries bound for Kaesong were only allowed to travel at certain times North and South Korea have restored regular access across their heavily fortified border , for traffic going to and from a jointly - run industrial park .
The North had severely limited access across the border since December 2008 .
The border will be opened 23 times a day to traffic , up from the previous six times a day .
The reopening is the latest sign that North Korea has softened its stance against the South since its nuclear and missile tests in May .
Seoul 's Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong - joo told reporters that the number of people and vehicles allowed to cross the border at one time would also no longer be restricted .
Industry
The crossing provides access to and from the Kaesong industrial park , where South Korea runs 110 factories employing about 40,000 North Korean workers - an important source of foreign exchange for the North Korean government .
The project was in danger of collapse amid recent tensions , but the visit earlier this month to North Korea by Hyundai Asan chairwoman Hyun Jeong - eun eased the cross - border relationship .
Kim Jong-il held talks with Hyundai 's chairwoman in Pyongyang
She met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and secured the release of a South Korean worker at Kaesong who had been detained .
She also secured agreement for cross - border talks on family reunions to restart .
South Korea 's Yonhap news agency said that the two Koreas are also due to exchange the names of about 200 people seeking relatives today .
Warmer ties ?
The thaw between North Korea and the outside world began when former US President Bill Clinton went to Pyongyang to secure the release of two US journalists detained for alleged illegal entry .
It was furthered by the North 's expression of grief at the death of former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung , the man credited with the sunshine policy of rapprochement .
When North Korea sent a delegation of senior envoys to his funeral , those envoys also spoke with current South Korean leaders .
But there is still no movement on deadlocked international talks on North Korea 's nuclear ambitions .
The North remains insistent that it wants bilateral talks with the United States and that the six - party talks involving both Koreas , China , the US , Russia and Japan are dead .

President Obama made his " controversial " speech to students today on the first day of school , and as expected it was simply about working hard and persisting in getting a good education despite any personal problems students may have .
The reaction after the speech has been positive , and no trace of a socialist agenda can be found .
So it turns out that this did n't happen .
The three strategic errors made by the GOP are as follows :
First , opposing something done by the President for the sake of opposition alone .
Before the school speech was derided as being a socialist agenda the GOP was hard at work opposing health care reform , which for them dwarfs a speech at a school by an order of magnitude .
Thanks to opposition to the speech over the past seven days or so , their focus has been divided at a crucial period of time for them .
Second , they neglected to check what other presidents have said in the past to students .
It turns out that Ronald Reagan gave a speech to children that veered well off the subject of education , referencing items such as job creation and tax cuts .
The first George Bush also gave two speeches to students .
Third , they opposed the speech before the text was even released .
Speeches are almost always modified before release according to the news of the day or other recent developments , so they made it easy for Obama to tailor the speech in order to make it both controversy free , as well as as different from what the GOP had been claiming it would be as possible .
Showing one 's hand that early when one 's opponent is given days and days to watch and draft a counter - strategy is always a bad idea .
Now that the speech is over , all of a sudden Obama is about to give another one on health care the next day and it's time for the GOP to switch gears again now that this tactic has turned out to be a dud .
Fox News has been accused of riling up winguts for the wacky , psychotic 9/12 protests .
And while Glenn Beck and company deny such antics , there 's now proof .
We 're nearly speechless ...
The above video shows a Fox News producer egging on the crowd , a crowd the improbably named newsman Griff Jenkins described on air as " absolutely grassroots . "
It was , he declared , an " uprising . "
It sure is .
Indeed .
Fox executives , of course , have an excuse for the apparent breach of ethical , balanced conduct : the girl 's simply young and " inexperienced . "
The employee is a young , relatively inexperienced associate producer who realizes she made a mistake and has been disciplined .
Hmmm .
This looks pretty experienced to us , but perhaps it 's just youthful exuberance — something of which we know nothing .
There is an interesting account out of Waco , Texas where Bill Nye “ The Science Guy ” was booed for saying that the Moon does not generate it own light — in contradiction to the Bible .
This will likely end any dream of Nye to open a new Bill Nye “ The Religion Guy ” line of products .
The speech reportedly occurred in 2006 but the controversy was rekindled after critics cried foul at the removal of the story from the local newspaper ’s online archive .
Nye ran afoul of the faithful by remarking that it is not true that the moon generates its own light as opposed to reflecting light .
This contradicted Genesis 1:16 , which says quite clearly ( if only Nye bothered to read it ) that “ God made two great lights — the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night .
He also made the stars . ”
Fortunately , there were educated people in the audience who proceeded to boo Nye and walk out .
One woman with three children reportedly screamed “ We believe in God ! ” while storming out .
Now what is particularly interesting is the Waco Tribune broke the story and ran an article with quotations from the audience .
However , it has been removed from the online site , as noted at an atheist site .
However , it has now been returned , here .
Why would the newspaper remove a clearly important story with international interest ?
If the story was false , there should have been a retraction and an investigation .
If it is simply embarrassing , the newspaper is engaging in self - censorship .
Either way , the newspaper owes people and explanation .
In the meantime , Nye needs to answer for his rejection of biblical science .
Recently , Texas legislators moved to help create a master ’s in creationist science .
Perhaps
Nye should be required to get a real science degree in creationism as opposed to that ridiculous Bachelor of Science in mechanical engineering from Cornell .
Next he is going question the fact that the sun revolves around the earth and find himself in a papal trial .

From rhinos to redwood trees , the noughties decade has spelled the end for some species of plants and animals .
Many have not been sighted in their natural habitat for some time , while others have been declared officially extinct by body that compiles an annual 'red list ' of the status of endangered species , the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN )
Adem Yilmaz , part of a group of suspected militant Islamists arrested in Germany 's Sauerland region in September 2007 , told the court in one of Germany 's largest terrorism trials since the 1970s that it did n't matter to him whether the soldiers were American , German or Turkish .
" For me they are all the same , " said Yilmaz , who is himself Turkish .
" Allah gave us the right to fight against those people who are fighting us , " he said , adding that many Muslims had been attacked in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Yilmaz also said he stood by an earlier statement that he wanted to kill as many non-believers as possible .
Asked whether he would return to fighting armed jihad - holy war - after serving his sentence , the 30 - year - old said , " I do n't know yet . "
Yilmaz belongs to the so - called Sauerland Group , together with fellow defendants Fritz Gelowicz , Daniel Schneider and Attila Selek .
Yilmaz arrived in Germany in 1986 and said he decided to join the armed " holy war " in 2004 .
His initial target had been Iraq .
He added that the Americans were the " head of the team " fighting Islam .
Daniel Schneider is distancing himself from the idea of a holy war
Yilmaz was the second member of the group , arrested after intense police surveillance , to make an extensive confession .
In return he 's likely to be given a reduced sentence .
The case is expected to yield unprecedented details of militant Islamist training and recruitment methods in Pakistan .
Co-defendent Schneider also testified on Wednesday , when he sought to distance himself from the group ’s activities , labelling jihad as senseless .
" I would no longer choose to move towards jihad , " the 23 - year - old said , adding that he doubted that jihadist attacks served any purpose given the strength of Western forces , which he said were aligned against Islam .

Asteroid impact craters are among the most interesting geological structures on any planet .
Many other planets and moons in our solar system , including our own moon , are pock - marked with loads of craters .
But because Earth has a protective atmosphere and is geologically active – with plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions , mostly relatively young oceanic crust , and harsh weathering from wind and water – impact structures do n't last long and can be tough to come by .
But on a few old pieces of continent , especially in arid deserts , the marks of asteroids have been preserved .
One well - known example is our own Barringer crater , also known as Meteor Crater , in Arizona .
The images here show some of the biggest , oldest and most interesting impact craters on the planet .
Aorounga crater , pictured above and below , is one of the best preserved impact craters on Earth , thanks in part to its location in the Sahara Desert in Chad .
The 10 mile - wide crater is probably around 350 million years old .
The stripes are alternating rock ridges and sand layers , known as yardangs , caused by persistent unidirectional wind .
The image above was taken by astronauts in the International Space Station in July .
The radar image below , taken from the space shuttle in 1994 , reveals that Aorounga may be one of two or three craters .

The Shoemaker crater in Western Australia , formerly known as the Teague crater , was renamed in honor of the planetary geologist Eugene Shoemaker for whom the Comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 is also named .
The age of the crater unclear , but it could be 1.7 billion years old , which makes it the oldest known impact in Australia .
The brightly colored splotches are seasonal salt - water lakes .

The Manicouagan Crater in northern Canada is one of the largest impact craters known on Earth .
The impact occurred around 210 million years ago at the end of the Triassic period and may have caused a mass extinction that killed around 60 percent of all species .
Though the crater has mostly eroded , Lake Manicouagan outlines what is left of the 43 - mile wide impact structure .
The asteroid that created the crater is thought to have been about three miles wide .
Today the lake is a reservoir and popular salmon fishing location .

This crazy looking structure in Western Australia is called the Spider crater , for obvious reasons .
Geologists determined it was an impact crater when they found shatter cones , telltale cone - shaped , grooved rocks found only around impacts .
The crazy looking legs surrounding the impact are mostly due to erosion of different rock layers .
The harder sandstone ridges withstood the weathering of wind and water better than the softer intervening layers .
The crater is somewhere between 600 million and 900 million years old and the raised area at its center is around 1,600 feet wide .

The Gosses Bluff crater in Australia 's Northern Territory sits between two mountain ranges .
The raised circular feature in the center of the structure is around 2.8 miles across , but the original crater rim was probably at the edge of the surrounding grayish area .
The crater was formed caused by an asteroid impact around 140 million years ago .

Clearwater Lakes in Quebec , Canada were formed by a pair of asteroid impact craters .
The impacts probably occurred simultaneously around 290 million years ago .
The larger crater measures 22 miles across .

The Roter Kamm crater in Namibia is hard to see in visible light , but shows up more clearly with imaging radar .
The crater 's 1.5 mile - wide rim stands out as a bright ring in the lower left of the image , which was taken by a radar instrument on board the space shuttle .
Irregular surfaces show up brightly and smooth areas are dark .
The white splotch at the bottom of the photo is a rocky hill , the darkest areas are wind - blown sand dunes , the blue around the crater 's rim may be material that was ejected during the impact , the red is limestone outcrop and the green areas are mostly vegetation .
The impact occurred around 5 million years ago .

The Lonar crater in Maharashta , India is around 6,000 feet wide and 500 feet deep and contains a saltwater lake .
Scientists determined the structure was caused by an asteroid through clues such as the presence of maskelynite , a glass that is only formed by extremely high - velocity impacts .
The impact occurred around 50,000 years ago .

We here at Wired Science love a really good , cheesy artist 's rendering of a space object or phenomenon , so we could n't resist this beauty .
This is one man 's idea of what a 300 - mile wide asteroid would look impacting Earth .

It 's unlikely anybody on the Costa Mesa Fire Department 's Urban Search and Rescue team signed up for this .
The highly trained team usually responds to calls involving people trapped in structures and vehicles .
On Tuesday , squad members responded to a trapped penis .
In an ill - conceived attempt to increase the size of his member , a man placed his penis through the " hole of a steel , ring - shaped dumbbell weight fastener , " according to the Daily Pilot .
The fasteners are used to secure weight plates on dumbbell bars .
" They said his comment was , ' This will make me the chief of my tribe , ' " Costa Mesa Battalion Chief Scott Broussard told the Pilot .
It did -- if becoming chief of the tribe means restricting blood flow and causing one 's penis to swell to the point that the device cannot be removed .
When he arrived at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach , doctors tried to convince the man he needed immediate treatment .
That 's where the multi-skilled urban search and rescue team and a surgical saw came in .
The Pilot reported that squad members cut through the inch - thick ring -- producing sparks that flew across the room -- during a two - hour process .
" They also slid a little piece of metal between the collar and his thing , so if it slipped past it would n’t hit his thing , " Broussard told the Pilot .
Keith Jones , deputy fire chief in Costa Mesa , told the OC Register that the man 's penis remained fully intact .

An Australian man has been arrested for allegedly fathering four children with a daughter he repeatedly raped for more than 30 years , local media reported Thursday .
A display outside a Melbourne shop on Thursday shows rows of The Herald - Sun with its headline story .
The man , in his 60s , began the abuse in the 1970s when the daughter was 11 and continued almost daily until 2007 , said the Herald Sun newspaper , which first reported the case .
The assaults resulted in four children , all with birth defects , the paper said .
One later died .
Authorities in the southeastern state of Victoria would not confirm details of the case to CNN , citing an overarching court gag order that bars the release of any information that may identify the man .
A clerk with the Melbourne County Court would say only that the man was arrested on charges of rape and incest .
Lisa Neville , Victoria 's minister for community services , said her agency is investigating .
" As a parent , this is just a horrific and appalling story , " she said .
" Court proceedings and a very broad suppression order make it impossible to go to the specifics of the story , " she said .
The case has created a stir in the country , with many comparing it to that of Josef Fritzl , the 73 - year - old Austrian man who kept his daughter imprisoned in a basement for 24 years and fathered seven children with her .
Local media outlets have also compared it to the recent case of Jaycee Lee Dugard , who was kidnapped from South Lake Tahoe in California at age 11 , kept a prisoner for 18 years , and bore two children with her captor .
The suspect in the Australia case denied raping his daughter , but was arrested after DNA tests revealed otherwise , the newspaper said .
The alleged victim's mother told the newspaper she was unaware of the abuse , despite living in the same house .
" We lived in a big house , so I would n't have known , " she said .
She said her daughter was vague about who fathered the children .
" She used to say something about going out to nightclubs and meeting a fella , but then she would clam up , " the mother told the newspaper .
The newspaper said the victim , now in her 40s , first reported the abuse to authorities in 2005 at the urging of a neighbor , but then refused to cooperate because she feared for her safety .
She came forward again in June 2008 , after which authorities conducted the DNA tests on her father .
The man was arrested in February , but someone tipped off the newspaper to the case only recently .
The woman and her three children were taken to a safe house .
Another neighbor told the Herald Sun she had her suspicions about the father but did not want to interfere .
" I did n't go to anybody , because it was n't anybody 's business , " she told the paper .
She added that the woman who encouraged the victim to contact police " has always been a busybody . "

Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson won the Nobel economics prize on today for their analyses of economic governance — the way authority is exercised in companies and economic systems .
Ostrom was the first woman to win the prize since it was founded in 1968 , and the fifth woman to win a Nobel award this year — a Nobel record .
Ostrom , who has devoted her career to studying the interaction of people and natural resources , told the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences by telephone that she was surprised by the Nobel .

" There are many , many people who have struggled mightily and to be chosen for this prize is a great honor , " she said .
" I 'm still a little bit in shock . "
The academy cited Ostrom " for her analysis of economic governance , " saying her work had demonstrated how common property can be successfully managed by groups using it .
Williamson , the academy said , developed a theory where business firms can serve as structures to resolve conflicts .
" Over the last three decades , these seminal contributions have advanced economic governance research from the fringe to the forefront of scientific attention , " the academy said .
It said the American winners ' research shows that economic analysis can shed light on most forms of social organization .
" Elinor Ostrom has challenged the conventional wisdom that common property is poorly managed and should be either regulated by central authorities or privatized , " the academy said .
" Based on numerous studies of user - managed fish stocks , pastures , woods , lakes , and groundwater basins , Ostrom concludes that the outcomes are , more often than not , better than predicted by standard theories . "
One notable publication Ostrom wrote in 1990 examined both successful and unsuccessful ways of governing natural resources — forests , fisheries , oil fields , grazing lands and irrigation system — that are used by individuals .

Williamson was cited for arguing that markets and hierarchical organizations , such as firms , represent alternative governance structures that differ in their approaches to resolving conflicts of interest .
Issues of governance , or the rules by which authority is exercised in companies and economies , have been at the heart of the ongoing world economic crisis .
The failure by boards of directors , for instance , to police excessive compensation , or prevent bonuses that reward excessive risk taking , can be considered a corporate governance issue .
The economics prize was the last Nobel award to be announced this year .
It 's not one of the original Nobel Prizes , but was created by the Swedish central bank in Alfred Nobel 's memory .
Nobel Prize winners receive 10 million Swedish kronor ( $ 1.4 million ) , a gold medal and diploma from the Swedish king on Dec. 10 , the anniversary of Nobel 's death in 1896 .
In the biggest surprise of this year 's awards , President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday .
In other awards , American scientists Elizabeth H. Blackburn , Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak shared the Nobel Prize in medicine for discovering a key mechanism in the genetic operations of cells , an insight that has inspired new lines of research into cancer .
The physics prize was split between Charles K. Kao , who helped develop fiberoptic cable , and Americans Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith who invented the " eye " in digital cameras .
Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz and Ada Yonath of Israel shared the chemistry prize for their atom - by - atom description of ribosomes .
Romanian - born German writer Herta Mueller won the literature prize .
Start by Stopping
Each new day is a blank canvas which we fill with a checklist of tasks .
But every minute need not be structured and scheduled .
Try stopping from time to time , and make conscious contact with your inner self .
Let go of the need for maximum daily achievement and become comfortable doing nothing , if only for a short while .
“ Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication . ” – Leonardo da Vinci
Take the time to lay down on a blanket outside and watch the clouds .
Bring some crumbs for the birds and watch them enjoy .
Or check out the stars for a few minutes before going to sleep .
An occasional dose of non-doing lets you slow down to appreciate the pleasures of the moment , however simple , and gain a fresh perspective on how your time is spent each day .
Of the many things that long - term alcohol addiction can steal -- careers , lives , health , memory -- one of its most heartbreaking tolls is on relationships .
Alcoholics , researchers have long known , have a tendency to misread emotional cues , sometimes taking offense when none was intended or failing to pick up on a loved one ’s sadness , joy , anger or disappointment .
The misunderstandings can result in more drinking , and more deterioration of relationships and lives .
How does alcohol do all that ?
A new study finds that the brains of long - term alcoholics , even those who have long abstained , often differ from nonalcoholics ’ in ways that make them poorer judges of facial expressions .
In particular , alcoholics register less intensity in the amygdala and hippocampus ( collectively known as the limbic system ) when observing faces .
For the study , 15 abstinent alcoholics and 15 nonalcoholics looked at pictures of faces and were asked : “ How intelligent do you think this person is ? ”
Each face expressed positive , negative or neutral emotions .

Meanwhile , researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and Boston University peered into their brains using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging , which tracks brain activity from second to second .
The result is published online in the journal Alcoholism : Clinical and Experimental Research .
Nonalcoholics ’ limbic systems showed strong activity when the photos projected emotion , but were relatively quiet for neutral expressions .
The alcoholics ’ limbic systems , on the whole , responded no differently whether the faces expressed strong or no emotion .
The participants in the two groups were matched on factors such as age , IQ , education and socioeconomic status .
But their brains reacted completely differently when confronted with evidence of anger , joy , sadness or disappointment .

Ksenija Marinkovic , one of the study ’s authors , cautioned that it left one of researchers ’ most burning questions unanswered : Did alcoholism blunt emotional sensitivity , or did emotional insensitivity come before the alcoholism ?
The idea that alcohol abuse damages the brain makes intuitive sense .
But some research suggests instead that a child ’s cognitive deficits -- especially in the realm of emotional intelligence -- may set off a cascade of events leading to alcoholism .
Past research has shown that the children of alcoholics often exhibit the same deficits in reading emotions .
Children of alcoholics are at far greater risk of becoming alcoholics themselves .
“ It ’s a chicken - or - egg problem .
We just do n’t know which comes first , ” said Marinkovic , who now works at UC San Diego .

Police take away documents after the raids .
A 25 - year - old Glenroy man has been charged with an act in preparation for or planning a terrorist act .
He will appear in Melbourne Magistrates Court later today .
Police are interviewing a 26 - year - old Carlton man , a 25 - year - old Preston man and a 22 - year - old man from Meadow Heights .
All four men arrested are Australian citizens .
Police have confirmed they are also interviewing a fifth man , a 33 - year - old , who is already in custody in relation to other matters .
Police are also questioning several other people .
A NSW Police spokesperson said 20 officers from the Counter Terrorism and Special Tactics Command helped in the Melbourne phase of the investigation over a number of months .
No raids or arrests were made in NSW , a federal police spokesman said .
But NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione today revealed that a 35 - year - old Lakemba man is assisting police with their inquiries into the planned terrorist attack on Holsworthy army base .
Mr Scipione would not be drawn on how the man was connected with the Melbourne suspects and it did not appear at this stage that he would be arrested or charged .
NSW Police were told of the planned attacks , which could have potentially been ‘‘ catastrophic ’ ’ , in late March and had been working with the Victorian Police and the Australian Federal Police .
Acting AFP Commissioner Tony Negus said the alleged intention of the group was to gain entry to Australian Army barracks and kill as many people as they could .
" Police will allege that the men were planning to carry out a suicide terrorist attack on a defence establishment within Australia involving an armed assault with automatic weapons , " he said .
" Details of the planning indicate the alleged offenders were prepared to complete a sustained attack on military personnel until they themselves were killed . "
The alleged plotters had links to groups affiliated with the Al Shabaab terrorist organisation in Somalia - some were of Somali descent , others Lebanese , Mr Negus said .
The investigation revealed some of the alleged plotters had travelled to Somalia to join in fighting there , he said .
The group had been " actively seeking a fatwa , or religious ruling , to justify its plan for a terrorist act in Australia , " Mr Negus said .
Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Simon Overland said search warrants issued across Melbourne and at Colac in the state 's south - west might take 24 hours to complete .
Mr Overland said police had been anxious to control the alleged threat during their investigation and the time had come to act .
" I think it ’s sufficient to say that we got to a point where we were satisfied it was appropriate to take some action , and that ’s what we did , " Mr Overland said .
Mr Overland stressed the overwhelming number of Islamic people in Australia and Melbourne were valued members of the community , not terrorists .
He did not rule out further arrests in association with the raids , but said no one had been apprehended overseas .
Mr Overland said the suspects had conducted reconnaissance at Holsworthy in outer south - western Sydney .
There had also been " ‘ suspicious activity around other bases ’’ which he was not prepared to identify .
Mr Overland said he was " extremely disappointed " by leaks that led to reporting of the raids in newspaper .
" We will be vigorously pursuing the leak from my end and I expect that the federal authorities will be doing the same , '' Mr Overland said .
Copies of the newspaper were publicly available at 1.30 am in Melbourne , well ahead of the raids , he said .
" This , in my view , represents an unacceptable risk to the operation , an unacceptable risk to my staff , '' Mr Overland said .
" It 's a risk that I take extremely seriously and is cause for great concern . ''
The 's editor - in - chief Chris Mitchell defended the timeframe used for publishing the details .
Mr Mitchell said copies of the paper carrying the story were not available at at 1.30 am .
" We held the story out of all early editions , " Mr Mitchell told website .
" No newspaper that was sold before the raids had any mention of them - they had Godwin Grech on the front page .
" Only papers that were sold at newsagents after the raid , and those destined for home delivery , had the raid story on page one . "
Journalist Cameron Stewart , who was a spy with the Defence Signals Directorate before joining in 1987 , said the AFP nominated the publication date for the article after he sought comment from them .
" They said please do n't publish because you might comprise the investigation , " he told Sky News .
" I listened to their arguments and we did not publish .
Early - morning raids across city
Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police executed 19 search warrants at homes in Glenroy , Carlton , Meadow Heights , Roxburgh Park , Broadmeadows , Westmeadows , Preston , Epping and Colac about 4.30 am .
Police set up a crime scene at the corner of View and Glen streets , Glenroy , in Melbourne 's north .
Police blocked off View Street in both directions .
Investigators loaded equipment into the house , while they waited for the arrival of forensic chemists .
A small pale green weatherboard house , three doors along from the corner of Glen Street , was among those raided .
Resident Kylie Bitnell , who has lived in Glenroy for 18 years , described the morning ’s events as “ a bit scary ” .

THURSDAY , April 30 , 2009 ( HealthDay News ) --
In the face of a possible swine flu pandemic , U.S. health officials are already collecting information and ingredients with an eye to creating a swine flu vaccine .
And even though experts say there 's no guarantee such a shot -- which would take months to develop -- would work , many agree it's the logical next step .
There are now 109 confirmed cases of swine flu in the United States , spread across 11 states , with the first confirmed death -- a 23 - month - old child from Mexico who'd been taken to Texas for medical treatment -- reported on Wednesday .
That death notwithstanding , officials say most U.S. cases of the swine flu in humans are mild , and patients quickly recover .
However , they do expect more fatalities as the outbreak progresses .
" To start working on a vaccine now , before this has really moved anywhere near pandemic level , is the prudent thing to do , " said Dr. Lawrence Stanberry , chair of pediatrics at Columbia University and New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children 's Hospital in New York City .
" If a pandemic really develops , it 's an event that generally circles the globe over months .
It does n't just happen in one season .
It can extend to a second season and , with each wave , you get an amplification .
More people are infected , and it spreads more . "
" Most flu people will tell you that vaccines are the way to prevent and control flu , " agreed John Quarles , professor and head of microbial and molecular pathogenesis at Texas A&M Health Science Center in College Station .
While such a shot is n't ready yet , " it probably would be helpful six months from now , " he said .
That 's because any flu vaccine takes months to prepare and deliver to the public .
The seasonal flu vaccine , likely the model for the production of a swine flu vaccine , takes about six months to get out .
Here 's how the seasonal formulation occurs .
First , more than 120 sites around the world work year - round collecting data on which strains are circulating .
Twice annually , a panel of experts meets to determine which strains should be included in that season 's vaccine .
So , first researchers need to know more about what strains of swine flu are circulating , Quarles said .
And other questions remain unanswered --
Why are cases apparently more lethal in Mexico ?
How are the strains evolving ?
" There 's a lot of basic work they need to do over the next two - to - three weeks , " Quarles said .
" It 's just too early to have a hold on this . "
But much of that work may be under way .
On Tuesday , Dr. Ruben Donis , swine flu chief at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , said that engineers there must first devise a strain of swine flu that will spur the immune system without causing real illness .
Donis told the Associated Press that his team is about a third of the way to creating such a strain .
And at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , Dr. Jesse Goodman , who 's heading that agency 's swine flu effort , told the AP that his group is working " at 100 miles an hour " to create quality raw materials to deliver to vaccine manufacturers .
But even with the " regular " flu , there is often not a perfect match between circulating strains and the distributed vaccine .
However , people receiving a non-perfectly matched vaccine can still use it to help avoid getting sick , or at least not be sick for as long , Quarles said .
And there 's another key challenge to vaccine production , the experts said .
The U.S. still uses a relatively archaic egg - based production technique , in which selected strains of the influenza virus are grown in chicken eggs .
Often , one egg produces just two doses of a vaccine .
In the case of an experimental avian flu vaccine , Stanberry said , one egg yielded only one dose of vaccine .
And that 's if the virus grows in the eggs at all , or does n't kill the eggs .
If that portion of the process is successful , the vaccine still needs to be approved by the appropriate governmental bodies , although , Stanberry said , " There 's no reason to think , in an emergency situation , they could n't pull that committee together in no time at all . "
" We 're just going to have to be a little patient , " Quarles said .
" We can hope it will fizzle out , but it is still a good test of the system we have in place . "

2006 October
If you are interested in visiting the site , have stories about the site , or are interested in helping with an open house event , please contact me .
On Saturday , October 7 , the employees and associates of the White Sands Missile Range and the National Atomic Museum held another Trinity Site open house , 61 years and about 3 months after the world 's first nuclear explosive device was detonated there .
A couple days later , North Korea 's nuclear explosive device test erupted in the news .
A couple weeks later , October 22 , would mark 42 years after the first of two nuclear detonation tests conducted at the Salmon , or Tatum Salt Dome , site near Baxterville , Mississippi .
The tests performed there ( described below ) were intended to improve our ability to detect underground nuclear tests such as North Korea's .
The Tatum Salt Dome site is the only U.S. nuclear detonation test site east of the Mississippi River .
Mississippi is one of only 5 USA states to have a nuclear detonation test ; the others are Nevada , Alaska , Colorado and New Mexico .
The unmarked entrance to the southwest of the Salmon site is blocked by a plain , old , metal bar gate .
After a short distance , the dirt road is blocked by dirt piles and a barbed wire fence across the road .
Another mile or so down the road , there is a large , round area with dead and dying trees .
After passing many large spiders and spider webs across the road along the way , the effects of radiation may be suspected ; however , excess water in a swampy area is a more likely cause .
On Saturday , October 7 , 2006 , about 2500 people visited the Trinity site during the open house , according to the official count .
During the following week , at least one person made an informal visit to the Salmon / Sterling site .
Site Ground Zero is marked by a simple , headstone - like monument and several wells protruding from the ground .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- AIG 's stock closed at $ 47.84 on Thursday .
At the start of the month , shares were trading at a mere $ 13.14 .
What 's going on here ?
AIG 's stock has nearly quadrupled in August , but the company is no closer to paying back the $ 80 billion it owes taxpayers .
Investors got all wound up after the company announced in the past few weeks that it had appointed a new CEO and returned to profitability .
Shares gained another 27 % Thursday after The Wall Street Journal reported that new Chief Executive Robert Benmosche 's $ 10.5 million pay package has been fast - tracked for approval by Obama administration " pay czar " Kenneth Feinberg .
AIG pressed for a quick decision on Benmosche 's compensation , over concerns he might leave the company if it was n't immediately approved , according to the report .
The news actually came as little surprise , since AIG had previously announced that Feinberg gave the pay package a preliminary nod of approval .
A spokeswoman for AIG said the company would not comment on the status of Benmosche 's pay package or on the stock price .
Investors ' excitement about AIG began to build on Aug. 3 , when the company announced it would replace retiring Chief Executive Ed Liddy with Benmosche , the former MetLife ( MET , Fortune 500 ) CEO .
Shares gained a modest 3.5 % .
The stock skyrocketed on Aug. 5 , with shares soaring 63 % on hints that the company would post its first quarterly profit since October 2007 .
On Aug. 7 , when AIG announced it earned $ 1.8 billion in the second quarter , shares gained another 20.5 % .
On Aug. 20 , Benmosche said that he was optimistic the company would be able to pay back the more than $ 80 billion it owes the U.S. taxpayers and return to the company 's former glory .
Shares rocketed 21 % higher that day .
" People really like this guy Robert Benmosche , because he 's really a salt - of - the - earth New York financial guy , " said Damon Vickers , managing director of Nine Points Management & Research fund , which has bought up AIG 's stock in recent days .
" He looks like he 's got the spirit to take on this situation and make the best of it . "
Since the beginning of the month , shares of AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) are up 264 % .
The company held a 20 - 1 reverse stock split on June 30 , when shares closed at $ 1.16 .
Vickers said AIG 's stock has a chance to hit $ 60 in the near term and $ 100 in the coming months .
He noted that after the stock split , AIG 's all - time high stands at $ 1,400 , so the stock has plenty of room to grow .
No help for taxpayers
Since the government holds its 79.9 % interest in AIG in preferred shares , taxpayers do n't stand to gain from a steep rise in the company 's common stock price .
Instead , the preferred shares pay a dividend .
But the dividends on the TARP part of the bailout -- $ 41.6 billion , or about half of its overall loan -- are " noncumulative . "
That means that the company can skip dividend payments without the obligation to make up the difference later .
And that 's just what AIG did on Aug. 3 , failing to declare its dividend payment to Treasury .
Should AIG miss three more dividends , the government will have the right to nominate two more directors to the insurer 's board .
Despite Benmosche and investors ' enthusiasm , AIG is still a very troubled company with a sizeable debt to repay to the government .
The insurer has said it did not make enough profit to repay the taxpayers , and AIG said it wo n't likely be able to sustain a string of profitable quarters anyway , as it will take hefty restructuring charges for its looming core asset sales .
AIG plans on paying back the government by selling off pieces of the company .
But those asset sales have been slow - going and sold at depressed values thus far , as credit remains tight .
AIG has made just over $ 9 billion on those deals to date .
As a result , AIG has agreed to spin off three huge chunks of its business , selling stakes in two of them to the Federal Reserve to reduce its loan by $ 25 billion .
Before his retirement on Aug. 10 , Liddy reiterated that the company would likely be able to repay the government in full in three to five years , which Benmosche echoed last week .
The company also has to deal with the ongoing distraction of hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses that have still yet to be paid to employees of its troubled Financial Products unit .
The company became the subject of a public uproar after the revelation in March that AIG paid $ 165 million in bonuses to employees of the division that nearly brought the company to its collapse .
Still , traders like Vickers are undeterred .
" As risky as AIG seems , it has the full backing of the U.S. government , " he said .
" Apparently you can take that to the bank .
I 'm comparing AIG to a U.S. Treasury , and I know it 's insane , but it 's nonetheless true . "
While the mortgage crisis has abated a bit , housing values are still significantly down from their peak .
The average sold price has gone from $ 322,000 to 273,000 since 2007 .
This leaves a lot of people with underwater mortgages .
For recent buyers , this has created a wave of foreclosures .
In any economy , a certain number of people will be unable to make the mortgage due to job loss , medical problems , or just simple over extension from the beginning .
Most times , this is an extremely stressful situation , but not a tragedy , because the buyer put 20 % down , and real estate prices have tended to go up .
Therefore , the person who got into trouble would simply sell the house for more than the balance on the mortgage , pay off the mortgage , and find a new , smaller house to buy or rent .
Unfortunately in our current economy , several factors make this impossible for many people .
First , in the past half decade or so , lenders were making a lot of loans with zero or reduced down payments , and amortization schedules that built up little or no equity .
This dramatically increased the pool of dollars chasing housing assets , driving up prices , and bringing buyers more likely to default into the housing market .
This meant more people who could n’t afford their mortgages , and more of those buyers could not sell their house for more than the balance of the loan .
As a result of this situation , the number of defaults has increased dramatically .
This caused lending standards to tighten up again , reversing the price increase caused by the looser standards .
The price decline further exacerbated the problem of low equity , as no or low equity became negative equity .
This creates quite a problem for the person who is not necessarily in dire financial straits , but needs to move for a job or for other reasons .
Many people are now effectively locked in their current home unless they are willing to default and rent somewhere else .
Let ’s take a typical example .
Jones buys a $ 300,000 house in 2007 .
In 2009 , he loses his job , and he ’d like to move to another city where jobs are more available .
His house is now worth $ 240,000 .
Unfortunately , he only put 5 % down , and got an interest only loan , so he would have to pay $ 45,000 plus a real estate commission of $ 14,000 .
Being unemployed with little savings , he does n’t have a spare $ 59,000 kicking around .
Therefore , he stays and tries to find another job , perhaps eventually defaulting .
Alternately , he might decide to live in the house , not paying the mortgage while waiting for foreclosure to save his money .
The lack of a mortgage payment and the cost of the foreclosure , of course , will cost the bank up to 50 % of the value of the house .
Either way , the default ruins Jones ’ credit , may keep his life on hold , and costs the bank a six figure sum .
One solution is to allow Jones to do a short sale .
This costs the bank $ 59,000 , which is better than $ 150,000 , but still a lot of money .
The bank will not want to do this unless it thinks Jones is very likely to default if they do n’t agree to the short sale .
The bank also does n’t want to create a prescient for other borrowers that might be able to keep making payments .
Jones might not even be in serious danger of default .
He might be able to get a lesser job that will pay the mortgage , but he would really rather move where he could get a new one .
Ultimately this all leads to the conclusion that the bank should let him move .
The bank has already lost its security for the loan —
It can recover some of the lost money , but not all , and so the loan is only partially secured by real property .
The bank does n’t want to just let Jones sell the house and write them an IOU for the balance , because Jones has a lot less incentive to make the monthly payment on that loan than he does on the existing one .
Furthermore , with current lending rules , Jones would probably have to come up with a 20 % down payment on the new house , which he almost certainly does not have .
So why not have the bank let him move to a new house with the old mortgage ?
The bank would require that he sell his existing house first , and then would allow him to buy a new house with the proceeds from the sale .
Any money left over would pay down the balance on the existing loan .
This way , the bank keeps its security — the remaining unsecured balance is constant or down , and Jones gets to move .
Furthermore , with the new job , Jones is much more likely to continue to make payments on the existing loan .
If Jones was overextended , he would move into a smaller house , trading down in house , but with the lower loan balance , getting a lower payment in the process .
The bank might require this if Jones did not meet current income guidelines in the new house .
The lower payment would make Jones much more likely ultimately repay the loan .
The bank might even ask that he move into one of the foreclosed bank - owned properties that are littering their balance sheets .
This solves two big problems for the bank simultaneously .
With the huge advantages to banks and Jones , why are n’t we seeing this as an option ?

Everyone would agree that usability is an important aspect of Web design .
Whether you ’re working on a portfolio website , online store or Web app , making your pages easy and enjoyable for your visitors to use is key .
Many studies have been done over the years on various aspects of Web and interface design , and the findings are valuable in helping us improve our work .
Here are 10 useful usability findings and guidelines that may help you improve the user experience on your websites .
1. Form Labels Work Best Above The Field
A study by UX Matters found that the ideal position for labels in forms is above the fields .
On many forms , labels are put to the left of the fields , creating a two - column layout ; while this looks good , it ’s not the easiest layout to use .
Why is that ?
Because forms are generally vertically oriented ; i.e. users fill the form from top to bottom .
Users scan the form downwards as they go along .
And following the label to the field below is easier than finding the field to the right of the label .
Tumblr features a simple and elegant sign - up form that adheres to UX Matter ’s recommendation .
Positioning labels on the left also poses another problem : do you left - align or right - align the labels ?
Left - aligning makes the form scannable but disconnects the labels from the fields , making it difficult to see which label applies to which field .
Right - aligning does the reverses : it makes for a good - looking but less scannable form .
Labels above fields work best in most circumstances .
The study also found that labels should not be bold , although this recommendation is not conclusive .
2. Users Focus On Faces
People instinctively notice other people right away when they come into view .
On Web pages , we tend to focus on people ’s faces and eyes , which gives marketers a good technique for attracting attention .
But our attraction to people ’s faces and eyes is only the beginning ; it turns out we actually glance in the direction the person in the image is looking in .
Eye - tracking heat map of a baby looking directly at us , from the UsableWorld study .
And now the baby is looking at the content .
Notice the increase in people looking at the headline and text .
Here ’s an eye - tracking study that demonstrates this .
We ’re instinctively drawn to faces , but if that face is looking somewhere other than at us , we ’ll also look in that direction .
Take advantage of this phenomenon by drawing your users ’ attention to the most important parts of your page or ad .
3. Quality Of Design Is An Indicator Of Credibility
Various studies have been conducted to find out just what influences people ’s perception of a website ’s credibility :
Stanford - Makovsy Web Credibility Study 2002 : Investigating What Makes Web Sites Credible Today
What Makes A Web Site Credible ?
A Report on a Large Quantitative Study
The Elements of Computer Credibility
Elements that Affect Web Credibility : Early Results from a Self - Report Study ( Proceedings of ACM CHI 2000 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems , v.2 , New York : ACM Press )
We do n’t know if Fever app is any good , but the sleek user interface and website make a great first impression .
One interesting finding of these studies is that users really do judge a book by its cover … or rather , a website by its design .
Elements such as layout , consistency , typography , color and style all affect how users perceive your website and what kind of image you project .
Your website should project not only a good image but also the right one for your audience .
Other factors that influence credibility are : the quality of the website ’s content , amount of errors , rate of updates , ease of use and trustworthiness of authors .
4. Most Users Do Not Scroll
Jakob Nielsen ’s study on how much users scroll ( in Prioritizing Web Usability ) revealed that only 23 % of visitors scroll on their first visit to a website .
This means that 77 % of visitors wo n’t scroll ; they ’ll just view the content above the fold ( i.e. the area of the page that is visible on the screen without scrolling down ) .
What ’s more , the percentage of users who scroll decreases with subsequent visits , with only 16 % scrolling on their second visit .
This data highlights just how important it is to place your key content on a prominent position , especially on landing pages .
This does n’t mean you should cram everything in the upper area of the page , just that you should make the best use of that area .
Crowding it with content will just make the content inaccessible ; when the user sees too much information , they do n’t know where to begin looking .
Basecamp makes great use of space .
Above the fold ( 768 pixels high ) , it shows a large screenshot , tagline , value proposition , call to action , client list , videos and short feature list with images .
This is most important for the home page , where most new visitors will land .
So provide the core essentials there :
Name of the website , Value proposition of the website ( i.e. what benefit users will get from using it ) , Navigation for the main sections of the website that are relevant to the user .
However , users ’ habits have significantly changed since then .
Recent studies prove that users are quite comfortable with scrolling and in some situations they are willing to scroll to the bottom of the page .
Many users are more comfortable with scrolling than with a pagination , and for many users the most important information of the page is n’t necessarily placed “ above the fold ” ( which is because of the variety of available display resolutions a quite outdated , deprecated term ) .
So it is a good idea to divide your layout into sections for easy scanning , separating them with a lot of white space .
For further information please take a look at the articles Paging VS Scrolling ( Wichita University – SURL ) , Blasting the Myth of the Fold ( Boxes and Arrows ) .
( thanks , Fred Leuck ) .
While giving your website a unique design is great , when it comes to usability , doing what everyone else is doing is best .
Follow conventions , because when people visit a new website , the first place they look for things are in the places where they found them on most other websites ; they tap into their experience to make sense of this new content .
This is known as usage patterns .
People expect certain things to be the same , such as link colors , the location of the website ’s logo , the behavior of tabbed navigation and so on .
Google keeps all links on its websites blue for a reason : the color is familiar to most users , which makes it easy to locate .
What color should your links be ?
The first consideration is contrast : links have to be dark ( or light ) enough to contrast with the background color .
Secondly , they should stand out from the color of the rest of the text ; so , no black links with black text .
And finally , research shows ( Van Schaik and Ling ) that if usability if your priority , sticking to blue for links is best .
The browser ’s default link color is blue , so people expect it .
Choosing a different color is by no means a problem , but it may affect the speed with which users find it .
6. The Ideal Search Box Is 27 - Characters Wide
What ’s the ideal width of a search box ?
Is there such a thing ?
Jakob Nielsen performed a usability study on the length of search queries in website search boxes ( Prioritizing Web Usability ) .
It turns out that most of today ’s search boxes are too short .
The problem with short boxes is that even though you can type out a long query , only a portion of the text will be visible at a time , making it difficult to review or edit what you ’ve typed .
The study found that the average search box is 18 - characters wide .
The data showed that 27 % of queries were too long to fit into it .
Extending the box to 27 characters would accommodate 90 % of queries .
Remember , you can set widths using ems , not just pixels and points .
One em is the width and height of one “ m ” character ( using whatever font size a website is set to ) .
So , use this measure to scale the width of the text input field to 27 - characters wide .
Google ’s search box is wide enough to accommodate long sentences .
Apple ’s search box is a little too short , cutting off the query , “ Microsoft Office 2008 . ”
In general , search boxes are better too wide than too short , so that users can quickly review , verify and submit the query .
This guideline is very simple but unfortunately too often dismissed or ignored .
Some padding in the input field can also improve the design and user experience .
7. White Space Improves Comprehension
Most designers know the value of white space , which is the empty space between paragraphs , pictures , buttons and other items on the page .
White space de-clutters a page by giving items room to breathe .
We can also group items together by decreasing the space between them and increasing the space between them and other items on the page .
This is important for showing relationships between items ( e.g. showing that this button applies to this set of items ) and building a hierarchy of elements on the page .
Notice the big content margin , padding and paragraph spacing on The Netsetter .
All that space makes the content easy and comfortable to read .
White space also makes content more readable .
A study ( Lin , 2004 ) found that good use of white space between paragraphs and in the left and right margins increases comprehension by almost 20 % .
Readers find it easier to focus on and process generously spaced content .
In fact , according to Chaperro , Shaikh and Baker , the layout on a Web page ( including white space , headers , indentation and figures ) may not measurably influence performance but does influence user satisfaction and experience .
8. Effective User Testing Does n’t Have To Be Extensive
Jakob Nielsen ’s study on the ideal number of test subjects in usability tests found that tests with just five users would reveal about 85 % of all problems with your website , whereas 15 users would find pretty much all problems .
Source : Jakob Nielsen ’s AlertBox
The biggest issues are usually discovered by the first one or two users , and the following testers confirm these issues and discover the remaining minor issues .
Only two test users would likely find half the problems on your website .
This means that testing does n’t have to be extensive or expensive to yield good results .
The biggest gains are achieved when going from 0 test users to 1 , so do n’t be afraid of doing too little : any testing is better than none .
9. Informative Product Pages Help You Stand Out
If your website has product pages , people shopping online will definitely look through them .
But many product pages lack sufficient information , even for visitors doing a quick scan .
This is a serious problem , because product information helps people make purchasing decision .
Research shows that poor product information accounts for around 8 % of usability problems and even 10 % of user failure ( i.e. the user gives up and leaves the website ) ( Prioritizing Web Usability ) .
Apple provides separate “ Tech Specs ” pages for its products , which keeps complicated details away from the simpler marketing pages , yet provides easy access when they ’re needed .
Provide detailed information about your products , but do n’t fall into the trap of bombarding users with too much text .
Make the information easy to digest .
Make the page scannable by breaking up the text into smaller segments and using plenty of sub-headings .
Add plenty of images for your products , and use the right language : do n’t use jargon that your visitors might not understand .
10 . Most Users Are Blind To Advertising
Jakob Nielsen reports in his AlertBox entry that most users are essentially blind to ad banners .
If they ’re looking for a snippet of information on a page or are engrossed in content , they wo n’t be distracted by the ads on the side .
The implication of this is not only that users will avoid ads but that they ’ll avoid anything that looks like an ad , even if it ’s not an ad .
Some heavily styled navigation items may look like banners , so be careful with these elements .
The square banners on the left sidebar of FlashDen are actually not ads : they ’re content links .
They do look uncomfortably close to ad banners and so may be overlooked by some users .
That said , ads that look like content will get people looking and clicking .
This may generate more ad revenue but comes at the cost of your users ’ trust , as they click on things they thought were genuine content .
Before you go down that path , consider the trade - off : short - term revenue versus long - term trust .
Bonus : Findings From Our Case - Studies
In recent years , Smashing Magazine ’s editorial team has conducted a number of case studies in an attempt to identify common design solutions and practices .
So far , we have analyzed Web forms , blogs , typography and portfolios ; and more case studies will be published next month .
We have found some interesting patterns that could serve as guidelines for your next design .
Here , we ’ll review some of the practices and design patterns that we discovered in our case studies in this brief , compact overview , for your convenience .
According to our typography study :
Line height ( in pixels ) ÷ body copy font size ( in pixels ) = 1.48 . 1.5 is commonly recommended in classic typographic books , so our study backs up this rule of thumb .
Very few websites use anything less than this .
And the number of websites that go over 1.48 decreases as you get further from this value .
. 1.5 is commonly recommended in classic typographic books , so our study backs up this rule of thumb .

And the number of websites that go over 1.48 decreases as you get further from this value .
Line length ( pixels ) ÷ line height ( pixels ) = 27.8 .
The average line length is 538.64 pixels ( excluding margins and padding ) , which is pretty large considering that many websites still have body copy that is 12 to 13 pixels in font size .

The average line length is 538.64 pixels ( excluding margins and padding ) , which is pretty large considering that many websites still have body copy that is 12 to 13 pixels in font size .
Space between paragraphs ( pixels ) ÷ line height ( pixels ) = 0.754 .
It turns out that paragraph spacing ( i.e. the space between the last line of one paragraph and the first line of the next ) rarely equals the leading ( which would be the main characteristic of perfect vertical rhythm ) .
More often , paragraph spacing is just 75 % of paragraph leading .
The reason may be that leading usually includes the space taken up by descenders ; and because most characters do not have descenders , additional white space is created under the line .

Optimal number of characters per line is 55 to 75 .
According to classic typographic books , the optimal number of characters per line is between 55 and 75 , but between 75 and 85 characters per line is more popular in practice .
According to our blog design study ( not online anymore ) :
Layouts usually have a fixed width ( pixel - based ) ( 92 % ) and are usually centered ( 94 % ) .
The width of fixed layouts varies between 951 and 1000 pixels ( 56 % ) .
The home page shows excerpts of 10 to 20 posts ( 62 % ) .
58 % of a website ’s overall layout is used to display the main content .
According to our Web form design study :
The registration link is titled “ sign up ” ( 40 % ) and is placed in the upper - right corner .
Sign - up forms have simple layouts , to avoid distracting users ( 61 % ) .
Titles of input fields are bolded ( 62 % ) , and fields are vertically arranged more than they are horizontally arranged ( 86 % ) .
Designers tend to include few mandatory fields and few optional fields .
Email confirmation is not given ( 82 % ) , but password confirmation is ( 72 % ) .
The “ Submit ” button is either left - aligned ( 56 % ) or centered ( 26 % ) .
According to our portfolio design study :
89 % of layouts are horizontally centered , and most of them have a large horizontal navigation menu .
47.2 % of portfolios have a client page , and 67.2 % have some form of standalone services page .
63.6 % have a detailed page for every project , including case studies , testimonials , slideshows with screenshots , drafts and sketches .
Contact pages contain driving directions , phone number , email address , postal address , vCard and online form ,

Baby born with heart outside body survives against the odds after life - saving surgery
A 10 - day - old baby born with his heart outside of his body , has undergone revolutionary life - saving surgery .
During the four - hour operation , 13 surgeons created a space for the baby 's heart inside his body by shifting his lungs and liver .
They did not stop the heart at any point .
' As there was no place for the baby 's heart in his chest , we had to create it , ' Dr Yogendra Gupta said .
The unnamed body had his heart tucked inside his chest during a four - hour operation
The brave youngster has already amazed doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi for surviving so long .
The incredibly rare defect ectopia cordis affects only eight in every million births and ninety per cent of these are stillborn or die within three days .
Dr RC Deka , the director of AIIMS said : ' The baby has been shifted to the ICU .
Though he is stable , this is a critical time and we are closely monitoring his condition . '
The doctors will keep the boy under observation and decide later whether he will need further surgery .
The baby was taken by his father Majhi , 26 and mother Vibha , travelled with their sick son 685 miles in a rickety train compartment to get medical aid .
Doctors replaced the baby 's infected blood after he arrived at the hospital and treated him for dehydration .
The baby 's father said they were indebted to the doctor in their home state of Bihar in eastern India , who paid for the trip .
Since federal limitations on domestic oil production in the 1980s , there has been a steady decline in US production .
By 1994 , the US was importing more than its total domestic production .
Restrictions on supply help to drive up prices and unnecessarily contribute to US reliance on foreign oil .
As much as 66 percent of all US crude oil is imported from other countries , and the amount of oil imported from OPEC nations is roughly equal to the amount of oil produced domestically .
Petroleum , natural gas and coal are the primary sources of energy consumed in the United States because they are the most energy rich resources available .
So far , renewables have only been capable of providing a small portion of total energy consumption , and their contribution to energy consumption has remained limited over the last two decades .
However , with increasing government and private focus on green energy sources , renewables are likely to go from strength to strength in the near future .
One of the major alternative fuels emerging as a genuine alternative to oil and gas is the ethanol - based biofuel , made from corn crops .
The real price of corn was significantly higher than the nominal price of corn until 1996 .
However , while the nominal and real price of corn remained relatively stable for ten years , both the real and nominal price of corn are back on the rise .
With pressure to produce biomass fuels containing higher concentrates of ethanol , prices of corn appear to be further increasing .
For every dollar of US GDP , the amount of GHGs and CO2 emissions that are produced in the process has been slowly falling .
When countries develop and prosper they create more efficient means of production .
As a result , American economic growth has brought more energy efficiency and less pollution per GDP dollar .
Until we find the renewables capable of replacing fossil fuels , oil and gas will remain the world ’s most important commodities , meaning the US will continue to import great volumes from overseas .
But just how reliant is the US on the importing of foreign oil ?
I wrote my column on it .
I do n't find the opposition to reform somehow illegitimate .
There are many reasons to criticize the plans now congealing ; and the end - result looks to me more and more like a simple extension of healthcare security to a lot of people without any real or strong mechanisms to curtail the soaring costs that are bankrupting the country and putting so much strain on US business .
Of course , I belong in that archaic camp that believes it is the job of a liberal president to expand such coverage and the job of a conservative opposition to propose ways to afford it .
Instead , the chairman of the GOP is making the Republican position on Medicare indistinguishable from the most cynical Democratic scare tactics , and complaining about any attempt to curtail costs .
If you have to strip out of a bill a mere conversation with seniors about powers - of - attorney for end - of - life decisions , you are not interested in a serious conversation about curtailing healthcare costs .
I agree with most everything David Brooks has written on this subject .
If we had a functional and serious conservative movement in this country - instead of a Poujadist mob of cynical know - nothings - we would be talking about the kind of questions David Goldhill discusses in the best single piece on the debate I have yet read - the cover-story in the current Atlantic .
We'd be talking about re-thinking the insurance model for large parts of medical care , we'd be cutting subsidies for employers , we'd be empowering patients to seek better coverage with better value and providing the tools to help them make informed decisions .
Instead , we 're talking Hitler and Oligarhy and " taking the country back " .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama insisted he can overhaul the U.S. healthcare system without raising taxes for anyone but the wealthiest Americans , in a media barrage on Sunday as he sought to take control of the debate on his top domestic policy priority .

In interviews with five Sunday television talk shows taped on Friday , he said his goals to expand healthcare and rein in costs would not lead to middle - class tax increases , and that he and his fellow Democrats are determined to pass the legislation despite a lack of Republican support .
After months of rancorous public debate , this week will be crucial in the effort to get what could be the defining issue for his presidency -- healthcare overhaul -- through Congress , where Democrats are the majority party .
The Senate Finance Committee meets starting on Tuesday to vote on and possibly amend a bill from its Democratic chairman , Max Baucus , which contains many of the elements Obama outlined in a major address to Congress on September 9 .
A Gallup poll last week found that by 60 percent to 38 percent , Americans do not believe the government can expand healthcare coverage without raising taxes on the middle class or affecting the quality of care .
The $ 2.5 trillion U.S. healthcare system is the world ’s most expensive -- it represents about a sixth of the economy -- but lags those of other advanced industrial states in quality of care .
The Kaiser Family Foundation study found insurance coverage for an average family costs $ 13,375 a year and premiums have increased 138 percent over the past decade .
Forty - six million people in the United States lack any health insurance , leaving them at risk of economic catastrophe if they get sick .
Obama said on CBS ’ “ Face the Nation ” he could still keep a campaign pledge not to raise taxes on those making less than $ 250,000 .
He said much of the cost of the overhaul could be funded by eliminating waste and abuse .
“ I can still keep that promise because as I ’ve said , about two - thirds of what we ’ve proposed would be from money that ’s already in the healthcare system but just being spent badly .
And as I said before , this is not me making wild assertions , ” Obama said .
‘ BIG GOVERNMENT PLAN ’
Republicans acknowledge problems with healthcare , but call the Democrats ’ approach an unnecessary government intrusion in the private sector that would raise taxes for individuals and small businesses and cut benefits to the elderly .
“ There is no debate in Washington , or around the country , about the need for us to fix our health care system .
It does n’t work well for everyone ... and it costs too much , ” House Republican leader John Boehner said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
“ But we can fix our current system , we can make it work better , we do n’t have to throw it away and have this big government plan . ”
The Baucus proposal would impose a fee on expensive health insurance policies .
The fee could raise $ 215 billion over 10 years to cover a fourth of the $ 856 billion plan .
It does not include a “ public option ” government - run insurance plan , which many Congressional liberals want but has been heatedly opposed by Republicans and insurance industry lobbyists .
Obama ’s healthcare campaign has prompted angry demonstrations by Americans skeptical of the plan .
Republican Representative Joe Wilson shouted “ You lie ” at Obama during his recent speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress .
The exchange led former President Jimmy Carter to say Obama was a victim of racism , a claim Obama , the first black U.S. president , dismissed .
“ You know , I think that it really has more to do with the fact that there are some people who think government can’t do anything .
As I said , there ’s some people who just cynically want to defeat me politically , but there ’s nothing new about that , ” Obama told Univision .
The media blitz , after repeated healthcare rallies and his major address to Congress on September 9 , prompted criticisms that Obama risks diluting his message through overexposure .
“ He ’s been on everything but the food channel , ” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said on “ Meet the Press . ”
The White House says the president must make his case in a variety of ways because Americans get news in so many places .
Many analysts agreed , saying the White House erred earlier by leaving it to Democrats in Congress to formulate a strategy and sell it to the public .
“ The White House needs to provide that single focal point , that single voice , ” said Daniel Amundson , research director at George Mason University ’s Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington .
“ It looks to me like the strategy is on the one hand , regain the rhetorical high ground , and on the other hand , cool off the language , ” he said .

My father worked for IBM for 30 years , starting in the late 1960 ’s and well into the 1990’s .
IBM was the reason I was born in the town I was , with the IBM plant down the road and my father investing in a new development on what was once farmland to build a new home for his soon - to - be - growing family .
His titles , from when I first started paying attention to them , were gibberish to me : compound - phrases with “ manager ” or “ technology ” or “ research ” scattered among them , and all I saw was that he wore a tie and disappeared for most of the day .
If you had asked me , at any time , what my dad did during those years , I ’d say he “ worked at IBM ” because that ’s what I saw it as , a job involving some sort of entering of a giant conglomerate morass .
He brought home computers from the lab that he borrowed for his son to try , and this was very successful in interesting me , but it did n’t tell me , specifically , what he did .
When I got into my snotty phase , somewhere in my early teens , I just started calling him “ The Cog ” .
This , I might add , to his face , as one might call someone “ pops ” or “ smitty ” or whatever .
The reason for calling him “ the Cog ” was my perception of his life at IBM – that he was a simple turning part in a huge , dominating machine , and that should anything go wrong with him or the machine would find him redundant , he would simply burn out , and a new cog would be snapped into place instantaneously , as if he never existed .
Harsh , I know , but we ’re that kind of family , if any of my other weblog postings help to indicate such .
It was , in most ways , an endearing nickname , but the perception was real – that my father ’s work was nameless , faceless , uninteresting and easily replaceable by forces unknown .
I say that , but in point of fact my father was valuable indeed .
He worked , as I said , for many years for IBM , at one point being dropped off the official roster because of their huge restructuring in the 90s , but then being hired immediately back as a consultant .
After he fully retired from IBM , with full benefits and a pension , he was scouted and went to work for ex-IBMers at other companies , gaining greater and greater responsibilities at those companies as well .
In other words , he was anything but a cog ; he was a prized part of the endeavors he was a part of , and when he essentially retired for good , which is how he is these days in his late 60’s , he could focus on his new loves of painting and travel with impunity .
One could hardly ask for more .
But , I , myself … well .
When I was laid off , let go , or whatever term was used , the process was , shall we say , sterile .
Sterile like a hired cleaner brought in to dispense of a library ’s collection or a hapless relative tasked with selling a well - tended car on Craigslist , its owner long gone .
Imagine being asked a couple of questions over a few months – your current vacation list from the year , your availability a certain week .
Imagine being brought into a room you never visit , and being read a paragraph off of a laptop explaining why your employment with a company is coming to an end .
Read , I might add , with no eye contact , a pre-formed script written long ago and at a different place , intended to state in the most general and non-hostile of phrasings why you should n’t show up tomorrow .
My term came to an end after 13 years at the company ( save a year elsewhere during rough times for the firm , a self - directed furlough ) .
13 years of often - difficult work , of 24 - hour on - call , of treacherous drives in snow to repair failing machinery and shared moments of elation and teamwork and pulling off the difficult or the impossible .
As explained by an accompanying voice on the speakerphone , I was not to return , I would not be in the building ever again , any major items would be pulled out of my cubicle and sent to me at a later date .
And then I was escorted out of the building , asked for all company material on my person , and left standing in a courtyard .
And the bastard wanted to shake my hand .
I had things to do and stuff to sort out elsewhere , but it was truly a week or so later that I made the major realization .
I was the cog .
My father ’s job ended with dignity , punctuated towards the end with a 30 - year ceremony in which his children were invited to come and have his long term with IBM lauded by co-workers and manager .
A small gesture , but meaningful , and accompanied with a small gift from the company , an appreciation above mere salary for his years given .
He was not a replaceable part in so many words , although of course the company did eventually move in directions not needing his talents .
He took his breath in and moved to the next adventure .
I make this declaration and revelation not for pity , or concern , or a comment stream filled with pedantic explanations of modern workplace reduction procedures .
It ’s simply to point out that I let myself spend many years in an environment that , ultimately , had little use for my real talents .
Sure , I wrote scripts that reduced overnight alarms by a significant percentage , and I installed more parts into more servers than I could ever possibly count .
And I definitely could triage a problem with the best of them , bringing near - minutes turnaround on failures that could threaten the stability of rather important and wide - facing systems .
But this was not joy I felt when these things happened , only the grim regard of a needed repair being executed before turning to the next mundane hoop .
Compare that , if you will , to being told of people attending conferences specifically to hear my presentations , or teary - eyed conversations about my documentary work .
Delight from finding nearly - lost history , or accolades for archives and collections and writing in all matters I choose ( and the important term is choose ) to address .
Imagine a slightly bumpy red line in the center of a graph , and then a blue line of highs and lows waving around it like a jagged mountain range .
At work , hours a day , I lived the red line , when I wanted the blue line of life outside work .
Therefore , I am making it clear that I am looking for employment , and places and persons who think they could use someone like me should feel free to contact me for my resume .
My resume is odd and varied , but it represents a passionate person who wants to do in his days what once he could only squeeze into variant stretches of snatched hours .
I wish to have a place that ’s proud of what I do , and can use those skills , and will consider it a thing worth talking about , something worth mentioning to others , and worth working with me to accomplish even more .
I wish , no longer , to be a cog .
Surely , out there , is a group who is looking for someone like me .
I ’m here .
Come get me .

The rumored Palm Pixi ( originally spelled Pixie ) , has now been officially announced .
The Pixi , WebOS based smartphone , is the thinnest ever phone from Palm .
It ’s 10 % thinner than iPhone 3G S and 20 % thinner than Pre .
Like the Pre , it also has a full QWERTY keyboard but rather than sliding , it ’s bare open body .
Other specifications include 8GB of onboard storage , a 2 megapixel camera equipped with flash , AGPS , a 2.63 inch capacitive display with a 320×400 pixel resolution , 3.5 mm headset jack , Bluetooth 2.1+EDR and …no WiFi .
Features include MicroUSB port ( both data and charging ) , proximity sensor , light sensor , accelerometer , ringer switch , and the same 1150 mAh battery as found in the Pre .
The Pixi uses a brand new Qualcomm processor : the MSM7627 .
The exact specifications of this chip are as of yet unknown .
RAM figures are unknown too .
The Pixi comes in the candybar form factor , which makes it incredibly small , thin , and light : it ’s 10.85 mm thin , 111 mm tall , and 55 mm wide , and weighs in at a mere 99.5 grams .
The screen is capacitive multi-touch , smaller than that of the Pre ( 3.1 ″ 320×480 ) or that of the iPhone ( 3.5 ″ 320×480 ) .
The multitouch part extends below the screen into the gesture area ( a prerequisite for the webOS , it seems ) , but the centre button of the Pre has been replaced by a gesture area tap .
The lower resolution is no problem for the webOS and its applications , as it was designed from the start to handle different resolutions .
The multitouch also appears to be slightly more responsive than on the Pre .
Design : video
It ’ll also come in many different colors and designs as part of something called the Palm Pixi Artist Series , which will offer a selection of limited - edition back covers for the device .
As far as price goes , since Pixi is Pre ’s younger brother , it ’ll probably be lower than $ 149.99 which is how much Sprint is currently asking for the Pre .
In a move reminiscent of the Pre launch , Palm has unveiled its second webOS mobile phone today , ahead of Apple ’s music / iPod event .
The Palm Pixi is a candybar incarnation of the Pre , but is clearly positioned below its big brother ; smaller screen , and more worryingly , no wifi .
The keyboard sports better tactile feedback . 🙂
The Pixi will be available before the holidays …
But only on Sprint for now .
So , here we are , two webOS phones , tied to Sprint , and only available in the US and Canada .
But No WiFi and a smartphone ?
Some one is joking .

Muse – The Resistance ( Warner Bros / Helium - 3 )
Everyone enjoys a good conspiracy theory – a wild romp through fanciful images of shadow and light at war behind the scenes of ordinary life .
But once you peel back the layers and do some proper research , those tales of secret brotherhoods , aliens and government cover - ups just seem so silly and childish .
And so it is with The Resistance , the new album by Muse that leaked this week ( available below ) – a big loud stadium - rock opera filled with romantic tales of defying Big Brother set against the backdrop of Judgment Day … that ultimately just feels so hollow .
Muse ’s front - man Matt Bellamy has never had any qualms about admitting he is a conspiracy theorist , and on this outing ( their fifth studio album ) , his penchant for the sinister and bizarre is once again on full display .
Those who have never heard Muse will probably notice Bellamy has a falsetto vocal range reminiscent of Thom Yorke from Radiohead , and in many ways , Muse sounds like a louder , poppier , eviler Radiohead ( though Radiohead is clearly the better band ) .
The band has moved slowly away from the prog-rock experimentation on their early albums toward a much more radio - friendly big arena - rock sound .
And while that change is disappointing , some of the new stuff is certainly fun .
The album opener “ Uprising ” is a simple , thunderous catchy number destined to be a single , and lyrically , it also sets the tone for what ’s to come next : the title track “ Resistance , ” a rocking strident plea to resist the powers - that - be with love .
The album then takes a bit of a turn with the song “ Undisclosed Desires ; ” a track with an 80 ’s throwback ambience , which , strangely enough , sounds like early Depeche Mode or maybe Tears for Fears for a new era .
But what follows is when the flood gates of craziness truly burst open with the totally frenzied madcap opus ( and perhaps the best song on the album ) , “ United States of Eurasia . ”
This track features more than a slight nod to Queen ’s “ Bohemian Rhapsody ” with a bit of the main theme to Lawrence of Arabia thrown in the mix .
Also featured in the instrumentation is an homage to the work of composers Camille Saint - Saëns and Frédéric Chopin .
The album closes with a three - part symphonic epic called “ Exogenesis ” that mixes the orchestral compositions of Chopin , Wagner , and Gershwin with the rock - opera sensibilities of Queen , Rush and Electric Light Orchestra , and it all comes together in an interesting , albeit a bit overreaching and flawed , musical arrangement that somehow sounds modern .
There is no question that much of this album is enjoyable and plays well at the higher decibels .
But ultimately , the album just does n’t gel as a whole very well , partly due to the embarrassingly awful lyrics .
Bellamy has attempted to create some sort of concept album which feels a bit like a paranoid love poem penned as a soundtrack for the Apocalypse .
Yet , the end product sounds more like the ramblings of a teenage pot -head that has read too many David Icke books and has fallen in love for the first time .
It seems like Muse was really swinging for the fences on this new album , but the result is more of an inside - the - park homerun than a grand - slam .
Granted , once it begins its inevitable rotation on the airwaves , it will probably be one of the best things currently playing on MTV or corporate radio , but that bar has obviously been set incredibly low .
One must give Muse props for attempting something grandiose , but for all its ambition , much of it still sounds like boilerplate arena - rock fit for the radio dials , and the thematic and lyrical content is unforgivably juvenile .
Perhaps Bellamy will someday grow up and abandon his puerile obsession with conspiracies and other such nonsense , but until then , he will always come off as a pseudo - intellectual .
And as such , this review shall close with an oft - quoted Shakespearean line , a favorite for the pseudo - intellectual in all of us :
The Resistance “ is a tale told by an idiot , full of sound and fury , signifying nothing . ”

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Google
Inc said more than 2 million businesses now use its online office software , and the Web search leader is going global on Monday with an advertising campaign to lure customers away from Microsoft Corp and IBM products .

The campaign , which starts Monday in countries including France , Japan and Britain , represents a rare foray by Google into mass - market advertising and underscores increasing competition to provide businesses with email and other office software .
While Microsoft and International Business Machines Corp dominate the market for enterprise email , Google is trying to convince businesses to switch to its so - called cloud - based services , in which software is accessed over the Internet and maintained at Google ’s data centers instead of on a company ’s computers .
Cloud - based services can provide cost and maintenance savings over traditional software , though recent high - profile outages -- including an outage of Google ’s Gmail last month -- have raised questions about the reliability of online software for business users .
Gartner analyst Tom Austin said most businesses will eventually switch to cloud - based email , but the process may take years .
He noted IBM and Microsoft have introduced cloud products recently , and that Cisco Systems Inc appears to be preparing to offer its own cloud - based software .
On Thursday , Google CEO Eric Schmidt told investors during the company ’s quarterly earnings conference call he intended to boost investments in new business initiatives .
Google ’s Apps business -- which the company has said is profitable and generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue a year -- is a tiny portion of Google ’s overall business , which yielded almost $ 22 billion revenue last year .
According to spokesman Andrew Kovacs , its Apps team has doubled over the past year to more than 1,000 employees .
Google said Apps is used by 2 million businesses , up from 1.75 million in June .
Those include both larger businesses that pay $ 50 a year per user for Apps , as well as firms with fewer than 50 employees that get the software for free .
The company also said there are now 20 million active users of Google Apps , up from 15 million in June , although that number included students who use the free version Google provides to universities .
Google ’s marketing campaign , which it first rolled out in the United States in August , will feature ads in publications such as The New York Times , Forbes and The Economist , as well as on billboards at airports and train stations in various cities .
Google Enterprise Product Marketing Director Tom Oliveri would not say how much Google is spending on the campaign , which runs through 2009 .
He said the creative part of the campaign was designed in - house by the Google Creative Lab team led by former Ogilvy & Mather executive Andy Berndt .
A wildlife scientist says people relieving themselves on top of Uluru may have killed off a rare species of shrimp .
Retired university professor Brian Timms says he has studied museum specimens of small inland shrimp that live in pools on top of Uluru .
He says his research shows the localised extinction of one species of fairy shrimp and the dominance of another - changes which could be due to human waste .
" It 's happened already that the people going up the rock somehow have affected the animals which live in the pools , possibly by peeing on the rock and pooing on the rock , " he said .
He says the Branchinella Latzi shrimp species , which once inhabited rock pools on Uluru , has not been found in collections since about the 1970s .
" Latzi is a very limited species and it might be susceptible to enrichment of the pools whereas [ the other species on Uluru ] is a widespread , tough species , " he said .
" Certainly if they [ tourists ] go up , they should be behaving themselves , not pooing on the rock . "
Earlier this month an Uluru tour guide told the ABC that tourists climbing the rock are sometimes defecating at the top because there are no toilets available .
The Director of National Parks continues to assess submissions on a draft management plan for the Uluru - Kata Tjuta National Park , which proposes banning climbers from the rock for cultural , safety and environmental reasons .
When the Macintosh was new , Bruce “ Tog ” Tognazzini wrote a column in Apple ’s developer magazine on UI .
In his column , people wrote in with lots of interesting UI design problems , which he discussed .
These columns continue to this day on his web site .
They ’ve also been collected and embellished in a couple of great books , like Tog on Software Design , which is a lot of fun and a great introduction to UI design .
( Tog on Interface was even better , but it ’s out of print . )
Tog invented the concept of the mile high menu bar to explain why the menu bar on the Macintosh , which is always glued to the top of the physical screen , is so much easier to use than menu bars on Windows , which appear inside each application window .
When you want to point to the File menu on Windows , you have a target about half an inch wide and a quarter of an inch high to acquire .
You must move and position the mouse fairly precisely in both the vertical and the horizontal dimensions .
But on a Macintosh , you can slam the mouse up to the top of the screen , without regard to how high you slam it , and it will stop at the physical edge of the screen – the correct vertical position for using the menu .
So , effectively , you have a target that is still half an inch wide , but a mile high .
Now you only need to worry about positioning the cursor horizontally , not vertically , so the task of clicking on a menu item is that much easier .
Based on this principle , Tog has a pop quiz : what are the five spots on the screen that are easiest to acquire ( point to ) with the mouse ?
The answer : all four corners of the screen ( where you can literally slam the mouse over there in one fell swoop without any pointing at all ) , plus , the current position of the mouse , because it ’s already there .
The principle of the mile - high menu bar is fairly well known , but it must not be entirely obvious , because the Windows 95 team missed the point completely with the Start push button , sitting almost in the bottom left corner of the screen , but not exactly .
In fact , it ’s about 2 pixels away from the bottom and 2 pixels from the left of the screen .
So , for the sake of a couple of pixels , Microsoft literally “ snatches defeat from the jaws of victory ” , Tog writes , and makes it that much harder to acquire the start button .
It could have been a mile square , absolutely trivial to hit with the mouse .
For the sake of something , I do n’t know what , it ’s not .
God help us .
In the previous chapter , we talked about how users hate reading , and will avoid it unless they absolutely cannot accomplish their task .
Similarly :
Users ca n’t control the mouse very well .
I do n’t mean this literally .
What I mean is , you should design your program so that it does not require a tremendous amount of mouse - agility to use it right .
Top six reasons :
Sometimes people are using sub-optimal pointing devices , like trackballs , trackpads , and the little red thingy on a ThinkPad , which are harder to control than true mice .
Sometimes people are using mice under bad conditions : a crowded desk ; a dirty trackball making the mouse skip ; or the mouse itself is a $ 5 clone which just does n’t track right .
Some people are new to computers and have not yet developed the motor skills to use mice accurately .
Some people literally will never have the motor skills to use mice precisely , and never will .
They may have arthritis , tremors , carpal tunnel ; they may be very young or very old ; or any other number of disabilities .
Many people find that it is extremely difficult to double - click without slightly moving the mouse .
As a result they often drag things around on their screen when they mean to be launching applications .
You can tell these people because their desktops are a mess because half the time they try to launch something , they wind up moving it instead .
Even in the best of situations , using the mouse a lot feels slow to people .
If you force people to perform a multi-step operation using the mouse , they may feel like they are being stalled which in turn makes the UI feel unresponsive , which , as you should know by now , makes them unhappy .
In ye olden days when I worked on Excel , laptops did n’t come with pointing devices built in , so Microsoft made a clip - on trackball that clipped to the side of the keyboard .
Now , a mouse is controlled with the wrist and most of the fingers .
This is much like writing , and you probably developed very accurate motor skills for writing in elementary school .
But a trackball is controlled entirely with the thumb .
As a result , it ’s much harder to control a trackball to the same degree of accuracy as a mouse .
Most people find that they can control a mouse to within one or two pixels , but can only control a trackball to within 3 or 4 pixels .
On the Excel team , I always urged people to try out their new UIs with the trackball , instead of only with a mouse , to see how it would feel to people who are not able to get the mouse to go exactly where they want it .
One of the UI elements which bothers me the most is the dropdown combo list box .
That ’s the one that looks like this :
When you click on the down arrow , it expands :
Think about how many detailed mouse clicks it ’s going to take to choose , say , Times New Roman .
First , you have to click on the down arrow .
Then , using the scroll bar , you have to carefully scroll until Times New Roman is in view .
Many of these dropdowns are carelessly designed to show only two or three items at a time , so this scrolling is none too easy , especially if you have a lot of fonts .
It involves either carefully dragging the thumb ( with such a small range of movement , it ’s probably unlikely that this will work ) , or clicking repeatedly on the second down arrow , or trying to click in the area between the thumb and the down area — which will eventually stop working when the thumb gets low enough , annoying you even further .
Finally , if you do manage to get Times New Roman into view , you have to click on it .
If you miss , you get to start all over again .
Now multiply by 10 , if , say , you want to use a fancy font for the first letter in each of your chapters , and you ’re really unhappy .
The poxy combo dropdown control is even more annoying because there ’s such an easy solution : just make the dropdown long enough to contain all of the options .
90 % of the combo boxes out there do n’t even use all available space to drop down , which is a sin .
If there is not enough room between the main edit box and the bottom of the screen , the dropdown should grow up until it fits all the items , even if it has to go all the way from the top of the physical screen to the bottom of the physical screen .
And then , if there are still more items than fit , let the combo scroll automatically as the mouse approaches the edge , rather than requiring the poor user to mess with a teensy weensy scrollbar .
Furthermore , do n’t make me click on the little tiny arrow to the right of the edit box before you pop up the combo : let me click anywhere on the combo box .
This expands the click target about tenfold and makes it that much easier to acquire the target with the mouse pointer .
Let ’s look at another problem with mousing : edit boxes .
You may have noticed that almost every edit box on the Macintosh uses a fat , wide , bold font called Chicago which looks kind of ugly and distresses graphic designers to no end .
Graphic designers ( unlike UI designers ) have been taught that thin , variable spaced fonts are more gracious , look better , and are easier to read .
All this is true .
But graphic designers learned their skills on paper , not on the screen .
When you need to edit text , monospace has a major advantage over variable spaced fonts : it ’s easier to see and select narrow letters like “ l ” and “ i ” .
I learned this lesson after watching a sixty year old man in a usability test painfully trying to edit the name of his street , which was something like Fillmore Street .
We were using 8 point Arial , so the edit box looked like this :
Notice that the I and the Ls are literally one pixel wide .
The difference between a lower case I and a lower case L is literally one pixel .
( Similarly , it is almost impossible to see the difference between “ RN ” and “ M ” in lower case , so this edit box might actually say Fillrnore . )
There are very few people who would notice if they mistyped Flilmore or Fiilmore or Fillrnore , and even if they did , they would have a heck of a time trying to use the mouse to select the offending letter and correct it .
In fact , they would even have a hard time using the blinking cursor , which is two pixels wide , to select a single letter .
Look how much easier it would have been if we had used a fat font ( shown here with Courier Bold )
Fine , OK , so it takes up more space and does n’t look as cool to your graphic designers .
Deal with it !
It ’s much easier to use ; it even feels better to use because as the user types , they get sharp , clear text , and it ’s so much easier to edit .
Here ’s a common programmer thought pattern : there are only three numbers : 0 , 1 , and n .
If n is allowed , all n‘s are equally likely .
This thought pattern comes from the belief ( probably true ) that you should n’t have any numeric constants in your code except for 0 and 1 .
( Constants other than 0 and 1 are referred to as “ magic numbers ” .
I do n’t even want to go into the gestalt of that . )
Thus , for example , programmers tend to think that if your program allows you to open multiple documents , it must allow you to open infinitely many documents ( as memory allows ) , or at least 2^32 , the only magic number programmers concede .
A programmer would tend to look with disdain on a program which limited you to 20 open documents .
What ’s 20 ?
Why 20 ?
It ’s not even a power of 2 !
Another implication of all n’s are equally likely is that programmers have tended to think that if users are allowed to resize and move windows , they should have complete flexibility over where these windows go , right down to the last pixel .
After all , positioning a window 2 pixels from the top of the screen is “ equally likely ” as positioning a window exactly at the top of the screen .
But it ’s not true .
As it turns out , there are lots of good reasons why you might want a window exactly at the top of the screen ( it maximizes screen real estate ) , but there are n’t any reasons to leave 2 pixels between the top of the screen and the top of the window .
So , in reality , 0 is much more likely than 2 .
The programmers over at Nullsoft , creators of WinAmp , managed somehow to avoid the programmer - think that has imprisoned the rest of us for a decade .
WinAmp has a great feature .
When you start to drag the window near the edge of the screen , coming within a few pixels , it automatically snaps to the edge of the screen perfectly .
Which is probably exactly what you wanted , since 0 is so much more likely than 2 .
( The Juno main window has a similar feature : it ’s the only application I ’ve ever seen that is “ locked in a box ” on the screen and cannot be dragged beyond the edge . )
You lose a little bit of flexibility , but in exchange , you get a user interface that recognizes that controlling the mouse precisely is hard , so why should you have to ?
This innovation ( which every program could use ) eases the burden of window management in an intelligent way .
Look closely at your user interface , and give us all a break .
Pretend that we are gorillas , or maybe smart orangutans , and we really have trouble with the mouse .
America 's spy agencies want to read your blog posts , keep track of your Twitter updates – even check out your book reviews on Amazon .
In - Q - Tel , the investment arm of the CIA and the wider intelligence community , is putting cash into Visible Technologies , a software firm that specializes in monitoring social media .
It 's part of a larger movement within the spy services to get better at using " open source intelligence " – information that 's publicly available , but often hidden in the flood of TV shows , newspaper articles , blog posts , online videos and radio reports generated every day .
Visible crawls over half a million web 2.0 sites a day , scraping more than a million posts and conversations taking place on blogs , online forums , Flickr , YouTube , Twitter and Amazon .
( It does n't touch closed social networks , like Facebook , at the moment . )
Customers get customized , real - time feeds of what 's being said on these sites , based on a series of keywords .
" That 's kind of the basic step – get in and monitor , " says company senior vice president Blake Cahill .
Then Visible " scores " each post , labeling it as positive or negative , mixed or neutral .
It examines how influential a conversation or an author is .
( " Trying to determine who really matters , " as Cahill puts it . )
Finally , Visible gives users a chance to tag posts , forward them to colleagues and allow them to response through a web interface .
In - Q - Tel says it wants Visible to keep track of foreign social media , and give spooks " early - warning detection on how issues are playing internationally , " spokesperson Donald Tighe tells Danger Room .
Of course , such a tool can also be pointed inward , at domestic bloggers or tweeters .
Visible already keeps tabs on web 2.0 sites for Dell , AT&T and Verizon .
For Microsoft , the company is monitoring the buzz on its Windows 7 rollout .
For Spam - maker Hormel , Visible is tracking animal - right activists ' online campaigns against the company .
" Anything that is out in the open is fair game for collection , " says Steven Aftergood , who tracks intelligence issues at the Federation of American Scientists .
But " even if information is openly gathered by intelligence agencies it would still be problematic if it were used for unauthorized domestic investigations or operations .
Intelligence agencies or employees might be tempted to use the tools at their disposal to compile information on political figures , critics , journalists or others , and to exploit such information for political advantage .
That is not permissible even if all of the information in question is technically ' open source . ' "
Visible chief executive officer Dan Vetras says the CIA is now an " end customer , " thanks to the In - Q - Tel investment .
And more government clients are now on the horizon .
" We just got awarded another one in the last few days , " Vetras adds .
Tighe disputes this – sort of .
" This contract , this deal , this investment has nothing to do with any agency of government and this company , " he says .
But Tighe quickly notes that In - Q - Tel does have " an interested end customer " in the intelligence community for Visibile .
And if all goes well , the company 's software will be used in pilot programs at that agency .
" In pilots , we use real data .
And during the adoption phase , we use it real missions . "
Neither party would disclose the size of In - Q - Tel 's investment in Visible , a 90 - person company with expected revenues of about $ 20 million in 2010 .
But a source familiar with the deal says the In - Q - Tel cash will be used to boost Visible 's foreign languages capabilities , which already include Arabic , French , Spanish and nine other languages .
Visible has been trying for nearly a year to break into the government field .
In late 2008 , the company teamed up with the Washington , DC , consulting firm Concepts & Strategies , which has handled media monitoring and translation services for U.S. Strategic Command and the Joint Chiefs of Staff , among others .
On its website , Concepts & Strategies is recruiting " social media engagement specialists " with Defense Department experience and a high proficiency in Arabic , Farsi , French , Urdu or Russian .
The company is also looking for an " information system security engineer " who already has a " Top Secret SCI [ Sensitive Compartmentalized Information ] with NSA Full Scope Polygraph " security clearance .
The intelligence community has been interested in social media for years .
In - Q - Tel has sunk money into companies like Attensity , which recently announced its own web 2.0 - monitoring service .
The agencies have their own , password - protected blogs and wikis – even a MySpace for spooks .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence maintains an Open Source Center , which combs publicly available information , including web 2.0 sites .
Doug Naquin , the Center 's Director , told an audience of intelligence professionals in October 2007 that " we 're looking now at YouTube , which carries some unique and honest - to - goodness intelligence … .
We have groups looking at what they call ' citizens media ' : people taking pictures with their cell phones and posting them on the internet .
Then there 's social media , phenomena like MySpace and blogs . "
But , " the CIA specifically needs the help of innovative tech firms to keep up with the pace of innovation in social media .
Experienced IC [ intelligence community ] analysts may not be the best at detecting the incessant shift in popularity of social - networking sites .
They need help in following young international internet user - herds as they move their allegiance from one site to another , " Lewis Shepherd , the former senior technology officer at the Defense Intelligence Agency , says in an e-mail .
" Facebook says that more than 70 percent of its users are outside the U.S. , in more than 180 countries .
There are more than 200 non-U.S. , non-English - language microblogging Twitter - clone sites today .
If the intelligence community ignored that tsunami of real - time information , we 'd call them incompetent . "

NASCAR Driver Hits Coyote At 190 MPH [ Pictures ]
Total Pro Sports –
You thought those Coyotes in Phoenix were in bad shape ?
Wait till you see what happened to this one , luckily Alex Ovechkin of the Washington Capitals can speak about his near death experience after almost being decapitated .
Brad Coleman , a driver for Joe Gibbs racing was traveling at 190 mph when he saw a coyote a mere 100 feet away .
With no possible way of slowing down to save the creature , the driver ran it over .
To his suprise he could n’t figure our where it went .
He describes the incident ,
“ It just started smoking like crazy .
And it smelled terrible .
I did n’t see anything in the mirror , so I was like , ‘ I wonder where it went ? ’ ” .
It turns out where it went had alot to do with that terrible smell as the coyote and car were fused into one superbeing .
All jokes aside these are some pretty gruesome pictures , and some claim may even be fake .
The coyote did n’t win this one , but nothing will ever will top Nascar ’s Carlos Pardo who died in a freak accident and still managed to win the race .
A representative from Joe Gibbs racing was able to confirm the incident did in fact happen but was unable to verify the pictures .
Looks like this coyote bit off more then it could chew , should have went to see a women ’s tennis match or something with fewer speeding cars .
So we would like to hear from you .
Do you think these photos are real or fake ?
Leave your comment below , thanks .

What do you do when you ’re stuck in a rut ?
Is doing the same , old same - old really good enough ?
The answer can be found in entertainment , at least if you ’re willing to go along with the flow and accept something very different .
In a world that seems like it ’s full of very similar knock - off movies and teevee shows based on proven formulas , there is one place where creative people found themselves uninterested in just doing the same things over and over , and that ’s in animation .
There may be a lesson there for everyone who finds that what they ’ve been doing for a long time may not be good enough anymore .
When I was a kid , cartoons were more or less terrible .
We had our Saturday diet of Warner Brothers cartoons , but they were 20 - 40 years old by then .
The quality of cartoons being produced in the 1970s was extremely low , and we knew it .
The best we had going for us was “ Speed Racer ” , which had a different feel to it but absolutely terrible production quality .
The industry was simply dying .
Just when animation seemed dead , a lot of forces started to converge on it .
The most important came from Japanese anime , where the art of storytelling in cartoon form lived on with great style .
The stories were not particularly accessible to American audiences , being full of spirits and sword - wielding heroes in the samurai tradition – but they were captivating .
The gradual import these to a small but eager audience was the first sign that cartoons might be more than we had come to expect .
Eventually , the delightful works of Miyazaki made their way over and a larger audience was hooked .
Cartoons were hitting the big time .
The other infusion of hope came from no less than Disney , who brought Broadway tunes and a loving hand to “ Beauty and the Beast ” and “ The Little Mermaid ” .
These were made for a mass audience from the start , and they proved their worth immediately .
They were still seen as kid stuff by most people , but the love that was put into the stories was obvious .
Last , there was the development of CGI or computer - made graphics .
“ Toy Story ” was the first major picture to use this , baring making the grade of “ major ” by clocking in at a laboriously crafted 70 minutes .
But it was captivating , and it was a hit .
It was such a big hit that John Lasseter of Pixar was able to cash in big when Disney bought him out – and he used part of his gain to bring even more of his beloved Miyazaki movies to the US .
Once we had “ My Neighbor Totoro ” , there was no turning back .
That ’s not to say that each of these genres has n’t found its own rut in its own time .
Many of the anime shows that make it to Cartoon Network are still full of the Technicolor Shinto and Samurai of the traditional anime world in ways that seem a bit derivative .
But somewhere along the line , wonderful things started to happen .
I had the great pleasure of showing my kids the delightful “ Cowboy BeBop ” this weekend .
This is an anime that crosses all lines in ways that are as captivating as life itself .
It ’s a sci - fi epic set around 2070 , where humans have colonized the whole solar system and created a lawless western society .
At its heart it ’s a noir epic , a world that Bogart would recognize easily , but in the end it ’s actually a romance that turns on an existential examination of the meaning of life itself .
My third trip through it still blows my mind .
The influence of BeBop can be seen in Nickelodeon ’s “ Avatar : The Last Airbender ” .
It also crosses genre lines without a care as easily as it crosses cultural boundaries .
The fact that a generation of kids is being raised on this stuff , rather than old Bugs Bunny retreads , gives me great hope .
They are n’t going to take the same old answers to anything if it really sinks in .
Why is this important ?
It ’s an illustration of the great power of simple connections stirring innovation .
When things are starting to become stale , innovation can come from an amazing variety of places that you do n’t expect it to as people start to make connections that refresh their world .
Traditions from other nations , new technologies , and a recommitment to the fundamentals were all part of the development of what we know as animation today .
The result is a new product , unimaginable just a few decades ago , that has a large and engaged audience .
Animations have become a staple of most movie studios , with several marking each summer ’s big hits .
It ’s not as though one person sat down and said , “ I ’m going to completely re-innovate animation . ”
The process was a bit slow at times , and influences came from very different sources .
In a way , most of the pieces were lying around waiting for someone to start putting them together in new ways .
What matters is that they were put together , starting whole new industries in an area that 30 years ago seemed absolutely dead .
I think that animation is a great lesson in what happens when the same , old same - old becomes tired and inadequate .
Innovation is often as simple as looking around at what you have and daring to do something different with it .
It ’s all about making connections between things that seem strange and inaccessible , or even totally unrelated .
That seems to be a good roadmap for how a lot of industries and professions might re-invigorate themselves in a changing world .

The email reads ,
My husband is in debtor ’s prison , and he is not alone .
The court has him in custody until he pays a $ 15,000 cash bond .
We have no money or property .
Unless we get help , he could be there for the remainder of his life .
While imprisonment for debt was eliminated in this country in the 19th century , it has re-emerged under a new name : contempt of court .
A defendant is deemed “ in contempt ” if they do not pay a court ordered debt , regardless of their ability to pay .
The punishment : they are stripped of their liberty and sit in jail , at the taxpayer ’s expense , until and unless money is found to purchase their release .
If my husband had raped a woman he would be entitled to a trial by an impartial jury .
He does not enjoy that right as a debtor .
If my husband had sold drugs to children he would be entitled to legal representation .
He does not enjoy that right as a debtor .
If my husband had molested a child , he would be subject to no more than a maximum sentence allowed by the law .
As a debtor he can be held for the rest of his life .
If my husband had robbed a bank he would be entitled to one phone call upon arrest .
He did not get this opportunity and we had no communication until the 7th day of his incarceration .
The United States Constitution guarantees the right to bankruptcy .
We went through this process but were effectually denied our right to the remedy of bankruptcy when his debt was deemed “ non-dischargable . ”
Additionally , I believe his 1st , 5th , 6th , and 14th amendment rights are being violated .
His freedom has been stripped .
This is not the United States of America of which I was taught to be a proud citizen as a child .
I write not only on my husband ’s behalf , but also for the thousands of other Americans who sit in jail for the simple “ crime ” of not being able to pay their debts .
How sad for this country when these words , written over 250 years ago , are known to ring true in modern America :
" Since poverty is punished among us as a crime , it ought at least to be reated with the same lenity as other crimes : the offender ought not to languish at the will of him whom he has offended , but to be allowed some appeal to the justice of his country .
There can be no reason why any debtor should be imprisoned , but that he may be compelled to payment ; and a term should therefore be fixed , in which the creditor should exhibit his accusation of concealed property .
If such property can be discovered , let it be given to the creditor ; if the charge is not offered , or can not be proved , let the prisoner be dismissed . "

I received the following email from a heartbroken and understandably enraged wife whose husband languishes in America 's version of a debtor 's prison .
No one knows how many people -- almost all of them men -- are being held indefinitely on contempt of civil court charges for which they do not have the due process protections offered to those accused of a criminal offense -- no right to a trial , an attorney , an appeal ... no due process .
Most of these imprisonments are for non-compliance with court ordered child support or alimony .
It does not matter if the man is unable to comply due to poverty -- e.g. from losing his job ; he can be imprisoned anyway until he " pays up . "
For an analysis of the plight of these prisoners who languish in jail without ever being arrested , tried or accorded Constitutional rights , please see my article " The Return of Debtor 's Prison . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Merck & Co ’s Gardasil vaccine appears to be safe and effective in preventing genital warts in young men and boys , a U.S. medical reviewer said in documents released on Friday .
A U.S. Food and Drug Administration staff reviewer said the company ’s data showed the vaccine , already approved for use in girls and young women , was effective in preventing the warts caused by certain strains of the human papillomavirus .
The company is seeking the FDA ’s permission to market Gardasil for males between 9 and 26 years old , the same age rage currently approved for females .
The FDA released the staffer ’s memo ahead of an advisory panel meeting on Wednesday to discuss whether to approve the new use .
The agency usually follows its panelists ’ recommendations .
The FDA posted the documents on its websitehere
The gloves are coming off .
Although the RIAA already won a $ 675,000 judgment against student Joel Tenenbaum over 30 songs shared on P2P networks , the recording industry has a fixation with going the extra mile against infringers .
It is asking courts to issue injunctions against repeated infringement for both Tenenbaum and Jammie Thomas - Rasset , the only other file - sharing defendant to go to trial in the US .
In a new filing with the Massachusetts federal court , RIAA lawyers rail against Tenenbaum 's " repeated lies and continued infringement , " saying that " it is likely Defendant will continue to infringe and / or act in concert with others in committing online copyright infringement of Plaintiffs ’ sound recordings , especially given that he is currently promoting the online copyright infringement by countless others . "
What are they talking about ?
Well , Tenenbaum 's appearance on The Pirate Bay 's front page , for one thing .
Last month , the Bay was hawking a . torrent file of all 30 songs at issue in the case , labeling it " DJ Joel : The $ 675,000 Mixtape . "
Tenenbaum 's team told Ars some time ago that he had no notice of or involvement with the torrent .
What his team did do was issue a tweet saying , " Interesting : a ' joel ' torrent list of the 30 songs is now on thepirateBay / other torrent sites and is being DL widely in protest . "
That tweet , says the recording industry , is evidence that Tenenbaum continues to promote copyright infringement .
Now , it did n't help that Tenenbaum lied to the industry several times ( and admitted that he had done so in court ) , or that he continued to use P2P apps long after having a federal copyright lawsuit filed against him .
It also did n't help that his legal team uploaded the songs at issue in the case to a file - hosting website , and Harvard Law prof ( and Tenenbaum lead lawyer ) Charles Nesson posted the username and password to his blog .
The reaction of Judge Nancy Gertner was predictable ; at the time , she chided Nesson , saying , " The Court 's indulgence is at an end .
Too often , as described below , the important issues in this case have been overshadowed by the tactics of defense counsel : taping opposing counsel without permission ( and in violation of the law ) , posting recordings of court communications and emails with potential experts ( who have rejected the positions counsel asserts ) on the Internet , and now allegedly replicating the acts that are the subject of this lawsuit , namely uploading the copyrighted songs that the Defendant is accused of file - sharing . "
The RIAA wants an injunction against Tenenbaum , but the fact that his team tweeted once about his appearance on one of the most - trafficked front pages on the Web seems a pretty thin reason to argue that he continues to flaunt both the court and copyright law .
Still , when your own legal team passes out the copyrighted songs in question " with an image of Defendant ’s counsel and the statement ' Destroy Capitalism - Support Piracy ' " beneath it , it 's no wonder the industry gets a little hot under the collar .
For better or worse , our American Idiocracy has come to rely on athletes as national pedagogues .
Michael Jordan educated the country about commitment and just doing it .
A.C. Green lectured us about sexual caution .
Serena Williams and John McEnroe taught us what sportsmanship is — and is not .
And Charles Barkley outlined how society should define role models .
So when a single week like this one sees both the Justice Department back states ’ medical marijuana laws and a Gallup poll show record - level support for pot legalization , we can look to two superjocks — Lance Armstrong and Michael Phelps — for the key lesson about our absurd drug policy .
This Tale of Two Supermen began in February when Phelps , the gold - medal swimmer , was plastered all over national newspapers in a photo that showed him hitting a marijuana bong .
Though he was smoking in private , the image ignited a public firestorm .
USA Swimming suspended Phelps , Kellogg pulled its endorsement deal and The Associated Press sensationalized the incident as a national issue about whether heroes should “ be perfect or flawed . ”
The alleged imperfection was Phelps ’ decision to quietly consume a substance that “ poses a much less serious public health problem than is currently posed by alcohol , ” as a redacted World Health Organization report admits .
That ’s a finding confirmed by almost every objective science - based analysis , including a landmark University of California study in 2006 showing “ no association at all ” between marijuana use and cancer .
Alcohol , by contrast , causes roughly 1 in 30 of the world ’s cancer cases , according to the International Journal of Cancer .
And a new report by the Cancer Epidemiology journal shows that even beer , seemingly the least potent drink , may increase the odds of developing tumors .
Which brings us to Armstrong .
This month , the Tour de France champion who beat cancer inked a contract to hawk Anheuser - Busch ’s alcohol .
That ’s right , less than a year after Phelps was crucified for merely smoking weed in private , few noticed or protested the planet ’s most famous cancer survivor becoming the public face of a possible carcinogen .
“ Apparently , it ’s perfectly acceptable for a world - class athlete to endorse a substance like alcohol that contributes to thousands of deaths each year , as well as hundreds of thousands of violent crimes and injuries , ” says Mason Tvert , a co-author of the new book “ Marijuana Is Safer . ”
“ Yet a world - class athlete like Michael Phelps is ridiculed , punished and forced to apologize for marijuana , the use of which contributes to zero deaths , and has never been linked to violent or reckless behavior .
Why the double standard ? ”
The data prove the answer is n’t about health , and our culture proves it is n’t about widespread allegiance to “ Just Say No ” abstinence .
After all , whether through liquor commercials , wine magazines , beer - named stadiums or cocktail - drenched office parties , our society is constantly encouraging us to get our liquid high .
No , the double standard is about know - nothing statutes and attitudes promoting the recreational use of alcohol and banning the similar use of marijuana — all thanks to retrograde mythologies of post - ’60s Americana .
In our now - dominant backlash folklore , the patriots are the strait - laced Joe and Jane Sixpacks — and the Armstrongs who encourage their drinking .
Meanwhile , the supposed evildoers are the pot-smoking Cheeches , Chongs and Phelpses , whose marijuana use allegedly underscores a dangerous hippie -ness .
Ergo , the moral of this Tale of Two Supermen :
To end contradictions in narcotics policy and permit safer recreational drug choices , we have to first reject the outdated Silent - Majority - versus - Counterculture iconography that defines so much of our politics .
We must , in other words , replace caricatures with scientific facts and mature into something more than an Idiocracy .
We should all be able to imbibe — or inhale — to that .

Reporting on the ratings rivalry between the Fox News Channel ( FNC ) and CNN is often misleading — and almost always over - hyped .
“ Fox Tops CNN as Choice for Cable News , ” declared one typical headline ( Chicago Tribune , 3/24/03 ) .
“ Fox News Channel Continues to Crush CNN , ” reported Knight Ridder ( Dallas Morning News , 2/3/04 ) in a column comparing the rivalry to a party primary : “ Fox News Channel is winning the Nielsen caucuses . ”
Last summer ( 8/17/03 ) , the New York Times Magazine declared , looking back at the period of the Iraq invasion , “ Fox was — and still is — trouncing CNN in the ratings . ”
After exposure to countless similar stories published since January 2002 , when Fox was reported to have surpassed CNN in the Nielsen ratings , one might naturally conclude that Fox has more viewers than CNN .
But it ’s not true .
On any given day , more people typically tune to CNN than to Fox .
So what are the media reports talking about ?
With few exceptions , stories about the media business report a single number for ratings ( often expressed two different ways — as “ points ” or “ share ” ) .
This number is often presented as if it were the result of a popularity contest or a democratic vote .
But it is actually the average number of viewers watching a station or a show in a typical minute , based on Nielsen Media Research ’s monitoring of thousands of households .
The average is arrived at by counting viewers every minute .
Heavy viewers — those who tune in to a station and linger there — have a greater impact , as they can be counted multiple times as they watch throughout the day .
When an outlet reports that CNN is trailing Fox , they are almost invariably using this average tally , which Fox has been winning for the past two years .
For the year 2003 , Nielsen ’s average daily ratings show Fox beating CNN 1.02 million viewers to 665,000 .
But there is another important number collected by Nielsen ( though only made available to the firm ’s clients ) that tells another story .
This is the “ cume , ” the cumulative total number of viewers who watch a channel for at least six minutes during a given day .
Unlike the average ratings number the media usually report , this number gives the same weight to the light viewer , who tunes in for a brief time , as it does to the heavy viewer .
How can CNN have more total viewers when Fox has such a commanding lead in average viewers ?
Conventional industry wisdom is that CNN viewers tune in briefly to catch up on news and headlines , while Fox viewers watch longer for the opinion and personality - driven programming .
Because the smaller total number of Fox viewers are watching more hours , they show up in the ratings as a higher average number of viewers .
CNN regularly claims a cume about 20 percent higher than Fox ‘s ( Deseret Morning News , 1/12/04 ) .
For instance , in April 2003 , during the height of the fighting in Iraq , CNN ‘s cume was significantly higher than Fox ‘s : 105 million viewers tuned into CNN compared to 86 million for Fox ( Cablefax , 4/30/03 ) .
But in the same period , the ratings reported by most media outlets had Fox in the lead , with an average of 3.5 million viewers to CNN ‘s 2.2 million .
Even among
Fox ‘s core audience of conservatives , CNN has an edge in total viewership .
A study by the ad agency Carat USA ( Hollywood Reporter , 8/13/03 ) found that 37 percent of viewers calling themselves “ very conservative ” watch CNN in the course of a week , while only 32 percent tune to Fox .
Show me the money
Journalists who publish Nielsen numbers ought to explain that the data are not simply measures of popularity , and they are not produced as a service to journalists or the public .
The figures are gathered to provide advertisers with complex data about viewer habits .
It pays to remember that neither cable news stations nor Nielsen Media Research are primarily in the business of serving the public interest — both are in the business of delivering audiences to advertisers .
Advertisers would rather see larger numbers of viewers see each ad a few times than have a smaller number watch the ad over and over again .
But having a large number of viewers tune in for so short a period of time that they see very few ads is not desirable either .
As Sherrill Maine , CNN ‘s senior vice president of marketing , was quoted in the Cablefax ( 1/26/03 ) : “ We ’d like Fox ‘s [ average ] ratings ; Fox would like our cume . ”
But in the race between these two for - profit ventures , the bottom line is the bottom line :
From their capitalistic perspective , the channel that gets more ad revenue is winning the real ratings war .
Earnings for the two channels are a contentious subject — since neither network reports its revenues separate from its corporate parent , and each claims to earn more income than its rival .
But many industry analysts say CNN still makes more money .
Stock analyst Michael Gallant told the Chicago Tribune ( 11/28/03 ) that while Fox is growing faster , CNN is still earning about $ 200 million more per year than Fox ( Television Week , 10/20/03 ) .
Furthermore , CNN apparently continues to command higher ad rates , or CPM .
CPM stands for “ cost per thousand ” ( using the Roman numeral ) , the price a television outlet charges advertisers per thousand television households reached by a commercial .
Though Fox began claiming to have reached CPM parity with CNN last summer , CNN chair Jim Walton insisted that CNN ‘s rate was still 40 percent higher ( Television Week , 7/14/03 ) .
In interviews with Extra ! , ad buyers for three different firms ( all of whom declined to be named ) confirmed that CNN continues to command a higher CPM , though their estimates of the gap in prices was less than half that quoted by Walton .
One of the reasons for CNN ‘s lead in CPM , according to the buyers , is the advertiser preference for lighter viewers .
Such viewers tend to come from the most desirable demographics — younger , busier , more free - spending — and because they ’re harder to reach with ads , the law of supply and demand drives their cost up .
One media buyer we interviewed analyzed the contrast between Fox and CNN in terms of programming and viewing habits , telling Extra ! : “ CNN is like news radio where people drop in for the news ;
Fox is like talk radio , where they stay longer for the opinion shows . ”
An ad executive interviewed in Media Week last year ( 2/10/03 ) suggested that snob appeal was part of CNN ‘s edge in the race for ad dollars : “ There are two kinds of news advertisers .
If you ’re talking cold remedies , you ’re buying eyeballs .
Others are looking for an environment , an image .
They ’re looking to reach decision - makers and influencers who watch news .
If you ’re an image - oriented product — a BMW , Mercedes , Lexus — it ’s not even a question , you go with CNN .
There ’s no comparison in the quality of the journalism — CNN is light years ahead in objectivity and reporting — and I do n’t think Fox ‘s ‘ New York Post on TV ’ approach appeals to the most desirable consumers . ”
Fox vs. everyone else
Fox News Channel , then , is so far neither the choice of most people who watch cable news , nor the more successful business model .
But the perception that Fox is “ trouncing ” CNN — based largely on the fact that the number Nielsen releases to the public emphasizes heavy viewers — is of great use to Fox , which trumpets these ratings as a vindication of its partisan , “ fair & balanced ” approach to the news .
Reacting to a guest ’s charge that Fox had a right - wing bias , Brian Kilmeade , co-host of the successful Fox & Friends morning show ( 2/25/03 ) , boasted : “ Then what does that say about the country when they made us No. 1 ? ”
But even in the limited sense of average hourly watchers , Fox is only No. 1 among 24 - hour cable news channels .
Fox , like CNN , now reaches about 4 of every 5 television households , so comparisons with broadcast news shows are increasingly valid .
And among all television news sources , Fox ‘s performance is nothing to brag about .
The O’Reilly Factor is the best - rated show on Fox , with about 2 million viewers a night ( Daily Variety , 12/5/03 ) .
CBS Evening News , the least - watched broadcast network evening news show , routinely gets four or five times as big an audience , and that ’s seen as a ratings disaster .
Fox ‘s flagship news show , Special Report with Brit Hume , gets a million viewers on a good night - a few thousand more than the local newscast of New York City ’s WNBC ( Hollywood Reporter , 10/1/03 ; Nielsen ) .
Fox likes to position itself as the alternative to all the other news that ’s on TV .
As Fox News president Roger Ailes likes to claim ( New York Times , 6/24/01 ) , “ If we look conservative , it ’s because the other guys are so far to the left . ”
If it ’s true that news can be put into two categories —
Fox and everything else — then when Special Report airs , everything else beats
Fox by at least 30 to one .
SIDEBAR :
Defeating the Brussels Bureau
“ Someday , ” [ CNN news chief Walter Isaacson ] adds , “ a more crass corporate management than the kind we have now wo n’t get it .
They ’ll say , ‘ You ’ve got 40 bureaus .
They have four .
You have a thousand journalists .
They do n’t . ’
They ’ll say , ‘ Geraldo parachuting in somewhere gets better ratings than having a bureau .
Why not go that route ? ' ”
Replies Fox ‘s [ VP for advertising Paul ] Rittenberg , “ The day will come when we ’ll catch up [ in ad sales ] .
And then how will they justify their business model ?
How will they not cut the Brussels bureau ? ” — American Journalism Review ( 4/03 )
Rep. Nadler on Fox , Sen .
Whitehouse on MSNBC agree , no legal choice but to investigate torture allegations , wherever they may lead ...
Ernest A. Canning Byon 9/4/2009 , 1:40 pm PT
Guest blogged by Ernest A. Canning
Former U.S. Attorney and Rhode Island Attorney General Sen. Sheldon
Whitehouse ( D - RI ) recently wrote in National Law Journal :
The judicial branch ... has determined that waterboarding is torture ... The Bush administration has admitted to waterboarding captives .
The corpus delicti of that crime exists .
For there to be investigation now is unexceptional .
The only exceptional thing is the parties involved : the former vice president of the United States , his counsel David Addington , Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) lawyer John Yoo and their private contractors Bruce Jessen and Jim Mitchell , psychologists who designed the torture program .
During a Sept. 2 , 2009 segment of MSNBC's Countdown , Keith Olbermann interviewed Whitehouse about his National Law Journal piece ( video below ) and quoted former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , who praised Attorney General Eric Holder 's appointment of a special prosecutor to investigate CIA employees who exceeded the guidelines contained in the infamous Office of Legal Counsel ( OLC ) torture memos .
Olbermann 's interview included a Fox " News " segment in which Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D - NY ) was cut - off by a Fox anchor while making the following crucial point ...
The law says very clearly that it is the obligation of the attorney general to investigate , to see whether crimes were committed any time there is torture under American jurisdiction .
He must do that .
If he did n’t do that he’d be breaking the law .
My criticism of the attorney general is that he should not limit the investigation to people in the field who may have committed the torture , but to people who may have ordered it , such as the Vice President ...
He was then abruptly interrupted by the Fox interviewer .
Anyone who has read my five - part series , " History of CIA Torture : Unraveling the Web of Deceit " ( Part I , Part II , Part III , Part IV & Part V ) , will understand why I welcome recognition by these two members of Congress of Holder 's legal obligation to " look back " as part of a criminal investigation of any and all individuals who either authorized , conspired to commit or committed torture .
But that recognition falls short of a full understanding of the scope of CIA torture and the direct and immediate role that Congress should play in restoring the rule of law .
Whitehouse 's assessment that the corpus delicti , essentially the body of a crime , is already established and that an investigation of all who may be implicated in ordering , conspiring , or committing torture is " unexceptional " should carry a great deal of weight given that Sen .
Whitehouse previously served as the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island and also served as a United States attorney .
What is troubling , however , is that Whitehouse 's suggestion that psychologists * Jessen and Mitchell " designed the torture program " reflects that a sitting United States Senator does not realize that the CIA techniques were not first developed when the Bush / Cheney regime called upon these two psychologists to " reverse engineer " the military 's Survival Resistance , Evasion & Escape ( SERE ) techniques .
The CIA 's development and application of CIA torture techniques occurred over a span of nearly sixty ( 60 ) years , dating back to the 13 - year , multi-billion dollar project to crack the code of human consciousness , which culminated in the CIA 's 1963 KUBARK torture manual .
Whitehouse would do well to read my five part series on the " History of CIA Torture , " as well as the more extended academic studies , like Prof .
Alfred McCoy's A Question of Torture : CIA Interrogation , from the Cold War to the War on Terror .
In his National Law Journal piece , Whitehouse writes :
There is substantial evidence of a back channel between Addington and Yoo .
It is not yet clear what information or instructions passed along that back channel .
It does appear to have sidelined regular chains of reporting , including the attorney general .
Investigation would determine whether this was communication or conspiracy .
I dealt with this issue in Part I , though I included two names Whitehouse overlooks :
The Levin Report reflects that the torture memos were issued by the OLC ’s Jay Bybee only “ after consultation with senior Administration attorneys , including then White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales and then - Counsel to the Vice President David Addington . ”
This seemingly innocuous notation says a great deal .
As revealed by Jane Mayer ’s July 3 , 2006 New Yorker article , " The Hidden Power , ” the former Vice President and his chief legal counsel ... David Addington were the driving force behind the Bush regime 's unprecedented claims of dictatorial executive powers .
Under Whitehouse 's analysis , this makes Gonzales , as well as Addington , a potential co-conspirator .
It provides context for Gonzales ' praise of Holder 's decision to appoint a special prosecutor who would look only at those who exceeded these sham quasi-legal memos .
That praise for the decision to only go after " a few bad apples " reflects a desire to save his own skin .
Though the next day , Gonzales completely flip - flopped on his original statement , " I think it is legitimate to question and examine that conduct to ensure people are held accountable for their actions " to completely reverse the record by asserting : " I do n’t support the investigation by the department because this is a matter that has already been reviewed thoroughly . "
But in pointing only to Holder 's duty to prosecute , both Nadler and Whitehouse overlook the responsibility that Congress has in this matter .
Jay Bybee is a sitting judge on the federal appellate bench .
Nadler , as a member of the House Judiciary Committee , is in a position to initiate articles of impeachment .
Why has n't he , or any other member of the progressive caucus , done so ?
Finally , I would reiterate what I said in Part V as it relates not only to Cheney 's role in torture but in the establishment of an executive assassination wing , ostensibly to kill senior al - Qaeda leadership , though , given that it was kept secret even from Congress , there can be no guarantee that a ruthless and duplicitous authoritarian like Cheney would not put it to other use :
While Professor Turley was correct when he noted Holder 's chiseling special prosecutor offer negates the principles our nation followed at Nuremberg , the failure to hold those who ordered these war crimes accountable , especially Cheney , has far more sinister implications .
It amounts to nothing less than to establish a precedent that a President or Vice President can get away with cold blooded murder .
It renders hollow any claim our current President and Attorney General can make that we are a nation of laws .
It reinstates a long discarded principle that " the King can do not wrong , " and it betrays the core principle of equal justice under the law , which generations of Americans have fought and died to preserve .

The September 2nd MSNBC interview with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse --- including a snippet from the interrupted Fox " News " interview with Rep. Jerrold Nadler --- follows below ...
UPDATE 09/06/09 :
In an op - ed published today in The New York Times former FBI Agent Ali Soufan noted that the torture apologists were " fast running out of classified documents to hide behind .
The three that were released recently by the C.I.A ... fail to show that the techniques stopped even a single imminent threat . "
Soufan described the so - called " enhanced interrogation " program ( a euphemism for " torture " ) " ineffective , unreliable , unnecessary and destructive . "
It was more than that .
It was a crime which should be investigated and punished like any other crime .
We are either a nation of laws or a nation where the King can do no wrong .
The rule of law can be preserved only where there is equal justice for all .

Our society is very fond of the idea that we are enlightened .
We are scientific , progressive , compassionate humanity .
Underneath this veneer of nice , the usual manipulations go on for personal profit — which is the underlying theme of humanity in every age : sacrifice the self for the whole , or sacrifice the whole for the self .
However , in order to keep the sheep and goats in line , we form pleasant fictions in order to compensate , and from this we get our inflated self - image .
We did not start out overrated ourselves ; we did it in response to one too many incidents of humans failing themselves .
Our society is also very fond of the idea that we have done away with superstition , and replaced it with modern science , including Darwin ’s natural selection .
But what if superstition just changed names , so that when we batted the old away , its falling reveals a new face on the same mentality ?
To make this concrete , let me ask you what you think of this political party ’s chances in the 2012 elections :
THE DARWIN PARTY OF AMERICA
Our platform : * We feel no obligation to any other nations or the U.N .
* We will push aside and occupy the territory of any nation near us which is lower in average IQ or less organized , more corrupt or less militarily strong .
* Our state will have no welfare .
Instead , there will be rigorous competition at all levels .
* Those who cannot pull their weight because they are deformed , retarded or disabled will be left to die .
* We will maintain a distinct plumage , and a high - degree of third cousin inbreeding , so we resemble each other and can defend each other as a group .
* Meritocracy will replace bureaucracy .
The only criterion for someone ’s choice for a position is how competent they are .
* We will not have prisons .
Violators will either be killed by the public or exiled from our lands .
Darwinism , or natural selection , works because it always puts those with the best abilities ahead .
This way , you do n’t need an authoritarian “ nanny state ” making sure we all make it through .
The Darwin Party is based on the idea that we should not all make it through — only the best should survive .
How well do you think this party would do in a democracy ?
Pretty poorly , indeed .
Our modern society is based on the idea of pity .
It starts with self - pity , when we ’re afraid we personally cannot compete or do not have a place .
That extends to group pity , when we figure out that if we pity someone worse off than ourselves , we benefit because if their extreme situation becomes acceptable our less extreme situation does as well .
This is the psychology of modern society : band together to protect our least competent members , so that each of us feels we are protected by that rule .
It ’s that old superstition — “ the meek will inherit the earth ” and “ we are all equal in the eyes of God ” — but with a new face , is n’t it ?
Each time I see someone committing an act of murder against the environment , I think : there is someone who probably should not be alive , because this destructive act is the height of their competence .
Each time I see someone bungling a simple task — driving , home care , a logical argument — I realize that somewhere out there is a society where they have n’t made bungling politically correct , and they will eventually dominate us .
Because they play by Darwin ’s rules , even if our secular superstition has made Darwin taboo .
How do giant corporations , rapacious overlords and bad politicians gain power ?
They appeal to masses of people who fear for their own competence , reach out with pity , and then manipulate them just the same .
Some will say that I have not defined “ competence ” very well here .
In a universal sense , it is a word like the Darwinian “ adaptation ” which is so vague yet has such concrete incarnations that it ’s nearly impossible to define .
Competence is the process of understanding your world , understanding what you need to do it in to survive at your level of competence , and then staying organized and diligent to do it , including a level of raw ability .
We do n’t see much of that these days .
Get the credit card , the wide - screen TV , and the optional job , and you can just space out in your own little world — and attack anyone who tells you you ’re being selfish .
The overlords do n’t care .
Your dysfunction gives them problems which they gain power by fixing .
Your incompetence keeps them in power .
It ’s a curious little human world where , having come to our intelligence level by Darwinism , we have decided life is too frustrating to think outside of the herd , and so we create toys and social games , but never look too deeply into the human beast , because that ’s where we ’ll find the future date with reality that ’s going to re-affirm Darwinian natural selection .

Remember the day you got a brand - new computer ?
Applications snapped open , processes that once took minutes finished in seconds , and graphics and animation flowed as smoothly as TV video .
But several months and many new applications later , the bloom fell off the rose .
Your lightning - fast computer no longer was fast .
You needed more memory and faster processors to handle the gigabytes of new files now embedded in your machine .
Climate scientists can relate .
They , too , need more powerful computers to process the sophisticated computer models used in climate forecasts .
Such an expanded capability is now being developed at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md .
High - End Computing System Installed
In August , Goddard added 4,128 new - generation Intel “ Nehalem ” processors to its Discover high - end computing system .
The upgraded Discover will serve as the centerpiece of a new climate simulation capability at Goddard .
Discover will host NASA ’s modeling contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the leading scientific organization for assessing climate change , and other national and international climate initiatives .
To further enhance Discover ’s capabilities , Goddard will install another 4,128 Nehalem processors in the fall , bringing Discover to 15,160 processors .
“ We are the first high - end computing site in the United States to install Nehalem processors dedicated to climate research , ” said Phil Webster , chief of Goddard ’s Computational and Information Sciences and Technology Office ( CISTO ) .
“ This new computing system represents a dramatic step forward in performance for climate simulations . ”
Well - Suited for Climate Studies
According to CISTO lead architect Dan Duffy , the Nehalem architecture is especially well - suited to climate studies .
“ Speed is an inherent advantage for solving complex problems , but climate models also require large memory and fast access to memory , ” he said .
Each processor has 3 gigabytes of memory , among the highest available today .
In addition , memory access is three to four times faster than Discover ’s previous - generation processors .
In preliminary testing of Discover ’s Nehalem processors , NASA climate simulations performed up to twice as fast per processor compared with other nationally recognized high - end computing systems .
The new computational capabilities also allowed NASA climate scientists to run high - resolution simulations that reproduced atmospheric features not previously seen in their models .
For instance , “ features such as well - defined hurricane eyewalls and convective cloud clusters appeared for the first time , ” said William Putman , acting lead of the Advanced Software Technology Group in Goddard ’s Software Integration and Visualization Office .
“ At these cloud - permitting resolutions , the differences are stunning . ”
IPCC Simulations
For the IPCC studies , scientists will run both longer - term and shorter - term climate projections using different computer models .
A climate model from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies will perform simulations going back a full millennium and forward to 2100 .
Goddard ’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office will use a climate model for projections of the next 30 years and an atmospheric chemistry - climate model for short - term simulations of chemistry - climate feedbacks .
The IPCC will use information from climate simulations such as these in its Fifth Assessment Report , which IPCC expects to publish in 2014 .
NASA climate simulation efforts also contribute to the U.S. Global Change Research Program , the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System , and the U.S. Weather Research Program .
Supported international programs include UNESCO ’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission , the United Nations Environment Programme , the World Climate Research Programme , the World Meteorological Organization , and the World Weather Research Programme .

NASA Expands High - End Computing System for Climate Simulation
WASHINGTON , DC UNITED STATES
GREENBELT , Md. , Aug. 24 /PRNewswire -USNewswire / — NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , made available to scientists in August the first unit of an expanded high - end computing system that will serve as the centerpiece of a new climate simulation capability .
The larger computer , part of NASA ’s High - End Computing Program , will be hosting the agency ’s modeling contributions to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) and other national and international climate initiatives .
The expansion added 4,128 computer processors to Goddard ’s Discover high - end computing system .
The IBM iDataPlex “ scalable unit ” uses Intel ’s newest Xeon 5500 series processors , which are based on the Nehalem architecture introduced in spring 2009 .
Discover will be hosting climate simulations for the IPCC ’s Fifth Assessment Report by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( GISS ) in New York City and Goddard ’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office ( GMAO ) .
Stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will enable installation of another 4,128 Nehalem processors this fall , bringing Discover to 15,160 processors .
“ We are the first high - end computing site in the United States to install Nehalem processors dedicated to climate research , ” said Phil Webster , chief of the Computational and Information Sciences and Technology Office ( CISTO ) at Goddard .
“ This new computing system represents a dramatic step forward in performance for climate simulations . ”
In preliminary testing of Discover ’s Nehalem processors , NASA climate simulations performed up to twice as fast per processor compared to other nationally recognized high - end computing systems .
Moreover , the new computational capabilities allow NASA climate scientists to run high - resolution simulations that reproduce atmospheric features not previously seen in their models .
“ Nehalem architecture is especially well - suited to climate studies , ” said Dan Duffy , CISTO lead architect .
“ Speed is an inherent advantage for solving complex problems , but climate models need large memory and fast access .
We configured our Nehalem system to have 3 gigabytes of memory per processor , among the highest available today , and memory access is three to four times faster than Discover ’s previous - generation processors . ”
In daily forecasts for NASA satellite missions and field campaigns , the GMAO typically runs its flagship Goddard Earth Observing System Model , Version 5 ( GEOS - 5 ) at 27 - kilometer resolution .
Using Discover ’s new processors , the GMAO has been testing a special “ cubed - sphere ” version of GEOS - 5 at resolutions as high as 3.5 kilometers .
“ Once the model goes below 10 - kilometer resolution , features such as well - defined hurricane eyewalls and convective cloud clusters appear for the first time , ” said William Putman , acting lead of the Advanced Software Technology Group in Goddard ’s Software Integration and Visualization Office .
“ At these cloud - permitting resolutions , the differences are stunning . ”
Putman has been collaborating with GMAO modeling lead Max Suarez and others on the cubed - sphere configuration of GEOS - 5 .
NASA ’s IPCC simulations will include both longer - and - shorter - term climate projections using the latest versions of the GISS and GMAO models .
GISS ModelE will perform simulations going back a full millennium and forward to 2100 .
Making its first IPCC contributions , the GMAO will focus on the next 30 years and perform decadal prediction simulations using GEOS - 5 and atmospheric chemistry - climate simulations using the GEOS Chemistry Climate Model .
With the performance of GEOS - 5 on the Nehalem processors , investigations of societal relevance , such as climate impacts on weather extremes , now reach a new level of realism .
The IPCC ’s Fifth Assessment Report is due to be published in 2014 .
NASA climate simulation efforts also contribute to the U.S. Global Change Research Program , the U.S. Integrated Earth Observation System , and the U.S. Weather Research Program .
Supported international programs include UNESCO ’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission , the United Nations Environment Programme , the World Climate Research Programme , the World Meteorological Organization , and the World Weather Research Programme .

Every once in a while Juan Williams almost gets one right on ClusterFox .
While discussing whether the government should be cutting off funds for ACORN , Juan Williams asks Hannity why he's not concerned about the billions of dollars we 've been ripped off for by private contractors and our defense department .
Of course Hannity has no problem with that since they 're " keeping us safe " .
HANNITY : And we continue now with our " Great American Panel . "
Should ACORN lose all federal funds ?
Juan ?
WILLIAMS : Well , yes , if they are guilty of this corruption , yes , they should , you can't have federal money going into a corrupt organization .
Now , I will say this , Sean .
Exactly how serious do you think this is ?
Because the way you play it ...
HANNITY : Extreme .
WILLIAMS : ... you would think that this is the basis of all corruption , going to take apart our great country .
And you know what ?
This is miniscule .
And most of what ACORN does is help poor people .
HANNITY : Getting tens of millions , getting $ 8 billion .
WILLIAMS : Forget that .
They got about $ 5 million .
STEWART : The thing is , when you receive that amount of federal dollars or any amount , you should be held accountable .
And the face is , whenever the layers are peeled back , the spotlight is put on them .
In this case , when it comes to voter fraud , when it comes to using taxpayer money to support campaigns , which they did with the Obama campaign , they should all federal funds ...
WILLIAMS : That 's not proven .
That 's not proven .
HANNITY : Obama was a lawyer .
WILLIAMS : That 's not -- that 's a charge .
That 's not a fact .
CIANCI : Look , look , ACORN is an association that started back in 1970 .
It was to empower people .
And I 'm sure it was started for all the right reasons .
Voter registration , helping people get home ownership , finding jobs , raising the minimum wage .
I 'm sure the goals are noble , but , unfortunately , as a lot of organizations grow , there 's a lot of bad , toxic people who get involved with it .
And that 's what we have here .
The videos speak for themselves .
No one made those videos up .
And so does it need to be investigated ?
Yes .
And those congressmen and those senators are not going to stay close to ACORN .
HANNITY : They 've gotten over $ 54 million now .
CIANCI : Over 10 years .
HANNITY : That 's our money .
On track with the stimulus to get $ 8.5 billion .
WILLIAMS : But it 's not happening .
Did you see the vote the other day ?
It was 80 -- OK , 80 ...
HANNITY : Because of these two little kids .
WILLIAMS : Eighty - three to seven .
So that 's Republicans and Democrats .
The Census Bureau pulling out .
But I will say something to you .
You 're a big guy .
How come you 're not going after people who take billions of dollars ?
Why do n't you go after Blackwater ?
Why do n't you go after the defense industry that rips off our country ?
You know , these are people ...
HANNITY : The industry that keeps us safe .
WILLIAMS : Why do n't you go after Wall Street ?
HANNITY : Look , how about we go after the corrupt radicals in the Obama administration ?
CIANCI : ACORN -- ACORN is an organization that maybe should stay in existence , but not the way it is right now .
They should n't get a dime .
HANNITY : We only have 30 seconds .
STEWART : They should have zero to do with the census .
They should not receive any more funds and have nothing to do with the senses .
WILLIAMS : What about Bernie Madoff and the Wall Street people that do our people ...?
( CROSSTALK )
HANNITY : How about we go after the government that bankrupted Social Security and Medicare ?
How about we go after the government that bankrupt Social Security and Medicare , and Obama that gave us a promise that we'd have 8 percent unemployment ?
WILLIAMS : Why do n't we go after George Bush , who gives us prescription drug benefits without paying for it ?
HANNITY : I 'm against it .
I 'm against it .
( CROSSTALK )
HANNITY : All right , we 've got to run .
Now , thank you guys .
Great panel .
Good to see you all .

Après avoir aidé les Penguins de Pittsburgh à remporter une première coupe Stanley en 18 ans , le Québécois Philippe Boucher a annoncé sa retraite , jeudi .
« J'ai toujours admiré les athlètes qui se sont retirés en tant que champions et je suis honoré d'avoir la chance de le faire » , a déclaré celui qui a passé 17 saisons dans la Ligue nationale de hockey .
« J'aimerais remercier mes coéquipiers , mes entraîneurs et toutes les organisations pour lesquelles j'ai joué . »
Le défenseur originaire de Saint - Apollinaire a marqué 94 buts et récolté 206 passes en 748 matchs dans la LNH avec les Sabres de Buffalo , les Kings de Los Angeles , les Stars de Dallas et les Penguins .
Il a été un choix de première ronde - 13e au total - des Sabres en 1991 .
" J'avais commencé à y songer après avoir gagné la coupe Stanley .
J'ai subi des blessures durant les deux dernières saisons et j'avais réfléchi à cette option avec ma famille .
On s'est installé à Québec cet été et nous avons réalisé que nous étions bien ici alors j'ai choisi de me retirer la semaine dernière " , raconte Boucher .
" Je n'ai pas encore pris le temps de m'asseoir et de songer à tous les beaux moments de ma carrière , mais je vais me souvenir avant tout d'avoir gagné la coupe Stanley " , ajoute celui qui réfléchit encore à ses plans d'avenir .
Psychiatrist Stephen Dwindle has done a recent study of the top 40 metropolitan areas within the U.S. and has determined the 5 most stressful cities .
Based on the data , the most stressful city in America is Chicago , Illinois , followed by Los Angeles , New York City , Cleveland , and Providence .
Residents of these cities are finding that life is n't as easy as it used to be .
A number of factors were taken into consideration in the study .
For one thing , quality of life factors were studied .
Unemployment figures from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics were also considered .
Researchers also included cost of living through figures from the Community and Economic Research Council in addition to population density , the number of sunny verses cloudy days , and air quality .
Based on these same factors , in a huge endorsement of the Lone Star State , San Antonio and Austin , Texas were ranked as the two least stressful of the 40 metropolitan areas included in the study .
Researchers concluded that the cities ranked highest in stressfulness were hit hard by the recession and heavy unemployment .
Dropping home values and mounting foreclosures were also considered to have added greatly to stress levels in these cities .
In San Francisco alone , the housing market has dropped 43 percent compared to a national median home price dip of 14.7 percent .
Participants in a National Sleep Foundation report , also considered in the study , said that they sleep less because of economic woes .
Not only are people sleeping less , but they are trying to reassess their lives and cut down on what are viewed as unnecessary expenses .
Over 53 percent of individuals surveyed by the Kaiser Family Foundation reported that they had cut back on health care costs by avoiding doctor visits , skipping checkups , and not refilling prescriptions .
The stress in these cities can sometimes be difficult to bear because of the traffic , air pollution , not seeing the sun , rising unemployment , and falling home prices .
There are many aspects that make these cities stressful , but , when you 're dealing with these circumstances and very expensive living costs , it can be difficult to stay afloat financially .
Most troubling , researchers say , are the ill effects of such rampant , extreme stress .
High stress levels are known to increase patients ’ risk of high blood pressure , heart disease , diabetes , obesity , depression , stomach cramping , insomnia , and irritability .
Even worse are the cumulative effects of high stress levels in an entire population .
Historically , such collective stress levels have run parallel with crime waves , large - scale civil unrest , and pandemic domestic abuse .
Given this trend , researchers recommend that these cities take action to reduce population stress levels .
City - sponsored exercise programs , time management programs , entertainment , arts programs , or noise reduction programs have been advocated .

Rolls - Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé
( 2007 onward ) When in 2004 Rolls - Royce celebrated their 100th Anniversary a special highlight had been the launch of the Rolls - Royce 100 EX Centenary at the Geneva Motor Show .
This 100 EX Centenary was a drophead coupé of opulent dimensions that provided seats for driver and three passengers .
Following the debut of this Concept Car the company advised they were considering to start at some later stage production of a model developed from that Concept Car .
Some three years had passed before the new Rolls - Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé entered the market and although it obviously was based on the Concept Car many modifications showed this to be particularly different .
In the meantime the specially erected factory at Goodwood in the South of England had been used for manufacturing the Rolls - Royce Phantom , a four door saloon .
Sales figures for that model had been significantly low when compared to what had been anticipated at start of production and could hardly have been a source of profit for the parent company BMW .
It had been no mystery that there was need to extend the model - range to generate sufficient revenue to cover the cost of the Goodwood investment .
This was , of course , a key factor for the economic future of Rolls - Royce Motor Cars .
The Phantom 's spaceframe construction facilitated to develop a different model .
Simply by changing dimensions of certain components a spaceframe can be altered relatively quick .
Nonetheless it is no simple task to gain the load - bearing strength that is necessary for a roofless car .
There could be no doubt that some owners ' driving attitudes would be more agile than when behind the steering wheel of the large formal saloon .
Rear hinged doors are a remarkable feature of the Phantom Drophead Coupé – and had been a feature of the Concept Car 100 EX Centenary , too .
Such doors over a long period were burdened with the epitaph ' Suicide Doors ' , a reflection of the fact that doors inadvertently opened during driving could rarely be shut again ; usually flung fully open from wind - pressure with dangerous results for the car 's occupants .
The manufacturer guaranteed that on the new model their highly sophisticated door - locking mechanism would prevent any chance for such a problem ever to occur .
Top of page
Serbian - born Marek Djordjevic was responsible exterior designer on this model .
His design showed a silhouette with a rise in the waistline over the rear wheels and that was a faint reminiscence of the legendary Rolls - Royce Corniche convertible .
A front view revealed the radiator set a considerable angle and a headlamp - layout not much different from that of the Rolls - Royce Phantom ; and that had not met confirmed acceptance but caused controversial comments .
A two - piece bootlid was a design - peculiarity worth a note .
The lower part could be folded down to a horizontal position although it is hard to fathom that might be used like similar features on pre-war cars , i.e. to carry additional luggage .
Technical Data :
12 - cylinder - engine with 60 degree V- configuration , four valves per cylinder , bore x stroke 84.6 mm x 92 mm ( 3.33 in x 3.63in ) , capacity 6,749 cc ( 411.8 cu in ) ; digital engine control , SAE 453 bhp at 5350rpm ( DIN 460hp / 338 KW at 5,350r pm ) , max torque 531 lb ft ( 720 Nm ) at 3,500 rpm ; ZF6HP32 6 - speed automatic gearbox ; independent suspension front and rear , ventilated disc brakes ( diameter front 374 mm , rear 370 mm ) , anti locking device ; wheelbase 130,7in ( 3,320 mm ) ; height 62.2in ( 1,581 mm ) , width 78.2in ( 1,987 mm ) , overall length 220.8in ( 5,609 mm ) ; Michelin tyres PAX265x790 R540 A 11W on light alloy wheels PAX265x540A ALU ( optional tyre size : front Goodyear EMT 255/50R21 106W on alloy wheels 8x21 and rear Goodyear EMT 285/45R21 109W on alloy wheels 9.5x21 rims at the rear ; max .
speed 149mph ( 240 km / h ) ; 0 - 60 mph 5.7 sec ( 0-100 km/h 5.9sec )
Obviously a lot of components and features from the experimental car had been copied for the new convertible but neither the power - plant nor a derivative of the V16 - 9 litre - engine was transferred .
The powertrain of the Phantom Drophead Coupé was the familiar combination of the V12-6.75 litre - engine and 6 - speed automatic gearbox .

Days ago , under the headline " White House Struggles to Gauge Afghan Success , " a New York Times story made a splash .
" As the American military comes to full strength in the Afghan buildup , the Obama administration is struggling to come up with a long - promised plan to measure whether the war is being won . "
Do n’t ask the dead .
They do n’t count .
The Times article went on : " Those ‘ metrics ’ of success , demanded by Congress and eagerly awaited by the military , are seen as crucial if the president is to convince Capitol Hill and the country that his revamped strategy is working . "
Do n’t ask the dead .
They wo n’t have a say .
" Without concrete signs of progress , Mr. Obama may lack the political stock — especially among Democrats and his liberal base — to make the case for continuing the military effort or enlarging the American presence . "
Do n’t ask the dead .
They ca n’t hear you .
" We all share the president ’s goal of succeeding in Afghanistan , " said Senator John Kerry .
" The challenge here is how we are going to define success in the medium term , given the difficult security environment we face . "
Do n’t ask the dead .
You ca n’t hear them .
The White House " struggles to gauge Afghan success . "
People in the middle of the Afghan war struggle to survive .
A new ceiling of 68,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan has n’t been reached yet , but leaks are now telling us that the Pentagon ’s top commander there will soon request 45,000 more .
Apparently , escalating the warfare is much more attractive to Washington ’s policymakers than actually challenging the main supporters of the Taliban in Afghanistan — the Pakistani government .
" With the U.S. relationship with Pakistan still locked in a cold war embrace that accedes to Pakistani demands at the expense of Afghanistan , establishing a metric for anything is useless without reassessing the underlying assumptions , " Elizabeth Gould and Paul Fitzgerald said last week .
They ’re authors of the new book Invisible History : Afghanistan ’s Untold Story , published after nearly 30 years of research .
" With Pakistan ’s creation of the Taliban , America ’s concept of ‘ winning ’ entered a complicated phase that continues to haunt American decision - making to its core , " Gould and Fitzgerald added .
" Pakistani intelligence knows full well the American political system , its history of compliance with their wishes and the lack of appreciation for Afghan independence .
America ’s war in Afghanistan is an ongoing bait and switch where the U.S. fights against its own interests and Pakistan plays the Beltway like a violin . "
Gould and Fitzgerald contend : " The only metric that matters is how far Pakistan ’s military has moved from supporting Islamic extremism .
With the insider relationship the United States has with Pakistan ’s military intelligence , that should not be a difficult metric to establish . "
Meanwhile , few Democrats with high profiles can bring themselves to challenge President Obama ’s military escalation in Afghanistan .
But an important statement has just come from John Burton , chairman of the California Democratic Party .
" Enough is enough , " Burton wrote in an August 11 email blast that went to party activists statewide .
" It ’s time we learned the lessons of history .
The British Empire , the most powerful empire in the world , could not subdue Afghanistan .
Neither could the Soviet Union , the second most powerful country at that time and next - door neighbor to Afghanistan .
Two of the great militaries in history found Afghanistan easy to conquer but impossible to hold .
It ’s time the people of Afghanistan assumed full control of their own country .
It ’s time for American troops to come home — not only from Iraq , but from Afghanistan too .
And the first step is an exit strategy . "
Burton made a key connection between the soaring costs of the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and the domestic economy : " Already , $ 223 billion that could have gone to things like health care reform has been sunk into this war . . . "
Routinely , the dominant political and media calculus renders the dead as digits and widgets , moved around on spreadsheets and news pages .
The victims of war are hardly seen as people by the numbed sophisticates who can measure just about anything but the value of a human life .
The dead ca n’t speak up .
What ’s our excuse ?
The seizure is one of the largest made by Guatemalan authorities
Guatemalan and US authorities have seized a makeshift submarine loaded with cocaine with a US street value of $ 200 m ( £ 120 m ) .
The submarine , which had 10 tonnes of cocaine on board , was stopped by the coast guard some 280 km ( 175 miles ) off Guatemala 's Pacific coast .
Four Colombians and one Mexican man on board the vessel were arrested .
Guatemala is becoming an important transit point for illegal drugs moved north by Mexican trafficking cartels .
These cartels are increasingly moving into neighbouring Guatemala in a bid to ensure safe supply lines following a crackdown launched by Mexico 's President Felipe Calderon .
The president has deployed more than 45,000 troops to fight drug gangs since he took office in December 2006 .
At least two other submarine - like vessels have been found by anti-drug patrols in the waters around Central America .
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott , in Medellin , says drugs smugglers often use such makeshift vessels - constructed in steel and fibreglass - as they are difficult to detect using a conventional radar .
Our correspondent adds that the vessels , which can cost up to $ 1 m each , are often sunk after use .
Remember when mom said not to worry when people call you names , it 's the sticks and stones you need to watch out for ?
Well , it turns out mom was wrong .
Again .
In this case , though , it 's the name - callers who are in danger of getting stoned ( no , not in that way ) .
[ Cringely points to more signs of changes on the Internet , courtesy of AT&T and 4chan | Stay up to date on Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
Yesterday a U.S. federal judge ruled that Google must turn over the name of an anonymous blogger who took a severe disliking to aging supermodel Liskula Cohen .
The ripples emanating from the ruling could potentially wash over every member of the blogosphere ( including those who delight in anonymously depositing nasty comments on blogs -- you know who you are ) .
The backstory : In August 2008 , some soon - to - not - be - anonymous blogger ( STNBAB ) created a Google blog called " Skanks in NYC " ( no longer available , but archived at Mahalo ) .
The sole topic of this short - lived blog : Liskula Cohen , a zygomatically gifted Canuck who has graced the covers of Vogue , Elle , and other magazines probably not in the bathrooms of most InfoWorld readers .
Among other things , the STNBAB called Cohen " a psychotic , lying , whoring , still going to clubs at her age , skank . "
He ( she ? ) also called Cohen " an old hag . "
I bet that 's the one that really stung .
( Note : This blog takes no position whatsoever on the relative skankiness of any supermodel , Cohen or otherwise .
I 'm sure they 're all just sweet - natured gals at heart .
Also : 100 percent virgins .
But I digress . )
Cohen 's attorneys sent a nastygram to the blogger , who immediately removed " Skanks in NYC " from Blogger.com .
But it did n't end there .
Last January Cohen sued Google , demanding it reveal the blogger 's identity .
Yesterday , the court ruled that Google had to hand over the only information it had : the blogger 's IP and e-mail addresses .
So it looks like STNBAB is about to be sued for defamation , libel , and anything else Liskanka -- err , Liskula 's attorneys can dig up .
Bad news for him / her , but potentially worse news for the rest of us .
Because if anonymous speech on the Internet is no longer anonymous , some people will simply stop speaking .
This is not necessarily a bad thing .
There is way too much nastiness on the Net hiding under the shield of anonymity .
The Skanks in NYC blog is a good example of this , but virtually every blog with any traffic suffers from the Anonymous D------ Commenter syndrome ( fill in the blanks yourself ) .
A lot of that would go away if people had to staple their own identities to what they actually said .
Yes , free speech is a good and powerful thing .
But as a wise superhero once said , " With great power comes great responsibility . "
Allen Wastler , managing editor at CNBC.com , finds some hope in the " skank ruling " :
... I do get a little riled when " mainstream media " — by comparison to blogs — gets tagged for not being tough or hard on certain people or subjects .
Hey , I could be the roughest , toughest bully Corporate America has ever seen ... if I could be anonymous and not worry about threatening calls from lawyers .
But when you work for a newspaper , a TV network , or an established Net news site , you have to follow the journalistic rules :
You back things up , with your identity and your reporting ... or you get sued .
The flip side of this : Anonymous speech that really does need to be anonymous , like blogs by political dissidents in repressive countries .
The tactics used by Liskula 's attorneys are not all that dissimilar to those employed by the Chinese government to force information about its political enemies out of Yahoo , Google , and others , except of course that her attorneys do n't have tanks .
How far this ruling will extend is unknown at this point .
But I think the lesson here is be careful whom you attack on the Net , because they might be able to find you and fight back .
One long - term impact of all this is obvious , though :
The search term " skank NYC " is now permanently anchored to Liskula Cohen 's name on Google .
If she was trying to protect her reputation , she went about it in exactly the wrong way .
So let 's whack the hornet 's nest again , shall we ?
What 's more important : privacy & anonymity or identity & responsibility ?

Review : Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Monday , 12th of October 2009 - 07:39 PM ]
Now we 've all heard and seen the hype for this game .
It was selected as Best of Show at E3 this year and is already slated to capture best game of the year .
Does it stand up to these claims and look like it will win ?
Well let me tell you my thoughts here .
Controls :
The controls on this game are just about perfect .
Every button and trigger is mapped just right so there are no awkward holdings of a controller or worry about missing an action due to poor placement .
There is a slight learning curve at the beginning , well the first five chapters of beginning , but once you get all the tutorial stuff out of the way , it all becomes second nature .
I felt like I had it all down once they finally showed how to run and gun from chasing vehicles and enemies .
So pretty much the intro to the fifth chapter .
From there , only a few minor hiccups to deal with as controls go .
The main issue I found with the controls here mainly came up when the camera angle was forced in a different angle .
For instance there are a few scenes in the game where you are sprinting away from an enemy or vehicle and you are running to the camera , holding down on the stick .
Then the shot changes and you are running away , and now you are supposed to be holding up on the stick .
Changes that do n't compensate easily for the transition , thus leading to Nate running the opposite way and slowing you down in the run while you re-adjust .
When on Hard and Crushing mode , this can mean life and death .
The only other issue I had during my play through was a bit of the climbing .
Sometimes pressing a direction would force Nate to jump down instead of move up a level and vice versa .
Not too much of a hindrance , but a little annoying when on the run and being shot at or when timing needs to be perfect .
But besides those issues , the controls were spot on .
Graphics :
Now this is one of the areas everyone anticipated to be the shining gold star of the game .
Let me tell you , those anticipations are met with this offering .
The visuals are off the charts ( pun intended ) for this game .
If you thought what was previously shown for video was pre-rendered or supped up for promotions , they were totally not .
In fact , I would say that seeing them on my HDTV , they actually looked even better .
Worlds better , and not just because they were displayed larger either .
To go one further , the motion capture and engine made certain scenes look like actual film quality .
I 'm not talking CGI film either .
Someone walked in during the opening of chapter two and actually asked what movie I was watching .
Then they were surprised when I said these are just the in - game graphics for the game .
Then again when there was an obvious cut scene for the game , the same person asked me if it was an FVM or game graphics again .
Something that was answered when the scene ended and I was moving the same character he thought was fully rendered .
Audio :
Just like the graphics , this is yet another shining point of the game .
From the sound effects to the voice overs to the in - game music , Uncharted 2 did not fail to impress .
This was n't even one of the things people were over - psyched for to boot , but the audio added to the overall experience and complimented the visuals perfectly .
The music of the game was very epic and something you would expect to hear in a feature film .
It would get louder and faster when there was a lot of action or the scene required it to help emphasize the urgency of things or danger .
Then when there were tender and softer moments , the audio cues would shift to fit .
I am hard pressed to even think of a time that the music of the game did n't blend in perfectly at all .
This is true even in the scenes where it is suppose to be just background noise .
One more thing before I move on , the voice over work .
It is easily one thing that can harm a game like this more than help .
It , just like the music of the game , was completely well done .
There were no hiccups or poor dialogue for the game at all .
Even when you would think they are being overly corny with a joke or phrase , it completely fits in with the scene or the character saying it .
That 's something that you do n't get in a lot of games .
Resident Evil and Final Fantasy , I 'm talking to you .
Gameplay :
At first glace one would look at this game as another Tomb Raider style of game .
Run , Gun , and A LOT of climbing , which when you look at it , it very much is so .
I spent 3.56 of my 15.78 hours playing the game climbing .
About the same amount was spent in cover , firing at people .
So , about half of the game was spent in cover or climbing .
That is to be expected right ?
But where did the other half of the game go ?
Well , somewhere in between the mixture of puzzle solving and the other little " mini- games " built into the overall game .
By mini -game , I 'm talking all the other little things that are needed to progress ; this includes reading through Nate 's journal to figure a few things out , sliding down the side of a falling platform while trying to free an ally from a freaking looking enemy and partaking in the full - on Metal Gear stealth missions through a museum to steal an artifact .
Even petting
Yaks in a small village will earn you a small medal .
Nothing ridiculously out of place for the game , but a nice little side game to keep things fresh and new while playing everything out .
Fun Factor :
All of those above modes for the game make this a very fun game to play , and replay .
While playing , I do n't think there was a time I was playing where I had to set the controller down due to boredom .
Pretty much I only stopped when I needed to take care of personal care requirements so I could keep playing the game .
This experience draws you in and makes you want to see what is going to come next .
If not for the story , then all the little extras Naughty Dog slipped into the title or to gain all the medals of the game .
Medals to buy extra multiplayer and single player items .
Overview / Final Words :
In the end , Uncharted 2 meets and exceeds all of the expectations and hype Sony and Naughty Dog had placed out there .
This has to be the most visually breathtaking , aurally stunning , and impressively entertaining game to hit the PS3 thus far .
Some games might beat it out in one area or another , but nothing can challenge the entire package .
In fact , I will even say the multiplayer is fun as well , and you all know how much I despise online multiplayer .
Or at least I 'd think so by now .
I will say that it does have a very Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones feel , as I mention above , but that is just the genre of the game .
Although I will say it does follow after National Treasure more when you look at it .
Not that they ripped it off , but it 's just a good comparison .
In fact , if Naughty Dog keeps pumping out Uncharted games like this , I can see a revitalization of the genre in all forms of media .
The minds they have there are akin to genius .
Uncharted 2 is totally a must buy for anyone that has a PS3 .
It completely will end the gripe that there are no " good games " on the PS3 , if you had that gripe in the first place .
If you did n't it will give you a new appreciation for what designers can produce for the PS3 when they put real work towards it .
All other games from here on have a very high bar of standards now because of Uncharted 2 .
A new El Niño has begun .
The sporadic Pacific Ocean warming , which can disrupt weather patterns across the world , is intensifying , say meteorologists .
So , over the next few months , there may be increased drought in Africa , India and Australia , heavier rainfall in South America and increased extremes in Britain , of warm and cold .
It may make 2010 one of the hottest years on record .
The cyclical phenomenon , which happens every two to seven years , is a major determinant of global weather systems .
The 1997 - 98 El Niño combined with global warming to push 1998 into being the world 's hottest year , and caused major droughts and catastrophic forest fires in South - east Asia which sent a pall of smoke right across the region .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At present , forecasters do not expect this El Niño to equal that of 1998 , but it may be the second - strongest , and concerned groups , from international insurance companies to commodity traders , to aid agencies such as Oxfam , have begun to follow its progress anxiously .
Its potential for economic and social impact is considerable .
Professor Chris Folland , of the Met Office Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research , said : " We are likely to see more global warming than we have seen in the past few years , which have been rather cool .
In fact , we are already seeing it . "
El Niño is a periodic warming of the normally cold waters of the eastern tropical Pacific , the ocean region westwards out from South America along the line of the equator .
Since the Pacific is a heat reservoir which drives wind patterns around the world , the change in its temperature alters global weather .
An El Niño is defined by ocean surface temperatures rising by more than 0.5C above the average .
This El Niño is well beyond that , says the Climate Prediction Center of the US National Weather Service .
" Sea surface temperatures remain +0.5 to +1.5 above average across much of the equatorial Pacific Ocean , " the centre reported last week .
" Observations and dynamical model forecasts indicate El Niño conditions will continue to intensify and are expected to last through the northern hemisphere winter of 2009 - 10 . "
The last El Niño was in 2006 - 07 and , at its peak , sea surface temperatures averaged about 0.9 degrees above normal .
But this is a stage which has already been reached by this one .
The last El Niño , comparatively weak though it was , is thought to have been partly responsible for the extraordinarily warm weather in Britain between the summer of 2006 and the spring of 2007 : July 2006 was Britain 's hottest month , autumn 2006 ( September , October and November ) was the warmest autumn , winter 2006 - 07 ( December , January and February ) was the second warmest in Britain , and April 2007 was our warmest April .
People have forgotten this because there then began our recent cooler and wetter period , with Britain 's two " washout summers " of 2007 and 2008 , and they may , in turn , have been associated with the counter - phenomenon of La Niña , a cooling of the eastern tropical Pacific waters , which followed .
The start of the present El Niño was one reason the Met Office predicted a " barbecue summer " for 2009 .
Our noses are what people notice first , are n’t they ?
“ Oh God , I hate my nose ! ” – many of us go .
And what about “ others ” ?
What would celebrities normally do , if they did n’t like something about their appearance ?
That ’s right , they go to plastic surgeons !
Could the nose shape affect the celebrities ’ career ?
Of course it could !
Here are 8 successful examples of rhinoplasty .
Marilyn Monroe , Rhinoplasty Pioneer !
Legendary Marilyn was one of the first celebrities to have had a plastic surgery done .
Rhinoplasty is yet another secret weapon which turned plain - looking small - town - girl Norma Jean into a chic Merilyn .
Smooth line of sensual nostrils and thin nose bridge contributed to a new image of the actress .
Scarlett Johansson : “ I never had a plastic surgery ”
Not that long ago the young and charming Scarlett Johansson used to be pretty big -nosed .
Rhinoplasty has made her face features noticeably finer .
The actress did n’t lose her individuality though , it is still her nose but it became smaller .
Scarlett keeps denying her rhinoplasty .
She claims , she will go to plastic surgeons only when she faces the first signs of aging .
According to her words , she believes plastic surgery is a great way to avoid looking like a wrinkled witch when she ’s old .
Jennifer Aniston , almost natural beauty
Jennifer is partially Greek , and by the time of her aging you could tell what nationality her father is by her nose .
Plastic surgery helped here , too .
Last year Jen had yet another plastic surgery .
Now Aniston is discouraging plastic surgery and saying she had to change her nose because she needed it medically .
Britney Spears , invisible change
Rhinoplasty is at peak of its popularity and you are supposed to be in .
Britney Spears and her surgeon found simple and effective solution – Britney ’s new nose is a copy of her natural nose in its form but the fake one is smaller .
The result was just great :
You ca n’t see the change right away but it was for better .
They did n’t achieve the best wished result with one surgery , so the singer had to have another surgery .
Halle Berry on the way to Oscar
Before rhinoplasty you could say Halle Berry was one of many cute actresses out there .
But a nose job made her look like a mind - blowing beauty .
Narrowing the span of the nostrils is one of the most sought - after plastic surgeries among Afro-American celebrities .
After the nose job had been done Halle Berry ’s career was on the rise and she became the only Oscar - winning girlfriend of James Bond ( in ‘ Die Another Day ’ movie ) .
Winona Ryder , you would n’t believe it !
Once you saw that big - eyed girl , you would n’t get her off your mind .
However , before starring in ‘ Edward Scissorhands ’ and ‘ Bram Stocker ’s Dracula ’ , she had her nose job .
The surgery was a success .
Ryder looks so natural now that it ’s hard to believe she changed anything in her appearance .
Many surgeons say that when it comes down to plastic surgery , it ’s crucial not to overdo it .
The ex-lover of Jonny Depp did it right .
Angelina Jolie , one more little step to excellence
Angelina Jolie was born beautiful .
As a teenager , she had a part time job modeling and made appearance in video clips of many famous bands like Meat Loaf , Rolling Stones , Lemonhead and Lenny Kravitz .
After her first notable movie ‘ Hackers ’ had been released , she decided to make her nose bridge smaller .
Well , actually her surgeon has nothing to be proud of as he did n’t have a lot of job here .
But the fact that Jolie ’s fans are still arguing whether their idol had a plastic surgery or not , means that Angelina looks very natural .
So her nose job was successful .
Janet Jackson , pursuit of beauty in blood
The younger sister of Michael Jackson has followed her brother ’s footsteps .
She had a good start as a singer and was also busy getting plastic surgeries done .
Fortunately , she could stop before it was too late .
The nose job made her look better , though now you can argue over her naturalness .
This cute button - nose makes the 42 - year old look a bit childish .
Smooth voice , nice show and bright appearance are a key to Janet Jackson ’s successful career .
And do you think these clebrities really needed a nose job or could they achieve what they have now without it , just like Barbra Streisand , for example ?
PLOS Medicine HIV Shedding from Male Circumcision Wounds in HIV - Infected Men : A Prospective Cohort Study Aaron A. R. Tobian , Godfrey Kigozi , Jordyn Manucci , Mary K. Grabowski , David Serwadda , Richard Musoke , Andrew D. Redd , Fred Nalugoda , Steven J. Reynolds , Nehemiah Kighoma , Oliver Laeyendecker , Justin Lessler , Ronald H. Gray , [ ... ] , Published : April 28 , 2015 DOI : 10.1371/journal.pmed.1001820 Abstract Background
A randomized trial of voluntary medical male circumcision ( MC ) of HIV — infected men reported increased HIV transmission to female partners among men who resumed sexual intercourse prior to wound healing .
We conducted a prospective observational study to assess penile HIV shedding after MC .
Methods and Findings
HIV shedding was evaluated among 223 HIV — infected men ( 183 self — reported not receiving antiretroviral therapy [ ART ] , 11 self — reported receiving ART and had a detectable plasma viral load [ VL ] , and 29 self — reported receiving ART and had an undetectable plasma VL [ < 400 copies / ml ] ) in Rakai , Uganda , between June 2009 and April 2012 .
Preoperative and weekly penile lavages collected for 6 wk and then at 12 wk were tested for HIV shedding and VL using a real — time quantitative PCR assay .
Unadjusted prevalence risk ratios ( PRRs ) and adjusted PRRs ( adjPRRs ) of HIV shedding were estimated using modified Poisson regression with robust variance .
HIV shedding was detected in 9.3 % ( 17/183 ) of men not on ART prior to surgery and 39.3 % ( 72/183 ) of these men during the entire study .
Relative to baseline , the proportion shedding was significantly increased after MC at 1 wk ( PRR = 1.87 , 95 % CI = 1.12–3.14 , p = 0.012 ) , 2 wk ( PRR = 3.16 , 95 % CI = 1.94–5.13 , p < 0.001 ) , and 3 wk ( PRR = 1.98 , 95 % CI = 1.19 –3.28 , p = 0.008 ) after MC .
However , compared to baseline , HIV shedding was decreased by 6 wk after MC ( PRR = 0.27 , 95 % CI = 0.09 –0.83 , p = 0.023 ) and remained suppressed at 12 wk after MC ( PRR = 0.19 , 95 % CI = 0.06 –0.64 , p = 0.008 ) .
Detectable HIV shedding from MC wounds occurred in more study visits among men with an HIV plasma VL > 50,000 copies / ml than among those with an HIV plasma VL < 400 copies / ml ( adjPRR = 10.3 , 95 % CI = 4.25 –24.90 , p < 0.001 ) .
Detectable HIV shedding was less common in visits from men with healed MC wounds compared to visits from men without healed wounds ( adjPRR = 0.12 , 95 % CI = 0.07 –0.23 , p < 0.001 ) and in visits from men on ART with undetectable plasma VL compared to men not on ART ( PRR = 0.15 , 95 % CI = 0.05 –0.43 , p = 0.001 ) .
Among men with detectable penile HIV shedding , the median log10 HIV copies / milliliter of lavage fluid was significantly lower in men with ART — induced undetectable plasma VL ( 1.93 , interquartile range [ IQR ] = 1.83 –2.14 ) than in men not on ART ( 2.63 , IQR = 2.28 –3.22 , p < 0.001 ) .
Limitations of this observational study include significant differences in baseline covariates , lack of confirmed receipt of ART for individuals who reported ART use , and lack of information on potential ART initiation during follow — up for those who were not on ART at enrollment .
Conclusion
Penile HIV shedding is significantly reduced after healing of MC wounds .
Lower plasma VL is associated with decreased frequency and quantity of HIV shedding from MC wounds .
Starting ART prior to MC should be considered to reduce male - to - female HIV transmission risk .
Research is needed to assess the time on ART required to decrease shedding , and the acceptability and feasibility of initiating ART at the time of MC. Editors ' Summary Background
About 35 million people are currently infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS by destroying immune system cells , and every year , 2 million more people become HIV - positive .
Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) can keep HIV in check , but there is no cure for AIDS .
Consequently , prevention of HIV acquisition and transmission is an important component of efforts to control the AIDS epidemic .
Because HIV is most often spread through unprotected sex with an infected partner , individuals can reduce their risk of becoming HIV - positive by abstaining from sex , by having only one or a few partners , and by using male or female condoms .
In addition , three trials undertaken in sub-Saharan Africa a decade ago showed that male circumcision — the surgical removal of the foreskin , a loose fold of skin that covers the head of the penis — can halve the HIV acquisition rate in men .
Thus , since 2007 , the World Health Organization ( WHO ) has recommended voluntary medical male circumcision for individuals living in countries with high HIV prevalence as part of its HIV prevention strategy .
Why Was This Study Done ?
With the rollout of voluntary medical male circumcision programs , circumcision has become more normative ( regarded as acceptable ) , and HIV - positive men are increasingly requesting circumcision because they want to avoid any stigma associated with being uncircumcised and because circumcision provides health benefits .
WHO recommends that , although circumcision should not be promoted for HIV - positive men , voluntary circumcision programs should operate on HIV - positive men if they request circumcision .
However , in a trial of circumcision of HIV - infected men , HIV transmission to their female partners increased if the couples had sexual intercourse before the circumcision wound had healed .
Moreover , in studies of current male circumcision programs , two - thirds of married men and a third of all men reported that they resumed sexual intercourse before their circumcision wounds had healed .
Thus , better understanding of how male circumcision increases HIV transmission to female partners is essential , and improved ways to prevent transmission in the post - surgical period are needed .
Here , in a prospective observational study ( an investigation that collects data over time from people undergoing a specific procedure ) , the researchers assess HIV shedding from the penis after circumcision .
What Did the Researchers Do and Find ?
The researchers evaluated penile HIV shedding among 223 HIV - infected men ( 183 men who self - reported not being on ART and 40 men who self - reported being on ART , 29 of whom had no detectable virus in their blood ) living in Rakai , Uganda , by examining preoperative and postoperative penile lavage ( wash ) samples .
Viral shedding was detected in 9.3 % of the men not on ART before surgery and in 39.3 % of these men during the entire study .
Relative to baseline , a greater proportion of men shed virus at one , two , and three weeks after circumcision , but a lower proportion shed virus at six and twelve weeks after circumcision .
HIV shedding was more frequent among men with a high amount of virus in their blood ( a high viral load ) than among men with a low viral load .
Moreover , the frequency of HIV shedding was lower in visits from men with healed circumcision wounds than in visits from men with unhealed wounds , and in visits from men on ART with no detectable virus in their blood than in visits from men not on ART men .
Finally , among men with detectable penile HIV shedding , men on ART with no detectable virus in their blood shed fewer copies of virus than men not on ART .
What Do These Findings Mean ?
The findings suggest that healed circumcision wounds are associated with reduced penile HIV shedding in HIV - positive men compared to unhealed circumcision wounds and HIV shedding prior to circumcision .
[ They only consider male HIV shedding in transmission to women , not any possible effect of the keratinised glans rubbing over the vaginal surface on HIV reception . ]
In addition , they suggest that a lower HIV viral load in the blood is associated with a decreased frequency and quantity of HIV shedding from circumcision wounds .
Because this was an observational study , these findings cannot prove that healed wounds or reduced blood viral load actually caused reduced penile HIV shedding .
Moreover , the accuracy of these findings may be affected by the lack of information on ART initiation during follow - up among men not initially on ART and by reliance on ART self - report .
Nevertheless , these findings highlight the importance of counseling HIV - positive men undergoing circumcision to avoid sexual intercourse until their circumcision wound heals .
In addition , these findings suggest that it might be possible to reduce HIV transmission among HIV - positive men immediately after circumcision by starting these individuals on ART before circumcision .
Further research is needed to assess how long before circumcision ART should be initiated and to assess the acceptability and feasibility of initiating ART concurrent with circumcision .
[ But never for a moment do they consider NOT CUTTING HIV - POSITIVE MEN !
It is TOO LATE to protect them .
One reason they have given for doing so is that they do not want the men to be stigmatised as HIV - positive if they are not cut .
But if people refuse to have sex with them , that too will help to prevent the spread of HIV .
The question arises " What is their true motivation - to prevent the spread of HIV , or to promote the spread of male genital cutting ? ]

The Fremont Brewing Company will be celebrating its Grand Opening at the Latona Pub on August 17th .
For those long - time Punk readers you may remember us highlighting this brewery in my Seattle Beer - venture posting .
For those of you who are new or need a refresher , Fremont is a small scale family - owned start - up located in Seattle ’s Fremont district .
The FBC is dedicated to producing high - quality sustainable beer , and I can personally vouch for the fact that they do .
To help accomplish this onerous feat the brewer sources as many locally produced organic ingredients as possible .
This includes everything from using water from a nearby river in the Cascades to buying hops grown in the Yakima Valley .
The other half of the formula comes from the owners ’ passion for making the best beer possible .
I had the pleasure of meeting with the owners during my visit , and I can assure you from what I saw these guys not only mean business , but should be around for a long , long while .
I should also point out that the FBC has a long - term goal of creating a neutral carbon foot - print , and brewing with sustainability in mind .
The opening event kicks off at the Latona Pub 7:00 PM sharp when the first keg of Fremont ’s Universale Pale
Ale will be tapped at the bar .
Fremont ’s founder , Matt Lincecum will be on hand to answer your questions regarding the beer and discuss the hardships of starting a small scale environmentally conscious brewery in the midst of a severe economic downturn .
Apparently , Matt is considered a long - time regular at the Latona Pub , which ironically will be celebrating its 22nd birthday at midnight on the same night .
My only regret is that I can’t fly out to Seattle to attend , so I hope all of you in the Seattle area attend , and have one ( or many ) on my behalf , and please be sure to say hello to Matt for us .
Also , in the future look for Fremont Brewery six packs at a grocery store near you ( if of course you are reading this in Washington state ) .

• Four - times Dakar Rally winner says ' time has come for change ' •
Finn has received positive responses from FIA member clubs
The former world rally champion Ari Vatanen is considering standing against Max Mosley if the Briton seeks re-election as president of motorsport 's world governing body , the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile .
" At the moment I am consulting the member clubs and am already seeing positive feedback , " said the 57 - year - old Finn , a four - times Dakar Rally winner .
" I am considering standing .
I think the time has come for a change .
I would go for it , even if not sure of winning . "
Mosley , 69 , said last month that he would not seek a fifth four - year term of office in October as part of a deal with Formula
One teams calling for a reform of the sport 's governance and threatening a breakaway series .
The Briton has since accused the teams of " dancing on his grave " and suggested that he was under pressure from members of the Paris - based FIA to stay on .
" I am under pressure now from all over the world to stand for re-election , " said Mosley .
" I do genuinely want to stop .
But if there is going to be a big conflict with the car industry , for example with the Formula One Teams Association , then I wo n't stop . "
Vatanen said Mosley had done a lot for motorsport , adding that he enjoyed a good relationship with him , but he felt there was a time when every organisation needed change .
Mosley has been a controversial figure in the FIA , most notably last year when he saw off calls for his resignation over a sado - masochistic sex scandal and then won a high court lawsuit for invasion of privacy .
The FIA president , whose organisation groups some 219 member clubs from 130 countries on five continents , has also worked hard to make motorsport safer while championing environmentally friendly technology .
Vatanen won the world rally championship in 1981 , with the future Benetton and BAR Formula One team principal , David Richards , as his co-driver .
The Finn was also a member of the European Parliament from 1999 until this year .
Other potential candidates for the position could include the former Ferrari team principal Jean Todt , the Frenchman widely seen as Mosley 's preferred successor should the president decide to step down .
When you 've spent the weekend splurging on greasy fast foods , your bathroom scale is n't alone in reeling from the impact .
Your brain does , too .
New research shows just how saturated fat tricks us into eating more and elucidates the evolutionary basis for the propensity for poundage in developed nations .
Our brain physiology , it seems , is glaringly out - of - date in the modern world .
Researchers have long known that the hormones leptin and insulin play key roles in appetite and food intake .
In healthy people leptin , which is secreted by fat tissue , acts as a molecular measuring tape for our waistlines , quashing feelings of hunger .
Insulin spikes when the pancreas gets a whiff of the blood sugar increase after a meal ; once the brain detects the spike , it knows to tamp down the desire for food .
Certain foods and metabolic disorders , however , can disrupt our ability to respond appropriately to these hormonal signals .
In a study published in the September issue of The Journal of Clinical Investigation , scientists report unraveling a central biochemical mechanism behind fat 's effect on the mammalian brain .
They found that after only three days on a diet high in saturated fat — a common ingredient in beef and cheese — the brains of rats and mice became resistant to leptin and insulin .
In contrast , unsaturated fats , such as those found in olive oil , did not trigger resistance .
As a result of the hormone resistance , a meal high in saturated fat can crank up our appetite well after dessert .
" Taking time off from a healthy diet to eat most fast foods may have consequences that last for some days , even after one resumes the healthy diet , " says University of Cincinnati behavioral neuroscientist Stephen Benoit , who led the study .
He believes the findings are likely to apply to humans , too .
Sensing leptin and insulin is like keeping an eye on the body 's nutrient status , says Gary Schwartz , a neuroscientist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City , who was not involved in the research .
" If that eye starts to go blind because you keep giving it too much nutrient , then it can't respond .
It ca n't tell you , ' look , do n't eat . ' "
The result can spark a vicious cycle of metabolic problems and weight gain , he remarks .
But if the hormones are supposed to keep our metabolism from spinning out of control , why would saturated fat — the very thing that obese people have too much of — make us insensitive to them ?
" There is a basic mystery here , " says William Banks of the Saint Louis Veterans Affairs Medical Center .
A leptin expert , he has shown that high levels of saturated fat in the bloodstream block the hormone 's passage into the brain , further blinding it to those extra pounds below the neck .
One hint at an explanation for these counterintuitive effects comes from the physiology of starvation .
When we starve , our body begins to break down its blubber for energy .
As a result , the blood gets flooded with fat , just as it does in obesity and overeating .
Apparently erring on the side of caution , our brain interprets free fat ( no matter its source ) as a starvation alert — had it done otherwise in our evolutionary history , we probably would n't be around to worry about it .
Says Banks :
" In the history of evolution , we 've been faced with caloric shortages and starvation much more than we 've ever been faced with a wealth of calories . "
But as Benoit notes , a neurological response " that was useful at some point in history is no longer useful when there is a McDonald 's and a Taco Bell on your way home . "
So in our battle against the empty calories , sticking to a Mediterranean diet — rich in olive oil and vegetables — might help us outsmart our obsolete brain physiology .
wachovia fiascooo [ Sep. 4th , 2009 | 06:42 pm ] dionysian
It started when I recieved the first overdraft notice , a tiny flash went through my very preoccupied head " huh ?
i thought my account was fine ?
whatever , i fuck up a lot , maybe i did something stupid this month , oh well ... have to live with it , its just one fee . "
Maybe it really started when Wachovia called to leave a message to call them back , and when I did call back , they refused to take my relay calls , citing policy not to take 3rd party calls ....
In any case its been an interesting two days between me and Wachovia .
Wow .
It sounds like many people from the site I posted this to are skimming about 3 words per paragraph in this entry and making wrong assumptions .
••••THIS IS NOT A SIMPLE NSF - whining STORY .
WACHOVIA GENERATED FALSE BALANCES AND SL APPED FOUR NSF FEES ON ME WHILE I HAD A POSITIVE BALANC E .
A little preface : Wachovia and many other banks including Bank Of America have a nice little setup going on in which they treat all
weekend transactions as holds on your account that wo n't be processed til the end of the first business day .
So if you 've made several purchases , all of them within your balance at the time of purchase , and then you overstep and make one purchase that will overdraft the account , they practically rub their hands in glee .
They reorder all of the transactions to go in from the largest purchase amount to the lowest , " high - to - low . "
This effectively ENSURES that the largest purchase , regardless of when it was made , will deplete the funds .
It does n't stop there though , each transaction afterwards no matter how small or if its from the same place / same day , will get its very own separate $ 35 overdraft fee ; my largest overdraft fee total was $ 500 , yep .
They dont care if that $ 8 you spent at the tail end of a hectic sunday night filling up your gas tank so you could make it home was THE one that overdrafted the account , all they are concened with is that the total amount overdrafts , and then they reorder everything to maximize their profits .
The official stance of the banks on this high - low practice is that they assume that the largest purchase was the most important and cite unlikely situations such as a mortgage payment or a car insurance payment .
Get real .
Besides , they do n't even begin putting things in high - to - low UNTIL the account is overdrafted , they dont do this all the time to ' help ' customers .
And who are they to decide that my $ 8 gas purchase that overdrafted was not an emergency and essential purchase , moreso than my $ 20 lunch from the day before when I had the matching cash on hand in my account .
I have a debit card .
And by the way if you are thinking " hey , what about overdraft protection ? "
Yes , I thought it was a great idea too until I actually signed up for it an used it .
( by the way , Wachovia essentially pressured me into it ; I was down at a branch begging them to take off the overdraft fees that occured as i mentioned above , and the bank officer said ... " well , i'll take them off but only if you sign up for overdraft protection today " and i sighed and said OK , it was the $ 500 in NSF fees ! )
I do n't have a savings account with wachovia to link up to , so I opted for the wachovia credit card overdraft protection .
God .
I felt like I got my ass wiped by a Nigerian scammer .
Wachovia 's idea of overdraft protection was to set me up with a credit card with a $ 300 limit , link it autmatically to the account .
If I was ever so much as about to overdraft , they would funnel $ 100 of credit into the account .
Nice of them yes ?
That credit card had a crazy interest rate .
If I was about to overdraft , I certainly can't afford to pay back $ 100 plus the $ 10 fee for just having the automatic cash advance deposited in my account .
You could n't control it like " hey no , i dont want it , i'll pay a $ 35 fee instead , thanks ! " there was no control over how much would be deposited either , it was a minimun of $ 100 increments .
The card was a terrible credit card too , high interest rates , late fees , no grace period , etc etc .
But boring you with details is not the intention of my story , the details above are relevant and hopefully enlightening , but the real story here is that Wachovia essentially pre-emptively charged me an overdraft fee on my perfectly positive balance .
Essentially their system manipulated my account and stole money from me .
Back to the beginning of the story : I got the first overdraft notice and did n't think much of it , I _do_ regularly misjudge my finances over the weekends .
With the first notice , I was most likely busy with cassie , set it aside in a mound of paperwork and did n't consider it a priority to open ; I knew what it was , an overdraft notice .
But then I got 2 more in the mail and Veikko saw them and glowered at me , and I stammered some stuff about I 'lll go talk to the branch and see if they 'll work with me .
The next morning , Wachovia called and left a message .
I followed up calling them back , I was a bit confused , why would they be calling ?
they 've never called for overdraft notices before : never , and much to my shame they happen semi-often .
Upon being transferred to a representative , the rep immediately said " I 'm sorry , we dont take these kind of calls , we dont accept relay calls . "
I immediately asked to be transferred to a supervisor .
The supervisor confirmed it and refused to relent .
She very helpfully told me to call the TTY number , because thats " what we have for deaf customers . "
I asked her , " Do you even know what a TTY is ?
Do you even um know what it takes to make a TTY call ? "
I explained , as politly as I could that it was a very archaic piece of equipment and it required a land line ; neither of which I have .
I 'm comfortable with using relay to use regular customer services .
Even if I were to use an online - tty application , I 've found that many TTY numbers are " unmanned , " and theyre unlikely to be answered , especially not at after - business hours ( 1800 wachovia is 24hrs , and I was calling at 5 pm in the evening ) .
Essentially , TTY numbers are there for show pretty much ; even 5 years ago when I dragged out my TTY to call some businesses ' and gov't agencies '
TTY # I got no response , even over a few tries in a couple of days .
So I told her it was n't really an option for me ; what else could she suggest I do ?
She suggested that I email wachovia through the website 's email .
Sure , this might be a good option if I had any INFORMATION about why they were calling me .
In the absence of that it would take probably several emails back and forth between me and the email customer service to resolve the whole thing whereas if I had been allowed to use the phone customer service the exchange would fly back and forth fast and be done in one sitting .
Email could perhaps take days depending on the speediness of wachovia 's email reps ' responses .
Then she said I should go down to a branch office and sit down and talk to the branch manager .
I almost wanted to facetiously ask her if wachovia banks provided childcare .
Because if I went down there , my two year old was coming with me , and it would be unpleasant for all three of us .
Me trying to watch her with one eye while writing back and forth , cassie for being bored / restless or whatever the hell other mood struck her that would inevitably interfere with our discussion , and the manager for having to deal with that situation .
Finally I tell her that this is blatant discrimination .
I am being denied access to a service that is available to other paying customers if they are hearing .
God forbid I had an actual financial emergency such as placing a stop - payment or clearing a " suspected card theft " flag from my account triggered by irregular purchases ( which happened to me once and i only found out when my card was being denied for a purchase , had to call and verify identity etc to un- freeze my funds ) .
The supervisor informs me its a new policy enacted June 12 , 09 .
No wonder .
We both agree that she should make a report on this call and send it to headquarters including the recording of our conversation .
I begin doing web searches for wachovia denying relay calls , and found that the National Association of the Deaf filed a lawsuit on Aug 24 09 for this very same thing against Wells Fargo ( Wachovia is now essentially the same co as wells fargo , just have n't rolled out name changes yet )
The lawsuit asserts that Wachovia is discriminating and not complying to the ADA and wants to get a legal ruling to force wachovia to accept relay calls from deaf customers .
I promptly send off an e-mail detailing my denial of service experience to the e-mail contact and recieve a reply that evening , they are putting me in touch with the lead lawyer for the case .
It may be a class - action suit , still not sure .
So that night during cassie 's naptime , I explained the whole 9 yards of the events above to Veikko and one way or another we got into an argument about something and he muttered that I should be more financially responsible and maybe I wouldnt have to be dealing with overdraft fees .
I argue back with him that wachovia SETS people up , they have extremely deceptive business practices and there have been class action lawsuits against them for these overdraft fees , settled out - of - court .
( While searching for info on lawsuits about wachovia and discrimination I found plenty of suits against them for overdraft fee stuff ) .
He insisted that if theres no leglisation against it , too bad , its all known rules even if its " unfair , " and it then becomes * my * responsibility to track my purchases to the cent to avoid any of those fees , if I break their rules its within their rights to fine me etc as they are essentially covering my purchases .
I fume at him and decide to go sit down with my online account and study exactly how the overdrafting occured .
I pull up my account , read it line by line , date by date , recollecting each and every purchase leading up to the first overdraft , retracing my steps of the day in terms of financial purchases , tallying up all of my withdrawals against my deposits .
Dunkin donuts latte for $ 3 on my way back from the park , cassie 's pediatrican co-pay , $ 7 dinner with sandy & carl at stevi 'B's , a $ 25 thai lunch on my day " off " saturday .... in the end all adds up to a positive $ 75 balance .
And then out of the blue , after a $ 2.50 purchase , I get slapped with a NSF overdraft fee of $ 35 .
Undaunted , my account still has $ 40 in it , a positive balance .
Yet wachovia 's system has gone into gleeful overdrive , rearranging and putting in transactions from high - low to tip the odds in their favor and fill their coffers .
But my purchase amounts are still not enough to completely wipe out that $ 40 ; a $ 25 purchase , two $ 6 purchases ; I should have at least $ 2ish left in my account .
But for those 3 purchases , I was slapped with a NSF fee for each , for a total of $ 105 in fees alone ; bringing my balance to $ - 102.ish .
Why $ - 102.00 and not $ - 105.00 you ask ?
Because upon posting the fees , the system finally acknowledged that i had $ 2ish left in my account and applied it to the negative balance .
Amazing , they managed to take every last cent !
I print out a screen shot of my account and tromp over to veikko ( deeply immersed in WOW and miffed with me to boot ) and say something like " so you think they do n't set people up ?
look at this , see if you can explain it to me . " he pondered over it , got intrigued , came to my computer to look at the online transaction history himself , etc. and finally agreed , the bank made a giant mistake .
i was set up the fees .
( it was very hard to not do a gloaty dance . )
At some point afterwards , it finally dawns on me to OPEN up and look at the overdraft notices that I got in the postal mail .
I peer at the one that came first .
It says my account is purported to have $ 0.14 at the time of the $ 2.50 transaction that the overdraft fee occured ( if you recall , it had $ 75 . )
Innnteresting .
the second overdraft notice says that my account had $ 0.68 at the time of the transactions .
Very interesting , my " balance " went UP .
To add insult to injury I cannot call Wachovia since I am deaf and they wo n't take my calls as I described before , so I resolve to drag myself and cassie down to the closest large branch office first thing when we wake up .
I stomp into the Wachovia office with four very large overstuffed tote bags , not including cassie in tow with * her* doctor 's bag .
I knew we were going to be there a while so I brought a bag of toys , books & games , a bag of snacks , the diaper bag , and my laptop in its own bag .
Immediately a bank officer at the kiosk walks up to me asks what I need help with .
I manage to get her to understand " Overdraft fees " since I did n't want to dump my bags to write just yet and I see her eyes glaze over , " another one of those fee - whiners , " and she points to a standalone kiosk with an officer at it .
I 've done this before , they reserve offices for " really important " stuff like making a loan , opening accounts .
Everything else , the customer stands at a kiosk in the middle of the very large open space and talks with the reps there .
" No . I need to see the manager in an OFFICE , " I declare in writing .
I get an incredulous look .
She shows the paper to the manager who walks by .
I immediately amend the note with " I did NOT want to bring my two year old down here .
i am deaf , and wachovia 's phone customer service would not service me , therefore I am here and I need to write back and forth .
I cannot watch my toddler and be sure she doesnt run around and bother people while I am focusing on our conversation . "
The manager reads the note , nods wordlessly and walks off to his other client .
Sure enough , I chase cassie around the bank and ward her off of everything she shouldnt be touching .
He comes back and TRIES to get me to come to the kiosk claiming something like " i'm already logged in there , i can help you there . "
I repeat , " No , we need to go into your office .
I 'm sure you can sign in there too . "
He opens and closes his mouth a few times and then heads to an office and I come in with cassie , close the door , put a chair in front of it to deter her from opening the handlebar lever knob and unpack our bag of toys and set her up with a few snacks within easy reach for her .
Then I pull out my hefty macbook pro and set it up on his desk .
I open up TextEdit and begin typing to him .
I explain that I certainly did NOT want to bring my toddler here and essentially their discriminatory phone service forced my hand .
And in my experience writing back and forth adds a good amount of time to any kind of complicated discussion .
I was not about to manhandle my daughter in an open space and be a nuisance to other customers .
The hurriedness and distraction would add to our communication barriers .
I finally begin to explain to him what I was there for .
At the word , overdrafts , his eyes glaze over wearily .
Let 's look at your account and see where you overdrew .
He pulls up wachovia 's version of my account on a 1980s VAX machine lookalike program .
I play with cassie while he studies my account .
Then he smiles patronizingly .
and writes to me , " You have overdraft fees because you overdrafted with a $ 40 CVS purchase . "
Which , legitimately , was true , it was my very last purchase and had my balance been kept straight it would have overdrafted and been my only one , but FOUR other earlier overdrafts were erroneous .
" Go back futher , I say , " He looks and ponders .
He is the branch manager .
He tells me that he sees no problem .
I then pull up my screenshot of my account for the past 30 days and a scan of all 3 of my overdraft notices and I begin trying to explain things to him line by line .
He then tries the broken - record trick , writing slowly exactly what he wrote a few minutes ago , " You overdrafted when you made the $ 40 purchase at CVS and your balance was depleted . "
I ask him , may I speak with the manager , and he reminds me , he IS the branch manager .
But he will refund the fees as a complimentary courtesy , would that be okay ?
I say yes very much so .
He arranges it on the computer and signs off on it .
Expecting me to leave , he sits back and says , anything else ?
I say yes , we 're going to try this again .
Cassie was enjoying herself playing and staring through the glass door at people , I had time .
I put the paper copies of the three overdraft notices sent to me in the mail and my print - out of my account transactions and with a giant marker and making side - notes on the papers , I very painstakingly showed him how the first overdraft notice " balance " of $ 0.14 does not match my posted balance from that day last week which showed $ 75 .
Then I asked him how in the world could you charge me overdraft fees when i had the funds to cover it , pointing to the three overdraft fees after that one when clearly I still had cash in the account .
I asked , what happened here , you must know something that could explain it , it looks like outright stealing to me .
That startles him and he uses his calculator and paper and tallies up everything , getting a $ 75 positive balance at the time of the first overdraft .
Finally , he admits , he can not explain it .
But its okay now , he refunded the fees !
I ask him , " so the money is back in my account , all $ 175 of it ? "
He checks again and says yes , the funds are there now and shows me my new balance on the VAX - like program .
I smile and brighten , " Great !
thank you so much , I really appreciate you doing this , refunding the fees helps a lot . "
He stands up as he is reading smiles and tries to do the smarmy thankyougoodbye gladtobeofhelp handshake .
I pluck the paper and begin writing again .
" Can you help me with just one more thing please ? "
He nods cheerfully as most people in service jobs are trained to do , " Would be happy to . "
I then replied , " I 'd like to close my account and I 'd like my funds in cash . "
The crestfallenness was palpable .
" Yes , I can do that . "
And by the way , I never found out why Wachovia had called me and left a message to call back ; when I asked the branch manager about this he replied he did n't have acess to that information and suggested I call .
I had to take a deep breath before I reminded him about the phone situation .
He suggested helpfully that I email about it .
I guess I will never know , I no longer have access to email through my wachovia account since it is closed .
Maybe , just maybe , it was someone calling to explain a giant computer glitch and they would correct it asap .
In an extraordinary 4 ½ - hour interview from behind bars , convicted Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff told a San Francisco trial lawyer yesterday that he got away with his $ 65 billion scam because regulators were n’t paying attention .
There were times “ that he [ Madoff ] visited with the SEC .
. . when he thought , ‘ They got me , ’ ” the attorney , Joseph Cotchett , told a group of reporters camped outside a federal prison in Butner , NC , where Madoff is serving a 150 - year sentence .
Cotchett , who represented former CIA agent Valerie Plame against the Bush administration , landed the interview after threatening to sue members of Madoff ’s family , including his wife , two sons and brother .
Armed with two packs of quarters so that Madoff could get food from the prison vending machines , Cotchett and his partner Nancy Fineman grilled Madoff and his attorney about who knew what and when .
In order to take the heat off certain members of his family , Madoff “ spelled out how the fraud was committed ” during the face - to - face session .
“ He gave us a lot of information that we believe will help us aid the victims tremendously , ” Cotchett said .
“ He was very direct and did n’t hold back anything . ”
“ The detail was extraordinary .
I was very surprised at how candid and open he was . ”
Cotchett said that Madoff told him that “ it all started in the mid-’90s , ” and that the disgraced financier provided “ the details of how it all started . ”
But , Madoff was “ very remorseful . ”
Cotchett said Madoff repeatedly apologized for the harm he caused victims , about a dozen of whom are represented by Cotchett .
Cotchett declined to elaborate on specifics disclosed by Madoff yesterday , saying , “ The details of how it all went down are going to be more clearly laid out in the next complaint , ” which he said should be filed in the next few weeks .
Cotchett said it ’s safe to assume Madoff ’s brother , Peter , who served as his firm ’s chief compliance officer , will remain a target of the complaint .
Cotchett has yet to decide whether to target Madoff ’s wife Ruth or their sons Andrew and Mark .
The lawyer said he was Madoff ’s first visitor , adding that “ his wife has not been here , his son has not been here , no one ’s been here . ”
Cotchett said Madoff is estranged from his sons .
“ The sons have not spoken with their father or mother since Madoff ’s arrest on Dec. 11 . ”
“ We ’re the first people to meet with Bernie since he ’s been here , ” said Cotchett , who described him as healthy looking .
“ He seems to be working out , ” said Cotchett , adding that Madoff was looking “ a lot better ” than he ’s looked in pictures of late .
How many times have you heard Christians use Pascal ’s Wager in a debate ?
Or the canard that “ it takes more faith to be an atheist ” ?
Or the question of how we atheists can have morals or a purpose without religion ?
If you ’re my inbox , you come across it often .
I suspect most atheists who have been outspoken about their beliefs hear the same arguments from Christians over and over .
It gets tiring responding to the same bad arguments all the time .
Greta Christina makes an important point about this , though :
These arguments are old to us .
But they ’re new to them .
As long as there are people who have n’t heard our case — and who have n’t heard it more than once — we have to keep making that case .
And we have to make it patiently .
It does n’t make sense for a teacher to get annoyed and impatient with their students for not already knowing the material .
And it does n’t make sense for us to get annoyed and impatient with believers for not being familiar with our case .
We should n’t get annoyed , but it ’s hard not to .
If the questioner is sincere , however , it can lead to some great conversations .

Teaching Kids To Ride
One of the many tasks parents must undertake is teaching their children to ride bicycles .
At every stage of the learning process , there are several possible approaches , and most parents will be unsure how to proceed .
This article will try to cover the options and explain when to choose which .
This article focuses on only the most basic skills : pedaling , steering and balancing , that make it possible for a child to operate a bicycle .
There is much more to teach and to learn about cycling than this , but that is mostly beyond the scope of this particular article .
Tricycles
For most children , a tricycle is the first step in learning to ride .
The most useful tricycles are the smallest ones , like the one shown in the photo .
Ideally , a child should get a tricycle even before he or she learns to walk .
A tricycle has only two things to teach a child : steering and pedaling .
The steering usually comes first , because the child can stand on the back step with one foot and push along with the other .
Some children will be able to master this even before learning to walk .
Once the basic concept of steering has been learned , the child can start to use the pedals .
I believe that tricycles are best suited for indoor use , or use in a level , closed courtyard or driveway .
As soon as the child has become proficient in pedaling and steering a tricycle , it is time to move up to a small bike with training wheels .
Most 2 1/2 year - olds are ready for a 12 " - wheel bike with training wheels .
I would not recommend the purchase of a tricycle for a child that old .
As the child gets stronger and more confident on a tricycle , their speed potential can become faster than is safe on a tricycle , especially if they ride on surfaces that are not perfectly flat .
A tricycle can run away on even a slight grade .
Although a bike on training wheels cannot turn any faster than a tricycle , at least it has a brake !
Conventional upright tricycles become very dangerous as a child gets taller and stronger , particularly if used where there are even slight hills .
Once one of these gets moving faster than walking speed , its high center of gravity and lack of brakes makes it a recipe for disaster .
It ca n't stop without brakes , and it can't turn without flipping over .
The other common type of tricycle is the plastic semi-recumbent type , such as the " Big Wheel " ( tm ) .
These are not so durable as the older , metal trikes of traditional design , but for an older child , riding on sidewalks and the like , they are considerably safer .
Between the low center of gravity and the poor traction of the plastic wheels , they spin out in corners , instead of tipping over .
They also usually have a crude brake .
Although these are safer for an older child than upright trikes , they only postpone the day when the child will learn to ride a real bike , so a bicycle with training wheels is a better choice .
This type of trike is not as easy to handle for a young child just learning to steer and pedal , due to its awkward steering geometry .
They have an extremely shallow head angle , which makes the wheel tend to flop to one side or the other too easily .
Teaching Balance
There are three basic ways to teach a child to balance on two wheels : training wheels , assisted two - wheeling , and un-assisted two wheeling .
Each has its advantages , and best results will often be obtained by a mixed approach , adjusted to the child 's learning style and the practice area available .
Training Wheels ( Stabilisers )
Most bicycles intended for smaller children come with training wheels .
That does n't mean that training wheels are the only way , nor even the best way to teach a child to ride .
Training wheels are potentially the least painful way to learn to ride a bike , but also the slowest .
They make the most sense for families who live on very quiet , safe streets without hills .
To make good use of training wheels , you need a safe , flat driveway or wide sidewalk or other place where a child can ride with a minimum of supervision .
A bike with training wheels can be even more dangerous than a tricycle , because the child is higher up and the base width of the training wheels is fairly narrow .
This means that if the bike gets going much faster than a walk , it will topple over if the child tries to turn a corner .
Also , if the bike is turning even a little bit , weight is shifted from the rear wheel to the outside training wheel , so the braking power of the rear wheel is greatly reduced .
How To Use Training Wheels
Most people that use training wheels have them adjusted incorrectly .
The bike should always have a little bit of lean .
If both training wheels can touch the ground at once , there is little weight on the bicycle 's rear wheel .
This can reduce traction to zero .
On uneven ground , the child may get stuck because the wheel spins .
Even worse , the brake may become useless .
When the bike is new , there should be only a small amount of tilt from one side to the other .
After the child has become accustomed to pedaling , steering and braking , the training wheels should be raised slightly , a bit at a time .
It is probably better to do this without telling the child , who may object .
The bike will become more and more tippy , and the child will learn to balance automatically with practice .
As the child becomes more adept , the bike will spend more and more time with both training wheels off the ground .
The day will come when it is obvious that the training wheels are no longer doing anything , and they can be removed .
If the training wheels are left set on their lowest position , the bike is in effect an oversized tricycle , and some kids spend two or three years on training wheels as a result .
This is not only a waste of their time , it is really quite dangerous as they learn to ride faster and faster , because of the poor cornering and braking of a training - wheel equipped bike .
Eventually , the child will become heavy enough to bend the training wheel struts upward , making the bike suitably tippy .
Then they will finally learn to balance .
If a child has been using training wheels for more than two or three years , it is time to try something else .
Putting training wheels on a 20 " bike is usually a mistake , unless the child has a specific physical or mental disability .
The training - wheel approach works best for families who live on very quiet streets or have large driveways , or live near parks or other areas where the child may be left pretty much unattended .
For most families , this will not be the case , and a parent will need to accompany the child .
In this case , the " running - with - the - child " approach makes more sense , since children learn faster this way .
Running With The Child
The traditional way to teach cycling , by running along holding the child up , is still the fastest and best if an undersized bike is not available .
The parent should hold the child by the shoulders and run along behind .
It is important that the parent not hold the handlebars - the child cannot learn the feel of balancing if the parent is taking control of the bike .
If the parent holds onto the saddle or any other part of the bike , the child will not necessarily realize if they are leaning a bit to one side or the other , because the parent will be correcting for them .
Instead , hold the child by the shoulders , so that as they lean to the side , they will feel the side pressure , and can learn to reduce it by turning into the lean .
This should be done in a wide flat space , such as an empty parking lot .
The parent should not make any attempt to steer the child , just let the bike go where it will .
This is not much fun for the parent , especially if the parent is tall and has to lean over to reach the child 's shoulders - sore back time !
The parent will also have to be very careful not to bang into the bike or trip over it when the little creep swerves or puts on the brakes unexpectedly , but this approach is the fastest and most parent - involved way to teach basic balancing .
If running along holding the child by the shoulders is too uncomfortable , some parents like to make a handle out of a stick of some sort , typically wedged between the seat stays and lashed to the back of the saddle .
This does n't give as good feedback to the child , but it does work .
There are also commercial products that amount to the same thing , but I do n't generally recommend them .
A company called Wallaby Kids makes a special vest / handle that serves this purpose , with a handle above the child 's shoulder blades .
The Web site startstanding .org recommends using a towel .
The parent really has to run or at least trot , because balancing a bike at a walking pace is quite an advanced skill .
If the bike is moving too slowly , steering corrections will not move the bike sideways fast enough to correct an incipient fall .
One correspondent suggested that the parent use roller skates , but I would n't suggest this unless you are an unusually good skater .
Each of these three approaches works , and which is best for a particular family will depend on where they live , the type of bike available , and the child 's preference .
The average kid learns to balance between six and seven , given the chance .
It is not unusual for it to happen a couple of years either way .
In many cases , a combination of approaches will work best .
For instance , using training wheels is very good for teaching the child how to operate a coaster brake , so it is often best to start with the training wheels and then switch to one of the other approaches after the braking has been mastered .
The Undersized Bike Approach
The ideal bike for learning to ride , whether for a child or a deprived adult , is a bike that is " too small " for efficient riding .
For learning purposes , the rider should be able to sit on the saddle with both feet flat on the ground and the knees slightly bent .
The bike can then be used as a hobby horse or scooter , with the feet always ready to stop a fall .
It may even be useful to remove the pedals at first , so that the feet can swing freely .
( In case you are new to all this and have n't read the pages about pedals on this site : the left pedal unscrews clockwise ! )
Ideally , a bike for this approach should have at least one handbrake , so that the child can stop while using both feet for balance .
A good place to practice is on a grassy field , perhaps with a slight downgrade .
Unfortunately , it is often difficult for parents to justify the expense of a smaller bike that will be outgrown shortly , so there is a constant temptation to buy a bike that is a bit too large on the theory that the child will " grow into " it .
Scooters
A scooter can provide an excellent alternative way to learn balance , and is probably a better alternative to training wheels , especially for a child who has been depending on training wheels too long .
A scooter separates the steering / balancing function from the pedaling function , so the child can concentrate on learning to balance without the distraction of pedals .
An additional advantage of a scooter is that it is less scary than a bicycle .
One foot is on the ground much of the time , while the other is only a few inches above the ground with no obstruction to a " bail - out " .
Any child who can steer a tricycle can operate a scooter at some level of proficiency .
To start with , one foot can maintain nearly constant contact with terra firma .
As skill is acquired , the pushing foot gradually spends less and less time on the ground , until the basic skill of balancing on two wheels has been mastered .
A " Razor " scooter with its tiny wheels and spoon brake can teach balancing , but a scooter with pneumatic tires and handbrakes , like the one shown , is more stable and will accustom a child to the brakes .
A child who has learned balancing very young on a scooter may still find it hard to master starting and stopping on a bicycle .
Setting the saddle low can help .
( " Balance bikes ; Run bikes ; Push bikes ; Learner bikes ; No- pedal bikes ; pedal - less bike " )
There are a number of companies pushing re-invented draisines as an intermediate step between tricycles and bicycles .
There are a number of companies pushing re-invented draisines as an intermediate step between tricycles and bicycles .
These are a waste of time and money .
You can achieve the same effect simply by unscrewing the pedals from a real bicycle .
( You may have surfed here directly from the top of the page , so , again : the left pedal unscrews clockwise ! )
Safety Equipment
Encourage kids to start out with proper safety equipment from the get - go .
If a child gets used to wearing a helmet on a tricycle , the habit will become well established , and there will not be a later struggle about introducing a helmet .
Especially when kids are first learning to ride , gloves and even knee pads can be very worthwhile .
A child who falls and gets hurt may get turned off to bicycles at an early age , and at best will take longer to learn , because of fear .
Young children love to have their own bicycle gloves , it makes them feel really special .
They make a much more useful gift than streamers , bells or baskets .
When my daughter was little , children 's cycling gloves were not readily available , and the only gloves I could find to fit her were very high - quality leather gloves that retailed for $ 30 .
I felt a bit silly buying them , but I did anyway .
The very first time we went for a ride together on the street , she skidded in a patch of sand , and down she went .
She got up and got on the bike , and we continued on .
When I checked out the gloves later , the leather heel of her right glove was deeply abraded ... when I thought what that fall would have done to her little hand , I knew the gloves had already paid for themselves .
Brakes
Most small children 's bicycles in the U.S. come with coaster ( back - pedaling ) brakes .
The conventional wisdom is that this is desirable because : Children have weak hands , so they can't get a lot of braking power from hand brakes .
Children are rough on their bicycles , and hand brakes are too fragile to be reliable unless they are carefully maintained .
There is truth to both of these points , but handbrakes have their advantages as well : Children who are just learning to balance will often want to put their feet out whenever they fear they are about to fall .
On a bicycle with a footbrake , this means that they can't stop .
This is a very common cause of crashes among young children .
Children who have only used a coaster brake can have a difficult time re-learning old habits when they grow into a larger bicycle and have to make the transition to handbrakes .
The first time I rode a bike with handbrakes , I got going too fast on a bumpy road , tried to stop by backpedaling , crashed and broke my collarbone .
The ideal solution to this problem is to start out with a bicycle with a coaster brake , but to add a hand brake to it .
This is not a major expense , and not very difficult .
There is truth to both of these points , but handbrakes have their advantages as well :
The ideal solution to this problem is to start out with a bicycle with a coaster brake , but to add a hand brake to it .
This is not a major expense , and not very difficult .
It is better for it to be on the front wheel , so that the child will learn good braking techniques , which mainly rely on the use of the front brake .
( See also my article on Braking and Turning . )
Patience
There is a very wide range of ages at which children master basic balancing , with the average being about 6 years , but normal variation running from 4 to 9 .
It is important not to push too hard .
This can be a real problem for children of active cyclists ; excessive pressure can take all the fun out of the experience .
A bicycle trailer or cargo tricycle lets you continue with family riding with a very young child .
A child who has learned to pedal can ride on the back of a suitably - equipped tandem or on a trailer bike .
The pedaling options make the child a proud , full participant in short family rides , sometimes even before age 3 !
Allow your child to learn at his or her natural pace , and it is more likely that cycling will become a fun family activity for all of you .
Beginning early with traffic skills
There is much , much to learn about bicycling besides steering , balancing and pedaling .
Communication with the child is easy on a tandem ; the child can learn when it is safe or unsafe to go , the meaning of traffic signs and signals , etc .
The child can make hand signals for you , too .
Most children will be eager to do this .
Testimonials :
Today I accessed your website for assistance with teaching my daughter to ride a bike .
We have been trying for several days now , and although she had made fair progress , it just was n't happening yet .
I must mention that she is 10 1 / 2 years old , and has been putting off learning for all these years because of fear .
I read on your website that it is better for the child to ride an undersized bike , so I put her on her little brother 's bike .
I also stopped holding the seat and running along with her .
I tried to hold her shoulders but she did n't want me to !
Also , we went to a parking lot with a downhill slope .
Well ... she rides !
She learned within 10 minutes .
Your advice was exactly what we needed .

Starting Wednesday , those carrying concealed weapons are allowed to enter Arizona 's roughly 5,300 establishments licensed to sell alcohol , as long as they do n't drink .
If those bar and restaurant owners do n't want guns on the property , they must post a sign indicating that they are not allowed .
The law only requires one sign be posted in a " conspicuous " place , near the establishment 's liquor license .
But Al McCarthy , owner of Duke 's Sports Bar & Grill in Scottsdale , put up three signs - one for each entrance to his property - " as soon as the bill passed " nearly three months ago .
" I want to make sure there 's no confusion as to where this business stands on the issue , " McCarthy said .
" I have yet to have a customer to tell me they wish I had n't put up the sign . "
About a thousand official , laminated signs have been requested since they became available in mid-August , according to the Arizona Department of Liquor Licenses and Control , with the average establishment requesting four signs .
Business owners also have been able to download and print their own signs from the department 's Web site .
Janie Riddle , co-owner of the local chain Valle Luna , decided not to post any signs banning firearms , saying that it would be " business as usual " at the family 's three Mexican restaurants .
" We 've never had a problem in 26 - plus years , " said Riddle , whose husband , grown children and various relatives also work at Valle Luna .
" We basically talked about it as a family and as a business and just decided it was in the best interest to not prohibit law - abiding citizens from exercising their rights under the Second Amendment . "
Riddle also said they felt the presence of those carrying guns legally could deter trouble from those carrying guns illegally .
" I think it would get them to think twice , big time , " she said .
Proponents of the bill argue that concealed - weapons permit holders - who are required to undergo a background check , be fingerprinted and take an eight - hour training course - are among the most responsible gun owners .
There were 138,348 concealed - weapons permit holders in Arizona as of Sept. 1 .
Opponents are concerned that the law could create unnecessarily dangerous situations or harm the local and state tourism industry .
" I 'm not anti-firearm .
I honestly do n't think that firearms , drinking and dining are a match , " said Don Carson , who has owned Don & Charlie 's Steakhouse in Scottsdale for 28 years .
" I do n't know that I 'm looking for a gentleman with a permit for a firearm to defend me against a person who has a firearm illegally , because maybe the person with the legal firearm is n't such a good shot . "
Thirty - nine other states have " restaurant carry " laws that allow guns inside dining establishments .
Various incarnations of the bill that ultimately passed this session have appeared in the state Legislature for years .
Gov. Jan Brewer signed the bill into law on July 13 .
" We fought it , but we did n't have any partners in the industry to rely on , " said Bill Weigele , president of the Arizona Licensed Beverage Association , which originally opposed the bill .
The Arizona Restaurant Association and the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry were neutral on the bill , and no law - enforcement groups opposed it , according to Sen.
Jack Harper , R - Surprise , the bill 's sponsor .
Weigele said the new law was an eventual compromise between those who wanted to preserve business owners ' rights and those concerned with gun-carry rights .
Rather than allowing " open carries , " the law restricts the gun owner to concealed weapons .
The gun owner also is not allowed to drink .
Those who do drink while carrying - or who bring concealed weapons into establishments that have posted bans - could face Class 3 misdemeanor charges , punishable by 30 days ' jail time and a fine of up to $ 500 , according to Steve Duffy , an attorney who represented the beverage association .
They also risk loss of their concealed - carry permits .
" We made what we thought was the best deal , " Weigele said .
" If we had to die on the vine , we were going to die on the vine with some good . "
High demand , as well as laminating and postage costs , forced the liquor - licenses department to stop mailing signs to licensees , who can still obtain the free , approved sign in person from the Arizona Restaurant Association or online at azliquor.gov .
Todd Rathner , a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association , said he did not think the law would make a huge difference after it takes effect .
" I think that ultimately restaurant owners will make an economic decision to allow those 138,000 law - abiding citizens to come in and have a meal , " Rathner said , " whether they 're carrying a concealed weapon or not . "

Three New Jersey mayors and several rabbis were arrested on Thursday in a sweeping federal investigation into political corruption that also uncovered human kidney sales and money laundering from Brooklyn to Israel , authorities said .
Among the 44 people arrested were Hoboken Mayor Peter Cammarano , who took office 23 days ago .
Cammarano , at 31 the city 's youngest - ever mayor , was charged with taking $ 25,000 in bribes , including e10,000 last Thursday , said the U.S. Attorney 's office in Newark , New Jersey .
The case exposed " a corrupt network of public officials who were all too willing to take cash in exchange for promised official action , " Acting U.S. Attorney Ralph Marra said in a statement .
" It seemed that everyone wanted a piece of the action .
The corruption was widespread and pervasive . "
Central to the investigation was an informant who was charged with bank fraud in 2006 and posed undercover as a real estate developer and owner of a tile business hoping to build projects and win public contracts in northern New Jersey , according to documents in the case .
The undercover witness helped infiltrate a money - laundering
network by rabbis who operated between Brooklyn , Deal , New Jersey , and Israel and laundered millions of dollars through charitable nonprofit entities controlled by rabbis in New York and New Jersey , authorities said .
They laundered some $ 3 million for the undercover witness between June 2007 and July 2009 , authorities said .
Julio La Rosa , acting special agent in charge of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , said while traditional money laundering was once confined to narcotics traffickers and organized crime , " based on the allegations contained in today 's complaints , money laundering has no boundaries and impacts every segment of our society . "
Human kidney sales
Rabbis accused of money - laundering were Eliahu Ben Haim , the principal rabbi of a synagogue in Deal ; Saul Kassin , chief rabbi of a synagogue in Brooklyn ; Edmund Nahum , the principal rabbi of another synagogue in Deal ; and Mordchai Fish , a rabbi at a synagogue in Brooklyn .
Most of the defendants were arrested early on Thursday by federal agents .
One of the many criminal complaints filed in the case also accused a Brooklyn man , Levy Izhak Rosenbaum , with conspiring to broker the sale of a human kidney for a transplant , at a cost of $ 160,000 to the transplant recipient .
According to the complaint , Rosenbaum said he had been brokering the sale of kidneys for 10 years .
The undercover witness also helped infiltrate the huge public corruption scheme , authorities said .
A slew of public officials , council and mayoral candidates and associates took bribes for pledging their help in getting projects prioritized and approved or steering contracts to the witness , authorities said .
Accused were Secaucus Mayor Dennis Elwell , state Assemblyman Daniel Van Pelt and Jersey City Deputy Mayor Leona Beldini , according to the U.S. Attorney 's office .
Also named were state assemblymen L. Harvey Smith , and Daniel Van Pelt , who were charged with accepting bribes .
Elwell was charged with taking a $ 10,000 cash bribe , and Anthony Suarez , mayor of Ridgefield , was charged with agreeing to accept a e10,000 corrupt cash payment .
Beldini , Jersey City deputy mayor , was charged with taking $ 20,000 in illegal contributions

NEW DELHI : The government has decided to stop Chinese welders , plumbers and other semi-skilled workers from working in India in a move that is aimed at opening up more jobs for Indians but may end up delaying several key power projects using Chinese equipment .
���We have decided that for jobs where labour is available locally like welders , plumbers and fabricators , we will not allow Chinese companies working in various projects in India to get people from their country , ��� an external ministry official told ET .
The government has also asked about 25,000 Chinese , who have been working in India on business visas , to apply for work visas , said the official who wished not to be named .
This will cause an exodus as most of these business visa employees are semi-skilled people working in power , telecom and oil & gas sectors that have seen the influx of Chinese skilled and semi-skilled workers in recent years .
A few thousand Chinese workers have been helping lay the pipeline between Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh and Hazira in Gujarat for Reliance Industries .
Similarly , in the power sector , most Chinese manufacturers bring in their own manpower to set up power plants for Indian utilities that source equipment from China
�� �Chinese bring with themselves the entire set of workers who are acquainted with the equipment and the manual and so are more efficient as a team .
But removal of semi-skilled workers will create a gap that would require training of Indian workers to replace them , ��� said an executive of a power company that is using Chinese equipment .
As many as 30 power projects being implemented by companies including Reliance Power , Essar Power , Adani Power , Tata Power and Lanco Infratech are sourcing equipment from Chinese suppliers .
As per government estimates , about 20 % of the 80,610 MW new capacity under construction in the Eleventh Plan ( 2007 - 12 ) is using Chinese equipment .
Further , 31 % of Twelfth Plan projects under construction now have ordered Chinese equipment .
The decision to shut doors on semi-skilled Chinese workers , taken jointly by the ministries of labour and home , has already been put into effect with the government refusing to clear at least 800 applications for work visas over the past couple of months , said the external ministry official .
As for the business visa workers , the government set a September 30 deadline to obtain employment visa .
They are now offered a week���s extension .
India has promised to process new applications and decide on extending work visa within 45 days , the official said .
As per government figures , 69,084 Chinese were issued business visas in 2008 against 58,406 in 2007 .
About 32,700 Chinese have already been issued business visas this year till June .
The reluctance of Indian government to issue work visa to Chinese workers has been a matter of media debate for some time .
At the peak of economic boom in late 2007 , the country���s largest property firm DLF planned to bring masons , electricians and carpenters from China to overcome a labour shortage , but failed to convince the government .
S Jaishankar , India���s ambassador to China , recently told a gathering of Chinese and Indian businessmen in Beijing that Indian companies sourcing equipment and services from China should work with the sellers to reduce their dependence on Chinese workers .
This has now become a necessity as the door is now firmly shut on Chinese workers in semi-skilled areas .
( CNN ) -- Organized crime gangs are exploiting a new target for illegal profit : Medicare and Medicaid .
Experienced in running drug , prostitution and gambling rings , crime groups of various ethnicities and nationalities are learning it 's safer and potentially more profitable to file fraudulent claims with the federal Medicare program and state - run Medicaid plans .
" They 're hitting us and hitting us hard , " said Timothy Menke , head of investigations for the Office of Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services .
" Organized crime involvement in health care fraud is widespread . "
One hot spot for health care fraud is Los Angeles , California , where Russian , Armenian and Nigerian gangs have been caught by federal agents .
Recent cases include crime boss Konstantin Grigoryan , a former Soviet army colonel who pleaded guilty to taking $ 20 million from Medicare .
Karapet " Doc " Khacheryan , boss of a Eurasian crime gang , was recently convicted with five lieutenants of stealing doctor identities in a $ 2 million scam .
Two Nigerians , Christopher Iruke and his wife , Connie Ikpoh , were charged October 15 with bilking Medicare of $ 6 million dollars by fraudulently billing the government for electric wheelchairs and other expensive medical equipment .
The two , allegedly members of an organized crime ring , entered pleas of not guilty and are being held in a federal detention center .
" They deny any allegations of wrongdoing , " said their attorney , James Kosnett .
Defrauding government - run health care programs involves stealing two types of identities : those of doctors , who bill for services , and patients , whose beneficiary numbers entitle them to medical care and necessary equipment .
Criminals are expert at collecting both .
Watch doctor tell what happened when his identity was stolen
" That information is very , very valuable to these crooks .
And the doctor may work at one clinic but he wo n't know about the second and third clinic that they 've already set up using his identification , " said Glenn Ferry , special agent in charge of the Los Angeles region for the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General .
" They are definitely well - organized , well - schooled on how to commit Medicare fraud . "
Dr. Gianfranco Burdi had his identity stolen when he was recruited to join what appeared to be a new medical practice near Koreatown in Los Angeles .
After the managers failed to show a business license and proof of malpractice insurance , Burdi pulled out .
Two years later , the FBI came calling .
Agents questioned Burdi , a psychiatrist , about whether he had prescribed $ 800,000 worth of electric wheelchairs for Medicare patients .
" I said no .
I am a psychiatrist .
Why would I prescribe an electric wheelchair ? " said Burdi .
" It was shocking . "
A jury found Leonard Uchenna Nwafor guilty of using Burdi's identification to bill Medicare for medically unnecessary durable medical equipment .
" I was naive enough to provide them my medical license , my other data , " said Burdi .
Patient beneficiary numbers are easy to buy along Los Angeles ' Skid Row .
Impoverished residents of shelters there tell CNN they 've accepted cash from recruiters -- known as " cappers " -- to go to bogus medical clinics where they share what they call their " red , white and blue " -- the tri-colored Medicare card that has a beneficiary number for billing the government .
" People down here need to eat .
Somebody who comes up on a quick hustle , quick money , they going to jump on .
I 'm one of them , I will , " said a man who identified himself as Scott .
" They 're just defrauding the patients , defrauding the government . "
Jimmy Rodgers of San Bernadino , California , tells CNN he went to a clinic three times a week , receiving $ 100 per visit but little medical care .
" This is just like Carte Blanche , " said Rodgers , holding his Medicare card .
" Matter of fact , better than Carte Blanche .
Carte Blanche has limitations on it . "
The clinics , he concedes , were clearly fronts for collecting beneficiary data .
" They were no doctors .
They were just somebody who had their hand out , " said Rodgers , who later cooperated with federal investigators .

The Khacheryan gang told Medicare that health services were being provided on the 10th floor at 754 South Los Angeles Street .
But there is no doctor 's office in that decrepit industrial building -- only a mail drop , where the Khacheryan group collected checks from the U.S. government for hundreds of thousands of dollars .
The inspector general 's office of the Department of Health and Human Services estimates it is on track to recover about $ 4 billion this year by breaking up health care fraud schemes perpetrated by all types of criminals , from organized rings to corrupt doctors .
That amount , though , is only about 5 percent of the annual health care fraud cost in the United States , according to the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association .
Because government health programs operate on the honor system , law enforcement officials say it 's easy for organized crime rings and average criminals to cash in at the taxpayer 's expense .

Taiwanese police have arrested a 22 - year - old man who stabbed a nurse during a bungled robbery last week , then returned to profess his love for her .
The man stabbed the 18 - year - old woman in the back before repenting and taking her to the hospital for treatment .
" When I noticed how lovely you look , I changed my mind , " he wrote in a love note he placed on the nurse 's scooter , apologising and offering compensation .
Police arrested the unnamed man as he waited for the nurse to return .
" The suspect was caught as he tried to express his love for the victim , " said a police officer accompanying the woman , who was not seriously injured .
" It was n't a routine case , " the officer in Taiwan 's Miaoli county told the AFP news agency .
Local reports said the unnamed man had stolen her wallet , which contained 56 Taiwanese dollars , less than $ 2 ( £ 1 ) .

When Fox News ran a full - page ad in the Washington Post — as well as in two newspapers owned by Fox ’s parent company — claiming that it had been the only network to cover the 9.12 tea party rally in Washington , DC , it was more than one CNN anchor was willing to take .
“ I usually do n’t suffer fools gladly , ” CNN ’s Rick Sanchez began .
“ Especially when it comes to the fools who perpetuate falsehoods .
Well , today thousands of you flipped through the pages of the Washington Post , only to come up a lie so bold and so upsetting that frankly I ’m just not going to sit here in silence and allow my craft or my news operation to be unfairly maligned . ”

Over a large photo of the rally , the ad asks , “ How Did ABC , CBS , NBC , MSNBC and CNN Miss This Story ? ”
“ Enough is enough , ” Sanchez went on , sounding as though he had been taking lessons in righteous indignation from Keith Olbermann .
“ And yes , I ’m talking to you , Fox News .
You , who claim to be fair and balanced .
At what , I wonder ? …
They are saying we did not cover this story .
They are using a lie to try and divide people into camps . …
That ’s an offense to myself and my colleagues , who risked their lives in Iran and Afghanistan and around the world to bring the news . ”
Sanchez then backed up his charges against Fox with clips of several different CNN reporters covering various aspects of the rally and even played a clip of Fox ’s Bill O’Reilly saying smugly , “ CNN , as we mentioned , covered the anti-Obama protests , of course . ”
“ Here ’s the fact , ” Sanchez summed up .
“ We do cover the news , and we did extensively cover this event .
We did n’t promote the event .
That ’s not what real news organizations are supposed to do .
… ‘ Cover ’ is kind of like a ‘ fair and balanced ’ way of doing things .
You get it ?
You might want to look into that . ”
“ Let me address the Fox News Network now , ” concluded Sanchez , “ perhaps the most current way that I can — by quoting somebody who recently used a very pithy phrase .
Two words , that ’s all I need .
‘ You lie . ' ”

According to a story which ran in the New York Times following Sanchez ’s remarks , “ A senior CNN executive acknowledged that the network had never before confronted Fox so openly .
Later Friday CNN ran its own promotional ad on the air saying ‘ Fox News : Distorting Not Reporting . ' ”
An ABC News spokesman also called the ad “ demonstrably false ” and expressed outrage at the Post for running it .
The Post responded that it had accepted the ad after deciding that Fox was simply “ expressing its opinion ” of its competitors in the ad and not making false claims .
Post columnist Howard Kurtz added a few more details , writing that “ Fox ’s view is that the ad refers to the other networks ’ missing the larger story , not failing to cover the demonstration itself — although the photos suggest that the headline refers to the protest .
…
There is no evidence that The Post asked Fox for any substantiation . ”

Although only one page long , the list is daunting .
Satan's Whiskers , Monkey Gland , Blood & Sand , Corpse Reviver # 2 , Death in the Afternoon , Widow 's Kiss , El Diablo : one could almost mistake the cocktail names for santería ingredients .
And the sheer breadth of the different cocktails is mesmerizing ; some with egg , some with absinthe , some with champagne , some with rum .
And each of them a classic cocktail , in the truest sense of the phrase .
This is Anvil 's 100 List , a compilation of cocktails that everyone should try at least once in their lives .
Bobby Heugel and Justin Burrows , the master mixologists behind Anvil Bar & Refuge , created the list as a means of educating their customers on the long , fascinating history of cocktails .
The list itself is printed on a yellowed piece of legal - size paper , with this admonition at the top : " We at Anvil would be remiss in our duties if we did not mention that there are certain libations we feel you should try at least once in you life ... for better or worse . "
The list launches straight into the first cocktail -- an Absinthe Drip ( just absinthe and water over sugar ) -- and does n't let up until the Zombie ( which tastes better than it sounds , made with Jamaican rum , lime , lemon , pineapple , passion fruit syrup , brown sugar and angostura bitters ) .
Along the way , you cross over 400 years of history from drinks like the Port Flip ( No. 73 ) -- which dates back to at least 1887 , although Flips themselves date to the 17th century -- and the Toddy ( No. 92 ) , which dates to the 18th century .
Along the way , you 'll also run across a vast selection of familiar faces -- a Sidecar ( No. 84 ) , a Daiquiri ( No. 24 ) , a Mint Julep ( No. 55 ) -- and some unknowns which will become your new friends -- a French 75 ( No. 33 ) , a Champs Elysses ( No. 16 ) , a Jack Rose ( No. 41 ) .
You might meet a few you can do without and a few you can't live without , and that 's the whole idea .
On this past Sunday night , the bar was pleasantly busy and buzzing with the chatter of eager cocktail connoisseurs as they debated the flavors and profiles of the various libations that Matt and Sebastian -- two of Anvil 's weekend bartenders -- were intently preparing .
Patrons happily perused the long list , deciding which ones to check off next , while contrasting their current drinks with strangers .
At the end of a night at Anvil , you 're almost guaranteed at least one new friend .
Keeping track of the cocktails you 've tried is easy -- Anvil will hand you a card with 50 spaces , front and back , to get stamped every time you try one on the List .
As to what prize you 'll receive upon completion of the list ?
That 's not really the point .
The prize , after all , is a cocktail education you wo n't receive anywhere else and -- if you 're lucky -- a few friends that you 've picked up along the way .

NGC 6888 : The Crescent Nebula
Credit & Copyright : Daniel López , IAC
Explanation : NGC 6888 , also known as the Crescent Nebula , is a cosmic bubble about 25 light - years across , blown by winds from its central , bright , massive star .
This beautiful portrait of the nebula is from the Isaac Newton Telescope at Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in the Canary Islands .
It combines a composite color image with narrow band data that isolates light from hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the wind - blown nebula .
The oxygen atoms produce the blue - green hue that seems to enshroud the detailed folds and filaments .
NGC 6888 's central star is classified as a Wolf - Rayet star ( WR 136 ) .
The star is shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind , ejecting the equivalent of the Sun 's mass every 10,000 years .
The nebula 's complex structures are likely the result of this strong wind interacting with material ejected in an earlier phase .
Burning fuel at a prodigious rate and near the end of its stellar life this star should ultimately go out with a bang in a spectacular supernova explosion .
Found in the nebula rich constellation Cygnus , NGC 6888 is about 5,000 light - years away .
The health - system overhaul proposed by Sen .
Max Baucus would create millions of new insurance customers without subjecting health insurers to government - run competition -- two key victories for the much - maligned industry .
But insurers will come out on top only if a requirement that all Americans carry health insurance has teeth .
Insurers have argued that the so - called individual mandate is essential to get healthy people paying premiums and balancing out the costs of adding coverage from an influx of sick people .
Deliberations ...
Uninsured More Likely to Die , Study Finds Simply lacking health insurance can increase the risk of death by 40 percent .
Sept. 18 , 2009  -- WASHINGTON — People without health insurance are 40 percent more likely to die than those with private insurance , according to a new study whose authors say the finding underscores the need to expand coverage to the 46 million who lack it .
According to the report , published today in the Journal of Public Health , lack of health insurance was a factor in the death of as many as 45,000 people in 2005 .
Researchers lead by Dr. Andrew Wilper , of the Cambridge Health Alliance , an affiliate of Harvard Medical School , conducted a survival analysis of data from 9,000 adults under the age of 64 who were enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) .
Participants in the survey , which ran from 1986 through 1994 , were asked questions about insurance , health status , income , and education , among other things , and were examined by a physician .
Among the 9,000 participants , about 16 percent were uninsured .
People who were young , minorities , smokers , and had less education and income were more likely to be uninsured ( P=0.01 for all comparisons ) .
For the current study , researchers looked at the number of people enrolled in NHANES III who had died by 2000 and determined about 3 percent of the participants were dead .
After adjusting for factors such as obesity , exercise habits , alcohol use , and smoking status , researchers determined those without insurance were 40 percent more likely to die than those with a private insurance plan .
Researchers excluded those on Medicare or Medicaid from their analyses .
Among the other factors that increased the risk of death were clinically - verified poor health ( 222 percent ) , smoking ( 102 percent ) , being a former smoker ( 42 percent ) , and being a male ( 40 percent ) .
So , while other factors clearly make a person more likely to die , the new finding suggests that being uninsured is more hazardous to the health than previously thought .
In fact , the risk factor is 2.5 times higher than a 2002 estimate from the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) , which that suggested about 18,000 people between the ages of 25 and 64 die per year because of lack of health insurance .
Uninsured Less Likely To Seek Or Get Necessary Care
The study 's authors said previous investigations have shown that the uninsured are more likely to go without needed care , which could make them more likely to die than their insured counterparts .
Also , uninsured people are more likely to use emergency rooms , indicating that a decision not to treat a preventable illness might stem from not having insurance .
The IOM has said that having insurance improves health because it allows people to get medical care when they need it , to have a regular source of care , and to have continuity of coverage .
The authors also said the increased risk of death attributable to lack of insurance suggests that alternative measures of medical care for uninsured people , such as community health centers , do not protect against fatal medical issues as effectively as private health insurance .
" Despite widespread acknowledgment that enacting universal coverage would be life saving , doing so remains politically thorny , " the study authors said .
" Now that health reform is again on the political agenda , health professionals have the opportunity to advocate universal coverage . "
The leading Senate healthcare reform plan — from Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) — would cover about 90 percent of the uninsured , the senator said .
Baucus is the ranking member of the Finance Committee .
The study 's authors pointed out several limitations .
One is that data was collected at a single - point , so that investigators would not know if an uninsured person became insured later on .
However , the authors point out that if a person is uninsured at a specific point , he is likely to be part of a group of people who are uninsured over the long term .
The only way to guarantee you 're out at front in any race is to be in a pace car .

Why It 's Awesome :
When GM decided to nix any engines bigger than 400 cubic inches in any of its intermediate - sized vehicles , Hurst stepped in and started dropping 455 Tornado engines into Oldsmobiles .
In 1972 , after a tragic pace car accident in the previous year , none of the major manufacturers wanted to offer up a car .
Once again , Hurst stepped in , and the 72 Hurst / Olds Cutlass " executive hot rod " was the perfect choice and the only Indy 500 vehicle not sponsored by an automobile manufacturer .

In the absence of gravity , surface tension dominates the physics of fluids .
Here , in an image taken on the International Space Station , it causes water to extend from a metal loop as if it were stirred by an invisible spoon .
This stirring effect was created by using a flashlight to unevenly heat the water .
The resulting temperature difference induced an imbalance in the surface tension , causing the fluid to rotate .
Such surface - tension - triggered movement , called Marangoni convection , is less obvious on Earth , but can be seen in environments such as cooling puddles of molten steel .

Microgravity tends to produce rounder , cooler flames , as this comparison of combustion in normal gravity ( left ) and microgravity ( right ) illustrates .
Unlike on Earth , hot , less - dense air does not rise in microgravity .
As a result , other processes , like the diffusion of particles from a high temperature to a low temperature area , dominate .
Studying combustion in space reveals more about the fundamental physics of the phenomenon and could help develop fire - suppression technology for future space missions .

Crystals tend to grow bigger in microgravity ( right panel ) , as evidenced by these cubes of the mineral zeolite .
That 's because liquid - grown crystals feed on material dissolved in solution , leaving a less - dense liquid behind .
On Earth , this liquid floats upwards , creating a convection current in experimental containers that introduces flaws and limits the size of crystals .
The effect is virtually absent in microgravity .
Creating larger , purer crystals can reveal more about their basic structure and properties .
Zeolite , for example , is full of microscopic pores that can be used to filter and store materials , such as hydrogen for use in future fuel cells .

Japanese Medaka fish ( an embryo is shown here ) were among the first animals used to study embryo development in space when they flew aboard the shuttle Endeavour in 1994 .
The importance of gravity at the start of an animal 's life cycle is still a big mystery .
While Medaka fish born in space grew to resemble their Earth - born brethren , experiments on other animals , from mice to clawed toads , have shown that weightlessness can have a significant impact on early development , making many more prone to physical abnormalities .
( Image : NASA Marshall Space Flight Center )
The absence of gravity is n't the only environmental factor that changes when animals fly in space .
They must also withstand heavier doses of solar and cosmic radiation .
Lichen and bacteria have been able to survive exposure to the combination of the airless vacuum and intense radiation of space .
But so far only one animal – a microscopic invertebrate known as a " water bear " , or tardigrade , has done the same .
During a European rocket experiment in 2007 , some tardigrades were exposed to both the sun 's intense ultraviolet radiation and the vacuum of space , while others were shielded from radiation and only exposed to the vacuum .
Only a handful exposed to radiation could be revived , but many survived the vacuum alone .

A large part of space research has focused on the physiological effects of microgravity .
Free - fall has been shown to affect astronauts ' ability to judge size and distance and to cause the loss of red blood cells and muscle mass .
But the biggest toll may be on the bones .
Even with a rigorous exercise regimen , most people lose an average of about 1.5 per cent of their bone mass in certain body parts – such as the hips – for every month in space .
That is about the same amount of bone mass that a post - menopausal woman loses in a year .
Researchers are working to reduce this effect , in part with vertical treadmills that simulate microgravity conditions .

Weightlessness may be doubly dangerous for fending off infection .
Space travel seems to weaken the immune system , and it may also make a range of microbes deadlier than they are on Earth .
A flight of the space shuttle Atlantis in 2006 showed that the bacterium Salmonella typhimurium ( shown here in red ) was nearly three times as likely to kill mice .
Microgravity also seems to boost the virulence of methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , an antibiotic - resistant superbug that is a common cause of infection in hospitals .
A firm called Astrogenetix is now studying this increased potency to isolate factors responsible for virulence in the hopes of producing vaccines .
( Image : NASA )
This suitcase - sized experiment may look like the ultimate cosmetics kit , but it is used to test the effect of radiation on a range of materials , from ceramics to spores .
The first Materials International Space Station Experiment ( MISSE ) box was attached to the station in 2001 .
Astronauts from the space shuttle Discovery removed the sixth set of boxes from the station on 1 September this year .
A recent NASA report on space station science called MISSE " perhaps the most prolific suite of experiments to date " aboard the outpost .
( Image : NASA - MSFC )
The International Space Station has played host to a clutch of mini-satellites , soccer - ball - sized devices that are part of a project called Synchronized Position Hold Engage Re-Orient Experimental Satellites ( SPHERES ) .
This trio has been used to test control programmes that allow satellites to fly in formation with minimal human intervention .
Individual space satellites could be coordinated to make powerful telescopes .
Better control procedures could also enable spacecraft to dock autonomously , an ability that could be useful for assembling objects in orbit .

People have been stockpiling supplies of 100 watt bulbs
It is light , bright and has been around for 120 years .
But from Tuesday the 100 watt bulb bows out from Britain .
Under new EU rules the manufacture and import of 100 watt bulbs and all frosted bulbs will be banned in favour of the energy - saving variety .
According to the Energy Saving Trust , compact fluorescent lamps ( energy - saving bulbs ) use 80 % less electricity than standard bulbs .
They could also save the average household £ 590 in energy over their lifetime of between eight and 10 years , and if all traditional bulbs were replaced , the carbon saving would be the equivalent of taking 70,000 cars off the road .
Good reasons .
But while cutting carbon and cheaper bills might entice many , others are less happy .
Commonplace complaints about the new bulbs include they take too long to warm up , they are ugly , they give off poor light and they contain mercury - making them potentially hazardous and hard to get rid of .
THE PHASING OUT
Any bulb with frosted , opal , pearl or other translucent finish - unless category A energy savers - will be banned from 1 September 2009
All clear bulbs must be energy rating category E or better from 1 September 2009 100W bulbs and above must be at least category C from 1 September 2009 75 W bulbs and above must be category C or better from 1 September 2010 60 W bulbs and above must be at least category C from 1 September 2011
All clear bulbs must be at least category C from 1 September 2012
And according to campaigners , energy - saving bulbs can trigger migraines , exacerbate skin conditions and lead to other serious health problems .
When many retailers , including most supermarkets , announced they were signing up to a voluntary scheme to phase out traditional incandescent bulbs in January - ahead of the September deadline - there was wide - scale panic buying .
Supermarkets reported a massive run on the traditional type , while the Daily Mail gave away 25,000 incandescent light bulbs in " outrage at further European intervention in British affairs " .
One opponent , Glynn Hughes , from Preston , decided he could n't face life without 100 watts .
" I 've bought a 15 - year supply of the old - fashioned , incandescent light bulbs , " he told the BBC .
" I reckon in 15 years people will have worked out that these things are n't good for you and we 'll be able to buy as many as we want of the old ones . "
It is , he believes , a question of human rights .
" It 's totally unfair .
As human beings we are entitled to choose whether we believe the , some might say rumours , of the danger of low - energy light bulbs or whether we ignore it .
" At the moment we 've got the choice .
As of 1 September , we 've no choice . "
Health concerns
For some , the ruling could have serious side effects .
David Price , of Spectrum , an alliance of charities working with people with light - sensitive health conditions , says the government is " disregarding " public concerns .
" Health is important and it should come over anything else , but they 're not looking after ours , " he said .
The new low - energy bulbs , particularly the ones in coils or rings , trigger people 's migraines
Lee Tomkins
Migraine Action Lee Tomkins , director of Migraine Action , is urging sufferers to stockpile the old - fashioned bulbs before retailers run out , while the the Royal National Institute of Blind People suggests using tungsten halogen bulbs instead of energy - saving bulbs in hallways and stairs .
However , the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs denies they are a risk , saying the new bulbs are now " flicker free " .
" CFL bulbs used to operate at mains frequency ( 50 Hz ) .
They are now designed to operate at 1,000 times that frequency , " a spokesman said .
Claims of poor lighting were also untrue , he said .
" The light is bright and clear and tests conducted by the Energy Saving Trust suggest that the majority of people cannot tell the difference between the light of a new CFL and an incandescent bulb . "
He also said EU health experts had concluded that there was not enough evidence to suggest the modern lamps could aggravate epilepsy or migraines .
Even so , says Lee Tomkins : " Be sensible and use the old incandescent bulbs where you can .
" The new low - energy bulbs , particularly the ones in coils or rings , trigger people 's migraines . "
She added that the charity was in talks with light bulb manufacturers who had been " fantastic " and trials were planned later this year to try to see " if any of the new light bulbs could be adapted to be suitable " .
Meanwhile , shopkeepers are reporting many are indeed stockpiling 100 watt bulbs , although a quick search of the internet shows there are still plenty for sale .
Lesley Urrutia , of Pilton Electrical in Cardiff , said customers - many elderly - appeared to be panic buying .
" Normally I might sell 10 - but I 'm selling more than 80 a day , " she said .
" It 's good for business but there is no need for people to panic . "

Carrots used to be better !
-
Vegetables grown decades ago were much richer in vitamins and minerals than the varieties most of us get today .
The main culprit in this disturbing nutritional trend is soil depletion : Modern intensive agricultural methods have stripped increasing amounts of nutrients from the soil in which the food we eat grows .
Sadly , each successive generation of fast - growing , pest - resistant carrot is truly less good for you than the one before .
A landmark study on the topic by Donald Davis and his team of researchers from the University of Texas ( UT ) at Austin 's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry was published in December 2004 in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition .
They studied U.S. Department of Agriculture nutritional data from both 1950 and 1999 for 43 different vegetables and fruits , finding reliable declines in the amount of protein , calcium , phosphorus , iron , riboflavin ( vitamin B2 ) and vitamin C over the past half century .
Davis and his colleagues chalk up this declining nutritional content to the preponderance of agricultural practices designed to improve traits ( size , growth rate , pest resistance ) other than nutrition .
( J Am Coll Nutr . 2004 Dec;23(6):669-82 .
Changes in USDA food composition data for 43 garden crops , 1950 to 1999 .

The Organic Consumers Association cites several other studies with similar findings : A Kushi Institute analysis of nutrient data from 1975 to 1997 found that average calcium levels in 12 fresh vegetables dropped 27 percent ; iron levels 37 percent ; vitamin A levels 21 percent , and vitamin C levels 30 percent .
A similar study of British nutrient data from 1930 to 1980 , published in the British Food Journal , found that in 20 vegetables the average calcium content had declined 19 percent ; iron 22 percent ; and potassium 14 percent .
The key to healthier produce is healthier soil .
Alternating fields between growing seasons to give land time to restore would be one important step .
Also , foregoing pesticides and fertilizers in favour of organic growing methods is good for the soil , the produce and its consumers .
Those who want to get the most nutritious fruits and vegetables should buy regularly from local organic farmers .
Vegetables arenât as healthy as they used to be does n't mean we should avoid them .
Vegetables are still extraordinarily rich in nutrients and beneficial phytochemicals and vegetables and fruit are our best sources for these .
Read more about whether foods tasted better in days gone by , at Life in the 1900 's here .
Carrots contain elements that keep us healthy on many levels .
The 3 most important elements are Beta - carotene , Alpha Carotene , and Phytochemicals .
Beta carotene usually receives most attention when examining carrots .
It is one of about 500 similar compounds called carotenoids , which are present in many fruits and vegetables .
Beta - carotene is not , in itself , a vital nutrient for humans ; however , the human body converts it into vitamin A , which we do need .
The benefit of beta - carotene being our source of vitamin A is that our bodies wonât produce excess amount of the vitamin , which can be toxic when consumed to overzealously , or in pill form .
There are two forms of vitamin A we get from our food .
Pre - formed vitamin A , retinol , which is animal - based , and carotenoids , which are plant - based .
Beta - carotene is one of the most readily available carotenoids and is found abundantly in carrots .
The body changes beta carotene into vitamin A , which is important in strengthening the immune system , keeping the skin , lungs and intestinal track in order , and promoting healthy cell growth .
Beta - carotene is found primarily in dark green , red , yellow , and orange - coloured plants , and is converted by the body into vitamin A and also works on its own .

Because beta - carotene is an antioxidant , and anti-oxidants are important in the fight against heart disease , studies have found that high doses of beta carotene may lower the risk of heart disease by as much as 45 % .
However , the same studies also show that high levels of beta carotene taken in pill form , do n't work .
Further , a study conducted in the United States showed that participants who ate about 1 cup of carrots a day , reduced their blood cholesterol levels by approximately 11 % .
This was attributed to the high soluble fibre content of carrots , mostly in the form of pectin .
( more on beta - carotene here )
Because beta - carotene in a carrot is fat soluble , actually adding a little butter ( or other fatty intake ) when cooking helps the body make the best use of the nutrient .
The highest content is found in the deepest orange or red colours of carrots .
There is a red variety called Juwarot which is known to be one of the highest , though it 's not often available in normal shops , but you can find the seeds in good garden centres and online .
It has been recorded as having 249 mg per kilo , the average carrot has about 100 .
Vitamin
A is a pale yellow primary alcohol derived from carotene .
It affects the formation and maintenance of skin , mucous membranes , bones , and teeth , vision and reproduction .
In addition dietary Vitamin A , in the form of beta carotene , an antioxidant , may help reduce the risk of certain cancers .
However , beta carotene is much more than the precursor for vitamin A .
Only so much beta carotene can be changed into vitamin A , and that which is not changed contributes to boosting the immune system and is also a potent antioxidant .
It is an essential component needed for a healthy diet and lifestyle ; one of its main functions is to preserve oneâs eyesight .
This vitamin is necessary for the formation and development of teeth , bones and connective tissues .
It is known to protect the integrity and keep the skin healthy , the digestive system , is essential to the epidermal cells called keratinocytes that maintain nerves and blood vessels and helps maintain the lining of the urinary tract and lungs .
It also helps fight viral infections , keeps the immune system working at its peak , may help ward off certain cancers and is required for DNA translations in the reproductive systems of both males and females as well as lessen the risk of premature aging .
Antioxidants fight free radicals and help prevent them from causing membrane damage , DNA mutation , and lipid ( fat ) oxidation , all of which may lead to many of the diseases that we consider " degenerative . "
Exposure to sunlight , cigarette smoke and air pollution , along with your body 's every day cellular activities , cause free radicals to form .
It is free radical havoc that scientists believe is pivotal in the development of age related degenerative diseases such as cancer , cataracts , arthritis , heart disease an even asthma .
It is highly recommended that vitamin A be consumed from the diet rather than from supplements ( particularly in the case of beta carotene ) , because vitamin A obtained from a varied diet offers the maximal potential of health benefits that supplements cannot .
The richest sources of preformed vitamin A are liver , fish liver oils , milk , milk products , butter , and eggs .
Liver is an especially rich source because vitamin A is primarily stored in the liver of animals and humans .
There are actually two types of vitamin A .
The first is called retinoid that includes retinol , which is found in foods of animal origin , such as ; liver , kidney , butter , whole milk , egg yolks , shrimp , cod liver oil and whole cream .
The second is called provitamin A which is part of the carotenoid family , such as beta - carotene which can be found in sweet potatoes , Bok Choy , carrots , spices , lettuce , dried herbs , butternut squash , cantaloupe , dried apricots , dark leafy greens , Romaine lettuce and winter squashes .
As you can see Vitamin A intake is essential to human health .

Everyone should be aware of the signs of vitamin A deficiency .
Some of the symptoms and conditions that individuals can experience and be diagnosed with are ; hypothyroidism , bone deformities , irritability , depression , night blindness , stress , frequent cold , dry eyes , goose bumped skin , poor growth in children and frequent viral infections .
One wonderful principle of vitamin A is that it remains stable in foods that are exposed to heat .
Not having the vitamin affected when foods are cooked is great since it retains the nutrients that are essential to receive the dietary amount of vitamin A necessary from meats , daily products and vegetables .
In fact , when vegetables , prepared for a meal and they are processed by being chopped , sliced , pureed and cooked actually allows the carotenoid in the vegetables , such as the beta - carotene to become more available throughout the foods that are being consumed and absorbed more quickly into a personâs system .
Be sure to include these foods into your day to obtain the right amount of vitamin A that is necessary to balance oneâs diet and lifestyle
Alpha carotene .
Beta carotene is not the only carotenoid .
Often overlooked , and also found in carrots , is alpha carotene .
According to an article in NCI Cancer Weekly ( Nov. 13 , 1989 ) , Michiaki Murakoshi , who leads a team of biochemists at Japan 's Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine , contends that alpha carotene may be more powerful than beta carotene in inhibiting processes that may lead to tumour growth .
Murakoshi indicates that neuroblastoma ( cancer ) cells coated with carotenoids experience a drop in N - myc activity compared to untreated cells .
N-myc is a gene that codes for cell growth - stimulating proteins and can contribute to cancer formation and growth .
Alpha carotene was found to be about ten times more inhibitory toward N-myc activity than beta carotene .
Murakoshi concludes that all types of carotenoids should be studied for possible health benefits .
Phytochemicals which are found in vegetables , fruits , and nuts , may reduce the risk of cancer , strokes , hinder the ageing process , balance hormonal metabolism , and have antiviral and antibacterial properties .
A phytochemical is a natural bioactive compound found in plant foods that works with nutrients and dietary fibre to protect against disease .
Research suggests that phytochemicals , working together with nutrients found in fruits , vegetables and nuts , may help slow the ageing process and reduce the risk of many diseases , including cancer , heart disease , stroke , high blood pressure , cataracts , osteoporosis , and urinary tract infections .
They can have complementary and overlapping mechanisms of action in the body , including antioxidant effects , modulation of detoxification enzymes , stimulation of the immune system , modulation of hormone metabolism , and antibacterial and antiviral effect .
" Phyto " is a Greek word that means plant and phytochemicals are usually related to plant pigments .
So , fruit and vegetables that are bright colours - yellow , orange , red , green , blue , and purple - generally contain the most phytochemicals and the most nutrients .
You can benefit from all of the phytochemicals and nutrients found in plant foods by eating 5 - 9 servings of fruit and vegetables a day and eating more whole grains , soya and nuts .
More than 900 different phytochemicals have been found in plant foods and more will be discovered .
These protective plant compounds are an emerging area of nutrition and health , with new research reported every day .
Current research suggests that most fruit and vegetables contain phytochemicals and that many fruit and vegetables contain a wide variety of phytochemicals .

From the above 3 elements , carrots benefit our bodies by :
Boosting immunity ( especially among older people ) .
Reducing photosensitivity ( beta - carotene protects the skin from sun damage ) .
Improving symptoms of HIV .
Easing alcohol withdrawal symptoms .
Helping to heal minor wounds and injuries .
Prevent infection : Raw carrot or boiled are applied on cuts and wounds as an antiseptic .
Reducing the risk of heart disease .
Reducing the risk of high blood pressure .
Cleansing the liver , and when consumed regularly , can help the liver excrete fats and bile .
Fighting bronchitis .
Fighting infection ( vitamin A keeps cell membranes healthy , making them stronger against disease - causing micro organisms )
Improving muscle , flesh , and skin health .
Helping fight aneamia .
Reducing acne .
Improving eye health Anti ageing - Carrots are considered anti-ageing foods as they are rich in beta - carotene , an antioxidant that fights free radicals .
Boost beauty : Carrots are rich in antioxidants and vitamin A , both responsible for healthy skin , hair and nails Dental health : Consumption of carrots improves the dental health by clearing plaque .
Biting on carrots increases the production of saliva , hence balances the acid level which fight cavity - causing bacteria .
Pigment Power in Carrot Colour
Have you ever seen a purple carrot ?
How about white , yellow , red or black ?
Most people have n't , even though such carrots have existed for hundreds of years .
They are available in good health food stores , often called " Rainbow Packs " .
Carrots were originally purple or red , with a thin root .
Orange carrots arrived from natural mutations of yellow forms , and then by human selection and development , probably in the Netherlands .
It is thought that humans made selections from a genepool involving yellow rooted eastern carrots , cultivated white - rooted derivatives of wild carrot ( grown as medicinal plants since classical times ) and wild unselected populations of adjacent Daucus Carota subspecies in Europe and the Mediterranean .
It is thought that Dutch breeders used a mutant seed from North Africa to develop the orange variety into a stable and reliable plant for domestication .
( see the colour timeline here )
The first carrots were grown for medicinal purposes , perhaps the medicine tasted good !
There is lots more in the history pages - here .
Research at the University of Wisconsin - Madison suggests that pigments in these colourful carrots , which taste just like regular carrots , may help prevent heart disease and cancer , and reduce cholesterol .
Studies examining the health benefits of fruits and vegetables are revealing the disease - preventive powers of the pigments that give plants their distinctive colours .
Orange carrots get their colour from beta carotene , a pigment the body converts to vitamin A. Vitamin A deficiency , although rare in the United States , poses a major public health problem in developing countries second only to protein malnutrition .
According to the World Health Organization , vitamin A deficiency partially or totally blinds nearly 350,000 children from more than 75 countries every year .
Roughly 60 percent of these children die within months of going blind .
However , vitamin A deficiency is preventable .
Factors Affecting the Colour of Carrots
The main variation in the colour of carrot is due to genotype , the development of the plant , the temperature during the growing season and also other agronomic practices such as the use of fertilisers .
( reference Bajaj et al 1980 , Van de Burg et 2000 - Plant food Human Nutrition 30 : 97-107 ; Journal of Food Science and Agric 80:880-912 )
Carrot ( Daucus carota ) is a biennial plant that accumulates massive amounts of carotenoid pigments in the storage root .
Although the root of carrot plants was white before domestication , intensive breeding generated the currently known carotenoid - rich varieties , including the widely popular orange carrots that accumulate very high levels of the pro-vitamin A carotenoids b- carotene and , to a lower extent , a - carotene .
Recent studies have shown that the developmental program responsible for the accumulation of these health - promoting carotenes in underground roots can be completely altered when roots are exposed to light .
Illuminated root sections do not enlarge as much as dark - grown roots , and they contain chloroplasts with high levels of lutein instead of the b-carotene - rich chromoplasts found in underground roots .
Analysis of carotenoid gene expression in roots either exposed or not to light has contributed to better understand the contribution of developmental and environmental cues to the root carotenoid profile .
Young carrot roots are pale but after the first month of growth they start accumulating carotenoids to reach highest levels in about 3 months , just before secondary growth is completed .
It is likely that wild carrot plants had uncolored roots of a bitter taste and a woody core but were initially cultivated because of their aromatic leaves and seeds .
Carrot domestication probably took place around the 10th century but despite intensive breeding procedures since the 19th century , the background structure coming from demographic and early cultivation history still persists in currently cultivated carrot germplasm .
At present , carrots ( i.e. mature D. carota roots ) are available in a range of colors , although orange varieties are most popular .
Even though the high carotene content in carrots makes them one of the richest pro-vitamin A sources in the human diet , the mechanisms regulating their production remained poorly known until recently .
( ref - Biosynthesis of carotenoids in carrot :
An underground story comes to light Manuel Rodriguez - Concepcion , , Claudia Stange - Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 539 ( 2013 ) 110â   116 )
Main factors affecting colour include :
1. Temperatures above and below the optimum ( above 70 Â° and below 60 Â°F ) reduce the colour of carrots .
2. Spring and summer carrots are often of better colour than autumn and winter .
3. Carrots grown on sandy soils and soils high in organic matter produce a higher colour than did carrots on silt loams .
4. Excessive water decreases the colour .
5 . Reducing the number of daylight hours has reduced the colour .
Colour is more intense in the older portions of the root .
It decreases from the epidermis and centre toward the cambium , and from the top to the bottom .
Studies have been carried out in the USA on the differing properties of different coloured carrots with the following results : Orange Carrots contain beta carotene , with some alpha - carotene , both of which are orange pigments .
High in Vitamin A essential for well - being , healthy eyes .
These carrots originate from Europe and the Middle East .
Like all carrots these are a good source of fibre , which is vital for healthy gastrointestinal tracts and is linked to reducing cholesterol .
Their pre-dominant pigment is beta - carotene ; the orange pigment which is converted by the liver to vitamin A which is important for healthy vision .
It forms rhodopsin , which the eye needs to see in dim light .
This is accomplished by raising the effectiveness of the light sensitive area of the retina .
Vitamin
A also maintains the surface linings of the respiratory , urinary , and intestinal tracts , and regulates the immune system by helping white blood cells fight infections .
Yellow carrots contain xanthophylls and lutein , pigments similar to beta carotene , which help develop healthy eyes aid in the fight against macular degeneration and may prevent lung and other cancers and reduce the risk of astherosclerosis ( hardening of the arteries ) .
These came from the Middle East .
The major pigment found in the yellow carrots is xanthophyll which helps develop healthy eyes .
Studies have shown that intake of xanthophyll - rich foods are associated with a significant reduction in the risk for cataract ( up to 20 % ) and for age - related macular degeneration ( up to 40 % ) ( Moeller , Jacques & Blumberg 2000 ) .
Yellow Carrot page .
Red carrots are tinted by lycopene , ( another form of carotene ) a pigment also found in tomatoes and watermelon ; lycopene is associated with the reduced risk of macular degeneration , serum lipid oxidation , helps prevent heart disease and a wide variety of cancers including prostate cancer .
Originally from India and China .
Red carrots contain the pigment known as lycopene which has been associated with a lowered risk of prostate cancer in men and heart disease .
It also helps maintain healthy skin .
Red Carrot page
White carrots lack any pigmentation , but do contain other health - promoting substances called phytochemicals , natural bioactive compounds found in plant foods that work with nutrients and dietary fibre to protect against disease .
One might say these are the least healthy of carrots .
They originate from Afghanistan , Iran , Pakistan .
These chemicals may be important in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis , which is the build up of fatty deposits in artery walls .
White carrots are preferably used in baby foods to prevent them from forming orange skin .
White carrot page Purple carrots ( usually orange inside ) have even more beta carotene than their orange cousins , and get their pigment from an entirely different class , the anthocyanins , these pigments act as powerful antioxidants that protect key cell components , grabbing and holding on to harmful free radicals in the body .
Anthocyanins also help prevent heart disease by slowing blood clotting and are good anti inflammatory agents .
These originate from Turkey , and the Middle and Far East .
Purple carrot page The Purple Haze variety have a more purple / red and white centre .
Purple carrots neutralize the damaging effects of free radicals which disrupt the structure of other molecules leading to cellular damage , aging , and various health problems .
Anti-inflammatory properties of anthocyanins have also been observed .
They neutralize enzymes that destroy connective tissue and they repair damaged proteins in blood vessel walls .
Finally , anthocyanins may prevent heart disease by slowing blood clotting and inhibiting the absorption of LDL , the bad cholesterol .
Black Carrots contain anthocyanins , part of the flavonoid family with antioxidant properties .
Flavonoids are currently under investigation as anticancer compounds , as free radical scavengers in living systems , as well as inhibitors of LDL ( the bad ) cholesterol and the black carrot anthocyanins are especially active .
The Black variety has anti-bacterial and anti-fungicidal properties and oil made from its seed can help control scalp itchiness and provides essential nutrients for hair growth .
The ancient black carrot has been making a comeback , not so much for culinary purposes but as a source of natural food colorants .
These originate from Turkey , and the Middle and Far East .

Factors affecting taste / flavour of Carrots
The taste of carrots is a unique composition between sweet , fruity and more harsh or bitter flavours .
Many factors affect the balance between the different flavours in carrots and thus contribute to the final taste .
Sweet taste is more common in the centre and lower , tip , part of the carrot .
The phloem is mostly sweeter and also bitterer than the xylem .
Bitter taste is more often detected in the upper and outer part of the carrot .
The amount of sugar in the carrots has a clear correlation to the perception of sweetness .
The amount of sugar can also contribute in masking bitter taste in carrots .
One possible reason for the increases in bitter taste during storage is decreasing sugar content .
The sugar in carrots consists mainly of sucrose , glucose and fructose .
During the seedling phase no soluble sugar is stored , in the second phase only reducing sugar and in the third phase , starting some 50 days after sowing mainly sucrose is stored in the carrot root .
The reduction in sugar during storage mainly concerns sucrose .
The total amount of sugars do not differ so much between different parts of the carrot .
( ref - Introductory Paper at the Faculty of Landscape Planning , Horticulture and Agricultural Science 2007:2 Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences Alnarp , September 2007 )
Carrot flavour and aroma are made up of sugars and terpenoids .
The natural sugars , sucrose , glucose , fructose , and maltose give carrots their sweet flavour .
The organic chemicals or compounds called terpenoids give carrots their characteristic aroma .
The flavour of raw carrots is mainly due to sugars and volatile terpenoids , with the latter accounting for most odour .
There certainly are other chemicals involved but these are the major players .
Texture also plays a very large role in perception of carrot flavor , and that 's primarily due to structural carbohydrates , primarily pectin compounds , but not much is known about them , other than that they very widely across carrot cultivars
Young carrots develop terpenoids first ; these are volatile compounds , meaning they are aromatic .
Terpenoids can smell like pine , wood , citrus , and turpentine .
A carrot harvested too early can taste bitter and soapy .
As carrots grow , natural sugars develop through photosynthesis and are stored in the root .
When days are warm and nights cool , carrots make sugar during the day , but do n't expend that sugar energy at night .
In other words , the carrot grows sweeter .
( When nights are warm ( 60 F or greater , carrots respire and burn but sugar energy . )
Carrots are sweetest when they mature at the time of year when the days are warm and the nights are cool .
As well , the best time to harvest a carrot is at the end of a warm day as it finishes manufacturing new sugars through photosynthesis .
In the life of a carrot , terpenoids - driven taste come first and , in time , are balanced with sugar flavours .
The sweet carroty flavor is the perfect combination of terpenoids and sugars .
Cooking breaks down the terpenoids in carrots and at the same time releases natural sugars .
Cooked carrots will be sweeter than raw carrots .

Do not overdose
Consumption of too many carrots has been linked to the following side effects ;
1. Interference of other nutrient absorption
Consumption of many carrots increases the amount of fibre intake in the body which interferes with the absorption of other nutrients , such as iron , zinc , magnesium and calcium .
This can lead to deficiency of those nutrients aw well as proteins and fat which are absent in carrots hence affecting body processes such as growth , tissue repair , immune function and making of hormones and enzymes .
2. Digestive discomfort
Carrots contain a desirable amount of insoluble dietary fibers which results to intestinal discomfort by hindering their digestion .
It is not easy to digest such amount of fibre thus this causes stomach gas , bloating , stomach cramping and also constipation .
It is very important to take plenty of water when you have taken a high fiber diet like the carrots .
3. Skin discoloration
Eating too many carrots causes to a condition called carotenemia ( more below ) which is a result of increased beta - carotene in the bloodstream which lead to skin colour changing to orange .
This condition is mostly evident on the palms , soles of the feet and ears and disappears gradually on a lower - carotene diet ( excluding carrots ! ) .
By Robert Samuelson - September 21 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
For years , American presidents have faced a China conundrum :
How to deal with a country that practices predatory trade without unleashing global protectionism ?
President Obama 's recent decision to slap high tariffs on Chinese tire imports for three years , starting at 35 percent and dropping to 25 percent in the final year , reflects the dilemma .
To do nothing about China 's trade policies is to encourage more of the same .
But to attack them too aggressively might undermine U.S. - China cooperation on other issues ( from North Korea to financial regulation ) and risk a wider trade war .
The $ 16 billion wholesale tire market seems an unlikely flash point .
It 's true that from 2004 to 2008 Chinese imports rose from 3 percent to 11 percent of U.S. consumption ( all imports accounted for 42 percent ) .
The Chinese tires undercut prices of comparable U.S. tires by about 19 percent , reports an investigation by the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) .
Over the same period , four tire plants shut , and employment dropped by almost 5,200 .
Three more factories , with an estimated 3,000 workers , could go by year - end , leaving 25 plants and about 28,000 workers .
Still , cheap imports are n't the industry 's only problem .
The recession , depressed vehicle sales and less driving have also hurt .
At best , high tariffs might stabilize employment .
Critics plausibly argue that the loss of Chinese tires will stimulate imports from other countries ( Indonesia , Mexico ) or increase production from underutilized U.S. factories without more hiring .
Higher tire prices might dampen other consumer spending .
The net effect on the economy , though small , is unclear .
Understandably , the Chinese reacted harshly .
The tariffs were imposed under an obscure provision of U.S. trade law allowing complaints against Chinese imports that " cause or threaten to cause market disruption . "
The legal standard for this , as determined by the ITC , is lax , but the president must approve final tariffs .
President Bush said " no " four times .
Now that Obama has said " yes , " China must fear more cases , involving steel , clothes , shoes and who knows what else .
To deter more restrictions , China has threatened legal action against allegedly underpriced imports of U.S. auto parts and chickens .
Tit - for - tat retaliation could ignite a global trade war .
If United States and China do it , why should n't everyone else ?
Limits on tires , auto parts , chicken -- or whatever -- might inspire similar measures from other countries to prevent diversion of goods into their markets .
Flirting with protectionism is dangerous .
Announcing the tariffs shortly before the Sept. 24 - 25 economic summit of G - 20 countries in Pittsburgh makes the predictable pious anti-protectionist pronouncements even less believable .
But tolerating China 's predatory trade practices also is dangerous .
China 's cheap exports reflect more than low wages .
Government actively promotes and subsidizes exports , especially through a deliberately undervalued currency .
The undervaluation lowers the prices of Chinese goods .
Economist Nicholas Lardy of the Peterson Institute figures the present price advantage at between 15 percent and 20 percent .
It might be more .
Economist Eswar Prasad of Cornell University argues that cheap credit and subsidized land and energy further enhance the price competitiveness of Chinese exports .
Similarly , the undervalued currency deters imports by making them more expensive , and China also favors local production by other policies .
European companies have complained , for example , that China discriminates against them in its market for solar and wind power .
While the world economy boomed , these policies produced growing trade surpluses and bulging foreign exchange reserves that , reinvested in U.S. Treasury bonds and other securities , arguably lowered interest rates and contributed to the financial crisis .
Now , the same mercantilist policies may export unemployment elsewhere .
The United States is hardly the only target .
Europe and other developing countries also suffer from underpriced Chinese exports .
Meanwhile , China can tap its huge foreign exchange reserves , now $ 2.1 trillion , to buy control of more raw materials ( oil , minerals , food ) and foreign companies .
By and large , this is a formula to expand China 's economic power at everyone else 's expense .
The Chinese defend these policies , but even they increasingly recognize the drawbacks of their trade dependence .
The world recession has shrunk overseas markets , and exports have plunged .
China correctly responded by stimulating its domestic economy .
Lardy , for one , thinks the prospects for sustaining rapid economic growth are good , because -- among other reasons -- debt levels are low .
Household debt is about 20 percent of gross domestic product in China compared with 100 percent in the United States .
Social spending is also rising rapidly .
But China should couple its expansionary domestic policies with a dismantling of its self - serving trade practices .
So the verdict on Obama 's tire tariffs is paradoxical .
As protectionism , they 're bad policy .
But they send the right message to China : cease and desist .
Predatory trade spawns destabilizing economic imbalances and political resentments .
It menaces the global economy .
Elephant 2000 : A Programming Language Based on Speech Acts
John McCarthy , Stanford University
I meant what I said , and I said what I meant .
An elephant 's faithful , one hundred percent !
moreover ,
An elephant never forgets !
Abstract :
Elephant 2000 is a proposed programming language good for writing and verifying programs that interact with people ( e.g. transaction processing ) or interact with programs belonging to other organizations ( e.g. electronic data interchange )
Communication inputs and outputs are in an I - O language whose sentences are meaningful speech acts identified in the language as questions , answers , offers , acceptances , declinations , requests , permissions and promises .
The correctness of programs is partly defined in terms of proper performance of the speech acts .
Answers should be truthful and responsive , and promises should be kept .
Sentences of logic expressing these forms of correctness can be generated automatically from the form of the program .
Elephant source programs may not need data structures , because they can refer directly to the past .
Thus a program can say that an airline passenger has a reservation if he has made one and has n't cancelled it .
Elephant programs themselves can be represented as sentences of logic .
Their extensional properties follow from this representation without an intervening theory of programming or anything like Hoare axioms .
Elephant programs that interact non-trivially with the outside world can have both input - output specifications , relating the programs inputs and outputs , and accomplishment specifications concerning what the program accomplishes in the world .
These concepts are respectively generalizations of the philosophers ' illocutionary and perlocutionary speech acts .
Programs that engage in commercial transactions assume obligations on behalf of their owners in exchange for obligations assumed by other entities .
It may be part of the specifications of an Elephant 2000 programs that these obligations are exchanged as intended , and this too can be expressed by a logical sentence .
Human speech acts involve intelligence .
Elephant 2000 is on the borderline of AI , but the article emphasizes the Elephant usages that do not require AI .
