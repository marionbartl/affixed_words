Former Vice President Dick Cheney has been railing against President Barack Obama for being weak - kneed on terrorism and failing to interdict the BVD bombers recent attempt to blow up a plane .
Cheney seems to want us to put aside his own administrations abysmal record on the subject ignoring warnings and failing to prevent the most deadly foreign attack on U.S. soil in American history , failing to prevent the similar shoe bombers attempt to bring down an aircraft , and using 9/11 to launch invasions of Muslim countries that led to an increase in terrorist attacks worldwide and thus tries to make us believe Republicans are better at countering terrorism than Democrats because , well , they re Republicans .
Cheney told the political newspaper Politico ,  We are at war , and when President Obama pretends we arent , it makes us less safe  and that Obamas low - key response to the BVD bombers attack , the presidents refusal to use the phrase war on terror ,  and his plan to close Guantanamos prison all indicate that Obama thinks that terrorism is a law enforcement problem rather than a military issue .
Cheney concluded by asking ,  Why doesnt he want to admit were at war ? 
Since Cheneys attack on Obama lacked any substance and was mainly political demagoguery , his choice of Politico to launch it was appropriate .
But an even greater problem may be the Obamas administrations defensive response to Cheneys attack .
Administration officials said that Obama did too know that the country was at war and that he had explicitly stated so in the past .
The Democrats always end up playing defense when attacked on national security , largely because they are afraid that if they dont adopt a veneer of toughness the Republicans  specialty and out - macho them , they will always be tagged as  Democratic wimps . 
But what if , following the example of Republican president Dwight Eisenhower , the Democrats instead adopted a more reasoned approach to national security ?
Eisenhower was very skilled in making sure that no international problem was ever labeled as a crisis ,  knowing that this would box him into taking pressure for rash , imprudent acts .
What would Eisenhower have done about Islamic terrorism ?
Ike , after being subjected to the horrors of World War II , disdained and avoided unneeded military action .
He would have quickly realized that the war on terror has been counterproductive , especially the part in which the U.S. invades Muslim countries .
After all , the much under - publicized reason that Osama bin Laden began attacking the United States was its meddling and military presence in Islamic countries .
The attempted BVD bombing , emanating from a local al - Qaeda affiliate in Yemen , occurred only after stepped - up U.S. covert military help in recent months to a Yemeni government at war with Islamists .
According to the Islamic faith , every good Muslim must do all he or she can to repel non-Muslim invaders from Muslim lands and Islamist extremists from poor countries have found that terrorism is their only effective weapon in attempting to do so .
Even if one subtracts the deaths from terrorist attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq ( which there is really no reason to do because they were a response to the U.S. invasion of a Muslim land ) , the number of monthly worldwide deaths from terrorism increased substantially after 9/11 .
Thus , the war on terrorism has not only failed , it has been counterproductive .
Conducting a war against terrorists merely makes them warriors instead of criminals and causes more money and fighters to flock to the jihad .
Using a lighter touch intelligence , law enforcement , and maybe even a rare military strike to counter terrorism would at least be less likely to make the problem worse .
And after all , what is wimpy about calling mass murder what it is an evil crime ?
If anything is unpatriotic , its the macho rattling of the saber from the conservative chairborne brigades for which five - deferment Cheney is the chief spokesman because it paints a bulls eye on Americas back .
Senate votes to keep Medicare cuts
By Lori Montgomery
The Senate voted Thursday to keep nearly $ 500 billion in Medicare cuts in its overhaul of the health care system , protecting the bill 's major source of financing against a Republican attack .
On a vote of 58 to 42 , the Senate rejected a proposal by Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) to send the bill back to committee with orders to strip out the cuts , a move that would effectively have killed the measure .
Two Democrats -- Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Jim Webb of Virginia -- voted with all 40 Republicans on the amendment .
The vote was among the first cast on proposed changes to the package , which would spend $ 848 billion over the next decade to extend coverage to more than 30 million additional people and implement the most dramatic revisions to the nation 's health - care system in more than 40 years .
Though debate officially opened on Monday , legislative progress has been hampered by disagreements between the two parties over the terms of debate and the timing of votes .
But Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D - Nev. ) still hopes to hold a vote on final passage before the Senate adjourns for the Christmas holidays , and on Thursday he told senators to plan on working throughout the coming weekend .
The vote on Medicare cuts was the most significant of four votes held Thursday .
Republicans argued that the cuts , which would slow the projected increase in Medicare by about 5 percent over the next decade , would decimate the popular program for people over 65 in order to finance an expansion of insurance coverage for younger people .
Any cuts to Medicare , they argued , should instead be dedicated to preserving the program , which is scheduled to start running out of money in 2017 .
" If we 're going to take money from Grandma 's Medicare , let 's spend it on Medicare , " said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) .
Democrats , backed by an array of major senior organizations , including the AARP , argued that the cuts would extend the financial life of Medicare by several years .
The cuts would not reduce guaranteed benefits or increase co-payments , they said .
And because hospitals and other providers have agreed to absorb the cuts by working more efficiently , Democrats said they would not affect access to medical services .
" I think it 's pretty clear that the main organizations that care about seniors support this bill , " said Sen. Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , chairman of the Senate Finance Committee , which drafted the bill that formed the foundation for a compromise package assembled by Reid .
To underscore that point , the Senate voted unanimously to approve a separate amendment by Sen. Michael Bennet ( D - Colo. ) that explicitly states that the package would not affect guaranteed benefits for seniors .
Earlier in the day , the Senate approved an amendment to ensure that women under 50 could obtain mammograms , despite a recent controversial ruling by a government task force , and to prevent insurance companies from charging co-payments for that and other preventive tests for women .
The amendment , by Sen. Barbara Mikulski ( D - Md. ) , was approved on a vote of 61 - 39 , with Republicans David Vitter ( La. ) and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine joining a majority of Democrats in voting yes .
Democrats Russ Feingold ( Wis. ) and Nelson voted against the amendment , which is expected to nearly $ 1 billion to the cost of the package over the next decade .

International recently loaned us its biggest , chromiest new truck , the LoneStar Harley - Davidson Special Edition .
With commercial driver ’s license in hand , we set out to shift through all 18 of its complicated forward speeds .
View Photos PATRICK M. HOEY , JEFFREY DWORIN , THE MANUFACTURER
STEP 1 : The shift knob has two switches that control additional , air - actuated gearing , which magically allows the five forward ratios to become 18 different speeds .
One is the range switch [ A ] ; the other is the “ hi / lo ” splitter [ B ] .
With your index finger on the range switch , select “ lo through 4 . ”
Then , with your thumb , set the splitter switch to “ lo . ”
View Photos PATRICK M. HOEY , JEFFREY DWORIN , THE MANUFACTURER
STEP 2 : Hold the clutch pedal to the floor to engage the clutch brake , which stops the transmission gears from turning , a necessary feature that allows the shifter to go into gear without grinding in this synchro- less transmission .
Select “ lo ” by moving the shifter left and back .
STEP 3 : Let out the clutch , and the 11 - ton truck shudders to a blistering speed of maybe one mile per hour .
STEP 4 : Flip the splitter to “ hi , ” depress the clutch slightly ( making sure not to activate the clutch brake ) , let it out , and you ’re in “ lo hi . ”
( Does n’t make any sense to us , either . )
STEP 5 : Switch the splitter back to “ lo , ” depress the clutch slightly , shift to neutral and let it out , push it back in and move the lever up and right to 1 — you ’ve just double - clutched .
Let the clutch out .
Welcome to 1 lo .
STEP 6 : Repeat the switch - flicking / shifting / clutching process of steps four and five to go through the pattern to 1 hi , 2 lo , 2 hi , 3 lo , 3 hi , 4 lo , and 4 hi .
PATRICK M. HOEY , JEFFREY DWORIN , THE MANUFACTURER
STEP 7 : With the splitter switch in “ lo , ” flip up the range selector .
Double - clutch - shift back to where 1 was before .
As a result of flipping the range switch , that ’s now 5 ( 5 lo , to be precise ) .
STEP 8 : Continue the flick - and - shift procedures to move through 5 hi , 6 lo , 6 hi , 7 lo , 7 hi , 8 lo , and , finally , 8 hi .
Congratulate yourself for sticking with the program , and do n’t forget to double - clutch on the way back down , too .
P.S. Something to look forward to :
There are also four reverse speeds .

The former Army scientist who was the prime suspect in the deadly 2001 anthrax mailings agreed Friday to take $ 5.82 million from the government to settle his claim that the Justice Department and the FBI invaded his privacy and ruined his career .
Dr. Steven J. Hatfill , 54 , who was called a “ person of interest ” in the case by then - Atty .
Gen. John Ashcroft in 2002 , said that label and repeated leaks of investigative details to the media damaged his reputation .
For months in the anxious atmosphere after Sept. 11 , Hatfill was subjected to 24 - hour surveillance and was widely identified as the leading suspect in the nation ’s first bioterrorism attack .
However , he was never arrested or charged and a federal judge presiding over his lawsuit said recently that there “ is not a scintilla of evidence ” linking him to the mailings .
Former federal prosecutors knowledgeable about the investigation said the government payout to Hatfill signified that , in all likelihood , he would never be charged .

A spokesman for the Justice Department said the anthrax case “ remains among the department ’s highest law enforcement priorities . ”
Brian Roehrkasse also said in a statement that by agreeing to settle the lawsuit , the government “ does not admit to any violation of the Privacy Act and continues to deny all liability in connection with Dr. Hatfill ’s claims . ”
The settlement calls for an immediate $ 2.82 - million payment to Hatfill .
Beginning in 2009 , the government will pay Hatfill an annuity of $ 150,000 a year for 20 years , according to court papers .
Hatfill ’s lawyer , Thomas C. Connolly , said that his client would have no comment on the settlement .
“ We took this case to defend very fundamental principles of fairness , ” Connolly said .
Another lawyer for Hatfill , Mark A. Grannis , said Friday : “ If anybody in the country really knew what it was like to be Steven Hatfill for the past six years , nobody would trade places with him . ”
Grannis faulted “ a handful of credulous reporters , ” who he said published or broadcast government leaks of “ gossip , speculation and misinformation . ”

The lawsuit was filed in August 2003 , but U.S. District Court Judge Reggie B. Walton delayed permitting Hatfill ’s lawyers to question FBI and Justice officials or news reporters for two more years .
The government contended that the depositions of agents and FBI leaders could interfere with the investigation .
Connolly and Grannis oversaw depositions that eventually elicited sworn testimony from 37 witnesses , including Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III .
Hatfill ’s lawyers told Walton at a January hearing that they had identified three officials who allegedly leaked confidential information .
The officials -- former U.S. attorney for Washington , Roscoe C. Howard Jr. ; his former criminal division chief , Daniel S. Seikaly ; and a former FBI spokesman , Edwin Cogswell -- have not spoken publicly on the allegation .
At that hearing , Walton ordered attorneys for the government and for Hatfill to try to settle the case .
On Feb. 19 , he signaled that he saw the government ’s pursuit of Hatfill as questionable .
The judge had reviewed four still - secret FBI memos about the status of the anthrax investigation .

“ There is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that Dr. Hatfill had anything to do with this , ” Walton said .
Hatfill was trained in Zimbabwe as a physician and practiced medicine in South Africa .
He later worked at Ft. Detrick , Md. , researching how to counter the effects of deadly biological agents .
No physical evidence or witnesses ever linked him to anthrax and he long insisted that he had nothing to do with the mailings .
Those mailings -- hand - addressed letters bearing tiny amounts of deadly anthrax powder -- set off new waves of terror in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The first letter arrived at American Media Inc. in South Florida .
About Sept. 18 , photo editor Robert Stevens , 63 , breathed in spores of the bacterium while examining a letter .
He died Oct. 5 . Other letters laced with the same strain of anthrax were addressed to others in the media , including two network anchors .
Two letters were addressed to U.S. senators .
Of the five anthrax - related deaths , two were U.S. Postal Service workers in the Washington area .
Hatfill ’s plight recalls the targeting of Richard Jewell , a guard at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics who alerted police to a suspicious backpack and moved bystanders away .
The backpack exploded , killing a woman and injuring more than 100 .
Jewell was praised ; then media accounts described him as “ the focus ” of the FBI investigation .
Another man later confessed .
Then - Atty . Gen. Janet Reno apologized to Jewell , who died last year .

Rep. Rush D. Holt ( D - N.J. ) , whose district includes Princeton , where anthrax spores were recovered from a mailbox , said the government ’s payout to Hatfill confirmed that the investigation “ was botched from the very beginning . ”
“ The FBI did a poor job of collecting evidence , and then inappropriately focused on one individual as a suspect for too long , developing an erroneous ‘ theory of the case ’ that has led to this very expensive dead end , ” Holt said in a statement .

If you thought that “ Avatar ” was just a high - tech movie about a big - hearted tough guy saving the beguiling natives of a distant moon , you might want to check the prescription on your 3 - D glasses .
Since its release in December , James Cameron ’s science - fiction epic has broken box office records and grabbed two Golden Globe awards for best director and best dramatic motion picture .
But it has also found itself under fire from a growing list of interest groups , schools of thought and entire nations that have protested its message ( as they see it ) , its morals ( as they interpret them ) and its philosophy ( assuming it has one ) .
Over the last month , it has been criticized by social and political conservatives who bristle at its depictions of religion and the use of military force ; feminists who feel that the male avatar bodies are stronger and more muscular than their female counterparts ; antismoking advocates who object to a character who lights up cigarettes ; not to mention fans of Soviet - era Russian science fiction ; the Chinese ; and the Vatican .
This week the authorities in China announced that the 2 - D version of the film would be pulled from most theaters there to make way for a biography of Confucius .
That so many groups have projected their issues onto “ Avatar ” suggests that it has burrowed into the cultural consciousness in a way that even its immodest director could not have anticipated .
Its detractors agree that it is more than a humans - in - space odyssey  even if they do not agree on why that is so .
It is time for the people of NSW to take a stand , to say enough is enough .
The politics of NSW has ceased to be concerned mainly with the delivery of services or about its development and the welfare of its citizens , and has turned into an expression of the Labor Party 's civil war .
Sign the petition to reclaim your vote
We appreciate that the new Premier , Kristina Keneally , is simply the most recent draftee to this war .
The petition we are launching today is not about her .
It is about a system of government that locks the people of NSW into a four - year fixed electoral cycle , that reduces the voters to bystanders in an endless rotation of ministers and premiers - with no way of bringing on an election .
The people of NSW , who elected Morris Iemma in 2007 , have seen that choice overturned , and overturned again , until they now have a government they scarcely recognise .
And that government is overseeing a decline in the quality of services to the public .
Hospitals are understaffed and over budget .
They can not pay their bills .
Waiting lists for elective surgery are growing .
Public transport is in disarray and its future is in doubt for want of adequate planning .
Roads , railways , buses and ferries are dilapidated .
So are our schools .
Police resources are stretched .
Looming over all the problems , explaining them and perpetuating them , is a budget shortfall that results from the Government 's inherent inability to manage its affairs or anything else .
The failure to privatise the power industry - an attempt undermined by Labor 's union allies - has kept the budget on the edge of crisis .
Labor has been governing not for the people but for itself .
In turning its back on NSW , the Government has forgotten where its duty , and the source of its power , lie - the voters of NSW .

I think we ’re well due for an iPhone / iPod Touch post .
My Touch has become the peripheral of choice for the go , so I made sure it was well - stocked with games .
Here are 10 of my favorites :
Eliss – Steph Thirion ’s Eliss was one of the first iPhone games to catch my eye , and still stands out as one of the best games for the platform , in my opinion .
It ’s gorgeous and challenging , and makes great use of the iPhone ’s multitouch .
Canabalt – Conceived by Adam “ Atomic ” Saltsman , the big brain behind Flixel and Edgecrement , Canabalt has you leaping from roof - to - roof in a frantic and stylish escape from a dying city .
It ’s the best one - switch game I ’ve ever played and the latest update – which features new environments and sick beatz by Danny B. – make it even better .
Developers should check out Adam ’s post about “ The $ 0.99 Problem ” , too .
Evacuation – We covered Bennett “ Benzido ” Foddy ’s Evacuation on TIGSource before , when it was a Flash game .
It ’s even better on the iPhone .
Little Master – Likewise , Benzido ’s cricket game started life as a Flash title before it became an iPhone game , and we covered it before .
What can I say ?
I really like his work !
Sword of Fargoal – Jeff McCord ’s classic roguelike game has been rebooted by McCord and his partners , Paul Pridham and Elias Pschernig .
For those of you yearning for a good roguelike experience on the iPhone , this is it !
It ’s a fantastic update to the game .
Earth Dragon – Earth Dragon was created by Chaim Gingold , the design lead for Spore ’s Creators , including the Creature Creator ( now indie as the day he was born ) .
It ’s quite cute and fun and makes clever use of the accelerometer and touch to let you control your dragon .
The art is by Jane Ng , who also worked on Spore .
ZenBound – Zenbound is a calm ( I wrote “ clam ” first , and almost left it ) , meditative game that has you tying up wooden animals with rope .
It ’s really striking to look at .
The creators , Secret Exit , are best known for their Stair / Truck Dismount series of games .
Stair Dismount – And yes , Stair Dismount has finally made it to the iPhone .
This version has a variety of different levels and lets you paste your friends ’ faces onto the ragdoll via Facebook .
I chose Edmund McMillen , because his photo was cropped the best .
Then I chose a baby .
Skull Pogo – Chevy Johnston ’s Skull Pogo started off as a Game Maker game , but it works best on the iPhone , where you can use the accelerometer to control your little skullpogoman .
Aside from being an awesome , creative , and helpful dude on the forums , Chevy knows how to make an addictive game .
The recent update is pretty sweet , too .
Cross Fingers – Because of a certain someone asshole , Edge has been removed from the App Store again .
But at least he did n’t prevent Mobigame from releasing their next title , Cross Fingers , a sliding - block puzzle game that uses multitouch .
Although perhaps not as unique as Edge , I actually prefer CF as a game to play on the go .
So there you have it !

This is our first competition entry for the “ Bootleg Demake ” competition at The Independant Gaming Source .
It is a demake of the classic Homeworld by Relic .
If you have n’t played it , the short story is that Homeworld is a real - time strategy game in space .
Your fleet is centered around your Mothership , which constructs units and is the drop - off zone for resources .
In the game you are travelling through space in order to find your homeworld , while evil aliens attempt to destroy you ( obviously ) .
When we began making the game we set our hardware target at the PC games of the mid-ninetees , think Dune 2 ( i.e. the 320×240 resolution is intentional ) .
We wanted to translate Homeworld ’s 3D view to a flat 2D version , while keeping the key features that made Homeworld the game it is .
That means your Mothership ( called Maternal Vessel in House Globe ) is the center piece of your fleet and will construct all units .
It also means that we wanted to keep the tactical / strategical toggle that Homeworld has .
Beyond those initial concepts , we felt quite free to design our own game .
We put much effort on making the “ micro ” part interesting ( good control / response when moving units ) , and having a balanced technology tree .
In the end we believe we managed to make a really good game in only 10 days or so .
Not that the sale was immediately obvious , as Roozendaal acquired his flat off the plan through a company and Arbib's was purchased by his wife , Kelli Field .
The Greens MP Sylvia
Hale recently told Parliament that local real estate agents in Maroubra said the Labor powerbroker '' Eddie Obeid or his proxy also purchased a Maroubra beachside townhouse ' ' .
But Obeid told the Herald he did not own any property in Maroubra nor anywhere in the vicinity and that he had not bought property from Boyd or any Boyd companies .
Given he has been a wheeler - dealer extraordinaire over the years , it may have slipped Obeid 's mind that shortly before he became an MP , his company parted with $ 2 million to buy an industrial site on Canterbury Road , Bankstown , from Boyd 's company .
And while Arbib and Roozendaal were finalising their purchases with Boyd 's company , Telmet Ventures , Telmet was successfully lobbying the Labor - controlled Strathfield council to rezone contaminated land at Homebush West .
Telmet , which bought part of the site from State Rail , is planning to build up to 1000 apartments there .
Boyd has also been a long - time developer in and around the Olympic Park precinct .
The connections do n't stop there .
Brian Boyd 's lawyer is Mark Morgan .
Morgan is a director of several Boyd companies and he turned up as a shareholder in a company owned by Eddie Obeid 's son , Moses .
Streetscape Projects sells multipurpose street poles with street lights , banners and security cameras .
Despite coming last in a tender assessment by council officers in 1999 , Streetscape was awarded a contract to supply Smartpoles to the City of Sydney , run by then lord mayor Frank Sartor .
But Morgan himself was not the shareholder in Moses Obeid 's company .
The identity of the real investor was hidden within a $ 2 shelf company controlled by Morgan , who has steadfastly refused to disclose on whose behalf he held the shares .
Morgan 's $ 2 shelf companies , which he runs on behalf of unnamed people , donated a massive $ 230,000 to the ALP between 2002 and 2006 .
Sydney is a small town .
Take the 2007 purchase in Rose Bay by Eric Roozendaal 's parents , who spent $ 1.695 million buying a property in a development undertaken by Allen Linz .
Only a few years earlier Roozendaal and Linz had been fellow directors on the ill - fated company Getonboard , which was to offer union members cheap computers and internet access .
Other directors included Linz 's business partner , David Tanevski , along with Labor luminaries Mark Arbib , Michael Costa and John Robertson .
The shareholding of the union - based company was shrouded in mystery , with one shareholder hiding their identity through a company domiciled in the British Virgin Islands .
In 2007 eyebrows were raised when Unions NSW , run by John Robertson , now a NSW minister , announced that the successful purchaser of the unions ' historic workers ' cottages , Currawong , at Pittwater was Allen Linz 's company .
Hired by Unions NSW to broker the sale of Currawong was Joe Tripodi's close friend Tanevski , who just so happened to have been in the internet business with Robertson , Roozendaal and Linz , as well as being a business partner of Linz 's at the time of the Currawong sale .
When asked about Tanevski's role , Robertson said at the time , '' We wanted somebody who understood how property developers operated . ''
Tanevski certainly fitted the bill .
He had business links with Linz and fellow developer Duncan Hardie .
In 2001 Tanevski bought a house from developer Bob Rose in a Rose project , Breakfast Point , at Canada Bay .
Breakfast Point , an American - style $ 1.5 billion residential village complete with its own country club , won the Urban Task Force 's Development Excellence Award for a Master Planned Community in 2004 .
The 39 - year - old Macedonian - born Tanevski has been a director of the Urban Task Force , a lobbying organisation for property developers , since 2002 .
Noel Hemmings , QC , who was also counsel assisting the commission during last year 's Independent Commission Against Corruption hearings into Wollongong City Council , has recently been appointed the Task Force chairman , replacing Bob Rose , who held the position for seven years .
Recently elected deputy chairman is Allen Linz , while former directors have included fellow developers Bob Ell and Duncan Hardie .
The lobby group 's chief executive is Aaron Gadiel , brother - in - law of the Labor MP Tanya Gadiel and a former chief - of - staff to Joe Tripodi and Eddie Obeid .
Sydney 's property plays further connect the mates .
Tanevski made a $ 215,000 profit after selling a Woollahra unit he bought only one year earlier from Linz .
Tanevski also owned a house in Fairfield with Joe Tripodi 's former girlfriend , ex-state minister Reba Meagher .
Apart from friendship , Tanevski and Tripodi shared links with the influential property developer Pat Sergi , named in the Woodward royal commission as a principal in the Griffith Mafia .
While an MP , Tripodi had shares in a Sergi company which bought and sold government land .
Sergi was also a shareholder in Shingle Hill , a company owned by Linz and Tanevski .
Tanevski has harboured political ambitions .
In 1994 he and his cousin Jim Stefanovski ( also known as Stefan ) were exposed as being part of a massive branch stack by Labor 's right wing to oust a left - wing MP from the seat of Throsby , south of Wollongong .
Tanevski was hoping to be preselected .
Stefanovski , who ran a brothel , was later jailed for 6 ½ years for fraud and gun running .
The fact that he was in the clink did not prevent Labor mayor Nick Lalich awarding him one of Fairfield Council 's Citizens of the Year gongs in 2003 .
Lalich , who was elected to the seat of Cabramatta in October last year after Reba Meagher 's resignation , had the ignominy of having to rescind Stefan 's award .
But back to tiny degrees of separation surrounding the Currawong deal .
Unions NSW rejected a $ 30 million bid for the Pittwater retreat put forward by the late Michael McGurk , who was acting for the developer Ron Medich .
Before his murder in September , McGurk told the Herald Moses Obeid had helped them with negotiations with Unions NSW 's Robertson .
Loading
Despite offering double the money , Unions NSW preferred Linz 's $ 15 million bid because , unlike McGurk 's , it had no conditions attached .
The Herald has learnt that Linz 's company has been able to get a reduction of a third of the purchase price because the then planning minister , Kristina Keneally , knocked back its redevelopment plans .
But just to prove that the degrees of separation can never be too small , an independent inquiry authorised by Unions NSW found that Tanevski's involvement in the bid was completely above board and there were no conflicts of interest .
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti  Maxi Extralien , a twig - thin 10 - year - old in a SpongeBob pajama top , ate only a single bean from the heavy plate of food he received recently from a Haitian civic group .
He had to make it last .
“ My mother has 12 kids but a lot of them died , ” he said , covering his meal so he could carry it to his family .
“ There are six of us now and my mom . ”
For Maxi and countless others here in Haiti ’s pulverized capital , new rules of hunger etiquette are emerging .
Stealing food , it is widely known , might get you killed .
Children are most likely to return with something to eat , but no matter what is found , or how hungry the forager , everything must be shared .
The communal rationing , along with signs all over the city that say “ S O S ” and “ we need food , ” suggests that the food crisis here is growing .
In a country where malnutrition was common even before the earthquake , the United Nations now estimates that two million Haitians need immediate food assistance .
And despite frantic efforts by aid groups , distribution has been limited .
As of Saturday , the World Food Program had reached 207,392 people in Port - au - Prince and 113,313 in other areas .

MUSKEGON COUNTY — Marilyn Cole , of Muskegon , faces trial on charges of stealing goods from a local Wal - Mart store , then head - butting and urinating on a security guard .
Cole , 35 , waived her probable - cause hearing on charges of unlawful imprisonment , unarmed robbery and interfering with a crime report .
The hearing had been scheduled for Tuesday .
Her alleged accomplice , Rashieka Stewart , 23 , of Muskegon earlier waived her probable - cause hearing and faces trial on one count of unarmed robbery .
According to Roosevelt Park Police Chief Bill Regan , the women tried to steal merchandise , including make - up and curtains , from the Henry Street Wal - Mart on Halloween night .
Regan said the women broke away from a security guard who tried to detain them at the front door .
The security guard ran after them and tried to block Cole from getting into the passenger ’s seat of the car in which she and Stewart were preparing to flee .
Regan said Cole “ head - butted ” the security guard , who fell backwards into the vehicle .
The chief said Cole then sat on the man .
He grabbed his phone and called 911 , but Cole allegedly fought for the phone and then urinated on him .
Stewart drove away with the security guard still in the vehicle and Cole holding him down , according to the chief .
The incident ended when the women stopped in the parking lot of Acme Bedding Co. , 660 W. Broadway , where authorities , still on the phone with the security guard , arrested Stewart and Cole .

Deep in the rainforest , a squawk fills the air , discordant but strangely familiar .
It is the sound of sanctimonious humbug from Europe 's food industry .
For European food retailers stand accused of hypocrisy over buying palm oil from tropical countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia , where the widely used edible oil is often grown on land that once was rainforest .
Many of them promised to buy sustainable palm oil if it became available .
Now , though , their bluff has been called – by the growers themselves .
For six years , many of Europe 's leading food manufacturers and retailers have been members of an association called the Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) .
They wanted , they said , to ensure that they could buy palm oil – and the huge number of products containing it – which had been produced without destroying rainforests .
The food manufacturing giant , Unilever , started the RSPO in 2003 , and dozens of food manufacturers and retailers , particularly in Europe , joined .
So , less visibly , did some palm oil producers .
As demand for the oil rose for everything from margarine and shampoo to biscuits and ice - cream , the pressure grew to turn this well - meaning talking shop into a real force for change : to end forest destruction .
Ministers in Copenhagen next week will hear that deforestation is responsible for up to a fifth of CO2 emissions – and palm oil production , especially in Indonesia , is a leading incentive to tear down the remaining forests .
In response to that pressure , the food industry said it wanted very badly to use sustainable palm and would do so – just as soon as it was available .
Their allies , including the environmental group WWF , which first set up the round table with Unilever , gratefully backed them .
The problem , it seemed , was south - east Asian palm - oil growers .
Then just a year ago , something remarkable happened .
The first boatloads of " sustainable " palm oil , certified as coming from land not recently deforested , arrived at Rotterdam .
The growers were doing what their purchasers had been demanding .
But there have been very few takers .
Six months ago I reported that sales were just 15,000 tonnes .
When I checked the latest stats with WWF this week , sales had risen – to somewhere between 175,000 and 250,000 tonnes .
But that is a tiny fraction of what is available .
Producers have the capacity to ship 1.75 m tonnes of sustainable palm oil a year – getting on for 10 % of total global palm oil production .
But only 14 % of that 1.75 m tonnes was bought in the first year .
Why ?
" Sustainable " palm oil commands , as you would expect , a premium price .
Food manufacturers know all about how to sell us green products at a premium price .
But will they pay more themselves ?
It seems not .
And now the producers are getting wise to the reluctance of their customers to stick to their pledges .
According to Adam Harrison of WWF Scotland , who sits on the RSPO board , producers are cutting production and mothballing mills that are certified for sustainable production .
This is a tragedy .
Rich western corporations demand the sustainability stuff and flaunt their green credentials to customers in the process .
Developing world producers , though suspicious , start producing .
Rich westerners check the price tag and walk away .
Meanwhile , the rainforests continue to disappear .
Who , specifically , should we blame ?
I asked WWF , which just produced its first " scorecard " ( pdf ) of sustainability for the 59 leading European retailers and manufacturers buying palm oil .
The scorecard is generous .
Companies get marks just for being a member of RSPO , and for paperwork activity , like having plans to go sustainable one day .
Even so , the scores make depressing reading .
Top marks would be 29 .
Sainsbury 's and Marks & Spencer get quite close , partly through stipulating sustainable palm oil in some of their own - brand goods .
They scored 26 and 25.5 respectively .
Unilever , Cadbury , Asda and the Body Shop also get more than 20 marks .
But even for the top scorers , " in most cases certified sustainable palm oil is still being used in only very small quantities , " the WWF says .
Even on this indulgent scoring system , more than half the companies get below 10 marks .
These include Waitrose , Lidl , Boots , Danone ( " sustainability is part of our DNA " ) and Associated British Foods ( makers of Kingsmill and Allinson bread ) .
None of these poor scorers are buying any sustainably produced palm oil , according to WWF , which has given all the listed companies a chance to correct the findings .
Waitrose 's derisory 8.5 marks came as a surprise .
It is part of the John Lewis Partnership , which promotes its support for the Prince 's Rainforest Project , set up by the Prince of Wales to " make rainforests worth more alive than dead " .
I asked them what had gone wrong .
Nothing , it said .
" We have committed to using only certified sustainable palm oil in our own - label products by the end of 2012 .
We will achieve a quarter of the conversion within the next year . "
Maybe the lumbering beasts of the jungle are just slow to get moving .
But , by the time they get their act together , will there be any rainforest left to protect ?
This column will be watching their progress .
In three grueling sessions last year , a nine - member curriculum committee appointed by members of the State Board of Education met to hammer out which version of American history that Texas high schoolers , and maybe high schoolers everywhere , will learn for the next decade .
On the committee were eight educators and one “ citizen ” ( that ’s how he was described on a published list of its members ) , and the latter could not have been more different from the others .
Bill Ames had neither history or education credentials nor respect for fellow committee members who did .
Indeed , the retired IBM executive and conservative gadfly believed they had been planted there in a conspiracy of “ liberal groups ” and unions who wanted to “ hijack ” U.S. history — or so he would later write in a three - part , 9,300 - word rant , “ The Left ’s War on History , ” that was published by the conservative web site Texas Insider .
When the committee took up McCarthyism , for instance , Ames argued that disgraced Wisconsin Senator Joseph McCarthy was actually an American hero .
“ The SBOE , noting the predictable leftist condemnation of ... McCarthy for his anti-communist activity , requested the inclusion of the Venona papers , which revealed that the U.S. government was in fact infiltrated by communists , ” Ames later wrote .
The citizen was channeling his patron , Don McLeroy , the hyperconservative board member who appointed him to the curriculum committee .
McLeroy , in six pages of hand - scrawled editing instructions to committee members , parroted Ames on McCarthyism : “ Read the latest on McCarthy — He was basically vindicated . ”
However , in a brief interview last week , McLeroy — who was ousted as the SBOE ’s chairman in July , when the Texas Senate refused to confirm his reappointment by Rick Perry — downplayed his interest in clearing McCarthy ’s name .
“ He ’s not really a hero in my book , ” he said .
“ I just thought he was more accurate about the red threat than people thought .
I ’m not a historian on this stuff .
I ’m just a dentist from Bryan . ”
The McCarthyism dustup was one of many strange episodes in the yearlong drafting of Texas high school social studies standards , which will once again occupy center stage beginning this week , as the SBOE takes up public comment and amendments .
So far , much of the squabbling has involved the exclusion of particular historical figures , including the first African American U.S. Supreme Court Justice , Thurgood Marshall , and labor leader Cesar Chavez .
But beneath such spats lie far deeper ideological tussles , over disputed Biblical underpinnings of the nation ’s founding ; the notion of America as uniquely superior , even divinely ordained ; and the proper context and credit in exploring the struggles of oppressed minority groups .
Following earlier clashes over curricula in other disciplines , the social studies debate will test whether the SBOE can cut through the fog of extremism and find a neutral mainstream .
Though its appointees spent countless hours drafting the new standards , the board can toss or overhaul portions at any point , as it did with English standards in 2008 and science standards last year .
And so a fifteen - member elected board dominated by social conservatives , few of them educators , will once again decide what will and wo n’t be taught in Texas public schools .
Their influence will be magnified exponentially , as usual , because the content of textbooks in the lucrative Texas market drives what publishers peddle in other states .
“ They ’ve got the votes , ” said board member Pat Hardy , who is not part of the ruling faction .
“ You never know .
Fasten your seat belt . ”
Expert evangelists
The committee that included Ames is one of 16 different curriculum - writing committees appointed by SBOE members to rewrite the social studies standards .
All committee members were nominated by board members , who could recommend committee assignments as well .
The committee members were then assigned by Texas Education Agency staff , who sought to balance each committee with the appointees of different board members .
Each committee was charged with tackling different subjects or grade levels .
The draft standards they produced were then given to six “ expert reviewers ” who were each chosen by at least two SBOE members .
The board considers the input of both the curriculum writers and the reviewers separately but ultimately makes the calls on final changes by majority vote .
Predictably , the American history standards have become the focal point of controversy within the larger realm of social studies , which includes everything from geography to psychology .
“ With the partisanship that has emerged in America right now , how you interpret the recent past becomes an ownership struggle : People want to control what is said about it , ” said Jesus de la Teja , a history professor at Texas State University appointed as an expert reviewer by Rene Nunez and Mary Helen Berlanga , two other board members who are not part of the ruling faction .
The ambitions of some board members and their appointees extend well beyond the recent past .
Two of the six expert reviewers are evangelists rather than educators or historians and have argued for extended and disputed explorations of Christianity ’s role in the nation ’s founding to be included in the curriculum .
Separately , they have skewered the notion of devoting more study to racial and other minority groups .
One of the two evangelist expert reviewers is David Barton , the former vice chairman of the Republican Party of Texas and the founder of the Aledo - based ministry WallBuilders , a nationally known speaking - and - publishing outfit that preaches that the Founding Fathers never intended to separate church and state .
Barton , appointed by conservative members Gail Lowe ( who succeeded McLeroy as chair ) and Ken Mercer , takes a coldly mathematical view of historical advances in minority rights .
“ Multiple locations in the TEKS ( standards ) even suggest that it is people from ‘ racial , ethnic , and religious groups who ‘ expand political rights in American society . ’
This is an absolutely false premise , ” he wrote in an 87 - page review of the curriculum committee ’s work .
“ Only majorities can expand political rights in America ’s constitutional society . ”
( Barton declined a request to be interviewed for this story . )
The other evangelist expert reviewer , Massachusetts - based preacher Peter Marshall , supports the “ urgent necessity of recovering the original American vision , and the truth about our Christian heritage , ” according to his website .
Appointed by conservative members Barbara Cargill and Cynthia Dunbar , Marshall was the one who launched the assaults on the inclusion of Thurgood Marshall and Cesar Chavez .
( Marshall also declined to be interviewed . )
The choice of his fellow expert reviewers spoke to the ideological bent of some board members , said James Kracht , a geographer and associate dean at Texas A&M , chosen by board members Hardy and Bob Craig , who is also outside the majority faction .
“ You get some real lunacy in there when somebody ’s arguing that Thurgood Marshall does n’t belong in there but the inventor of the yo - yo does , ” he said .
Kracht was referring to two separate references in reviews Peter Marshall submitted to the SBOE — one saying Thurgood Marshall was “ not a strong enough example ” to be included , and another recommending : “ Add to the list of inventors Pedro Flores ( invented the yo - yo ) . ”
McLeroy was unable to name his own expert reviewer , as he could n’t find a second board member to agree with him on a choice , according to Debbie Ratcliffe , the spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency , which often works with , but does not report to , the state school board .
McLeroy wanted Allen Quist , a creationist Minnesota politician , author and teacher who , as a Minnesota state representative and in two losing campaigns for governor , railed against gay rights , pornography and abortion , which he compared to the holocaust in a 1980 book .
Now running for Congress , Quist was captured on YouTube in a speech last month saying : " Our country is being destroyed .
Every generation has had to fight the fight for freedom … Terrorism ?
Yes .
But that ’s not the big battle , ” he said .
“ The big battle is in D.C. with the radicals .
They are n’t liberals .
They are radicals .
Obama , Pelosi , Walz [ Quist ’s opponent ] …
They are destroying our country . ”
Though McLeroy ’s bid to appoint Quist failed to garner support — even on one of the most conservative public bodies in America — he could still count on Ames , operating on the curriculum committee level , to speak loudly on his behalf .
At some point , Ames demanded to address every other committee taking up separate subjects and grade levels , Ratcliffe said , but was rebuffed .
“ It ’s not like ( Ames ) is some kind of super - appointee , although at times it seems like he thinks he is , ” Ratcliffe said , “ He sometimes seemed very angry .
…
He complained a lot there were ‘ too many educators . ’
But it was a curriculum committee , so that seemed natural . ”
America the exceptional
In the U.S. history committee meetings , by several accounts and the record of edits in the draft standards , Ames lost nearly every battle he fought , refused to compromise , and generally irritated his fellow committee members .
And yet his ideas may ultimately prevail when the like - minded members of the SBOE gather this week .
Ames , for instance , may have been speaking for the elected board ’s majority when he tried to push through a standard on “ American exceptionalism . ”
Depending on how it ’s interpreted , exceptionalism can mean simply that the country , particularly its founders , did exceptional things .
Or it can mean — in a definition endorsed by Ames in his treatise — that America is “ not only unique but superior , ” that its citizens are “ a chosen people , divinely ordained to lead the world to betterment , ” and that it is “ not destined to rise and fall .
Americans will escape ‘ the laws of history ’ which eventually cause the downfall of all great nations and empires . ”
Ames failed to get such notions through the committee .
“ He believes we ’re ordained by God to play this role .
It ’s like the modern version of Manifest Destiny , which gave us the conquering of the West , the slaughtering of the Indians and all that , ” said Julio Noboa , a University of El Paso history professor who served alongside him on the history standards committee .
“ He wanted a nice whitewashed view of American history , with no pimples .
We said no .
Students need to understand there are problems within the capitalist system …
Politicians are n’t going to give our rights to us on a silver platter .
Democracy is evolutionary . ”
The committee did n’t necessarily object to any mention of exceptionalism as theory — it was first coined by French political philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville in the mid-1800s — but members recoiled at Ames ’ casting of it as unassailable doctrine .
“ Our take on that was that you ca n’t force your beliefs on students in a history book ; it has to take a non-biased view , ” said committee member Margaret Telford , a 34 - year educator who currently teaches in the Grapevine - Colleyville Independent School District .
The question of American superiority likely will come up again at next week ’s SBOE meetings , Lowe said .
“ The state board members had given them ( committee members ) clear direction in the spring that we wanted that concept included , so it ’s surprising they voted it down , ” she said .
“ We do n’t have to tell students what to think , but any educated person should have learned about American exceptionalism . ”
Asked if she supports the same definition Ames had offered , Lowe said : “ I do n’t believe America is the chosen nation the same way ( I believe ) Israel is the chosen nation .
I do believe we have a special and unique place in history .
We are not one of many . ”
“ We ’re Texans , ” she continued .
“ We believe our state is better than all other states , too .
Why would n’t we believe the same about our country ? ”
Lowe says she hopes to steer the social studies standards through with minimal controversy , but she may have a fight on her hands whether she wants one or not .
A group of academics and activists plans to push the board to include more Hispanic history .
And the Texas Freedom Network , an Austin - based nonprofit that monitors religious extremism , has mobilized a separate group of academics and clergy to advocate against a fundamentalist Christian interpretation of history .
SBOE member Berlanga , a Corpus Christi attorney , said she would “ fight to the bitter end ” for the inclusion of substantially more exploration of the Hispanic experience , both in Texas and nationally .
“ I read the history books our students currently use .
There ’s a few African Americans , but no Hispanics anywhere at all , from any era .
Reading it , it was like we did n’t exist , ” she said .
“ Just because we did n’t study something when we were children — because somebody did n’t do more research than they wanted to do — does n’t mean we should n’t fix it now . ”
Lowe shares none of that urgency : “ I think we ’ve done a good job of including historical figures .
I personally am not looking to remove names .
But there seems to be a fair representation of minorities . ”
McLeroy ’s man
The editing marks in draft documents of the standards provide a fascinating record of the debate inside the history committee room .
Every addition and deletion is marked — and every point of disagreement is chronicled , with the notation “ MV , ” for “ multiple viewpoints . ”
In reality , however , almost every “ MV ” in the history draft stemmed from the lone dissenting view of Ames , according to two committee members .
Ames , who did not respond to requests for an interview , complained that there was “ too much emphasis on multiculturalism ” when the committee wanted to change “ female ” to “ women and minority ” in a standard discussing employment issues after World War II .
In another case , he complained a standard did n’t include enough about “ negative effects ” of the New Deal .
Yet when it came to Ronald Reagan , the standards did n’t include enough praise for Ames ’ taste :
He objected to the removal of a blanket statement saying Reagan “ restored national confidence ” and wanted to add “ winning the Cold War . ”
Of a list of social and political leaders that includes “ [ Mexican - American surgeon and civil rights activist ] Dr. Hector P. Garcia , Thurgood Marshall , [ preacher ]
Billy Graham , [ 1964 GOP presidential candidate ] Barry Goldwater , [ conservative activist ]
Phyllis Schlafly , and [ former first lady and current U.S. Secretary of State ] Hillary Clinton , ” Ames remarked : “ Name selection appears more concerned with diversity than any significant accomplishment . ”
In early October , after three committee sessions , McLeroy sent along his point - by - point editing instructions , often mimicking Ames .
He wrote first : “ Pay close attention to the expert reviewers , especially David Bartons [ sic ] . ”
Then : “ Pay attention to ‘… the never ending battle for truth justice and the American Way … Introduction to Superman . ”
In a section on World History , he asked for a study of “ Ancient Isreal — Abraham , Moses , Ten Commandments . ”
In another , he wrote : “ CHRISTIANITY !
Development ! ”
He questioned another line : “ decline of the Roman Catholic church ?
How many current Supreme court justices are Catholic ? ” For U.S. History , he wrote : “ Add a standard that describes the Judeo - Christian influence on the founding documents . ”
He further instructed the committee members : “ Listen very closely to Bill Ames ; he speaks for a lot of Texas citizens . ”
Noboa , the UTEP history professor , chuckled when asked about that last McLeroy comment : “ Unfortunately , I think he may be right . ”
Herding cats
In light of the spectacle that has attended past standards adoptions , some of the expert reviewers question whether the messy process should n’t be scrapped entirely .
“ The board really monkeyed around with the English standards ” after committees of educators had spent months crafting them , said de la Teja , the Texas State history professor .
“ It injects a lot of politics .
When you get down to it , it does n’t give the experts in the field the ability to do what they ’ve been trained to do and have experience in doing . ”
Texas A& M 's Kracht compared the standards adoption process to “ trying to herd 40 cats in a blue norther . ”
Yet for now , the board ’s veto power over the yearlong , word - by - word grind by curriculum - writing committees remains in effect .
That gave great comfort to Ames , who walked out of his committee experience anything but defeated .
He wrote of the upcoming state board meeting : “ Item - by - item , motions will be made and passed to accept the changes .
Textbook publishers , bound by the standards , will publish pro-America textbooks that are used , not only in Texas , but also across the country .
The process will be the history revisionists ’ worst nightmare .
How can one be so confident of the outcome ?
Because the SBOE seems able to win every curriculum battle .
The left always loses in Texas . ”

DAVOS — The global economic recovery could lose pace later this year , dashing hopes for a rapid escape from the deepest downturn of the postwar era , economists and investors said at the World Economic Forum 's annual meeting at this Swiss ski resort .
Heavy debts will weigh on governments and households in the U.S. and Europe for some time , while hopes for global growth will continue to rest on fast - developing countries such as India and China , predicted participants at the meeting 's opening debate on the economy .

Get ready for a wild ride on the long end of the curve , as the bond vigilantes go to work making Barack Obama and Tim Geithner pay for the bailout .
Bloomberg : Yields on benchmark 10 - year notes will climb about 40 percent to 5.5 percent , the biggest annual increase since 1999 , according to David Greenlaw , chief fixed - income economist at Morgan Stanley in New York .
The surge will push interest rates on 30 - year fixed mortgages to 7.5 percent to 8 percent , almost the highest in a decade , Greenlaw said .
Investors are demanding higher returns on government debt , boosting rates this month by the most since January , on concern President Barack Obama ’s attempt to revive economic growth with record spending will keep the deficit at $ 1 trillion .
Rising borrowing costs risk jeopardizing a recovery from a plunge in the residential mortgage market that led to the worst global recession in six decades .
“ When you take these kinds of aggressive policy actions to prevent a depression , you have to clean up after yourself , ” Greenlaw said in a telephone interview .
“ Market signals will ultimately spur some policy action but I ’m not naive enough to think it will be a very pleasant environment . ”

Though there were no traditional exit polls , Brown ’s 5 - percentage - point victory in a state where just 12 percent of registered voters are Republicans makes clear that yet again , Democrats lost a race on friendly terrain because centrists fled into the arms of the GOP .
Sour swing voters desert Democrats
BOSTON —
It ’s voters like Deborah Donahue that keep Democratic candidates and consultants up at night .
She ’s from the suburbs , belongs to a union and is not registered with either political party .

“ Next Tuesday we get to make a statement about where we want our state to go and our country to go , ” Donahue said here last week as she stood outside a Martha Coakley event — holding a sign for Scott Brown ’s campaign .
As they did in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial contests last fall , sour swing voters overwhelmingly supported the Republican in Tuesday ’s Massachusetts Senate special election .
Though there were no traditional exit polls , Brown ’s 5 - percentage - point victory in a state where just 12 percent of registered voters are Republicans makes clear that yet again , Democrats lost a race on friendly terrain because centrists fled into the arms of the GOP .
After Barack Obama won independents by 52 percent to 44 percent in 2008 , the key demographic in American politics is moving away from him and his party .
And as in any 12 - step program to recovery , Democratic officials are finally owning up to having a problem with the swing bloc .
Though there were no exit polls , GOP pollster Tony Fabrizio surveyed 800 voters on election night and found that Brown won 64 percent of independents to Coakley ’s 34 percent .
Democratic pollster Dave Beattie said that independent voters — particularly whites and Hispanics — are worried about the economy and that Democrats had erred in focusing on health care at a time when voters are focused on jobs .
“ These are the same individuals that ditched the Republicans in the last couple of elections , ” Beattie lamented .
“ These are folks who do n’t like the way things are going . ”
After the corporate bailouts , middle - class voters felt particularly neglected , he said .
“ It ’s a feeling that the whole system in Washington is ignoring them , ” Beattie said .
“ We have not addressed the economic concern . ”
But the cure for Democrats is n’t as simple as tweaking their agenda , it would appear .
Donahue , a nurse , complained about the federal health care reform plans and said one - party control in Washington was partially to blame .
“ We need a little bit of diversity politically , ” she said .
The Bay State ’s results proved that she is not alone .
A survey taken by GOP pollster Wes Anderson for the Republican National Committee in the days leading up to the Massachusetts vote found deep discontent with the Democratic majority in Congress in a state that , until Tuesday , did n’t have a single Republican on Capitol Hill .
Asked whether they were satisfied that Democrats in Congress were listening to them , 67 percent of Massachusetts independents polled said they were unsatisfied compared with just 28 percent who said they were satisfied .
Drilling deeper into the poll ’s demographics illustrates just how grave the Democrats ’ problem is at the moment .
Like Donahue , the majority of the self - identified independents surveyed are white , middle - class , middle - aged suburban ticket - splitters — the sort of voters both parties crave .
And when tough economic times are combined with a heavily taxed electorate , as in Massachusetts , the results can be ugly for Democrats .
One Democratic pollster who sampled the state said the tax issue played a pivotal role for Brown in winning over the state ’s independents .
“ They were worried about taxes more than anything else , ” this consultant said .
“ [ Coakley ] was seen as a big taxer .
[ Brown ] was seen as someone who wants to lower taxes . ”
David Paleologos , a pollster at Massachusetts ’s Suffolk University , noted that Brown overperformed in heavily suburban , independent - filled towns — and that such voters came out in droves .
“ The voter intensity of independents was unusually high , ” Paleologos said .
Some Massachusetts suburbs — such as those in the South Shore ’s Plymouth County and in towns north of Boston — had turnout of more than 60 percent .
“ I think this is a signal , with two governors ’ races and one U.S. Senate race , that independents are using their clout to make changes nationwide , ” said Paleologos .
Some Democrats say they saw the warning signs well before what is being called the Massachusetts Meltdown .
In October , shortly before voters in New Jersey and Virginia went to the polls , Democratic pollster Geoff Garin delivered a presentation to Senate campaign managers at a Washington retreat sponsored by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
The title was “ Emerging Dynamics of the 2010 Cycle ” and the bottom line was sobering .
“ While voters are less dissatisfied than in 2008 , and core Democrats now feel the country is moving in the right direction , the center of the 2010 electorate expresses more doubts than confidence about the current direction of the country , ” Garin warned in a memo distributed at the event .
The national survey noted that just 22 percent of independents said the country was heading in the right direction , while 21 percent of liberal - to - moderate independents and 21 percent of conservative independents said the nation was on the right track .
The memo said 38 percent of independents approved of the job Obama was doing and only 28 percent of independents approved of Democrats in Congress .
Just 20 percent of those surveyed said Democrats in Congress “ look out for people like me , ” while 55 percent said they “ care more about wealthy special interests . ”
The only upside : Republicans fared even worse in the poll .
“ Voters disapprove of the job the Democrats are doing as the majority party in Congress , but they dislike the congressional Republicans even more .
The message from independents : ‘ A plague on both your houses , ’ ” Garin wrote .
Increasingly , it appears that pocketbook issues are the chief cause for the exodus of independents from Democratic ranks .
In its final poll before the special election — which showed Brown leading by 4 percentage points — Suffolk University found that 46 percent of Massachusetts independents said that the economy was the most important issue .
And among these voters , just 37 percent approved of Obama ’s job performance .
“ What ’s driving them are the problems — notably that unemployment does n’t seem to be getting any better and resentment of the bailouts and the big banks , ” said Paul Harstad , a pollster on Obama ’s 2008 campaign ..
And with some independents , especially those who lean to the right and hail from higher - income brackets , government spending is another concern .
“ They think it ’s out of control , ” said Democratic pollster Andrew Myers .
“ We did n’t pay a lot of attention to regular people , did we ?
I hate to say it , but to be honest this is largely self - inflicted , ” he said .
“ All we talked about was spend , spend , spend . ”
Just as big a concern , Myers said , was the view among independents that , after health care and the bailouts of the financial and auto industries , Democrats were simply too willing to extend the hand of the public sector into the private sector .
“ We ’ve more or less lost control of that debate , ” he said .
He concluded , “ Either Democrats are going to get the message , or if we do n’t , we are going to seriously pay the price . ”

So , since the UN has taken the time and effort to set aside a day in our honour , we should all be partying in celebration , right ?
Wrong .
I HATE HAVING A SPECIAL DAY FOR DISABLED PEOPLE , and it 's not just because it 's got a stupid name .
Look , in principle I can see that having one day set aside to celebrate crip pride might not be a bad idea , especially in countries where the disablified find themselves particularly marginalised .
It 's just , so far it has n't really lived up to its potential .
To be frank , I find the entire thing an embarrassment .
For a start , disabled people did n't come together and decide to have this day ourselves .
It was bestowed upon us by a group of benevolent world leaders .
I 'd respect it if there was anything in it for me .
If , for instance , it was commanded that on this day any Normal Person parking illegally in a Blue Badge bay would be thrown in the stocks and pelted with mouldy tomatoes , that 'd be quite cool !
But no , no conditions whatsoever are attached to this twenty four hour disability lovefest and as a result , not much happens , at least in the UK .
I checked out the events in my community and they include a speech by my local mayor and a workshop on equality .
No doubt both will be spellbinding .
I feel sure there 's weak orange squash involved .
I do n't mean to be rude - actually I do , I really do - but let 's compare this stuff to similar celebrations hosted by other minority communities .

After a lengthy court battle that saw Microsoft cut down by tiny Canadian firm i4i , the software giant has agreed to remove the conflicting function from its popular Word program .
As of this morning , the XML features at the heart of the great 2009 Word legal battle have been cut out .
The ordeal began back in August , when a Texas federal judge found Microsoft guilty of infringing on small Toronto - based i4i's copyright of various XML functions found in the software company 's Word , a prominent part of the very popular Office suite .
Microsoft was given until October 10 to remove
Word from store shelves or get the conflicting XML features out of the program , but this deadline was eventually delayed until January amidst appeals .
Microsoft lost its final appeal just before Christmas , and at that point vowed it would comply with the original court order .
MS Office Stock Dwindles Online MS Site
Getting one 's hands on a copy of Office on Microsoft 's website yesterday afternoon was a very difficult thing to do .
According to reports , only the $ 679 Office Ultimate edition was being listed as " in stock " .
All other versions of the suite were not available for purchase .
( Source : eweek.com )
Even Office 2003 Professional was pulled from Microsoft's MSDN and TechNet developer site .
It 's a surprising turn of events , given that at its last lost appeal Microsoft appeared ready to fully comply with the order .
Impressions then were that adapting to it would not have a dramatic impact on the program 's functionality or Microsoft 's retail capacity .
Microsoft Promises Short Absence for Office , Word
Microsoft Office should be available again soon .
" We 've taken steps to comply with the court 's ruling and we 're introducing the revised software into the U.S. market , " Microsoft noted in a statement yesterday .
" This process will be imperceptible to the vast majority of customers , who will find both trial and purchase options readily available . "
( Source : cnet.com )
In fact , Microsoft promises that most basic users of Office , including owners of home businesses and students , should n't notice much of a blip at all .
" In the U.S. , the Home & Student suite is already available for online purchase and download , and the other suites are available [ through ] retail outlets , " the company said .
MS Faces $ 290 M in Damages , Continues Fight
Despite promises that it would move on , reports state that Microsoft will continue its fight against i4i with another hearing in front of a three - judge panel soon .
The company faces having to pay damages of $ 290 million to the Toronto firm .

( Addition - a Power Point presentation on this theme )
In the early 20th century , Argentina was one of the richest countries in the world .
While Great Britain 's maritime power and its far - flung empire had propelled it to a dominant position among the world 's industrialized nations , only the United States challenged Argentina for the position of the world 's second - most powerful economy .
It was blessed with abundant agriculture , vast swaths of rich farmland laced with navigable rivers and an accessible port system .
Its level of industrialization was higher than many European countries : railroads , automobiles and telephones were commonplace .
In 1916 , a new president was elected .
Hipólito Irigoyen had formed a party called The Radicals under the banner of " fundamental change " with an appeal to the middle class .
Among Irigoyen 's changes : mandatory pension insurance , mandatory health insurance , and support for low - income housing construction to stimulate the economy .
Put simply , the state assumed economic control of a vast swath of the country 's operations and began assessing new payroll taxes to fund its efforts .
With an increasing flow of funds into these entitlement programs , the government 's payouts soon became overly generous .
Before long its outlays surpassed the value of the taxpayers ' contributions .
Put simply , it quickly became under- funded , much like the United States ' Social Security and Medicare programs .
The death knell for the Argentine economy , however , came with the election of Juan Perón .
Perón had a fascist and corporatist upbringing ; he and his charismatic wife aimed their populist rhetoric at the nation 's rich .
This targeted group " swiftly expanded to cover most of the propertied middle classes , who became an enemy to be defeated and humiliated . "
Under Perón , the size of government bureaucracies exploded through massive programs of social spending and by encouraging the growth of labor unions .
High taxes and economic mismanagement took their inevitable toll even after Perón had been driven from office .
But his populist rhetoric and " contempt for economic realities " lived on .
Argentina 's federal government continued to spend far beyond its means .
Hyperinflation exploded in 1989 , the final stage of a process characterized by " industrial protectionism , redistribution of income based on increased wages , and growing state intervention in the economy . "
The Argentinean government 's practice of printing money to pay off its public debts had crushed the economy .
Inflation hit 3000 % , reminiscent of the Weimar Republic .
Food riots were rampant ; stores were looted ; the country descended into chaos .
And by 1994 , Argentina 's public pensions - the equivalent of Social Security - had imploded .
The payroll tax had increased from 5 % to 26 % , but it was n't enough .
In addition , Argentina had implemented a value - added tax ( VAT ) , new income taxes , a personal tax on wealth , and additional revenues based upon the sale of public enterprises .
These crushed the private sector , further damaging the economy .
A government controlled " privatization " effort to rescue seniors ' pensions was attempted .
But , by 2001 , those funds had also been raided by the government , the monies replaced by Argentina 's defaulted government bonds .
By 2002 , " .government fiscal irresponsibility .
induced a national economic crisis as severe as America 's Great Depression . "
In 1902 Argentina was one of the world 's richest countries .
Little more than a hundred years later , it is poverty - stricken , struggling to meet its debt obligations amidst a drought .
We 've seen this movie before .
The Democrats ' populist plans can't possibly work , because government bankrupts everything it touches .
History teaches us that ObamaCare and unfunded entitlement programs will be utter , complete disasters .
Today 's Democrats are guilty of more than stupidity ; they are enslaving future generations to poverty and misery .
And they will be long gone when it all implodes .
They will be as cold and dead as Juan Perón when the piper must ultimately be paid .

The extended take or long take is the first time I noticed a filmmaker articulating cinematic space and pushing his / her desire for notions of auteurism .
It was the iconic opening shot in Stanley Kubrick 's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE , where we are introduced to our anti-hero Alex in an extreme close - up of his face , a smirking landscape of human evil that never blinks .
We then slowly PULL BACK to reveal the Korovo Milk Bar , the surroundings that fosters said evil with its retro-futuristic decay .
Ever since then , I 've been obsessed with the extended take in movies .
Let 's be clear .
The extended take is often mistaken for the tracking shot .
According to Wikipedia the tracking shot is , " a segment in which the camera is mounted on a wheeled platform that is pushed on rails while the picture is being taken .
Tracking shots cannot include complex pivoting movements , aerial shots or crane shots . "
So what is an extended take ?
The extended take is , " an uninterrupted shot in a film which lasts much longer than the conventional editing pace either of the film itself or of films in general , usually lasting several minutes .
It can be used for dramatic and narrative effect if done properly , and in moving shots is often accomplished through the use of a dolly or stedicam . "
The extended take is a cinematic high - wire act that pushes the director , actors , cinematographer , art department , sound design , and every other department to their limits .
They take a very long time to set - up , and are very easy to mess up .
The longer the take , the more pressure is added to get it right .
This list is , in my opinion , the 20 greatest extended takes in movies .
I intentionally did not make reference to movies like TIMECODE , RUSSIAN ARK , PVC - 1 , and NOKTA which are products of the digital filmmaking age , features entirely shot in a single take .
I believe those movies are a genre in and of themselves and deserve a separate discussion .
There are several amazing extended takes that I would have included in this list but was unable to because they are not available online to view , like the ones in ATONEMENT and JCVD .
I felt it would be unfair to make reference to something visually when I could not offer it up for review .
But I do recommend checking those films out on DVD if you have n't done so .
THE 20 GREATEST EXTENDED TAKES IN MOVIE HISTORY
20 . " THE PASSENGER " ( 1975 ) -- directed by Michelangelo Antonioni
On the DVD commentary to THE PASSENGER , star Jack Nicholson propagated a myth that Antonioni built the entire hotel soely for the purpose of shooting this final and haunting shot .
Documented production photos prove otherwise , and shows how the director achieved this shot by opening the bars on its hinges to push the camera through .
Hynoptic in its pacing and underlines the existential nature of the movie 's themes .
19 . " ROPE " ( 1948 ) -- directed by Alfred Hitchcock
Loosely based on the real life murderers Nathan and Leopold Loeb , Hitchcock 's ROPE was shot in 10 takes and is the famed director 's first color film .
18 . " THE SHINING " ( 1980 ) -- directed by Stanley Kubrick
Not as complex or lengthy as the other takes on the list , but is included for its iconic visual .
Stedicam operator , Garrett Brown , achieved many of the extended sequences by mounting the camera on a wheelchair .
Author Stephen King ( who wrote the book the film is based on ) originally tried to talk Kubrick out of casting star Jack Nicholson .
17 . " THE MIRROR " ( 1975 ) -- directed by Andrei Tarkovsky
Tarkovsky moves his camera with the seamless fluidity of a Max Ophuls in this scene that 's gorgeously moody as a classic Flemish painting .
16 . " BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES " ( 1990 ) -- directed by Brian DePalma
Every Brian DePalma film contains one or several great extended takes , so it 's no surprise he makes it twice on this list .
Here 's one from the often forgotten BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES , showing Bruce Willis entering the World Trade Center .
DePalma can be seen in this shot dressed as a waiter .
15 . " WEEKEND " ( 1967 ) -- directed by Jean - Luc Godard
WEEKEND 's famed extended shot is the list 's most overtly political , with its statement becoming more and more profound as the scene unfolds .
WEEKEND also marks the end of a particularly productive period for Godard who was pumping out two movies a year .
14 . " KILL BILL Volume 1 " ( 2003 ) -- directed by Quentin Tarantino
The tour through House of Blue Leaves proves to be Tarantino 's most ambitious shot .
Add to it the wonderful music by the girl band " The 5,6,7 , 8 's " and the funky lighting by Robert Richardson , you have a classic extended shot that is a mash - up of Tarantino 's influences .
13 . " WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES " ( 2000 ) -- directed by Bela Tarr and Agnes Hranitzky
In this scene , the camera moves with such confident discipline and restrained mastery , it serves to highlight the performances rather distract .
Its stark poetic beauty is only complimented by another extended shot of the main character moving along a dark street ... which only gets darker much like the character 's arc .
12 . " I AM CUBA " ( 1964 ) -- directed by Mikhail Kalatozov
This famous long take originally come out of the water and continued .
The camera was hand held , then passed from crew member to crew member , to make its way down the side of the hotel and into the pool .
Much to the disappointment of the camera crew , the director cut the end of the take , ending it underwater instead .
11 . " BOOGIE NIGHTS " ( 1997 ) -- directed by Paul Thomas Anderson
Many great extended shots tell their own individual stories within themselves , and have a beginning , middle , and an end .
There are several mind - blowing long takes in BOOGIE NIGHTS ( like the Shakespearean opening which introduces all the characters at the club ) , but this shot tells a clear tale of American tragedy and literally ends with a bang .
10 . " THE PLAYER " ( 1992 ) -- directed by Robert Altman
This opening and self - referential shot was unscripted and all the dialogue was improvised .
It took fifteen takes , but Altman ended up using the third take .
The interior scenes of Griffin Mill 's ( played by Tim Robbins ) office are the same used in BARTON FINK .
9. " MAGNOLIA " ( 1999 ) -- directed by Paul Thomas Anderson
P.T. Anderson tops his BOOGIE NIGHTS shot with this epic extended take through a TV network 's hallways .
Lots of dialogue , intricate lighting , and countless blocking and cues with multiple characters make this the most impressive take in Anderson 's canon .
8. " OLDBOY " ( 2003 ) -- directed by Chan-wook Park
There 's a rule in filmmaking :
If something can go wrong , it will go wrong .
Which is why extended takes of fight scenes are extremely difficult and risky to the safety of the actors .
In OLDBOY , its star Min-Sik Choi had to do most of his own stunt - work .
This single take proves it .
7. " CARLITO'S WAY " ( 1993 ) -- directed by Brian DePalma
DePalma is at his best with this extended shot through Grand Central Station .
A masterful composition that builds suspense by allowing the viewer to see only as much as Al Pacino 's character .
The word " fuck " is said a total of 139 times in CARLITO'S WAY .
6. " BREAKING NEWS " ( 2004 ) -- directed by Johnnie To
Johnnie
To never really got his due as a filmmaker .
This virtuoso shot proves it 's about that time .
5. " THE PROTECTOR " ( 2005 ) -- directed by Prachya Pinkaew
Martial arts star Tony Jaa kicks major ass in this extended fight scene that took 5 takes and over a month to shoot .
This is the first
Thai film to ever break into America 's top 10 box office , debuting in fourth place .
4. " CHILDREN OF MEN " ( 2006 ) -- directed by Alfonso Cuaron
CHILDREN OF MEN contain several jaw - dropping extended shots .
There is an on - going debate whether Cuaron used digital cheats to compose several shots into a single take .
I 've read sources that claimed this shot was done in four different locations and sources that claim it 's one take .
Whatever the truth , the audacity of Cuaron 's vision is never in question .
This scene is the strongest conceptually from beginning to end .
3. " HARDBOILED " ( 1992 ) -- directed by John Woo
This classic extended shot is impressive on many levels .
But more so because John Woo ( due to a tight schedule ) had no room for error and only had one chance at getting it right .
Critics have theorized that Woo knew ( at the time ) HARDBOILED would be his last Hong Kong production and wanted to pull out all the stops to let Hollywood know he was coming with both guns - blazing .
2. " TOUCH OF EVIL " ( 1958 ) -- directed by Orson Welles
Orson Welles was a genius ahead of his time .
This extended shot that opens TOUCH OF EVIL was so complex that it took endless takes to get it right .
The complexity of the manipulation of shadows and darkness is awe - inspiring as the camera moves through the town .
Welles finally got the take he was happy with on his last chance to film it before sunlight broke .
It opens with a close - up of a bomb and ends with it exploding , the perfect arc to a long take .
Welles decided to shoot the movie mainly at night because he knew meddlesome studio execs would be asleep during production .
1. " GOODFELLAS " ( 1990 ) -- directed by Martin Scorsese
From the master Scorsese , this sensational extended shot puts us right in the eyes of Lorraine Bracco 's character Karen Hill .
Like her , we are seduced by the glamour of Henry Hill as he takes us through a tour of the gangster 's life .
Money , respect , and power all in a single shot that ends with legendary comedian Henny Youngman , who kept ruining the difficult shot by forgetting his own famous lines .

Four girls and three boys were the victims of physical or verbal abuse because of their red hair , freckles and pale complexions .
Detectives are still trying to determine how long each attack lasted , but one may have been up to a half - hour , officials said .
Three boys have been booked for various crimes connected with the " ginger bashing " carried out Nov. 20 at A.E. Wright Middle School .
The Facebook page had dubbed it " National Kick a Ginger Day . "
What began as an effort by the animated TV show " South Park " to lampoon prejudice found a life of its own at a Calabasas middle school after a Facebook page inspired some students to attack redheaded 7th - and 8th - graders , officials said today .
Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. John Benedict said two 12 - year - old boys were detained and booked on charges of " battery on school property because of the cumulative incidents through the day . "
" This was not one incident but a number of incidents throughout the day , " Benedict said .
A 13 - year - old boy was booked for cyber - bullying or making a threat via electronic communication .
" He made the threat on an invite on Facebook , " Benedict said .
Investigators said the three boys face potential charges and have been released to their parents .
The Facebook page was not started by a Calabasas student , officials said .
Sheriff 's investigators began questioning students at the school after a 7th - grader was kicked and punched on campus by a large group of boys and had to be treated for bruises and bloody injuries by the school nurse , who alerted the principal .
That same afternoon , sheriff 's detectives were contacted by the parents of another 7th - grader , a 12 - year - old redhead .
They told investigators their son had been accosted twice by groups of 7th - and 8th - graders before first period .
Sheriff 's officials interviewed 25 students and say at least eight played some role in the bullying of redheads .
But they added that most of the activity did not involve physical violence and did not amount to crime .
The Facebook website that inspired the incidents seemed to draw on a " South Park " episode in which the Cartman character describes people with red hair , freckles and pale complexions as " evil " and " soulless . "
Dozens of children left messages on the Facebook page claiming to have carried out attacks on " National Kick a Ginger Day , " according to sheriff 's investigators .

Science reporter , BBC News
Doreen ( left ) with daughter Rebecca and granddaughter Anais
Genetic analysis turned up two white British women with a DNA signature characteristic of American Indians .
An Oxford scientist said it was extremely unusual to find these DNA lineages in Britons with no previous knowledge of Native American ancestry .
Indigenous Americans were brought over to the UK as early as the 1500s .
It rocked me completely .
It made think : who am I ?
Doreen Isherwood
Many were brought over as curiosities ; but others travelled here in delegations during the 18th Century to petition the British imperial government over trade or protection from other tribes .
Experts say it is probable that some stayed in Britain and married into local communities .
Doreen Isherwood , 64 , from Putney , and Anne Hall , 53 , of Huddersfield , only found out about their New World heritage after paying for commercial DNA ancestry tests .
Mrs Isherwood told BBC News : " I was expecting the results to say I belonged to one of the common European tribes , but when I got them back , my first thought was that they were a mistake .
" It rocked me completely .
It made think : who am I ? "
Ancestral home
The chartered physiotherapist studied for a degree at the University of North Carolina , but had no idea she possessed Native American ancestors .
She said she came from a long line of Lancashire cotton weavers .
Raleigh brought Indians from the Jamestown area to England
Anne Hall , who works as a private educational tutor , commented : " I was thrilled to bits .
It was a very pleasant surprise .
To have Native American blood is very exotic . "
She said she now aimed to investigate her family history in an attempt to track down the source of her rare genetic lineage .
Mrs Isherwood says her American antecedent must have arrived in Britain in the 18th or 17th Centuries .
She has traced her maternal ancestors back to 1798 and has found no sign of New World progenitors .
Maternal clans
The tests taken by both women were based on analysis of DNA inside the " powerhouses " of our cells : the mitochondria .
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is passed down from mother to daughter more or less unchanged ; but changes , or mutations , accumulate in the DNA sequence over successive generations .
Pocahontas was the daughter of a Native American chief
Mrs Isherwood and Mrs Hall possessed haplogroups characteristic of the indigenous people of the Americas , which are referred to as A and C .
" It 's very unusual .
Most of the people we test belong to one of the European maternal clans , " said Professor Bryan Sykes , whose company Oxford Ancestors carried out the tests for Doreen and Anne .
Professor Sykes , also a professor of human genetics at the University of Oxford , said : " There are matches between [ Doreen and Anne ] and particular Native American tribes , but that does n't necessarily mean those are the tribes their ancestors came from . "
Trickle of immigrants
This month marks the 400th anniversary of Jamestown , the first permanent English - speaking settlement in North America .
Alden Vaughan , a professor emeritus at Columbia University , in New York , has written a book on American Indians in Britain .
He said indigenous peoples from the New World began arriving in Britain as early as the sixteenth century .
" Sir Walter Raleigh brought back several individuals from the Jamestown area and from the Orinoco valley .
Pocahontas went to England in 1616 and died there the next year .
" She was accompanied by several of her tribal associates .
Some of them stayed in England for several years .
I do n't know of any marriages or even relationships between those women and Englishmen , but it is certainly possible .
" Later in the 17th Century , Native American slaves were brought over .
I do n't know much about them , because all the evidence I have are ads in London newspapers for runaway bond - servants , described as being Indians . "
William Gasarch is not the Clay Mathematics Institute .
He is n’t paying a million bucks for proofs of famous conjectures .
But Gasarch is putting up 172 of his own dollars for the solution to an intriguing little stumper .
And the prize problem appears to be somewhat easier than the Riemann hypothesis or the P=NP question .
( Unless it ’s impossible ! )
Gasarch sets forth his prize challenge in a blog post , with further background in a paper and in the slides from a talk .
All of those works are well worth reading , but for those who do n’t want to chase down the references , here ’s the gist .
Our mission , should we choose to accept it , is to color the nodes of an n - by -m grid , using only a specified number of colors , and observing a particular constraint :
Nowhere in the grid may the four corners of a rectangle all have the same color .
( Only rectangles with sides parallel to the x and y axes are considered . )
For example , here is a four - colored 15 - by - 15 grid that satisfies the no-monochromatic - rectangles constraint :
In this array of dots there are \( { 15 \ choose 2}^2=11025\ ) distinct rectangles .
If you care to check through all of them one by one , you ’ll find that in no case do all four corners have the same color .
In contrast , here is a 16 - by - 16 grid that is almost but not quite rectangle - free :
Gasarch offers his $ 289 bounty for any four - colored 17 - by - 17 grid with no monochromatic rectangles .
Why is that grid of particular interest ?
It ’s a border case .
Among square grids , all those up through 16 - by - 16 have been shown to have rectangle - free four - colorings .
For the 18 - by - 18 grid and all larger squares , rectangle - free four - coloring has been proved impossible .
For squares larger than 18 - by - 18 , four - coloring has been proved impossible .
The status of the 17 - by - 17 and 18 - by - 18 grids remains unsettled , but Gasarch believes that both are four - colorable .
Gasarch has much more to say about the mathematics behind this problem .
Here I would like to muse on some computational aspects of searching for a 17 - by - 17 four - coloring .
To state the obvious first , this is not a problem we can expect to solve by exhaustive enumeration .
There are 4289 possible colorings of the grid .
Casting out symmetries brings that down only to 2 × 4287 .
There ’s not world enough or time for checking them all .
Testing grids at random is also hopeless in the 17 - by - 17 case .
This nonstrategy actually works quite well for small grids .
For example , you can readily find a four - coloring of an 8 - by - 8 grid just by generating a few hundred thousand random colorings .
But the method fails for larger grids because the proportion of all colorings that are rectangle - free falls steeply with grid size .
( Consider the 2 - by - 2 grid :
There are 256 four - colorings , and all but four of them are rectangle - free . )
To make any progress toward the 17 - by - 17 case , we ’ll have to do at least a little thinking , rather than expecting the computer to do all the work .
Here ’s one idea that ’s very easy to implement :
Find a monochrome rectangle somewhere within the grid , change the color of one of its corners , and repeat until you ca n’t find any more rectangles .
This algorithm works reasonably well for grids up to about 12 - by - 12 , but then it runs out of steam .
On larger grids , changing the color of a node to eliminate one rectangle is likely to create another rectangle elsewhere ( or several more of them ) .
As a result , the system merely takes a random walk , with trendless fluctuations in the number of rectangles at any given moment .
You discover a rectangle - free coloring only if the walk happens to stumble on the zero point .
I found the 15 - by - 15 four - coloring shown above with an algorithm that ’s a little more effective even thought it ’s no more sophisticated than the corner - twiddling method .
The program repeatedly chooses a node at random and tries assigning it all four possible colors , tallying up the number of rectangles for each color choice .
Some color or set of colors must minimize the rectangle count ; from among these optimal colors the program chooses one at random and sets the node to that color before repeating the loop .
This is a “ greedy ” method :
At each step the number of rectangles can decrease or remain constant but can never increase .
Greedy methods are notorious for getting stuck in local optima that are inferior to the global optimum .
Maybe that ’s what happens to my program when I try it on 16 - by - 16 and 17 - by - 17 grids .
Or maybe the search space is just too large .
In any case , when I woke up this morning and checked the results of an overnight run , I did not find a rectangle - free four - colored 17 - by - 17 grid awaiting me .
Of course I really did n’t have to do any algorithm analysis at all to know that I was n’t going to win $ 289 and eternal fame with a day or two of idle hacking .
If the problem were that easy , Gasarch and his students would have solved it for themselves long ago .
In spite of these various failures and frustrations , the grid - coloring problem still looks tantalizingly solvable .
If a four - coloring of the Gasarch grid exists , it seems like we should be able to find it by some practical computation .
There are certainly lots of approaches more powerful than the blind dart game I ’ve been playing .
For example , if local optima are the major impediment , some variation on simulated annealing might help .
A more radical possibility is to try to construct an instance rather than merely search for it .
If we assume that the four colors are represented as evenly as possible , then the 17 - by - 17 grid must have 72 nodes in each of three colors and 73 nodes in the fourth color .
Starting from a blank grid , it ’s easy to mark off 73 nodes in a single color without creating a forbidden rectangle .
Adding 72 nodes of a second color is only a little harder .
But then the job gets tricky .
When you try to fill in a third color , you also by default choose nodes for the fourth color at the same time , and conflicts pile up in a hurry .
Some kind of backtracking approach is probably needed here .
Gasarch links to a paper by Elizabeth Kupin of Rutgers that explores these ideas in more detail .
( If you want to prove the nonexistence of a four - coloring , this is presumably the way to go . )
Gasarch mentions two other promising avenues : integer programming ( the discrete variant of linear programming ) and SAT solvers–algorithms for the satisfiability problem .
Having spent some time hanging out with a few master SAT solvers , I ’m intrigued by the latter possibility .
You can almost encode the grid - coloring problem as an instance of NAE - SAT , or not - all - equal SAT .
Each node of the grid is represented by a variable that can take on any of four values .
We group subsets of variables four at a time into clauses , where each clause includes the variables representing the four corners of a rectangle somewhere in the grid .
For the 17 - by - 17 grid there are \( {17 \ choose 2}^2=18496\ ) clauses of this kind .
The entire formula is satisfied if we can assign values to the 289 variables in such a way that none of the 18496 clauses has all four of its variables with the same value .
After 40 years of work on SAT , there ’s a highly developed technology for solving such problems .
However , there ’s a hitch .
SAT problems are formulated in terms of boolean variables , with just two values each , but the grid - color variables have four values .
Thus a further layer of encoding is likely to be needed , bringing a further explosion in the size of the problem instance .
One final hackerish note :
What ’s the best way to detect the presence of a monochromatic rectangle in a grid ?
My candidate goes like this .
We encode the rows of the grid in a set of bit vectors –four vectors for each row , representing the four possible colors .
For example , the red vector for a row has a 1 at each position where the corresponding node is red , and zeroes elsewhere .
The blue vector has 1s for blue nodes , and so forth .
Now we can detect a rectangle merely by taking the logical AND of two rows ( an operation that could be a single machine instruction ) .
A rectangle exists if and only if the result of the AND is nonzero .
at least two bits are set in the resulting vector .

Israel yesterday reacted angrily to a draft EU proposal for East Jerusalem to be a future Palestinian capital that allows the possibility of endorsing a unilaterally declared Palestinian state .
A draft policy document by the Swedish EU presidency , if approved next week by European foreign ministers , would significantly harden the EU 's support for the likely Palestinian stance in any on - going negotiations on a two - state solution .
A statement by Israel 's foreign ministry accused Sweden of leading a process which it claimed " harms the European Union 's ability to take part as a significant mediator in the political process between Israel and the Palestinians " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Israeli statement said that " important steps " had been taken by Israel to enable talks to resume , and the EU should now exert pressure on the Palestinians to return to the negotiating table .
Steps like those being taken by Sweden , it said , " only contribute to the opposite effect " .
In fact , the Swedish EU move is thought to be designed to encourage Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian Authority President , to enter negotiations with Israel by providing him with additional guarantees that the international community envisages broadly the same outcome as he does .
The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's declaration of a partial 10 - month settlement freeze has triggered anger on the pro-settler right , but the moderate Palestinian leadership is concerned that it will allow 2,500 housing units to go ahead in West Bank settlements and does not cover East Jerusalem .
Mr Netanyahu has frequently declared that he will not accept the division of Jerusalem .
European discontent over Israeli settlements will be further demonstrated today when the UK's Department for the Environment , Food and Rural Affairs is expected to announce a new labelling regime for goods from Israeli producers in the West Bank .
Labels will need to identify the goods as coming from the settlements , rather than using generic terms like " the West Bank " .
EU members have long envisaged Arab East Jerusalem as the capital and have never recognised Israel 's claim of sovereignty over it .
However , the Swedish draft would commit the EU for the first time to the inclusion of East Jerusalem as the capital of a " viable and contiguous " Palestinian state .
The draft also urges Israel to allow the reopening of Palestinian Authority institutions in East Jerusalem .
The Swedish document , leaked to the Israeli daily Haaretz , goes out of its way to praise the Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 's two - year plan for the preparation of a Palestinian state , and commits the EU " at an appropriate time to recognise a Palestinian state " .
Publicly , Mr Fayyad has only said he favours an eventual UN call for a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders .
But some officials have suggested that this could then form the basis for a unilateral declaration of a state – on the model of Israel 's declaration of independence in 1948 .
Some diplomats , meanwhile , said they expected the reference to recognising a Palestinian state to be dropped from any final EU communiqué .

Scientists have proposed an unusual method for cutting aircraft fuel consumption – they want to fly jumbo jets in formation like geese .
The prospect of flotillas of airliners soaring across the sky in V - shaped flocks , like migrating birds , is startling .
Nevertheless , research by aviation experts has shown that it could lead to major reductions in aircraft fuel consumption .
The work follows research carried out almost 100 years ago by a German researcher , Carl Wieselsberger .
In 1914 , he published a paper in which he calculated that birds flying in V - formations use less energy to flap their wings than those on solo flights .
Birds in flocks can therefore fly for longer periods than those travelling on their own .
Wieselsberger showed that when a bird flaps its wings it creates a current known as upwash ; essentially , air lifts up and rises round the tips of the wings as they flap .
Other birds , flying in the first one 's wake , experience an updraft , allowing them to fly further .
This idea is supported by observations by French scientists who studied great white pelicans trained to fly behind an aircraft .
The team – from the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , Villiers - en - Bois – strapped instruments and transmitters to individual birds .
These revealed that the birds ' heart rates went down when they were flying together , and also showed that they were able to glide more often when they flew in formation .
" They fly in formation to save energy , " said team leader Henri Weimerskirch .
Such experiments suggest that 25 large birds – such as pelicans or geese – flying in a V - shaped formation can travel 70 % further than solo birds .
Many of the great migratory journeys , some covering thousands of miles , made by birds would be impossible without the energy - saving effects of group flight , scientists say .
But aviation engineers have now taken these discoveries to their logical conclusion and have proposed that aircraft fly in V - shaped groups so they can benefit from similar energy - saving effects .
This idea is the brainchild of researchers led by Professor Ilan Kroo , of Stanford University , California , who say airlines could make substantial cuts in the amount of aviation fuel they use .
In one calculation , the team envisaged three passenger jets leaving Los Angeles , Las Vegas and San Francisco airports en route to the east coast of the US .
In the hypothetical exercise , the planes rendezvoused over Utah , then continued their journeys travelling in a V , with planes taking turns to lead the formation .
The group found that the aircraft used 15 % less fuel and produced less carbon dioxide when flying in formation compared with solo performances .
Such an approach could make significant inroads into the amount of carbon dioxide that is pumped into the atmosphere by planes .
The aviation industry is expected to become a major emitter of greenhouse gases over the next two decades , and airline chiefs are desperately looking for ways to cut fuel consumption .
Formation flights could be the answer , says Kroo and his team .
However , critics have pointed to problems .
Safety could be compromised by craft flying in tight formation , while co-ordinating departure times and schedules could become a major headache .
Kroo and his team say such difficulties can be overcome by more detailed work on their scheme .

Others have pointed out how the story itself is terribly thin and actually rather stupid , the dialogue is all sorts of corny , and the entire thing 's pretty much a direct rip - off of " Dances with Wolves " ( all true , by the way ; I 've seen it ) , but none of that really matters when the special effects are so awesome and brain - drenching that you might as well tear off part of your id and toss it in a blender when the movie starts to roll .
To which we can all effortlessly scoff : bulls - -t .
Let 's just say it outright :
This is a movie about alien porn .
It 's about the great , timeless , hypererotic white man fantasy of the Other .
Inhabiting it , having sex with it , becoming it , moving inside it , running and leaping and fighting and taking spectacular risks just before falling into a bed of florid vines with your significant -- and incredibly hot -- alien companion to fondle her tail as the planet smiles in happy bioluminescent munificence all around you .
Let me be clear .
I do n't mean " hot " in the typical sci - fi sense .
The Na'vi are not cheeseball pneumatic fantasy creations , the males all bloated , vein - popping muscle - bound meatheads and the females sporting Volkswagen - sized breasts and giant firedragon swords and asses from here to Lara Croft .
They are not the generic , infantile , 10 - year - old boy - lost - at - Comic - Con kind of hot .
Not completely , anyway .
No , this is adult hot .
Kinky hot .
Exoticism wrapped in virile prowess slipped into a giant sheath of sexy blue lizardleather .
It would appear that James Cameron and his nefarious crew of kinkhounds probed every nook and cranny and orifice of Freud 's extraterrestrial fantasy handbook to invent the dreamiest blue lustcreature imaginable .
Yes , this is a movie about fetishism .
Evidence ?
Plenty .
Let 's start with the obvious .
The Na'vi are 10 feet tall .
They are like every godlike basketball player , Amazon warrior and magical stiltwalker .
Did you know nearly every human on the planet wishes and dreams he / she could be taller so as to be more dominant and godlike and reach the top shelf at Pottery Barn with ease ?
Well , they do n't .
I just made that up .
But I bet it 's not far off .
The amazing thing is , despite their tremendous height , the Na'vi are not gangly or slow or heavy .
They have no dexterity issues or joint pain .
They are not constantly bumping into things with their gawky six - foot limbs .
They are phenomenally graceful and fluid .
There is no wasted motion .
They have zero body fat .
They move like featherweight gazelles when they should move like lumbering gibbons .
Mmm , tasty .
Let 's talk about those tails .
Oh , honey .
Did you know animal tail fetishism is one of the biggest sexual fetishes in all of fetishdom ?
Well it 's not .
Or rather , it might be .
I really have no idea .
I just made that up , too .
But it sure sounds right , does n't it ?
A tinge of bestiality ?
A hint of exotic animal play ?
Face it : on the right kind of creature , tails are sexy as hell .
Just ask a mermaid .
Catwoman .
The devil .
I mean , come on .
What about those catlike eyes ?
Wide set , twice as wide as normal humans .
And they 're huge .
Japanese anime huge , and bright yellow / green .
Like moonstones .
Like sea creatures .
Like Japanese anima sea creature catpeople from the moon .
Did you know large eyes and dilated pupils trigger a nurturing and protective instinct in humans ?
True .
Do you know when you add that to sexual kink , it 's downright perversion - ready combustible ?
Doubly true .
You ever seen any hentai ?
You ever read " Bondage Fairies " ?
Oh my God .
Of course , the Na'vi are deep blue .
They are not red .
Red would have been too angry and perhaps sparked protests from Native Americans .
Yellow is too creepy and urinary .
Green too slimy and frog - like .
Black too flagrantly racist .
Purple too fairy princess .
But everyone likes blue .
It 's sky , it 's oceanic , it 's blueberry pie .
Blue is downright dreamy .
Wet dreamy .
And the Na'vi sparkle .
Or rather , they have bioluminescent spots that light up and dance and look all magical and nightlighty and tasty .
Do you know what else sparkles ?
Another creature we 've excessively fetishized like drunk cheerleaders on meth lately ?
That 's right : vapid teen vampires .
Mmm , suck me now , sparkling blue bioluminescent anime sea creature Amazon basketball player moonlike catperson of my dreams .
But wait , there 's more .
What about the ears ?
Oh , hell yes .
Riding high , small and pointy , just like we like 'em .
Just like ... an elf .
Did you know elf porn is the second most popular fetish in America ?
Well it 's not .
I just made that up , too .
But it might be .
I mean holy hell , do you know how many fantasies were spawned by the Elfin robe - wearers in " Lord of the Rings , " with their high pointy ears and their Orlando Bloom / Liv Tyler immortal hotness ?
Elfin !
High , pointy ears !
Done .
What else ?
Oh right .
The African thing .
I mean , obviously .
Tribal .
Dreadlocks .
Full lips , long , sloping , wide noses , neck beads and loincloths and running through the jungle at top speed , barefoot , never cut or bruised or tripping over some damnable branch like a dumb lumpy white person .
The exotic African ( racist ? ) connection is strong and obvious , except for when it 's something else , like maybe Maori or Native American warrior , with the ponytails and the tribal markings and the fierce eyes .
Baby , the Na'vi have it all .
But wait , we have n't hit the best part yet .
Because in this movie , you do n't merely get to fantasize about the Other from afar or even just indulge in interspecies sex .
You get to literally become one of them .
You enter into their bodies and actually move and hunt and breathe and fight and screw and kiss and talk like them , fuse your DNA to theirs forever and ever .
It 's just like " Cocoon , " only far less creepy and geriatric Steve Gutenbergian !
Behold , the ultimate in guilty colonialist fetish fantasy epic porn filmmaking , ever .
Flawed , broken white man can , with his righteous modern technology , fuse his DNA with super - hot exotic sexually flawless alien species and become the Other and save the world and then score the hot chick from " Star Trek . "
Dude .
Mr. Cameron sir .
Just stop your silly overblown movie right there .
You do n't even have to have them fight the bad guys or run from monsters or stage ridiculous epic battle sequences .
What 's the point ?
Just have a lame white dude become a giant gorgeous blue sexhotsuckerbeast Na'vi , and film him walking down the street and ordering a latte from Starbucks .
Watch humanity share one giant , collective Lacanian psychospiritual orgasm .
Perfect .

In the current hodge podge of abstract finance , it is easy to get lost in the numbers and lose sight of the forest for the trees .
Which is why we provide the ultimate simplification :
In calendar ( not fiscal ) 2009 , the US grew its budget deficit by $ 1.47 trillion .
In the same time , the Federal Reserve grew its securities holdings from $ 500 billion to $ 1.85 trillion , a $ 1.34 trillion increase .
Keeping it simple : 91 % of the budget deficit increase in 2009 , under the authority of President Obama , was funded by the ... United States .
For thousands of people charged with such crimes as public drunkenness or resisting arrest , Department 42 is their first and last legal stop .
In this Hall of Justice courtroom , a stream of defendants arrive from jail for their first chance to have a judge review their case — without any attorney in sight .
There , many are given a legal Hobson ’s choice : Plead guilty and go home , or ask for a lawyer and spend longer in custody .
It is a choice offered to people who at times appear not to understand the legal consequences and who , in the worst cases , may not even be guilty of the crimes .
Defendants in Department 42 , the primary courtroom for misdemeanor crimes serious enough to warrant jail time , face the same predicament that Santa Clara County defendants encounter in all other misdemeanor courtrooms :
The rooms are not staffed with attorneys , so they are on their own as judges offer them a way to end their legal proceedings .
Impoverished defendants in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Sacramento , San Mateo and even smaller counties such as Yolo , San Joaquin and Shasta are routinely provided public defenders at their first court appearance , known as an arraignment .
But in Santa Clara , along with a handful of other counties including Contra Costa and Napa , public defenders and prosecutors are assigned only to felony courtrooms .
Defendants charged with misdemeanors can expect to be represented only if they hire their own lawyer for the proceeding , a rare occurrence .
Officials cite costs
The county ’s chief public defender , district attorney and the incoming presiding judge of the Superior Court criminal division all acknowledged in recent interviews that justice would be better served if a lawyer were present at all arraignments .
But each said in separate interviews that such representation is too expensive .
“ This current economic environment simply does not permit this type of expenditure when there are more critical demands on all public law offices , ” said Judge Phil Pennypacker .
That explanation shocks legal experts nationally and in other California counties .
Norman Lefstein , a law professor at Indiana University , said the practice leaves judges and the local bar “ complicit ” in depriving defendants of their right to representation by an attorney .
“ This is America , ” said San Francisco public defender Jeff Adachi .
“ If you were facing a year in jail , would n’t you want a lawyer to consult with ?
It ’s like facing a major illness and forgoing a doctor .
You just would n’t do it . ”
The problem of lawyerless courtrooms became evident as part of an ongoing Mercury News review of the criminal justice system and its handling of discretionary crimes , including resisting arrest and public drunkenness .
Those cases — which rest heavily on the word of police rather than physical evidence — commonly are resolved in guilty pleas by unrepresented defendants ; several later complained in interviews that the police improperly used force and then charged them with concocted offenses .
Unsettling disparity
The newspaper review revealed a startling disparity in the outcome of 246 resisting arrest cases that were resolved since January 2008 , depending upon whether a defendant was represented by a lawyer .
More than half of the defendants had no lawyers .
Almost nine in 10 defendants who represented themselves pleaded guilty or no contest to the resisting arrest charge — commonly at the first arraignment .
Almost half of those who were represented saw charges eventually reduced or dismissed altogether .
To be sure , those who pleaded guilty , in many cases , did so because they had no real defense and were willing to acknowledge their guilt .
But other defendants without attorneys said they offered their guilty pleas because the system pressured them into it .
“ I wanted to plead not guilty and I wanted to get out at the same time , ” said Sergio Batres , who insisted he was innocent of the resisting arrest charge filed against him .
Citing the burden of his incarceration on his wife , who works full time , and their two children , Batres pleaded guilty to avoid a lengthy and uncertain process in return for a finite sentence .
“ That deal was the only sure thing I had . ”
Judges ’ approaches
A Mercury News reporter watched lawyerless arraignments in a number of courtrooms in recent weeks , and reviewed transcripts of other hearings .
Every judge told the defendants of their rights and warned them of the dangers of representing themselves .
The speeches varied in length and in clarity .
Some judges took pains to protect the rights of the accused ; others appeared to openly encourage defendants to plead guilty in rushed hearings .
One day last month , the last defendant to be called in Department 42 faced charges of a traffic infraction and a failure to appear in court , previously , to answer the charge .
The defendant tried to explain that he missed the court date because he was in custody and not brought to the courtroom , when Judge Linda Condron cut him off , demanding a quick answer :
He could plead guilty to the traffic infraction , and she would drop the charge of failing to appear in court .
Otherwise , the defendant would return to jail to await another hearing with a lawyer .
The man took the deal .
A reporter watched a session last week in which Judge Randall Schneider told more than one defendant , “ I ’d like to resolve this matter today , ” which would probably happen only if the defendant chose not to contest the charge .
In contrast , in a special arraignment court for domestic violence misdemeanors , defendants are first shown an 18 - minute video on which Judge Pennypacker explained to defendants their constitutional right to counsel , and the serious consequences of pleading guilty .
He stated on the video , “ I do not want to encourage you to plead guilty simply to get out of jail , ” a point reiterated by Judge Michele McKay McCoy in the courtroom after the video had ended .
In that courtroom , where guilty pleas carried especially serious legal implications , virtually everyone ended up pleading not guilty and getting a lawyer .
Other court sessions left defendants openly confused .
One defendant , apparently meaning to plead “ no contest , ” pleaded instead “ no continent . ”
Defense attorney Daniel Mayfield watched one afternoon of an arraignment courtroom with a reporter , offering commentary as one defendant after another pleaded guilty .
Of about 20 defendants , Mayfield offered issues that he said should have been raised on all but two of them .
Needed compromise
In a recent interview the county ’s public defender , Mary Greenwood , called providing a lawyer for that first appearance an important “ goal . ”
District Attorney Dolores Carr , who has chosen not to staff the misdemeanor arraignments with prosecutors in the absence of public defenders , echoed Greenwood ’s view , but added , “ To staff these court appearances , we would have to decrease services in other areas .
Within these limitations , protecting public safety is best accomplished by the current compromises rather than diverting resources from more serious crimes . ”
But San Francisco defender Adachi rejected the idea that staffing the misdemeanor courtrooms was too expensive , calling it wrong to deprive people of “ the benefit of counsel at a critical stage . ”
Seattle University law professor Robert Boruchowitz , who serves on the American Bar Association committee on indigent defense , referred to that court hearing as “ the most important event ” in the lives of many defendants — they could face jail , losing their homes , getting deported .
Yet , he said , “ We are giving them a couple of minutes and no help when there is no lawyer there .
That is not what is supposed to happen in American courts . ”
Pity the small office when it comes to technology .
With anywhere from several to several dozen employees , there 's often no budget for an IT director to manage all the network services required for a modern company of any size .
Offices may need to handle email , file - sharing , calendar and contacts hosting , collaboration tools , and other matters .
Especially in this economy , how can an office of that size — perhaps your office ?— afford the technician needed to install and keep a Microsoft Server 2008 installation on the rails , plus the initial cost in per-seat licenses .
Unix and Linux distributions may be free or have relatively inexpensive purchase and service contracts , but you pay for that in requiring more expertise in house or on demand .
That may lead firms to Google 's door , turning to Web hosted services via Google Apps .
But the $ 50 per-user , per - year fee can add up , and Google Apps does n't offer everything a small business needs .
Some companies may not want to go this route , or may be subject to regulatory issues that prevent proprietary or confidential data from being located offsite with Google — or anyone .
That seems to leave a large niche in which companies want an affordable product that runs on commodity hardware and does n't need the constant ministrations of an IT expert , even if one 's required to set it up .
Apple has such a product , Mac OS X Server , but has been weak at exploiting this niche despite the server 's long history .
Apple has focused instead on support for large corporations ' enterprise networks , data center and cluster use , and academic deployments .
Releases before version 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) had numerous difficulties for those who could n't quickly fire up a command line and start entering commands from memory .
Further , OS X Server was often too focused on providing services for networks mostly comprised of Macs ; a lot of lip service was paid to Windows support , but it 's only seemingly fully matured in 10.6 .
But what makes OS X Server 10.6 a perfectly reasonable choice for small - to - medium - sized businesses is new pricing coupled with a custom Mac mini configuration .
For $ 999 , you can buy a perfectly speedy office server with a full , unlimited - seat license .
In this review , I look at a few specific aspects of the Mac mini server model and OS X Server as they relate to sub-enterprise - scale networks , especially where IT staff help is n't assumed .
I also offer you two key tips for fixing problems in OS X Server that tripped me up during testing .
( This is not a full review of OS X Server , which would take many tens of thousands of words and months of testing , much like John Siracusa 's in - depth OS X client reviews . )
Hardware , OS , and Pricing
The Mac mini server — its full name is the Mac mini with Snow Leopard Server — brings together two separate developments : a substantial price cut for OS X Server and increasingly powerful Mac mini models that have the gumption to work as servers .
Before 10.6 , Apple charged $ 999 for its unlimited user license , and $ 499 for a 10 - user version .
The 10 - user limit , however , applied only to simultaneous logins for certain kinds of services , including AFP ( Apple Filing Protocol ) , Apple 's native file - sharing service .
The 10.6 release threw that pricing out the window .
There 's one version of OS X Server 10.6 : $ 499 for an unlimited user version .
OS X Server can be installed on nearly any system capable of running the regular version of Snow Leopard ( which itself costs $ 29 for a 10.5 Leopard upgrade version that could be used for a full installation ) .
OS X Server since 10.5 can also be virtualized with one paid license per virtualization ; the $ 499 price makes virtualization cheaper , too .
By comparison , Windows Small Business Server 2008 comes in two editions ( naturally ) for either $ 1,089 ( standard ) or $ 1,899 ( premium ) with five client licenses , and charges $ 77 or $ 189 respectively for each additional client license .
The premium version includes Microsoft SQL Server 2008 for small businesses , and , because MySQL is included with OS X Server , one could argue the premium version is most comparable .
The Mac mini Server ( $ 999 ) is the other development .
Before this particular model , Apple shipped only one standard server system in multiple configurations with a full software license included : its rack - mounted Xserve ( starting at $ 2,999 ) , designed for server rooms and data centers .
Until an update in March 2009 , the Mac mini was too underpowered to handle multiple server tasks , although the mini was often found in data centers .
If you 're were n't racking your server , then an iMac or Mac Pro could serve , but both models can be overkill .
The Mac Pro can be purchased in a build - to - order configuration starting at $ 2,999 with OS X Server installed , but the Mac Pro has a strong graphics orientation , designed to be best used by 2D , 3D , and video professionals .
An iMac can handle OS X Server , too , but you 're paying for a built - in monitor you likely do n't need .
The March 2009 Mac mini update gave the tiny desktop real performance , bringing it reasonably close to iMac system specs .
The October 2009 Mac mini update bumped specs and made the server pricing work with Mac mini server .
For $ 999 , you get a 2.53 GHz Intel Core Duo , 4GB of 1066 MHz DDR3 RAM , two 500GB drives , one FireWire 800 port and five USB 2.0 ports , gigabit Ethernet , Bluetooth 2.1+EDR , and Wi-Fi ( 802.11n ) .
The server flavor omits an internal CD / DVD drive , which Apple sells as a USB attachment for $ 99 ; the second 500GB hard drive fills the optical drive 's space .
Instead of the external optical drive , you can use the networked CD / DVD feature — Remote Disc — that was added for the MacBook Air .
Mount a disc on computer elsewhere on the network with CD / DVD sharing enabled — separate software for Windows or via the Sharing system preference pane in Mac OS X — and the mini can mount it and even install a new operating system from it .
Two mistakes
Apple made only two missteps on system specs .
First , a server nearly always does better with more memory , and while 4GB is n't unreasonable , an 8 GB top limit would have been better if it were possible .
Several Mac tech sites have tested putting in 8 GB without any trouble , but Apple does n't support such a configuration , which means future versions of Snow Leopard could unintentionally cause trouble .
( The worst trouble I have had in 9 years of running OS X has been with system updates and incompatible third - party RAM . )
The second stumble is by limiting the Mac mini to 5400 rpm drives , the same as are used on the low end in laptops , instead of widely available 7200 rpm drives .
Servers benefit from faster drives because disk i/o runs continuously with many different sizes and types of file operations .
It may have been a heat issue , because the retail difference in price can be as little as $ 20 to $ 30 per drive , and Apple would pay some fraction of that .
However , it likely would have boosted the mini's street price by $ 50 to $ 100 , and that may have been seen as unacceptable .
The issue of RAM and drive speed are interrelated .
More RAM would increase caching and reduce disk accesses ; a faster drive would make a system with less RAM work more efficiently .
Apple should consider offering a higher - end mini for what would likely be $ 1,299 to $ 1,399 with two 7200 rpm drives and 8GB .
When I spoke to Apple about drive performance , product managers noted that the unit includes a FireWire 800 port .
Several of my colleagues who have tested similar configurations say that external FireWire 800 drives could outperform an internal drive .
Apple is offering the Promise SmartStor DS4600 RAID system alongside the mini for $ 799 with four 7200 - rpm 1 TB drives , and two FireWire 800 ports .
The device can be hardware - configured for mirroring , performance , or redundancy .
For networked Time Machine backups across an office network , this add - on might solve two problems reasonably affordably .
Four 1TB drives purchased separately can cost as much as $ 350 to $ 450 with no cases and without hardware RAID support .
Booting up for the first time
I have the advantage in this review of testing two separate Mac mini servers .
One I purchased days after the release of the model when it appeared as if a Mac mini I use for handling backups of Linux servers via Retrospect — do n't ask — had given up the ghost .
I had wanted to consolidate mail service , DNS , and a handful of other services onto a newer system , moving the functions from a Linux server , so I took the plunge .
( My older Mac mini was n't dead , only resting . )
How Apple Tries to Make It Easy Simplified server settings via Server Preferences
Automatic generation of self - signed SSL / TLS certificate
Automatic configuration of a variety of networked software for 10.6 ( Snow Leopard ) client systems
Creates a custom PDF on the Desktop with details on next steps , such as MX records for DNS to get outside mail delivery
The other system was a short - term loan from Apple , which let me compare and contrast a machine I 'd configured to run with a pristine installation .
In both cases , I did n't migrate any files from other systems , just test functions .
The Mac mini server is precisely like its non-server brethren .
It 's a squat square .
You unpack it , plug in a power supply and an included mini-DVI to DVI adapter , hook up a monitor , keyboard , and mouse , and you 're ready to go .
Set - up for a preinstalled copy of OS X Server is very much like the first boot for a client OS X system .
You walk through a very small number of settings , enter registration information , and create an account that can be used to administer the system .
OS X Server , like all of Apple 's business and professional products , has a serial number that must be entered ; it 's then confirmed with Apple over the Internet .
As part of setup , you answer a very few questions about what services you want to use , but you can change those choices later .
It 's most likely that a server wo n't have a permanent " head " or monitor , so after the initial start up , I activate my MobileMe account in system preferences and turn on Back to My Mac , as well as Screen Sharing in the Sharing preference pane .
( Back to My Mac only works with a single MobileMe account , so it 's not ideal for situations in which you have multiple people who need remote access .
Screen Sharing otherwise requires a publicly reachable IP address or port mapping that connects a public IP on a router to your server 's screen - sharing port . )
IN THE FRAY : Philip Poupin took this photograph of Corporal Willie Apiata VC in Kabul this week .
The French photographer says he saw elite Kiwi soldiers emerge from a building where the bodies of three insurgents were later found .
New Zealand SAS troops were in the thick of a deadly gunfight in Afghanistan that left three Taliban militants dead , a witness says .
French photographer Philip Poupin says he saw the elite Kiwi soldiers emerge from a building after the Taliban attack where the insurgents ' bodies were later found .
After the attack on Afghanistan 's Presidential Palace in Kabul on Monday , Poupin took photographs of Victoria Cross winner Corporal Willie Apiata and two other members of the New Zealand Special Air Service .
The publication of the photos yesterday has sparked debate about news media showing members of the SAS on duty .
The fact that one of the soldiers was Corporal Apiata was not disclosed until Prime Minister John Key officially announced it at a press conference yesterday afternoon .
Poupin told The Dominion Post that he saw a " tired and sweaty " Corporal Apiata emerge from the building .
" They were going out of the building where the three insurgents were .
They walked towards the Presidential Palace , no car , no Humvee , " said Poupin from a hotel room in Kabul .
" They were really close to the insurgents ... they were there to fight . "
Once the battle subsided , Poupin went inside the building and saw the bodies of three militants .
" There were two in one room and one in another .
I can't tell you if [ the New Zealanders ] were directly fighting with the insurgents ... but I could say they were right there . "
They were the only Western troops involved in the battle , he said .
Monday night 's attack was one of the biggest in Kabul since the war began in 2001 .
It followed three suicide bombings in the capital .
Earlier this week , Prime Minister John Key described the SAS 's role in the battle as " very limited " , saying they were " quite a long way back " from the building and fired no shots .
He only confirmed their presence after it was revealed by a New York Times reporter .
Thirteen people died in the battle and at least 70 were injured .
Defence Minister Wayne Mapp said yesterday that the SAS members were not as close to the fighting as Poupin suggested .
" That 's the information we have .
Both the prime minister and I have acted on the advice we 've received . "
Corporal Apiata was awarded the Victoria Cross in 2007 for carrying an injured Kiwi soldier out of the firing line during an attack in Afghanistan three years earlier .
Yesterday Mr Key criticised media for publishing a photograph of Corporal Apiata that clearly showed his face , saying it put the soldier at further risk .
He said Corporal Apiata would probably stay in Afghanistan until the end of his deployment .
" He is a very brave New Zealand soldier and he wants to be on deployment . "
The NZ Defence Force website features several photographs of Corporal Apiata , and has released photographs of him on duty in the past .
Dominion Post editor Bernadette Courtney said the paper published Corporal Apiata 's photograph because it was the first picture of New Zealand SAS troops in Kabul after they responded to a Taliban attack .
It was well known that the SAS was in Kabul , and the prime minister had confirmed the soldier in the picture was Corporal Apiata , she said .
" Corporal Willie Apiata is a war hero who requested to return to Afghanistan .
He was paraded in front of the public and the media here and around the world when he won his Victoria Cross .
" He has had extensive media training – $ 35,000 worth of advice paid for by the Defence Force .
" We do n't believe media here have placed Corporal Apiata or any of the other SAS members at any greater risk than they already are . "
The New Zealand Herald said today the journalist who broke the story of the SAS joining the counterattack against a Taliban strike was surprised at the reaction in New Zealand .
Afghanistan - based New York Times reporter Dexter Filkins , in a blog posted to the newspaper 's website yesterday , wrote : " New Zealand ?
At war ?
Who knew ?
Not a lot of New Zealanders , apparently . "
" The news ... that a team of commandos from New Zealand had joined Afghan soldiers at the scene caused a sensation in the little country off the coast of Australia , " he wrote .
Filkins said he spotted the New Zealand soldiers as they moved in to Pashtunistan Square , the site of the Taliban attack , which killed five people and wounded at least 70 .
He said one told him to : " Get out of here " .
" I saw the patch on his arm announcing his country .
Others were more friendly .
' Ca n't talk now , mate , ' said another with a smile . "
The Herald 's assistant editor John Roughan said the paper stood by the decision to use the picture which , he said , had real news value .
" The soldiers were in a public street , in a major city , visible to anybody , wearing their uniforms , carrying their guns , photographed as the New Zealand SAS , " he said .

Houston Police Officer Carl Black still remembers getting ready to fight the hulking 6 - foot - 6 , 280 - pound thug who was threatening him about 17 years ago .
The suspect readied to attack as he ripped off his shirt and shouted “ You 're not going to take me to jail ! ”
Then he looked at Black 's uniform , fell to his knees and gave up .
After putting him in his police car , the young officer asked why he had surrendered .
“ I ain't fighting the devil , ” the man said .
The suspect had caught a glimpse of Black 's badge number .
It was 666 .
Black , now 41 and a 20 - year veteran of the force , is in the unusual fraternity of police officers who have worn the mark of the beast on their uniforms — the number in the biblical book of Revelations that signifies the ultimate evil .
Though Black insists the number has no real meaning , the shield seems to have a mystical power to intimidate even the brawniest of suspects , who do n't want to mess with the man some colleagues call the “ white devil . ”
Got strange looks
Despite the number 's disturbing connotations , police departments around the country have freely given it out in the past .
An officer in El Paso , for instance , recently retired with that badge number .
And Black 's own grandfather was a Houston police officer who wore 666 .
Black specially requested the number out of respect for Loyd Black , who was an officer from 1943 to 1978 and died when his grandson was 13 .
But Black did n't think of its significance until he announced his number at the police academy and saw people move away and look at him strangely .
When Black graduated in 1990 , it was his grandpa 's old badge that got pinned to his uniform .
Black 's superiors thought the number request had been a joke , and he did n't get his new badge until he had been working the streets for a couple months .
Sentimental significance
To police officers , few things are more important than their badges .
The shields , which in Houston are finished with a precious silver - colored metal called rhodium , become part of an officer 's identity .
At the Houston Police Department , an officer only loses his badge number when promoted or leaving the force .
Even then , because of the sentimental significance , former officers keep them as mementos .
“ The number means a lot , ” said Doug Elder , a Houston Police administrative sergeant .
“ It 's the number they 're going to be associated with throughout their career . ”
Usually officers receive badge numbers in sequential order of when they joined the force , although numbers are sometimes reissued .
New officers today are likely to get numbers in the 8,000 range .
Officers can also request the numbers of family members who have left the police department .
Grandmother did n't like it
Black 's grandfather died long before his grandson joined the force , and family members are n't quite sure whether his unusual badge number troubled or helped him .
But everyone remembers how Carl Black 's grandmother tried to dissuade her grandson from taking the burden of 666 .
“ It was because of the reference , because of what the number represented , ” said Black 's father , Charles Black , who also worked as a Houston police officer .
“ She did n't want him to have it . ”
But the younger Black insisted .
He and his grandfather were close .
Today , Black keeps his grandfather 's old badge in his bedroom .
Black , who works monitoring sex offenders in the department 's Juvenile Sex Offender Registration Unit , is a bit of a cult celebrity in the 5,000 - man department .
Useful and amusing
Many officers have the reaction of Black 's partner for the last three months , Ricardo Rojas - Garcia , when they learn about his badge .
“ What the hell ? ” Rojas - Garcia first thought as he wondered whether he should hold up a crucifix or get a priest to bless him .
But it can be both useful and amusing working with someone who wears 666 .
There are , for instance , the occasional suspects who admit wrongdoing as soon as they see the number .
Then there are the reactions of deeply religious people , like the pastor who once spotted the number and asked Black to step out of his church .
Black maintains that his badge has no special powers .
But he notes he 's been shot at at least two times and was never hit .

NSW postal workers today agreed to return to work as a gesture of goodwill to the public to try to clear the backlog of mail before Christmas .
They had walked off the job earlier , along with other staff nationally , as part of a campaign for a new workplace agreement that protects penalty shifts and pay , and improves workplace safety .
But , while the other states remain on strike , several hundred angry NSW workers agreed at a meeting in Strawberry Hills , Sydney , to return to work at the next ordinary shift .
It 's the second strike in a week , after 20,000 workers walked off the job on Wednesday , December 16 , disrupting mail services nationwide .
Police closed Cleveland Street as the workers tried to march on Australia Post headquarters , carrying banners and balloons .
Zoran sez , " Earlier this week ( 12th Dec ) , a massive , peaceful protest of 100,000 people — the largest demonstration for climate justice in world history — was met with a heavy - handed response by the Danish police .
Thousands of riot police swarmed the march route , blocked off streets surrounding large groups of protestors , and arrested almost 1,000 people .
Arrestees were cuffed and forced to sit in rows for hours , as the temperatures dipped below freezing ; numerous people urinated on themselves after being denied use of toilets . "
Of course , these protests are being motivated by frustration at the incredibly weak results of the COP - 15 negotiations .
Last week , a closed - room group of delegates from Global North countries shocked Global South delegates and climate justice activists by pushing for a secretly - negotiated " deal " that would allow global temperatures to be allowed to rise by another 2 degrees Celsius – over the vehement protests of delegates from Africa and small island countries , argue that any increase larger than 1 degree will devastate and – in some instances – literally flood them .
Then , in the past two days , the negotiations on a deal on REDD ( reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation ) – which are being touted as the " success " of Copenhagen – have degenerated into an incredibly weak potential deal , in which immediate targets for deforestation limits would be dropped and no financial commitments from Global North countries would be made .
These failings on the part of negotiators from the Global North have been met with protests – both planned and spontaneous – by youth activists as well as delegates from the Global South .
What recession ?
China has second - highest number of billionaires as nation 's super - rich buck financial crisis
China now has more known dollar billionaires than any other country except the United States , according to a report released today .
The country has 130 known dollar billionaires - up from 101 last year , the Shanghai - based Hurun Report found .
The number in the United States is 359 while Russia has 32 and India 24 , according to Forbes magazine .
A Rolls Royce showroom in the city of Hangzhou .
There are now seven such showrooms across China
And China 's rich are getting richer , with the average wealth on the list $ 571 million - up almost one - third from last year , according to the report 's author , Rupert Hoogewerf .
' With the greatest wealth destruction in the west of the last 70 years , we 've seen China buck the trend and the wealth seems to be still growing , ' Hoogewerf added .
' They 've put the credit crunch behind them , ' he said .
' The key driver has been urbanisation .
You 've got all these cities being built , and that requires property developers , iron and steel manufacturers .
The latest thing is cars . '
Topping the list was Wang Chuanfu , chairman of electric car and battery maker BYD Co Ltd in which U.S. billionaire Warren Buffett holds a stake , with an estimated personal wealth of $ 5.1 billion .
He was also the fastest riser from last year , up 102 places .
Second place went to Zhang Yin and family .
She is the founder and director of the family company Nine Dragons Paper Holdings , a recycling firm that buys scrap paper from the United States , imports it into China , and turns it into cardboard for use in boxes to export Chinese goods .
In third place was Xu Rongmao and family , owner of Shimao Property Holdings Ltd .
Huang Guangyu , who founded GOME Electrical Appliances Holdings Ltd and owns unlisted property businesses , sank to 17th place from the top position he held last year .
He is currently being probed for alleged financial irregularities .
Gold rush : Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yin , who came in second place on the list , owns paper recycler Nine Dragons Paper and is worth an estimated $ 3 billion
Hoogewerf said the actual number of dollar billionaires could be higher than estimated .
' Either they are super - discreet , or perhaps they have n't come to the surface , " he said .
' Having said that , the transparency of wealth ... is now very much in the open .
There 's many more listed companies . '
Hoogewerf said people who probably should have been listed , but about whose wealth not enough in known , included Liu Chuanzhi , chairman of the world 's No. 4 PC maker Lenovo , and Chen Feng , founder of Hainan Airlines .
China 's ruling Communist Party once condemned entrepreneurs and private business people as capitalist exploiters , but now welcomes them since late reformist leader Deng Xiaoping began landmark economic reforms in the 1970s .
One third of the people on the 1,000 - name rich list are estimated to be Party members , according to the report .
Top ten Chinese billionaires

Minister for Justice Dermot Ahern today told a Council of Ministers meeting in Toledo , Spain , he supported the introduction of full - body scanners to Irish airports .
During a 90 minute session on the subject of counter terrorism , Mr Ahern told other European ministers and US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that Ireland would play its part in overcoming international terrorism .
" If additional measures are required - and they are - either in exchange of passenger information or better technology , then we should do so .
We need to fast track exchange of information which can play a very important role in defeating international terrorism .
Law - abiding citizens have nothing to fear from increased information exchange , particularly internally in the EU , and better scanning devices and technology , " he said .
" International co operation and co-ordination of all our efforts , particularly with the United States , will be essential to meet the terrorists head on .
The clear message to send out is that terrorism will not win over the rule of democratic nations . "
Britain and France are leading calls at EU level for the introduction of passenger name recognition ( PNR ) - information exchange used in profiling and detecting terror suspects - across the EU .
Such a system is in place between the EU and the United States .
Ms Napolitano briefed Ministers regarding recent attempted bombing of a Detroit - bound aircraft on Christmas Day , and she called for information exchange and security co-operation during the summit of European interior ministers .
The head of the Slovak delegation attending the Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers meeting publicly apologised to Ireland over the Christmas explosives incident involving one of their citizens .
After a meeting between Mr Ahern and the Slovak delegation , the Slovak ambassador to Spain , Jan Skoda , gave the apology for the incident in which a Slovak national returning to Ireland after Christmas unwittingly carried explosive material into the country as part of an exercise .
Mr Ahern told the Slovak delegation he understood the communications difficulties surrounding the incident in Slovakia , but he told the meeting the fact someone could board an aircraft with explosive material was a " wake up call " for the EU .
You just have to fire him now after that 118 - 83 loss to the Hawks .
Not because fans are angry , but because we all know what ’s coming : it ’s only going to get worse , confidence will continually decrease and guys will start acting up .
Nip it in the bud .
Firing Del Negro may not change the team in terms of success this year .
But it will prevent things from happening .
And this type of season is unacceptable .
I already ( somewhat sarcastically ) called for the head of every Bulls employee , so let ’s take a look around to see what everyone else is saying .
Not Qualified to Comment : “ I ’m too angry to get into it too much , but the Bulls are the worst team ever .
I do n’t mean that literally , but in terms of watchability they score a 0 on a scale of 1 - 10 .
The lackluster effort is frustrating , but what ’s more frustrating is Vinny Del Negro ’s complete lack of competency .
While there is more than enough blame to go around , I do n’t see how the situation could get worse without Vinny .
The way the offense runs ( or does n’t run ) leads me to believe things would probably get significantly better without him . ”
John Hollinger , ESPN : “ Even if the Bulls ’ management had no intention of canning Del Negro heading into the Hawks game , Wednesday ’s blowout has to give them pause .
Yes , the Bulls are a bit short on offensive talent , especially with injuries to Hinrich and Tyrus Thomas , but they have enough quality players to avoid getting hammered every night .
“ If we were losing close games , you could blame the injuries , ” one Bull said .
“ But this ? ”
Del Negro has had more than a year to implement his system , and it ’s one his players clearly do n’t believe in .
Whether he is removed Thursday morning or at some other point , the clock is ticking on his tenure in Chicago .
Wednesday ’s humiliating loss in Atlanta might just be the crack that sends him through the ice . ”
Sam Smith , Bulls Blog : “ Anyone who has watched this knows the level of disaster with nine losses in the last 10 games to fall to 7 - 13 , a half dozen games in that stretch in which the Bulls have trailed by at least an inexcusable 24 points during the game and a loss to the then 1 - 19 Nets .
Even worse , the Bulls have become something of an object of league wide ridicule . ”
By the Horns : “ Vinny might be feeling pretty chill — or so he claims — but it ’s become pretty obvious that losing has gotten to the players .
You can see it in their eyes , in the way their shoulders slump after a missed shot or turnover .
Basketball , especially on the professional level , is a game of split seconds .
In most cases , players have a split second to get their shot off or make the right pass , a split second to make the defensive move that will prevent an easy bucket . ”
Chicago Bulls Confidential : “ What ’s worse than anything else is that the absolute tank the team has fallen into will destroy any chance of getting a meaningful free agent this off season .
The argument for Chicago was always “ They have cap space and are better than new jersey or new york ” , well we ’re probably not better than New Jersey or New York the way we ’re playing .
There is no argument for Chicago if they can’t boost talent and cap space , because the ownership has a well earned poor reputation when it comes to paying for talent to surround it ’s players with . ”

Experience speedy RPG gameplay , beautiful environments and multiple endings for endless replayability !
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker says that when it comes to regulation , less is better .
" In my judgment we do n't need to regulate the capital markets so heavily , " Volcker said in an interview with Business week .
" You have some extreme cases where individual institutions are so big and so vulnerable , yes , you might want some regulation of capital and leverage , but that would be the exception .
But if they fail , let 'em fail . "
" We will have some kind of a new resolution process .
Some agency will go in there and say , " You 're going to fail , but we 're going to provide a more orderly exit . "
Volcker says that the kind of reform he proposes is “ somewhat in the spirit of Glass - Steagall in making a distinction between capital - market activities and trading activities and banking activities . ”
However , he would allow commercial banks to do underwriting of corporate customers , which the Glass - Steagall bill , passed toward the end of the Great Depression , did not .
“ The kind of reform I 've been advocating is acceptance of the fact that the core of the system remains commercial banking , ” Volcker says .
“ So let 's leave the capital markets to their own devices without any expectation of government protection and keep the existing safety net for the commercial banking system . ”
The bill proposed by Senators Maria Cantwell and John McCain bill would bar commercial banks from merging with investment banks .
If passed , the Cantwell - McCain bill would result in the break up of major Wall Street firms that critics say are gumming the country 's economic works by refusing to make smaller commercial loans .

Every year in virtually every country , crimes go unsolved – and sometimes undetected .
When someone commits a crime of this type it is called a perfect crime .
This is a list of ten tips to perpetrating the perfect crime .
I am sure it does n’t need to be said , this is not meant as a reference for criminals , but rather as an entertaining look at crime and detection .
1. DNA
DNA is the surest way to prove you committed a crime .
It is absolute imperative that you do not leave ANY DNA behind you and that is very difficult .
The best solution to this is to commit your crime in a place that is likely to have a lot of DNA from strangers .
For example , a park , a mall , anywhere that a lot of people tend to gather .
Finding your DNA will be like finding a needle in a haystack .
There may be no such thing as a perfect crime , but some people still manage to get away with it .

2. Relationship
The large number of crimes committed are committed by someone close to the victim .
The police know this well and they know who to question .
Your best bet here is to pick someone as random as the victim .
This is especially true if murder is your crime of choice .
Do n’t be tempted to commit your crime against someone you only know in passing – it must be a total stranger .
3. Proximity
This ties in to point 2 – commit the crime in another town .
You do n’t want to travel so far that you can be connected because you took a trip – just far enough that you are outside of the main area of interest to the police .
You also do n’t want to be on the road for hours before the crime as you may become tired , or after the crime as you may still be on the streets when the big investigation begins .
4. Type of Crime
Chose your crime carefully .
For example , you are almost certain to get caught if you try to rob a bank .
Chose a crime that can be committed in the early hours of the morning or that can be done very discretely during the daytime .
5. Evidence
Most criminals are caught because they tried to hide the crime – what they should have been doing is trying to hide any connection they have to the crime .
It does n’t matter if the police know the crime happened .
If your crime involves a gun or weapon of some kind , use it and drop it .
Leave it at the scene .
If you follow point 7 this will not be a problem .
If you kill someone , leave the body there .
Do not touch the body at all .
Do not move the body and do not try to hide the body .
And just in case you have n’t understood that last part – that includes using a vat of acid .
If you have stolen something , you need to get rid of it as quickly as possible and if it is money , do n’t start spending up large – you will draw attention to yourself .
6. Timing
Timing is everything .
The best time to commit a crime is in the very early hours of the day when most people are asleep .
If you do follow this instruction , remember that you need to look like you are not out of place on the street .
That means no full face coverings .
The selected time is important when you come to purchase your tools .
7. Tools
First off , you need good thick gloves .
The thin ones are not good enough as they can split and it is possible to leave fingerprints if they are sufficiently thin .
Do not use anything you own and do not buy brands you normally buy unless they are very generic brands .
This means you need to go shopping .
Shop out of town and shop in large department stores where you are less likely to be remembered .
Remember : very common brands only .
You must pay in cash and you must destroy any receipts , or shopping bags .
After the crime is committed , destroy everything you bought as quickly as you can and do n’t do it in an obvious way , like having a bonfire in your back yard when you have never done so before .
Wait at least one month from buying your goods to committing your crime .
8. Alibi
It is wise to have an alibi – though not essential if you have followed all the other rules .
It does n’t hurt however .
One way you can do this is to plan an out of town trip and book your hotel and rental car with your credit card .
Sign up for a convention and attend .
Try to use a hotel with no cameras .
In the early hours travel to the place of your crime , commit it , and return .
Enjoy the remainder of your holiday ( on your credit card ) and return home the next day .
9 . The Getaway
If you are committing the crime in the early hours , the best mode of transport is by bike .
This will enable you to get off the roads if you need and to travel quickly .
You do not want to be seen on the street walking ( remember , the Zodiac nearly got caught this way ) and you do n’t want to be the only car on the street at 2 am !
Take regular cycle clothes and wear them .
In the case of murder , if you have dumped the murder weapon you should not need to worry about evidence if you do get picked up .
Wear an iPod and maybe a fresh packet of cigarettes – you can always say you were out getting smokes as you could n’t sleep .
10 . Aftermath
First of all , do not watch the television and avoid the papers .
The police can use these as tools to try to psych you out .
Avoid these things for at least a month .
Do not celebrate in any way – continue about your every day life .
Do not brag about your crime to anyone ( that includes posting here in the comments ! )
One final tip : if you do get arrested , this does not mean you have failed to commit the perfect crime .
If this happens , do not speak .
The police need evidence to convict you – if you have done the job right , there wo n’t be any .
Do n’t help the police with testimony .
Remember , the court needs to find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt .
Oh – and if you do get convicted , you might want to read this article on the top 10 tips to surviving prison .
In case you are wondering how I know all this … re-read point 10 !
Okay , I am kidding .
Really .

Wanted and Kick - Ass creator Mark Millar has unveiled his latest Marvel Comics creation , and between the high concept and promotional image released , it 's as if he 's daring DC to think about legal action .
Ballsy or insane ?
You be the judge .

Nemesis , a new series created and owned by Millar and his Civil War collaborator does n't just look like the Joker 's smile painted on an all - white - costumed Batman 's face , it 's literally " What if Batman was the Joker . "
Millar explained to Comic Book Resources :
Yeah , a lot of people who 've read it have been coming up with hilarious tag - lines .
" What if Batman was The Joker ? " is the tame one .
" What if Batman was a total cunt ? " is maybe my favourite , although it 's hardly going to be an ad .
[ It 's ] is a reversal of the Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark archetype .
What if this genius billionaire was just this total shit , and the only thing that stood between him and a city was the cops ?
It 's Batman versus Commissioner Gordon , in a weird way .
Or maybe a super - villain version of " Se7en . "
A billionaire anarchist up against ordinary people .
The Joker 's the best thing in the Batman movies , so this guy is a bit of an amalgamation of all the stuff we like .

Consider it a psychological thriller with an unlimited special effects budget , if Millar 's description of the series is anything to go by :
All the cops are needed to go up against a guy as formidable as this .
He 's almost supernatural , he 's so good .
But he happens to just be in a costume .
Hopefully nobody 's ever seen anything like it before .
We 're so used to supervillains fighting superheroes , I just thought , " Imagine if there was only one person on the planet like this , and he was actually a bad guy . "
How would cops deal with him , even though he has no super - powers ?
... Very simply , I wanted to do a book about the world 's greatest villain up against America 's greatest cop .
I just liked the high concept of that - the idea of a villain going around from country to country and having a battle of wits with the best guy that he can get his hands on .
And he sends them a little funeral wreath with the date and time of when they 're going to die on it , every one dying at precisely that time .
All these cops in the Pacific Rim are dead , and then we come in at the American side of the story and see the struggle of this guy in just trying to stop him .

( As much as this is so - obviously - they 're - admitting - it - right - off - the - bat a Batman rip - off , am I the only person who got to " All the cops are needed to go up against a guy as formidable as this " and " I just thought , ' Imagine if there was only one person on the planet like this , and he was actually a bad guy ' " and thought that it was Death Note ? )
The series will debut in 2010 , and yes , Millar admits in the interview that there 's already Hollywood interest in a movie adaptation .

" Nemesis " Asks : What if Batman was The Joker ?
[ Comic Book Resources ]
( JTA ) — A Ukrainian philosophy professor said that Israel has brought thousands of Ukrainian children into the country to harvest their organs .
Vyacheslav Gudin told about 300 attendees at a conference in Kiev on Nov. 29 that Israeli medical centers have used the children for " spare parts " in the past two years , Ha’aretz reported Thursday .
The claim , which has been picked up by several Ukrainian Web sites , comes several months after a Swedish newspaper article claimed that Israel ’s army killed Palestinians for their organs .
During the conference , two professors presented a book blaming " the Zionists " for the Ukrainian famine of the 1930s , according to Ha’aretz .
The spread of the organ harvesting claim comes during a contentious Ukrainian presidential election campaign in which anti-Semitism has played a major role .
Presidential candidate Sergey Ratushnyak has made anti-Semitic and xenophobic statements during the campaign .
" The United States has been ransacked and pillaged .
Our structures have been gutted and only the walls are left standing …
In that dark crew of financial pirates there are those who would cut a man 's throat to get a dollar out of his pocket ; there are those who send money into states to buy votes to control our legislatures ; there are those who maintain international propaganda for the purpose of deceiving us into granting of new concessions which will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and set again in motion their gigantic train of crime . "
Senator Louis McFadden in the US House of Representatives , June 1932
" Never in the field of financial endeavour has so much money been owed by so few to so many .
And , one might add , with so little real reform . "
Mervyn King , governor of the Bank of England , speech to Edinburgh business leaders , October 2009 .
THERE IS a missing link in the debate about bonuses : shareholders .
They are the owners of the banks , so should have a significant say in remuneration , but , with some honourable exceptions such as Hermes and Co-operative Asset Management , they have kept quiet .
When shareholders or their representatives do speak – off the record , of course – it is not always encouraging .
One conversation last week wound me up so much I could n't sleep ; a colleague suffered a similar bout of insomnia .
We were told that a banker , sans bonus , could not live on £ 200,000 a year , when his outgoings were £ 350,000 .
How would he manage the school fees ?
Just how talented can these bankers can be if they lack the basic financial management skills to live a good life on £ 200,000 a year , or to have saved something for lean times ?
Never mind private school fees , what about the strain they have put on taxpayers , who fund the state system which educates more than 90 % of our children ?
A sense of entitlement does not make them entitled .
The bonuses being paid this year are not a reward for talent , but the product of taxpayer support , central bank rates so cheap they are almost free , and reduced competition .
We were told if you curb bonuses , the banks will head for the hills , damaging the City and the economy .
We were told it 's a very complicated issue , but that if we insist on cutting back bonuses we will pay a heavy price .
As if we 're not already .
I 'm sure readers will forgive my simplicity in pointing out that 6 m jobs have been lost in the US , two and a half million in the euro area and half a million in the UK .
Support for the banking sector here is close to £ 1tn , and , as Mervyn King says , we will be paying for the impact on the public finances for a generation .
We were told co-ordinated international action on bonuses is unrealistic , because some countries would break ranks .
That has n't deterred Barack Obama 's pay tsar from proposing drastic curbs on remuneration for the bosses of bailed - out companies , limiting rewards to $ 500,000 a year with a 50 % cut in total compensation .
In any case , countries that did defy global standards would risk turning themselves into bonus - havens with all the disadvantages suffered by tax - havens : a magnetic attraction for the " dark pirates " and a relatively impoverished native population , dependant on the patronage of a rootless elite .
We were told last week by Lord Griffiths , vice - chairman of Goldman Sachs , that banks should not be ashamed of paying bonuses , that we have to accept inequality is a way of achieving greater prosperity for all – the trickle - down theory of wealth .
I prefer novelist Margaret Atwood 's trickle - down theory of debt ; when the rich and powerful default , those lower down are crushed , unnoticed , in the wreckage .
Bonuses could be addressed if the banks collectively produced some best practice standards : it would be very impressive to see leadership on this from a strong international institution such as HSBC .
They could be tackled if shareholders , instead of defending the indefensible , came together as a coalition of owners to put pressure on the banks and other companies , and did their job of serving pension fund members and endowment savers .
Even individuals , who alone have little power , can contact the trustees of pension funds , mutual funds , charities or educational trusts in which they have a stake and ask them to engage with the banks .
Trustees have a fiduciary duty to protect their members , and arguably are in breach if they do not consider the future stability of the banking system .
My objection is not so much that someone at Goldman Sachs receives a large bonus if they get it right , but that when they get it wrong , we all pay .
That is why King is right to call for the splitting of basic utility banking from the " casino " activities of investment banks , with only the utilities enjoying state protection if they go down .
We are told this is nonsense , that it would not have prevented the collapse of Northern Rock , a utility bank , or that of Lehman , an investment bank .
But after the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act in the US , which until 1999 imposed just such a separation , the culture of the casino permeated the utilities .
The Rock was not a staid savings and loans operation ; like an innocent in Vegas , it was playing roulette with the big boys .
Investment banks were systemically important because they conducted their dealings in debt instruments with the utility banks , which should not have touched them with a ten - foot pole .
We are told we could not split the banks without international agreement : the same is true of climate change , but that does n't stop us trying .
Separation might be difficult , but as King says , it is not impossible , and if the casino bankers were excluded from state lifeboats their rewards need not trouble taxpayers so much .
Preferably , casino banks would also be structured as partnerships , as Goldman Sachs was until relatively recently , so individuals would bear real personal risk .
We 're told this is anti-capitalist , utopian , that we 're helpless to resist the bank and the bonus .
We should not believe everything we are told .
( CNN ) --
If you ask someone if they want something green for Christmas , they 're likely to ask for tens and twenties .
But some of us would n't mind getting gifts that are good for the planet as well as our lifestyles .
These are the gifts for people who write , " Dear Santa , How are you ?
I 've been good .
I 've been recycling and buying compact fluorescent light bulbs .
But you know what I really want for Christmas ? "
And Santa wants to help ; he 's a pretty green guy himself .
He eschews the big jets that most package delivery companies use , opting for a good old fashioned animal - powered vehicle that covers the planet on a single tank of hay and the occasional handful of carrots .
The big guy has long been a fan of canvas sacks , and shoppers in the U.S. have been catching on to the beauty of reusable bags .
Canvas shopping bags make an excellent , inexpensive present .
Most grocery stores sell them for $ 1 or $ 2 .
But a lot of people still put their fruits and vegetables in plastic bags .
Amazon.com partner Simple Ecology sells a set of three reusable produce bags for less than $ 12 .
Although Santa 's carbon footprint is probably small ( he grows his own trees for toys and home fuel ) , the same cannot always be said for us , so why not buy carbon offsets to mitigate the energy use of a friend 's home or car ?
TerraPass has different packages for funding clean energy projects .
Prices of the packages range from $ 29.75 to $ 369 .
They even have gift certificates you can have e-mailed to your green friends .
The elves love cell phones .
Motorola has what it calls the first certified carbon - free phone .
So while your elf is texting away , he or she could be doing it on a device whose the housing is made from recycled bottles .
And it 's not just a gimmick ; CNET says : " The Motorola Renew W233 is more than just a green device ; it 's also a decent phone . "
Winter weather can play havoc on the skin , so someone on your " nice " list might enjoy some organic skin care items .
Sephora sells products by Juice Beauty that are made without synthetic dyes or fragrances .
Now , we 're not saying the Clauses have bad skin , but folks who live year - round at the North Pole probably could use a gift set of skin - care products , priced from $ 29 to $ 45 .
For those long nights when you just want to hide under the covers , organic cotton bedding is a good call .
Pottery Barn offers a blanket in four colors , starting at $ 59 .
They also sell a comforter made from recycled plastic bottles and covered in organic cotton for $ 159 and up .
It 's hard to imagine Santa talking on an iPhone , but everyone seems to have at least one small electronic device these days , whether it's a cell phone or portable music player or GPS unit ( well , maybe he has a GPS to help guide his sleigh ) .
To keep those things powered up , Solio makes solar chargers .
The company says its Classic version , sold at REI and other outdoors stores , works with more than 3,200 devices .
At the Claus house , composting is essential .
There are composters of all sizes and even some for indoor use .
To save food waste indoors before making one trip to the outside bin , a pail comes in handy .
Most compost pails are made from stainless steel , though Williams - Sonoma sells a ceramic version .
If you want to buy your green friend an outdoor compost bin , Home Depot sells a spinning model ( which means you do n't have to take a small shovel to turn over dirt all the time ) for $ 180 .
And if you really want to make an impression , NatureMill makes electric indoor composters , a good choice for people in cold climates .
The company says you should have good soil in just two weeks , and the composter does n't stink .
For the college kid on your list , you might consider a car , but an electric bike could be a good alternative .
We 've written about them before .
They are a little pricey but are designed to take the place of car miles while offering an assist to the biker who might have trouble climbing hills or covering 20 miles .
Prices range from a few hundred dollars -- the E - Zip Trailz Hybrid costs $ 398 at Wal - Mart -- to more than $ 13,000 for OptiBike 's top - end model .
Major bike manufacturers like Schwinn , Trek and Giant have models that are about $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 and sold at specialty shops .
So Santa , if you are reading , one in red , I mean green , please .
Only the Guilty Need Fear — But We ’re All Guilty
A short while back , just before Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ’s attempted Christmas bombing , I heard a couple of people discussing online privacy rights on one of the CNN talking head shows .
One of them quoted with approval this statement by Google CEO Eric Schmidt “ If you have something that you do n’t want anyone to know , maybe you should n’t be doing it in the first place . ”
If intrusive surveillance of online activity might prevent the next 9 - 11 , this commentator suggested , then most us would accept it as the necessary price of security .
Never mind that Schmidt himself does n’t practice what he preaches .
Google blackballed CNET reporters “ in response to privacy issues raised by a previous story . ”
In a story about online privacy issues with Google , CNET had illustrated the problem by publishing “ private ” information about Schmidt ( “ his salary ; his neighborhood , some of his hobbies and political donations ” ) it found by using — wait for it — Google .
Just as an aside , we need a technical term for the time interval it takes one of these “ only the guilty need fear ” types to get all outraged when their precious privacy is violated by someone using their own previously self - justified methods .
The same cops who assure us that “ you ’ve got nothing to worry about if you ’ve done nothing wrong ” are oddly prone to stomping the shit out of someone capturing police misbehavior on video , for example , and have been known to make death threats against those who post said videos online .
And I vaguely recall a story about a local police chief who , after securing a judge ’s opinion that a citizen had no “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” regarding the contents of garbage put out on the curb , went ballistic when the local newspaper printed the contents of his own trash .
Never mind , also , how easy it is to access Google via one of the many online free proxy servers .
If Al Qaeda ’s masterminds are too stupid to cloak potentially incriminating web searches in that manner , it ’s no wonder the U.S. announces another capture of their third - ranked leader every month or two .
No , never mind all that .
From a purely practical standpoint , most of that information will probably be useless to our “ protectors ” until after the attack occurs , anyway .
Remember the hoopla about Richard Clark ’s warnings about imminent Al Qaeda attacks in August 2001 , and the unprecedented levels of chatter before 9 - 11 ?
Well , now the story comes out that Abdulmutallab ’s dad contacted “ the authorities ” ( gag ) with a warning that “ my Islamic extremist son ’s gone bugshit insane and I ’m afraid he ’s going to hurt somebody . ”
The problem , according to unnamed intelligence officials quoted by Karen DeYoung and Michael Leahy at The Washington Post , is that “ thousands of similar bits of information flow into the National Counterterrorism Center each week from around the world . ”
So the more “ keywords ” Looking Glass sends into the supercomputers in the NSC ’s subbasements at Ft. Meade , the bigger the haystack to be sorted through .
The broader the sweep of information - gathering , the more the system will be overwhelmed to the point of paralysis by useless information .
As crappy as the government is at processing data to prevent the unexpected , there ’s one thing it ’s great at using all that information for : harassing people it already considers political enemies .
Imagine , if during Woodrow Wilson ’s Red Scare , the country had been covered with tens of thousands of public surveillance cameras hooked into computers with digital face - recognition software , or “ know your customer ” laws had required cashiers to swipe customer ID for all purchases ; and imagine if all those video captures and bank account transactions were instantly checked against a database of Wobbly photos .
Imagine if Hitler had had that technology after Kristallnacht .
All these “ only the guilty need fear ” assurances ignore a mastodon in the living room .
They assume that the government is innocent , and that it means well .
They ignore the possibility that whether you ’re “ guilty ” depends on what the government defines as guilt from one week to the next .
And to the state , “ guilt ” primarily means threatening the class interests it represents .
A lot of left - wing activists suddenly found out they were “ guilty ” in 1918 .
A lot of Jews who , for their entire lives , had minded their own business and treated others with unfailing civility , found out they were “ guilty ” under Hitler .
Regardless of whatever else she got wrong , Ayn Rand pretty well summarized things with this statement :
“ The only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals .
Well , when there are n’t enough criminals , one makes them .
One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible for men to live without breaking laws . ”
The very existence of a government , any government , is a direct threat to anyone with the natural will to survive .
This is because its incentive structure drives it to constantly seek more power , criminalizing more and more in the process .
Only the guilty need fear .
But never forget that YOU could wake up tomorrow and find yourself “ guilty . ”
If you ’re like me ( and the rest of America , according to the Billboard Hot 100 ) , you love the Jay - Z song “ Empire State of Mind . ”
But here ’s the thing : there ’s apparently a frequently - misunderstood lyric regarding popular NBA players LeBron James and Dwyane Wade , one that seems to leave a number of people befuddled .
Maybe you ’ve heard this line ?
It ’s in the second verse and goes something like this , “ I got it made / If Jeezy ’s payin ’ LeBron , I ’m paying Dwyane Wade . ”
A lot of people think this has to do with an NBA franchise , of which Jay - Z is a part - owner : the New Jersey - soon to be Brooklyn - Nets .
Those people are wrong .
https://medium.com/media/2f15bd5b89a0e7ef6fe395fc211e69dc/href
The lyric in question is usually misconstrued in one of two ways .
Either :
1 ) It ’s misheard as : “ If Jesus paying LeBron , I ’m paying Dwyane Wade . ”
Or :
2 ) It ’s heard correctly , but taken literally , as : “ If Jeezy ’s paying LeBron , I ’m paying Dwyane Wade . ”
Here ’s how the different scenarios break down :
1 ) “ If Jesus is paying LeBron , I ’m paying Dwyane Wade . ”
A lot of people assume that this means that there ’s someone named Jesus who owns a large equity stake in an NBA franchise who is vying for LeBron James ( one of the best NBA players of all time , and close friend of Jay - Z ) when James hits the market as a free agent in 2010 .
Well , you know what they say about happens when you assume , and that ’s just what you ’ve done .
No one named Jesus , pronounced like the son of God and not in the more commonly used Hispanic way , owns any part of any NBA team .
Sorry .
2 ) “ If Jeezy ’s paying LeBron , I ’m paying Dwyane Wade . ”
So now you might think , okay , maybe the popular rapper Young Jeezy owns a bit of an NBA team , just like Jay - Z does , and he ’s saying that if Jeezy signs LeBron , Jay - Z will then settle for Dwyane Wade .
Again , you could not be anymore incorrect , I ’m sorry .
Young Jeezy also does not have any points in an NBA franchise .
It seems weird that you even thought that .
The actual answer is a bit more complicated .
In Young Jeezy ’s song “ 24–23 ( Kobe - Lebron ) , ” Jeezy uses the players ’ jersey numbers to articulate the price he ’s paying of a kilogram of cocaine .
The chorus of that song goes , “ I used to pay Kobe [ 24 ] , but now I pay LeBron [ 23 ] . ”
This means that he used to pay $ 24,000 for a kilo of coke , whereas now ?
He only pays $ 23,000 , you see .
So .
In “ Empire , ” Jay - Z takes this one step further , so as to show his impressive status in New York .
He suggests that , while Jeezy may be paying $ 23,000 , Jay - Z is paying a mere $ 3000 ( expressed as Dwyane Wade ’s jersey number ) for a kilo of cocaine .
David Cho is the publisher of The Awl .
Today I would like to go a little further and talk about distillation curves .
And then , because the world supply is changing to heavier crudes , I will go on to explain a little bit about what is involved in cracking a crude .
It is a little more immediately relevant than some posts given that researchers at Purdue have just come out with a suggestion for an improved refining sequence that they claim could improve efficiency by between 6 % and 48 % depending on how the process sequences in the refinery are re-ordered .
And the crude does n’t have to come out of the ground .
NIST have even tested some made from pig manure , with video .
Last week , I pointed out that the crude oil that comes out of the ground is not made up of a single hydrocarbon , but rather is a mix of different hydrocarbons that have to be separated .
And oils from different parts of the world are formed as different combinations of these , and even those from the same country have different properties .
For those new to the site , this is where , on weekends , I post a small technical talk explaining some of the aspects of the fossil fuel business , so as to help understanding of some of the topics on the site .
It is a very simple explanation , because of space .
Those who wish to ask or expound a bit more are invited to do so through the comments .
When you first get a sample of a new oil , you will gradually heat it to known temperature levels , generally following a standard method or something more advanced .
As the sample is heated , the lighter fractions boil off first , and by plotting the volumes emitted within known temperature ranges , a basic sense of the make - up of that particular oil can be achieved .
Example of two distillation curves from different types of oil
For example , if one looks at the blue line in the above graph , this shows a typical light oil composition .
It might well yield , on passing through the first distillation column of a refinery , the sort of separation that I showed in the plot last time .
Distillation products from light oils ( Source EIA )
However , as is slowly becoming apparent , we are seeing less of these light oils on the market , and increasingly the world is having to accept a greater proportion of heavier crudes .
To understand the difference that this makes , consider the red line in the above graph .
You can see that there is no fraction boiled off until the temperature has passed 250 deg .
This means that , in its untreated state , there is no natural gasoline in the oil .
Likely it was too close to the surface and those fractions evaporated away over the millennia ( as is the case with the heavy oils in Alberta for example , though this example is from somewhere else ) .
So how do we change this mix into something more useful ?
The answer , not only for this crude , but also for the heavier fractions of the light crude , since in both cases we would like to end up with about 45 % gasoline , requires that we crack ( or split ) the higher carbon molecules into lighter or lower carbon ones .
For example say we have a molecule of Cetane ( 16 carbon and 34 hydrogen atoms or C16H34 ) .
If we heat this to a high enough temperature , then we can break it down into some Octane ( C8H18 ) , some Hexane ( C6H12 ) and some Ethylene ( C2H4 ) .
But , obviously , what we would like to do is to control what it is that we break these heavier molecules into , and how much of each we produce .
And so we get into the world of Cracking Oil .
After the crude oil has been separated into the different fractions , the gas - oil fraction is then fed to a second heating process , where the fluid is brought back up to a high temperature ( perhaps around 735 deg C 1400 deg F ) and mixed with a finely powdered catalyst ( hence the " cat " ) .
Steam is also added to help with the movement of the mix , and the combined mix is fed up a pipe ( called a riser ) into a tank .
As it flows up and into the tank , the gas - oil breaks down into the lower carbon molecules .
This happens very quickly , so that by the time the mix is in the tank , the heavy molecules have broken down , and so can be drawn off .
However the catalyst has first to be removed , which happens by passing the flow through cyclones that spin the flow and separate the heavy catalyst , which is collected and fed down a pipe back to be reclaimed and re-used .
It needs to be processed since , in part , the process is not perfect and carbon will be deposited on the particles of catalyst , blocking its action .
( The carbon can be burned off - providing some of the heat for the process . )
The catalyst can then be re-used .
One operation might use the catalyst at a flow rate of some 55 tons / minute .
The hydrocarbons that flow out of the cracking process are then separated into different fractions .
Depending on the season , more gasoline or distillate might be desired , but the process might yield about 8 % coke , 55 % gasoline , and 12 % light gas oil with about 10 % of the flow being a sufficiently heavy product that it is sent back to be run through the process again .
Light gas oil becomes diesel and furnace fuel oil .
The lighter gas products are usually sent to alkylation , or reforming , where the lighter molecules can be combined to give products that can be blended into a gasoline or another desired product .
Different crudes have different mixes of hydrocarbons , and will need different sizes of processing sections that convert these different fractions to usable and desirable products .
Refineries usually have been built to handle only a given range of crudes , and thus have to be considerably modified if that mix should change .
Sometimes the crude can be even heavier .
The sands in Alberta contain an oil which is more conventionally called a bitumen , since it has less volatile material than the heavy oil example I used .
That oil must therefore go through an additional step to produce the lighter synthetic oil that can then be distilled and cracked more conventionally .
Some of the new processes involved in mining and processing the ore are described in a pdf file by Herron .
It also includes the distillation curves for the original crude and that obtained when the THAI process is used .
Distillation curves from the Athabasca Oil Sands ( after Herron )
There are also contaminants such as sulfur that can be found in the oil .
If the content is higher than 2.5 % , then the oil is called " sour " .
This sulfur must be removed .
While at one time sulphur was used as fuel in the refinery , that has been stopped , and now the sulfur is recovered .
Recovering contaminants requires a treatment circuit that must be installed if the mix to the refinery changes .
This is part of an ongoing weekend series on technical aspects of oil and natural gas production , among other things .
As ever , if my explanation is not clear , or if there is disagreement , then please feel free to post , and I will try and respond .

Terminally ill Dennis Hopper does n’t want to kick the bucket until he boots the greedy wife he once lavished with expensive gifts , the movie icon ’s pals say .
A longtime family confidant told The Post that Hopper is angry that wife Victoria Duffy is trying to bleed him for every last nickel — although he ’s given her a ranch , museum - quality art works and a wardrobe of couture dresses .
“ Dennis told me , ‘ I ’ve worked so hard to give Victoria everything she wanted , but it only fueled her appetite for more and more luxury , ’ ” the source said .
Now the star , who is dying of prostate cancer , is desperately trying to hang on until his divorce from Duffy becomes final .
Hopper is at an LA - area hospital surrounded by his kids and pals — not to mention an ex-wife .
“ I wish Victoria the best , but [ I ] only want to spend these difficult days surrounded by my children and close friends , ” Hopper said in a statement released yesterday .
Hopper ’s rep , Alex Hitz , said : “ They ’ve been having trouble and he wants peace and quiet . ”
The 73 - year - old “ Easy Rider ” star filed for divorce Thursday from Duffy , 41 , to keep her from contesting his will , which leaves her only one - quarter of his estate .
They ’ve been married for 13 ½ years and have a 6 - year - old daughter , Galen .
Hopper and Duffy have been together for 18 years .
The actor has three grown children , Marin , Henry and Ruthiana .
His first wife , Brooke Hayward , Marin ’s mother , is reportedly at the hospital with him .
Meanwhile , Duffy has remained holed up at the couple ’s home in the chic Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles .
Duffy is furious about being left only 25 cents on the dollar — the same payout spelled out in their prenuptial agreement , sources have told The Post .
The Hopper - Duffy relationship has been rocky for years and took a steep downward slide when she took Galen and disappeared for two weeks — when she was scheduled to visit him in Albuquerque where he was filming his TV series “ Crash . ”
“ No one knew where she was , ” said the source .
Duffy had been expecting much more than a quarter of Hopper ’s estate — and was also fuming to learn she was not named executor of the will , a source said .
Sources close to Duffy ’s camp insist the “ Hoosiers ” star is too drugged up to make any key decisions .
“ He is mentally incapacitated from the enormous amounts of medication he is on given his state , ” a Duffy confidant told The Huffington Post .
“ It ’s truly a tragedy .
And sadly , it ’s all about the money and who inherits what .
This is about getting Victoria out of the will , nothing more , nothing less . ”
Hopper ’s associates say there ’s nothing wrong with him mentally .

IN 1984 , George Orwell described a superstate , Oceania , whose language of war inverted lies that " passed into history and became truth .
' Who controls the past , ' ran the party slogan , ' controls the future : who controls the present controls the past . ' "
Barack Obama is the leader of a contemporary Oceania .
In two speeches at the close of the decade , the Nobel Peace Prize - winner affirmed that peace was no longer peace , but rather a permanent war that " extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan " to " disorderly regions , failed states , diffuse enemies . "
He called this " global security " and invited our gratitude .
To the people of Afghanistan , which the U.S. has invaded and occupied , he said wittily : " We have no interest in occupying your country . "
In Oceania , truth and lies are indivisible .
According to Obama , the American attack on Afghanistan in 2001 was authorized by the United Nations Security Council .
There was no UN authority .
He said that " the world " supported the invasion in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
In truth , all but three of 37 countries surveyed by Gallup expressed overwhelming opposition .
He said that America invaded Afghanistan " only after the Taliban refused to turn over Osama Bin Laden . "
In 2001 , the Taliban tried three times to hand over Bin Laden for trial , Pakistan 's military regime reported , and they were ignored .
Columnist : John Pilger John Pilger is a renowned investigative reporter and documentary filmmaker who was called " the most outstanding journalist in the world today " by the Guardian .
He is the author of numerous books , including most recently Freedom Next Time : Resisting the Empire , a collection of investigations into the effects of war crimes and globalization .
His books and films are featured at JohnPilger.com .
Even Obama 's mystification of the 9/11 attacks as justification for his war is false .
More than two months before the twin towers were attacked , the former Pakistani diplomat Niaz Naik was told by the Bush administration that a U.S. military assault would take place by mid-October .
The Taliban regime in Kabul , which the Clinton administration had secretly supported , was no longer regarded as " stable " enough to ensure U.S. control over oil and gas pipelines to the Caspian Sea .
It had to go .
Obama 's most audacious lie is that Afghanistan today is a " safe haven " for al - Qaeda 's attacks on the West .
His own national security adviser , James Jones , said in October that there were " fewer than 100 " al - Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan .
According to U.S. intelligence , 90 percent of the Taliban are hardly Taliban at all , but " a tribal localized insurgency [ who ] see themselves as opposing the U.S. because it is an occupying power . "
The war is a fraud .
Only the terminally gormless remain true to the Obama brand of " world peace . "
BENEATH THE surface , however , there is serious purpose .
Under the disturbing Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who gained distinction for his assassination squads in Iraq , the occupation of Afghanistan is a model for those " disorderly regions " of the world still beyond Oceania 's reach .
This is known as Coin ( counter - insurgency ) , and draws together the military , aid organizations , psychologists , anthropologists , the media and public relations hirelings .
Covered in jargon about winning hearts and minds , it aims to incite civil war : Tajiks and Uzbeks against Pashtuns .
The Americans did this in Iraq and destroyed a multi-ethnic society .
They built walls between communities which had once intermarried , ethnically cleansing the Sunnis and driving millions out of the country .
Embedded media reported this as " peace " ; American academics bought by Washington and " security experts " briefed by the Pentagon appeared on the BBC to spread the good news .
As in 1984 , the opposite was true .
Something similar is planned for Afghanistan .
People are to be forced into " target areas " controlled by warlords , bankrolled by the CIA and the opium trade .
That these warlords are barbaric is irrelevant .
" We can live with that , " a Clinton - era diplomat once said of the return of oppressive sharia law in a " stable , " Taliban - run Afghanistan .
Favored western relief agencies , engineers and agricultural specialists will attend to the " humanitarian crisis " and so " secure " the subjugated tribal lands .
That is the theory .
It worked after a fashion in Yugoslavia , where ethnic - sectarian partition wiped out a once - peaceful society , but it failed in Vietnam , where the CIA 's " Strategic Hamlet Program " was designed to corral and divide the southern population and so defeat the Vietcong -- the Americans ' catch - all term for the resistance , similar to " Taliban . "
Behind much of this are the Israelis , who have long advised the Americans in both the Iraq and the Afghanistan adventures .
Ethnic cleansing , wall - building , checkpoints , collective punishment and constant surveillance -- these are claimed as Israeli innovations that have succeeded in stealing most of Palestine from its native people .
And yet , for all their suffering , the Palestinians have not been divided irrevocably and they endure as a nation against all odds .
The most telling forerunners of the Obama Plan , which the Nobel Peace Prize - winner and his general and his PR men prefer we forget , are those that failed in Afghanistan itself .
The British in the 19th century and the Soviets in the 20th century attempted to conquer that wild country by ethnic cleansing and were seen off , though after terrible bloodshed .
Imperial cemeteries are their memorials .
People power , sometimes baffling , often heroic , remains the seed beneath the snow , and invaders fear it .
" It was curious , " wrote Orwell in 1984 , " to think that the sky was the same for everybody , in Eurasia or Eastasia as well as here .
And the people under the sky were also very much the same -- everywhere , all over the world ... people ignorant of one another 's existence , held apart by walls of hatred and lies , and yet almost exactly the same -- people who ... were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that would one day overturn the world . "

Original ad :
i need a grille not the cole kind but the gas kind .
i will barter my skill as a landscaper in turn for a good grille if u need any kind of landscape work From Me to **************@***********.org :
Hello ,
I saw your ad looking for a grill in exchange for your landscaping skills .
Do you do tree removal ?
If so , there is a very expensive grill in it for you .
Thanks ,
Mike
From josh ******* to Me :
yes
From me to josh *******:
Great !
There is a pine tree that has been bothering me and I want it cut down .
You wo n't have to remove it .
It has n't been a problem until about two years ago when it got much taller .
My problem with it is that it is obscuring the view to my neighbor 's upstairs bathroom window .
I used to have a perfect view of the neighbor 's wife changing in the bathroom every day .
She had great tits and an ass that was out of this world .
It really completed my morning whenever I caught a glimpse of her .
Now that this damn pine tree is in the way , I can't see a thing .
If you could go onto my neighbor 's property and cut the tree down while they are at work , I will let you take the grill that is outside on their patio .
I 'm not sure what brand it is , but it is a gigantic propane grill .
It looks really nice .
If they ask about it , I will tell them that a huge storm happened while they were at work , and the wind blew the tree over and blew the grill away .
Meanwhile you will be enjoying a delicious salisbury steak from your new grill , and I wil be enjoying my neighbor 's hot wife as she steps into the shower .
They usually leave for work around 7:30 AM during the week , and come back home around 6:00 PM .
If you could have it done before they get back on Monday , that would be great .
Thanks ,
Mike
From josh ******* to Me :
wat the fuck r u smoking dude ?
so i cut down ur neigbors tree and u let me steal his grille .
what a grate deal ass hole .
how bout i just take the grille and dont cut down the tree u fuck
From me to josh *******:
You do n't know where his house is , so how are you going to steal the grill ?
I think my information in exchange for your services is a fair trade .
I 'll even let you come over for a few beers afterward , and we can watch the wife in the bathroom from my bedroom window .
Mike
From josh ******* to Me :
i dont want a stolen grille i want a real grille u retard wat da fuck is ur problem .
and i dont give a shit bout naked neigbor u fuckin perv
From me to josh *******:
I assure you that this grill is real .
By cutting down the tree , you are earning the grill and it will not be stolen .
Also , if seeing a naked woman is n't your thing , you could probably catch the husband changing in the bathroom as well .
I wo n't be watching , but I 'm not one to judge your lifestyle .
Mike
From josh ******* to Me :

If there are sugary sweet carols , there have to be some sweet and sour jokes to equalize the flavour , right ?
Enjoy humor with some very Christmassy jokes .
Come Christmas and just someone stops you at work to say " Hear this one : why was Santa 's helper in depression ? "
When you give up , your friend replies " because he had low elf - esteem ! " and then everyone 's in splits .
That is the sway Christmas jokes have on those who get to hear them .
Oftentimes , the whole festive season leaves people stressed out after days of planning , shopping , cooking and inviting people to parties .
So at parties , people crack Christmas jokes to keep up the sagging energies and spirits of everyone , especially the hostess , who has had to work really hard .
There are jokes about Santa Claus , Mrs Claus (! ) , about reindeers , snowmen , snowflakes , chimneys , mistletoe , elves and anything else that can be related to Christmas .
All those jokes are meant to take the whole festive season in a lighter vein and to remember that no festive season is complete without a laughter and good natured way of poking fun .
Here are some timeless as well as some contemporary jokes on Christmas .
Everything is flaccid and more delightful ; the festival waves a magic baton all over the world .
The jingling of bells , white snow , and festive spirit all signify the arrival of Christmas !
It represents the birth of Lord Jesus Christ and is celebrated with much magnificence and grandeur across the globe .
The first image , which comes to our mind when we think of Christmas , is a home filled with cheerful people , with laughter spread all over and a party at full swing .
Christmas enthralls us all in a state of happiness and the festive fervor .
It is a season that you do n't want to miss in your lifetime .
Christmas is that one special day of the year which is set to celebrate the birth of Christ .
It is celebrated with high spirits in various parts of the world .
It is the occasion to spread joy and cheer and also the perfect time for the families to gather and party .
Kids have a ball during Christmas with their friends and cousins coming over and the winter snow giving them lots of ideas for creative endeavors .
They get to play lots of games and have fun outside but the winter chill also means that they have to spend time in the warm interiors .
Christmas is the day to end our wait for that Mr. Fatman who in his white and red robes gives us gifts and we call him Santa Claus .
Over the years Santa Claus or Father Christmas as famously called , has become a legendary figure that brings gifts to children during the evenings or early hours of the Christmas Eve.
Christmas is a time when excitement is in the air and people are in the holiday mood .
The festivities start many days prior to Christmas Eve and carry on till the end of the holidays after which people reluctantly get back to their daily work routine .
Heaton showed no emotion as he was sentenced A teenager who sexually assaulted a nine - year - old girl while on bail awaiting trial for the rape of a 10 - year - old girl , can now be named .
Simon Heaton , 17 , of St Helens , pleaded guilty to rape , sexual assault and causing grievous bodily harm .
He was previously protected by a court order which banned the publication of his identity .
Heaton was jailed indefinitely at Liverpool Crown Court and ordered to serve a minimum of five years .
' Break your neck '
On Monday , the court heard how Heaton first struck in parkland near his home in St Helens , Merseyside , in April 2009 .
Debbie Gould , prosecuting , said : " He began to follow his victim , who was three weeks short of her 11th birthday , and stare at her .
He grabbed hold of her and despite her resistance pushed her into some bushes .
The sick monster who is in court today took my little girl 's childhood away from her
Victim 's mother " She was trying to scream for help but he said to her , ' If you shout one more time , I 'll break your neck ' . "
After being raped she managed to escape and ran home .
He was charged with rape , but granted bail at Liverpool Crown Court with the condition he remained outside Merseyside .
He then targeted his second victim , a nine - year - old girl in Blackburn , Lancashire .
ANALYSIS Clive Coleman , legal affairs analyst
Indeterminate sentences consist of a minimum period of custody , known as the tariff , which the prisoner must serve .
Once the tariff is served , the prisoner will not be released unless he or she can satisfy the authorities that they no longer pose a threat to the community .
That means that prisoners can remain in custody indefinitely and it is for that reason that some have criticised indeterminate sentences as the new ' life ' sentences .
Prior to their introduction the authorities were powerless to stop some criminals who clearly remained a danger , but had served their sentence , from being released .
He subjected her to a violent 45 - minute ordeal , in which her jaw was broken in two places and she was sexually assaulted .
Miss
Gould told the court the little girl was found by court witness , Mary Smith , bleeding from the mouth and covered in mud .
She said : " Mrs Smith said she had never seen a child so distraught and in such a state as that little girl was that evening . "
In her victim impact statement the child 's mother told the court : " The sick monster who is in court today took my little girl 's childhood away from her .
" I prepared my child with tools to deal with the world to ensure she was safe - that 's a mother 's instinct .
" But what tools do you give a child to deal with real monsters ? "
The youth , who showed no emotion throughout the day - long hearing , was jailed indefinitely and must serve at least five years for the rape .
For the other offences he must serve between three and seven years , all to run concurrently .
Jailing Heaton , Judge David Harris QC told him : " To read and hear of the violence which you perpetrated on those little girls for your own sexual gratification is truly chilling . "

NY - 23 : Absentees ( Still ) Point to a Democratic Win
Created : November 16 , 2009 17:54 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
I see that Doug Hoffman has “ un-conceded ” in the NY - 23 special election after some prodding from Glenn Beck .
Unfortunately for the Conservative Party candidate , the absentee ballot count so far points to a victory for Rep. Bill Owens ( D - N.Y . ) .
The key problem for Hoffman : Dede Scozzafava , the Republican candidate who was forced out of the race , is winning around one in five absentee ballots so far ; she only won one in twenty ballots on election day .
The Watertown Daily Times has the more - or - less final results of the election before absentee ballots were counted .
The conservative Gouverneur Times has those results plus the final totals of three counties — three of the seven counties carried by Hoffman on election night — with absentees tallied up .
On election night , voters cast 2,365 ballots in Hamilton County : Hoffman won 50.0 % of the vote , Owens won 37.6 % and Scozzafava won 12.4 % .
There were 207 absentee ballots cast .
The breakdown :
Doug Hoffman – 81 ( 39.1 % )
Bill Owens – 50 ( 24.2 % )
Dede Scozzafava – 76 ( 36.7 % )
On election night , voters cast 17,674 ballots in Madison County : Hoffman won 50.8 % of the vote , Owens won 45.8 % and Scozzafava won 3.4 % .
There were 496 absentee ballots cast .
The breakdown :
Doug Hoffman – 170 ( 34.3 % )
Bill Owens – 203 ( 40.9 % )
Dede Scozzafava – 122 ( 24.6 % )
On election night , voters cast 5,165 ballots in Oneida County : Hoffman won 53.8 % of the vote , Owens won 39.2 % and Scozzafava won 7.0 % .
There were 762 absentee ballots cast .
The breakdown :
Doug Hoffman – 446 ( 58.5 % )
Bill Owens – 219 ( 28.7 % )
Dede Scozzafava – 97 ( 12.7 % )
That ’s a lot of variance between three counties .
In one , Hoffman did better than he did on election day ; in another , both Hoffman and Owens did worse than they did on election day ; in another , Owens lost on election day but won on absentees .
But the total picture from this batch of 1,465 absentee ballots is :
Doug Hoffman – 697 ( 47.6 % )
Bill Owens – 472 ( 32.2 % )
Dede Scozzafava – 296 ( 20.1 % )
That ’s a net 225 votes for Hoffman , who ’s down by 2,951 votes with 6,123 left to count .
It ’s simply not the kind of ratio that will deliver victory .
If the numbers keep breaking this way , it would point an Owens win of around 2000 votes .
But keep in mind , we do n’t have absentees yet in the huge Owens counties of Clinton and St. Lawrence .
It sounds as though China 's central bank 's attempt to engineer a cooldown and end its bubble is going badly .
A research report from analyst Yuan Tuck Siew of Axia describes the carnage and confusion :
We have confirmed that banks have suspended new lending since 19 January across the country .
For the seven banks we contacted in various areas of China , six said that lending has been suspended while the remaining one refused to confirm .
The suspension in lending was imposed by the authorities after an emergency meeting by the central bank 's monetary policy bureau .
A few aggressive lenders have received a punitive hike in their reserves ratio .
Reportedly , banks lent Rmb1.1 tn during the first two weeks of this year , in line with the extraordinary lending in the beginning of last year and way above the averaging lending pace over the past ten years .
In responding to such a credit surge , the PBoC has launched more aggressive quantitative tightening than we previously have thought .
We would expect lending to resume from the beginning of February , but Beijing will keep a close eye on lending activities .
The State Council is watching the lending figures on a daily basis , instead of the usual monthly basis .
We would not surprised if banks were imposed a monthly lending quota , as against a quarterly quota in 2008 ( the hard lending quota was abandoned in late 2008 ) .
This sudden suspension in lending has caught importers , along with many other companies , by surprise and could cause turbulence in China 's import orders .
Letters of credit ( LoC ) suddenly became unavailable , despite previous agreements .
We believe that this will inevitably lead to delays or cancellations in China 's imports .
Import orders for commodities and machineries could be affected most .
Some banks suggested that they would resume issuing LoC from February , but that would be too close to the Chinese New Year .
The Lunar New Year is on 14 February ( China will have a seven - day holiday ) , and many will leave for the long holiday as early as in late January , just like the Christmas holiday in the Western world .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street traders are n’t what they used to be -- they ’re not even on Wall Street anymore .

The days of swashbuckling backslappers on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange have given way to an era of trading dominated by analytical technical whizzes whose computers may be running from a town in deepest New Jersey or Texas .
While street smarts and an ability to socialize were crucial to successful floor traders , today ’s trader needs math and computer science , and quite possibly a PhD .
And that has to be coupled with coolness , organization and logic to sift through masses of trading data each day and think about how to shave microseconds off trades .
“ The old markets were based on retribution -- I knew who you were and you would trade with me again and again , and if you did n’t treat me right I would n’t trade with you , ” said Al Berkeley , chairman of electronic brokerage company Pipeline Trading Systems and former vice chairman and president of the Nasdaq Stock Market .
“ The difference is anonymity .
If you play a game with the same people over and over again , you reach an understanding about what ’s acceptable .
If the game is completely anonymous , there are no rules between people , there are only rules imposed by the marketplace . ”
The outsized growth of high - frequency trading , dark pools of liquidity and high - tech computer algorithms has fundamentally changed the game on Wall Street -- and the psychology of those who work there .
Traditional floor trading “ really is an alpha - male activity , ” said Brett Steenbarger , and an associate professor of psychiatry at State University of New York at Syracuse and an expert in the psychology of trading .
“ You get these highly competitive people taking a good amount of risk ...
It ’s like being in a locker room .
In contrast , computer programmers are almost like a think tank . ”
Now , with high - frequency trading representing some 60 percent of U.S. stock trades , the atmosphere appears to owe as much to Arthur C. Clarke and artificial intelligence as to Gordon Gekko and the 1987 movie “ Wall Street . ”
“ They are introverts , some are socially awkward , and they do n’t seek publicity .
They are the type of guys you would see at a Star Wars convention , ” said Sang Lee of Aite Group .
High - frequency traders are practical , problem - solving people with an engineering background .
“ It ’s a very intellectually challenging field -- it ’s extremely exciting to develop a strategy , implement it and see it make money , ” Steenbarger said .
And it can be very lucrative , with a programer typically making 10 percent commission on the money his model generates , said Irene Aldridge of Able Alpha Trading , a one - time quantitative specialist at CIBC in Toronto who has a forthcoming book on the practicalities of high - frequency trading and algorithmic strategies .
The best programmers can make tens of millions of dollars a year .
That was even the case during last year ’s financial crisis , as great volatility offered both risks and opportunities for high - frequency traders .
“ It ’s a highly technical , mathematical game , ” Berkeley said .
“ They are playing a very precise game of statistically estimating and predicting over the next three to five seconds whether there is going to be any liquidity in that stock and where it is .
And how they can take it without being seen and without leaving any tracks . ”
Low key and somewhat awkward , these introverted but brilliant traders look up to James Simons , the Renaissance Technologies fund manager known as the “ King of the Quants . ”
A media - shy mathematics professor , the 71 - year - old Simons has made billions of dollars by making the right bets on technical trading strategies .
In January he will retire from his firm , which manages $ 17 billion in assets , but will leave an indelible mark on the industry .
In fact , the Simons model has made “ PhD ” some of the most common letters seen following the names of today ’s top traders .
Expert mathematicians , physicists , computer scientists , engineers and economists have used technical skills to excel in trading .
Among new recruits , Wall Street experience is n’t valued nearly as much as programing aptitude .
“ These are not your Harvard B - school grads , per se , ” said Robert Olman , president of Alpha Search Advisory Partners , an executive search firm for hedge funds and proprietary trading shops .
“ They often have dual degrees , bachelors and masters .
One degree is going to be computer science , and the other degree might be financial engineering , math , physics , ” he said .
MILLISECONDS AND MICROSECONDS
Traders have discovered that mathematical techniques can help them gain more control over their trades , said Berkeley .
They hunt for trading venues that give them the fastest trades at the best price without exposing their strategies to rivals .
An obsession with milliseconds has led high - speed traders to focus on “ co-location , ” where trading shops try to place themselves as close as possible to an exchange ’s data centers .
High - frequency trading shops that focus on options have sprung up in Chicago , near the options exchanges , and in New Jersey , where trading venues like BATS and Direct Edge are located and where the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange house their data centers .
“ High - frequency traders use the computer and the speed of the computer to take control of the situation , ” said Pipeline ’s Berkeley .
“ It ’s just like having a high - speed fighter airplane versus a slow - speed one .
If I can turn inside your turning radius , and if I ’m faster than you are , I can win every time . ”
The essence of algorithmic trading , Berkeley says , is to avoid trading at a bad price .
Traders get as much control as possible over how to enter an order , cancel an order , change the size of an order , or find out any other information that will help them stay ahead .
“ It is all about converting the fact that you have very high speed and very precise control of your order into an advantage , ” Berkeley said .
“ If you do n’t get the trade you want , your order is canceled .
You do n’t sit there even for a nanosecond . ”
However , high - frequency traders ’ computer programs are not foolproof .
John Malitzis , vice president of market surveillance at the New York Stock Exchange ’s oversight body , told a conference in September that he has seen examples , both in U.S. markets and elsewhere , of computer algorithms malfunctioning .
He calls them “ algos gone wild . ”
High - frequency traders are also often discreet and secretive .
Proprietary trading shops and banks spend millions developing complex algorithm strategies and want to keep them in a black box well away from their competitors .
“ The social skills traditional traders have needed to serve clients are disappearing , ” said Aldridge , herself an ex-trader at a “ prop shop . ”
“ There was a lot more interpersonal communications on the trade floor , ” she said .
“ You see little of that at all anymore , because most of it is by computer . ”
And that can be a risk in itself , some say .
While the computer traders are more coolly analytical , proprietary shops have had to put in control mechanisms to rein in the brilliant programmers who are sometimes so immersed in their reams of data that they lose perspective .
“ They are so immersed in the market activity they do n’t really have a panoramic ( view ) , ” Steenbarger said .

An " alarmingly high " number of high school students are reporting sexual advances from their adult bosses and other supervisors at some of the country 's best known fast food operations , according to an official of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
" It 's an incredibly serious problem , " said William Cash , a trial attorney with the EEOC , in an interview to be broadcast tonight on the ABC News program " 20/20 . "
" Employers that choose to use high school kids to work have a responsibility to protect these young people , " Cash said .
" We do n't want them to be fondled , we do n't want them to be raped . "
Watch " 20/20 " tonight at 10 p.m. for the full report .
The issue is being raised in a number of lawsuits , including cases now pending in California against Starbucks and a McDonald 's franchise owner .
CLICK HERE TO READ MORE .
Kati Moore of Orange County , CA claims a 24 - year old supervisor at Starbucks made almost daily demands on her for sex , months after she began working as a 16 - year old barista .
" I felt like I did n't have a choice , " Moore , now 20 , told ABC News .
" I was ashamed and embarrassed .
And I felt like he had complete control over my job ... he knew all this stuff about my family and my friends and my school . "
She says the supervisor would summon her for sex in hundreds of text messages , including one that said , " I 'd liked to f--- tomorrow . "
" It was an everyday , numerous times a day occurrence , " Moore said .
" And I just saw it and did what I had to do . "
She says other Starbucks supervisors and managers knew what was happening but did nothing to stop the illicit relationship .
After the young woman 's mother learned of the relationship , she alerted prosecutors who brought criminal charges against the Starbucks employee , Tim Horton .
After claiming he did not know the barista was 16 years - old , Horton pleaded guilty to a felony charge of illegal sex with a minor and served four months in prison .
The family has sued Starbucks claiming the company failed in its responsibility to protect the young woman from Horton .
Starbucks executives declined to be interviewed but in a statement the company said , " These two employees concealed their relationship from Starbucks , which violated company policy .
We are confident that the case will ultimately be resolved in finding that Starbucks is not at fault . "

Hard Ball Tactics
The case turned ugly as the Starbucks law firm , Akin Gump , used hard ball tactics to defend their client , including successfully seeking to make public the young woman 's sexual history once it learned she had been interviewed for " 20/20 . "
" They are trying to defend themselves by calling me a slut , " she told " 20/20 . "
" It 's intimidation .
It 's harassing to sit though deposition and just be re-victimized . "
Federal judge Andrew J. Guilford agreed with Starbucks lawyers and ordered the information unsealed because of the company 's need " to defend themselves " and " level the playing field . "
Starbucks disclosed in court papers that the woman has had sexual encounters with 12 men other than Horton , seven of them before she met Horton .
Starbucks says it does have a strict policy against sexual harassment and managers dating baristas , but there is nothing specific about relationships with teens under the age of 18 .
The case against McDonald 's was brought by another 16 - year old employee , Kasey Ramirez , who says a 23 - year old shift supervisor lured her into a back storage room and put his hands around her waist and pulled her close .
" He said , ' It 's okay , do n't be scared , you can trust me , ' " Ramirez told ABC News .
" I thought his plan was to try and rape me . "
She said she broke away and went to another supervisor in hysterics , who she says told her not to be so upset because everyone knew the shift supervisor , who was later fired , was a pervert .
In a statement to ABC News , the McDonald 's franchise owner Michael Godlove said there is a " strict policy prohibiting any form of harassment in our restaurants . "
" When Ms. Ramirez complained about the incident , which occurred in 2007 , we responded promptly and took appropriate action , " the statement said .

In another case , a manager at a Taco Bell restaurant in Memphis , TN pleaded guilty to raping two of his 16 - year - old high school workers , one of whom became pregnant .
" The first victim worked for him about two months before she was raped .
The other young lady , he attacked her on the first day that she was working for him , " said Cash , the trial attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission .
Taco Bell
In a consent decree with the EEOC , Taco Bell , while denying any wrongdoing , agreed to pay several hundred thousand dollars to the teens and to begin a training program for its managers about dealing with high school employees .
In a statement Taco Bell told ABC News , " We are outraged that this situation occurred and committed to maintaining a workplace free from harassment in all of our restaurants . "
Click here to read the full statement from Taco Bell .
" They make enormous profits based on the work of high school kids , and that 's fine , " said Cash .
" That can be a great working relationship in many cases .
But employers that choose to use high school kids to work have a responsibility to protect these young people . "
What happened to Kati Moore is not uncommon , experts say .
The problem is especially prevalent in fast food restaurants where so many teenagers have their first jobs , said Dr. Susan Strauss , a consultant on corporate harassment .
" They 're vulnerable , they 're young , they 're new to the workforce , " Strauss said of the teenage employees .
One in three high school students reported unwanted sexual advances in the workplace , according to a study in Maine .

Charlie 's JustGiving page A seven - year - old west London boy has now raised more than £ 145,000 for Haiti quake victims in a sponsored bike ride .
Charlie Simpson , from Fulham , had hoped to raise £ 500 by cycling five miles ( 8 km ) around South Park on Sunday for Unicef 's relief efforts in Haiti .
A day after his five - mile ride Charlie said : " My legs are a bit sore after the ride , but it was really fun . "
His effort led to donations pouring in on the JustGiving website from as far away as New Zealand and Hong Kong .
Charlie , who went back to school earlier , is still unaware of how much he has raised but Unicef said he will be told when he visits its office later .
Charlie 's father Dan Simpson said : " We cannot believe the incredible response from the UK public .
Thanks for all the messages of support , they really mean a lot
Dan Simpson , Charlie 's father " Charlie is so grateful to people for sponsoring him and he is delighted his bike ride has meant Unicef can help so many children in Haiti .
" Thanks to everyone who has taken the time to donate and thanks for all the messages of support , they really mean a lot . "
His family said the ride had begun as a " little cycle round the park with his dad " .
Michael Newsome , director of fundraising at Unicef UK , said : " Everyone at Unicef is absolutely staggered at how much Charlie Simpson has raised .
" His donations will mean we can help thousands of vulnerable children in Haiti . " ' Inspired by Charlie '
He added : " Charlie spoke out about Haiti and the UK has listened - we are so proud of him .
" We would now encourage other people inspired by Charlie to try fundraising themselves to help Unicef 's vital work with children in Haiti . "
Before the bike ride , Charlie wrote on his JustGiving page : " I want to do a sponsored bike ride for Haiti because there was a big earthquake and loads of people have lost their lives .
" I want to make some money to buy food , water and tents for everyone in Haiti . "
The final amount raised by Charlie will be increased by a Gift Aid supplement .

vjack got me thinking this morning .
This week ’s idiot of the week is Those Who Insist That Christmas is Under Attack .
I think he ’s right on target .
I ’m sure not attacking Christmas .
My wife and I go through the motions because it is part of my duty to my family .
I hate the whole obligatory gift giving ritual .
Especially in hard economic times .
I would much rather share a meal with my friends and talk about old times .
Handing over some new bauble just makes the day a little more stressful .
I ’d rather not participate .
Religion plays no role in our holiday .
We do n’t go to church .
We do n’t pray .
We do n’t even talk religion .
The is no Christ in Christmas because the vast majority of my Christian relatives do n’t bring it up .
We just share a meal and do a lot of talking .
The asshats who claim Christmas is under attack need to look at their own flock .
My team could care less .
Jump over to vjacks blog and add your comments .
I think he is right on this week .
The moon ’s crystal basin ( Image : Lunar Orbit 4 / NASA )
SUPERMAN’S sparkling Fortress of Solitude they ’re not , but giant outcrops of crystals , found on the moon by India ’s Chandrayaan - 1 probe , prove that a roiling ocean of magma once engulfed the rocky body of our satellite .
The moon is thought to have coalesced more than 4 billion years ago from the molten debris of an impact between the Earth and a Mars - sized object .
Models suggest that heat from that impact , as well as from material compressing to form the moon , created a sea of magma that lasted for a few hundred million years . …
TLC recently reran Purity Balls , a documentary about the father / daughter cotillions celebrating girls ' pledges to remain virgins until marriage .
Why is the focus solely on getting girls to protect their " purity " and so little on preventing boys from violating it ?
After all , I think the term " purity balls " would be much more appropriate for Christian males who pledge to remain virgins .
But aside from that , there 's a laundry list of reasons why I think purity balls are not only ridiculous , but harmful to the females who are pressured into participating in them .
One of those reasons is that the fathers involved in these ceremonies think that they not only know exactly what women want and need , but are the authority on it .

Also , this :
Which makes me feel like this :

By having their daughters take pledges of " purity " and telling them to expect nothing less than a fairytale of a romance from a prince of a guy , these parents are more than likely setting them up for a lifetime of disappointment , as life is far from a fairytale , even for women who marry literal princes .
( Hello , Princess Diana , anyone ? )
But ultimately , what 's most troubling about purity balls and such pledges is that the parents are always talking about how there are " terrible consequences " to making " certain " ( read : sexy ) choices .
And while that can be true , why is the solution then to discourage their daughters from making any choices at all ?
I admit that I 'm approaching the topic with my own biases — about sex and religion and people who parent their children with a " do what I say , not what I 've done " philosophy — but it 's clear from this clip that this 11 - year - old girl has no idea about what dating in the 21st century is like , and it 's scary to think that there 's a chance she never will .
Armada 2526 is a new 4 x space strategy game released last 24th of November .
It was developed by Ntronium Games and published by Matrix Games .
The founder of Ntronium games is Bob Smith who was the project director and lead designer of Medieval 2 Total War , as for the other preceding Total War Games : Rome Total War , Shogun : Total War , and … Armada 2525 , the preceding 1991 oldy ) .
The game is talked about as being Master of Orion meets Total War .
Impressing combination right ?
Let ’s see if words turn into facts .
I bought Armada 2526 through Impulse ( digital copy ) 2 days ago .
No waiting or searching for where to buy the game , through impulse you can buy a digital copy only and download it right away or get a digital copy plus the Box for the ones interested in obtaining the physical stuff .
Some minutes of downloading and some more of installing and that ’s it , I ’m ready and thrilled to be launching my fresh new 4 x space strategy game .
Introductions made let ’s talk about the game .
Start a new game
You may wish to start by the tutorial to understand the basic features .
From there you have the option to play the built - in scenario that introduces the game 12 races or you can customize your own game .
Starmap , Stars , Planets , Comet clouds and Asteroid fields
I ’ll take some time addressing this part of the game because I think it really deserves it .
The star systems and planets have been carefully crafted to offer the player the right balance between abstraction and complexity .
This will certainly help the player enhance its gaming experience specially during the eXploration phase .
Armada 2526 – Star map
The starmap is 2D , very similar in style to Master of Orion ( first check for MOO inspiration ) .
Star systems can be of several shapes and sizes .
Stars can be Red Dwarfs ,
White , Blue , Yellow , Orange , Red Giants and White Giants which determines how likely the chance is of finding planets , and specially ideal planets for colonization .
White and Red Giant stars have the lowest chance of holding planets suitable for life while the yellow ones have the maximum probability of holding ideal planets .
There are even binary systems and neutron stars that have their own special characteristics and uses .
Armada 2526 – Different kinds of star systems
Each star usually contains one main planet ( and only one ) that may be categorized as : Ideal , Habitable , Barren , Icy , Irradiated or Dead ( I only found those types yet ) .
This planet categorization tells how suitable a planet is for population growth with Ideal obviously being the best suitable .
Some of these types requires technology to allow its colonization .
I say that a star usually contains a main planet because some times they do n’t contain a planet at all ( although you might still build a space station on those with suitable technology ) .
Another aspects of the planetary system , besides the quality of its main planet , is its mineral abundance that is categorized from Poor , Normal to Rich .
The richer the planetary system ( which is illustrated has having additional background planets ) the more money can be made from mining and taxes .
Again the resemblance with the Master of Orion mineral classification here is sound ( another check to the list ) .
In addition to planetary system mineral abundance there are two other aspects that help fully categorize a planetary system : the presence of a Oort cloud ( cloud of comets ) and of an Asteroid Belt .
These last two features provide additional chance for further mining and reduction on production costs .
Already feeling your eXploration desire kicking in :)
Population , Production , Fleets and Defenses
When clicking in one of your star systems you are presented with the production screen .
You can build structures , space ships and defenses ( missile bases and militia ) .
Nothing really original here , very similar to the Master of Orion ( I and II ) scheme .
Armada 2526 – Production Screen
In addition to managing production you can also easily consult all kinds of stats in the production screen like Income , Expenses , Happiness , Population Growth , etc .
Armada 2526 – Planet Stats Screen ( detail view )
Two important aspects to note in the production scheme , that make it different from other titles like GalCiv2 or Master of Orion 2 , is the notion of construction slots ( that are dependent on population ) and the notion of buildings improvement dependencies .
With respect to construction slots you may be already thinking , well but GalCiv2 provides planet construction slots already .
Yes its true but Armada 2526 takes this idea into a new level .
In Armada 2526 you can only use the slots to construct more things if you have enough population .
This makes sense since you should only be allowed to build more structures if you have enough labor to build and operate them .
One thing that annoyed me in GalCiv2 was the ability to build everything you wanted irrespective of the population present in the planet .
I know that some of that could be attributed to industry automation but anyway it did n’t feel natural .
The other production aspect where Armada 2526 innovates from previous 4 x titles is the buildings improvement dependencies .
To build more advanced structures you need to evolve your workshop and to build more advanced spaceships you need to evolve the shipyard .
This approach is in line with the Total War games where you need to enhance your main construction structures ( normally the townhouse ) before being allowed to build more advanced elements .
For example to build Cruisers you need to have at least a small orbital shipyard and to build a mine complex you need to have to turn your little workshop into a heavy industry .
Research
To unlock new ship designs , new buildings , new defences and to acquire new abilities and bonuses you need to do research , and to do that you need to construct research labs .
Each basic research lab present on a planet produces 1 research point .
The research points can be distributed among 7 different fields or areas : Weapons , Shields , Hyperspace , Construction , Information , Bio and Psychic .
There is a special additional area named skunk works which is a special project that gives you additional research options later in the game .
There is nothing new here , for what I could tell all 12 races share the same tech tree with some differences on the ship models .
The tree is static , always the same with no random factor .
Armada 2526 – Research Screen
On point I have to make in the research topic is that its link with production is not always intuitive .
As I said above to unlock more advanced structures the player needs to research certain technologies however is not always clear what needs to be constructed in order to unlock a certain thing .
For instance to build the mining complex one needs to research advanced mining first however to actually build the mining complex the player needs to upgrade the workshop to light industry and then to heavy industry .
The research screen should be revised to include more information on the dependencies between research and production .
Diplomacy
Diplomacy in Armada 2526 provides all the usual features found on other 4 x titles : goods exchange ( ships , maps , money and colonies ) and the negotiation of treaties ( trade , non-aggression , etc ) .
But an interesting and innovative feature of Armada 2526 is the tone in which the player may negotiate the deals .
Armada 2526 – Diplomacy Screen
For instance the player may propose a non-aggression treaty that may be asked humbly , firmly with threat of trouble or aggressively with threat of declaration of war .
I have not tried all of these options yet but they sound quite interesting while providing an additional flavor and complex factor to negotiations .
Battles
In space battles is where Armada 2526 makes a big leap from its Master of Orion 2 and Galactic Civilizations predecessors .
Although it ’s true that this is not truly innovative , since Sins of a Solar Empire and Sword of the Stars already provide 3D real - time battles , Armada does however turn its focus more into tactics and formation rather than click & hit classic battle style .
You can still choose targets but not to the individual ship level .
Armada 2526 – 3D Battles : Spaceship perspective
The player is allowed to pause the map at any time to switch formations or to make small adjustments to the fighting sequence .
The player can switch between three view modes : global perspective ( which gives an overview perspective from above ) , the ship perspective ( nice to see and rotate through your ship ) and ship sight perspective ( which allows you to see the battle through an individual ship ’s eyes ) .
User Interface
The user interface is perhaps the weakest element of the game .
Although quite ok in providing the basic functions it fails here and there on providing the overall picture to the player .
For instance the mini map is not very helpful , it basically shows the map in miniature but does not provide very useful information like borders , ships or other stats .
One thing that I really miss is the notion of borders with your neighbours .
It ’s not so easy to grasp the reach of your empire .
Galactic Civilizations 2 mini map was much better accomplishing all this .
Another aspect where the user interface stands short is that it ’s not so easy to see where your planets and fleets are .
The planets glow , the graphical feature that signals your colony , is particularly distracting .
You do n’t have an immediate feel of which are your planets and which are not and at the same time it ’s not so easy to see which of the planets have ship garrisons and even when you learn how to spot that you still cannot tell the number of ships present on the planet without having to double - click the planet and then check the fleets tab to see what ships are actually there .
The cursor zoom is a nice innovative feature however it fails to give enough information .
For instance the cursor zoom over your planet will show you that you have a particular type of ship stationed there but it does not give you the number of ships .
Small details like this should be revised in future game evolutions because they really help the player get in touch with its empire .
The diplomacy , research and production screens are ok , nothing too fancy but ok .
My troubles are more with the overall star map and mini map for the reasons I already pointed out .
Bottom line
I did n’t have enough time yet to check the game AI nor to grasp the overall game balance , full - scale war , advanced building and research , that I will leave for a full review to conduct later .
However what I can tell you now is that Armada 2526 is successful on delivering the goods to be recognized as a respected member of the 4 x space strategy games genre .
If it can overshadow the Master of Orion and Galactic Civilizations legacy it ’s still a bit early to tell .
A certain degree of that goal is dependent on the developers willingness to evolve and support the game and work with the community in order to turn Armada 2526 an exceptional game .
If you are a fan of 4 x space strategy games then you need to get your hands on Armada 2526 .
If you ’re not a fan of this type of games I still strongly recommend you try Armada 2526 if you ’re willing to give a shot on this type of games , after all it is the state of the art .
You can find more information on the game in Ntronium games ( developer ) , in the official forum , or in Matrix Games ( publisher ) .
You can buy the game in the Matrix Game store or GamersGate .

Yoo , whose memos offered the government legal justification for waterboarding prisoners and other actions , said his client was former President George W. Bush and the U.S. government as a whole .
The Times asked whether it was the case that the U.S. people were his client , and not the president .
Yoo replied , " If there ’s a conflict between the president and the Congress , then you have to pick one or the other . "
Yoo , who has written a book titled Crisis in Command , which is described as a history of " audacious power grabs by American presidents going back to George Washington , " says that Abraham Lincoln takes the prize as the president who most egregiously defied Congress and violated laws .
" He sent the Army into offensive operations to try to stop the South from seceding , " Yoo said .
" He did n’t call Congress into special session until July 4 , 1861 , well after this had all happened .
He basically acted on his own for three months . "
Asked if Yoo was citing Lincoln 's actions during the Civil War in order to justify President Bush ’s expansion of executive power during the Iraq War , Yoo replied that the authors of the Constitution always intended that a president ’s powers would expand with the circumstances to allow him to respond to crises quicky .
Yoo , who currently teaches law at the University of California at Berkeley , argued in a Wall Street Journal editorial published earlier this year that in wartime , the president should have almost unlimited power .
Yoo was working in the Justice Department 's Office of Legal Counsel when the Bush administration tapped him to write the classified memos on torture and warrantless surveillance , as an end - run around his Justice Department superiors .
Yoo 's direct supervisor at the time , former Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee , told the inspectors general that he had no role in the memos and was not even " read into " the surveillance program .
He had no idea how Yoo " became the White House 's guy " to advise it on serious constitutional matters .
Attorney General John Ashcroft also did not learn details about the surveillance program to which Yoo was privy , until later .
The surveillance memos have been slammed by congressional representatives and fellow Justice Department officials for misinterpreting the law in order to grant the government de facto approval for powers it had already secretly seized .
In 2003 , Justice Department lawyers who finally read
Yoo 's memos said his descriptions of the government 's surveillance programs did n't accurately represent the nature of the surveillance the government was doing .
This led to a now - famous showdown at the hospital bedside of Attorney General John Ashcroft , as the administration tried desperately to keep the Justice Department from shutting down a data - mining surveillance project .
FBI director Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General James Comey threatened to resign over the program unless it was brought into compliance with the law .
Five inspectors general from several agencies released a report in July 2009 questioning the Bush administration 's legal grounds for launching the surveillance programs without approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court .
The inspectors general stopped short of calling the programs illegal , but did call Yoo 's memos justifying the surveillance flawed .
Yoo 's 2003 torture memo ( .pdf of Part 1 ) was the justification the Bush administration used for engaging in " harsh interrorgation techniques " on prisoners being held outside the United States .
The memo concluded that U.S. laws and treaties prohibiting torture and inhuman treatment did not apply to interrogators who were questioning al - Qaeda prisoners outside the United Sates and that the president 's wartime authority trumped U.S. law .
" If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition , " Yoo wrote in the memo , " he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network .
In addition to his comments about the memos , Yoo told the Times in the recent interview that he never met President Bush or Vice President Dick Cheney and was not the White House insider people think he was .
" So you ’re saying you were just one notch above an intern , you and Monica Lewinsky ? , " the Times asked him .
" She was much closer to the president than I ever was , " Yoo replied .

BBC News , Milan
Cyberspace has become the latest cockpit for the unseemly exchange of views between fans and detractors of the battered Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
It could also yet prove to be the latest battleground in the debate over freedom of expression in Italy .
Dozens of Facebook pages were created after the attack Facebook has , as so often , been on the frontline ; but Twitter , too , has been busy - with " Berlusconi " for a time one of its most popular words across the globe .
Within minutes of Mr Berlusconi having been laid low by a tourist souvenir of Milan 's cathedral at the end of a political rally on Sunday , the social networkers had gone into action .
First out of the blocks were the prime minister 's critics : by the following morning more than 20,000 had signed up to one Facebook page giving hero status to the alleged attacker , Massimo Tartaglia .
That 's now risen to more than 70,000 .
Tweets and sympathy
But they did n't have it all their own way .
Mr Berlusconi's supporters were quick to hit back with messages of support and sympathy for their bloodied leader .
" Prime minister , I wept for you " , wrote one woman .
Often , though , the tone of the debate has been hysterical , even hate - filled .
Berlusconi - mocked and pitied in almost equal measure after the attack
Two examples - from an enemy of the prime minister : " Death to Berlusconi " ; and from one of his defenders : " I 'd like to wash my feet in the blood of Communists " .
This is not the first time that Italian social networkers have expressed views that would be frowned upon by mainstream media outlets .
In October , the government threatened to shut down a Facebook group called " Let 's kill Berlusconi " for inciting hatred .
It is this vitriol that worries the Italian government - and has led Interior Minister Roberto Maroni to threaten to block hate messages posted on social networking sites .
Mr Maroni told a news conference in Milan on Tuesday that he was very worried by the " echo " - as he put it - that Sunday night 's events were having on the internet .
In particular , he added , it was wrong that children and those - like Sunday 's attacker - with psychiatric problems should be able to read hate - filled messages on the web .
' Unguarded anger '
Other ministers say the laws are already in place to crack down on incitement to violence .
Those who argue that the web is a dangerous place overlook its ability to police itself
Beppe Severgnini , Italian journalist
But that could be easier said than done .
One police expert said trying to control the output of thousands of social networkers would be " like trying to empty the sea with a bucket " .
One of Italy 's most popular bloggers is Beppe Severgnini - who also writes a regular column for Milan 's Corriere della Sera newspaper .
He doubts that the government knows what it is dealing with .
" Maroni has n't said what he 's going to do , " says Mr Severgnini .
" Frankly , I do n't think they realise what the internet has become .
They tend to forget that its reach is global .
They do n't understand the appeal and power of phenomena like Twitter and Facebook .
" And in a Western democracy like Italy they simply can't - even if they could - block access to them like , say , the Chinese would . "
Berlusconi has been one of the most oft - tweeted tags in recent days
Seen thus , social networking is the last free - fire zone available to those who feel excluded by mainstream politics in Italy - like supporters of the hard Left or those suspicious of Mr Berlusconi 's grip on Italian television .
For Beppe Severgnini , the unguarded anger of social networkers reflects - rather than drives - the deep polarisation of political views in Italy .
It is , after all , easy to forget that the gulf between left and right in Italy remains a chasm rather than a matter of dinner party rhetoric - and one that in the past has been played out with bullets and bombs rather than hate - filled online messages .
But Mr Severgnini argues that social networking contains its own , reassuring equilibrium .
" Those who argue that the web is a dangerous place overlook its ability to police itself , " he says .
" Every time some moron posts something extreme , stupid and unacceptable , you get a vast number of people writing back to disagree .
It contains its own , in - built balance - and that 's what its critics ignore . "

An article published in the December 12th edition of the New York Times revealed the detention of a US government contract employee in Havana this past December 5th .
The employee , whose name has not yet been disclosed , works for Development Alternatives , Inc. ( DAI ) , one of the largest US government contractors providing services to the State Department , the Pentagon and the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) .
The employee was detained while distributing cellular telephones , computers and other communications equipment to Cuban dissident and counterrevolutionary groups that work to promote the US agenda on the Caribbean island .
Last year , the US Congress approved $ 40 million to promote transition to democracy  in Cuba .
DAI was awarded the main contract ,  The Cuba Democracy and Contingency Planning Program ,  with oversight by State and USAID .
The use of a chain of entities and agencies is a mechanism employed by the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to channel and filter funding and strategic political support to groups and individuals that support US agenda abroad .
The pretext of promoting democracy  is a modern form of CIA subversion tactics , seeking to infiltrate and penetrate civil society groups and provide funding to encourage regime change in strategically important nations , such as Venezuela , with governments unwilling to succomb to US dominance .
DAI IN VENEZUELA
DAI was contracted in June 2002 by USAID to manage a multimillion dollar contract in Venezuela , just two months after the failed coup dtat against President Hugo Chávez .
Prior to this date , USAID had no operations in Venezuela , not even an office in the Embassy .
DAI was charged with opening the Office for Transition Initiatives ( OTI ) , a specialized branch of USAID that manages large quantities of liquid funds destined for organizations and political parties favorable to Washington in countries of strategic interest that are undergoing political crises .
The first contract between USAID and DAI for its Venezuela operations authorized $ 10 million for a two - year period .
DAI opened its doors in the Wall Street of Caracas , El Rosal , in August 2002 , and began to immediately fund the same groups that just months earlier had executed  unsuccessfully  the coup against President Chávez .
The USAID / DAI funds in Venezuela were distributed to organizations such as Fedecámaras and the Confederación de Trabajadores Venezolanos ( CTV ) , two of the principal entities that had led the coup in April 2002 and that later headed another attempt to oust Chávez by imposing an economic sabotage and oil industry strike that crippled the nations economy .
One contract between DAI and these organizations , dated December 2002 , awarded more than $ 10,000 to help design radio and television propaganda against President Chávez .
During that time period , Venezuela experienced one of the most vicious media wars in history .
Private television and radio stations , together with print media , devoted non -stop programming to opposition propaganda for 64 days , 24 hours a day .
In February 2003 , DAI began to fund a recently created group named Súmate , led by Maria Corina Machado , one of the signators of the  Carmona Decree ,  the famous dictatorial decree that dissolved all of Venezuelas democratic institutions during the brief April 2002 coup dtat .
Súmate soon became the principal opposition organization directing campaigns against President Chávez , including the August 2004 recall referendum .
The three main agencies from Washington operating in Venezuela at that time , USAID , DAI and the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , invested more than $ 9 million in the opposition campaign to oust Chávez via recall referendum , without success .
Chávez won with a 60 40 landslide victory .
USAID , which still maintains its presence through the OTI and DAI in Venezuela , had originally announced that it would not remain in the country for more than a two - year period .
Then chief of the OTI in Venezuela , Ronald Ulrich , publically affirmed this notion in March 2003 ,  This program will be finished in two years , as has happened with similar initiatives in other countries , the office will close in the time period stated …
Time is always of the essence .
Technically , the OTI are USAIDs rapid response teams , equipped with large amounts of liquid funds and a specialized personnel capable of resolving a crisis in a way favorable to US interests .
In the document establishing the OTIs operations in Venezuela , the intentions of those behind its creation were clear ,  In recent months , his popularity has waned and political tensions have risen dramatically as President Chávez has implemented several controversial reforms …
The current situation augers strongly for rapid US government engagement … 
To date , the OTI still remains in Venezuela , with DAI as its principal contractor .
But now , four other entities share USAIDs multimillion - dollar pie in Caracas : International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , National Democratic Institute for International Affairs ( NDI ) , Freedom House , and the PanAmerican Development Foundation ( PADF ) .
Of the 64 groups funded from 20022004 with approximately $ 5 million annually , today the OTI funds more than 533 organizations , political parties , programs and projects , mainly in opposition sectors , with an annual budget surpassing $ 7 million .
Its presence has not only remained , but has grown .
Obviously this is due to one very simple reason : the original objective has still not been obtained ; the overthrow or removal of President Hugo Chávez .
DEVELOPMENT ALTERNATIVES
INC .
IS A CIA FRONT ORGANIZATION
This organization dedicated to destabilizing governments unfavorable to US interests has now made its appearance in Cuba , with millions of dollars destined to destroy the Cuban revolution .
Ex -CIA officer Phillip
Agee affirmed that DAI , USAID and NED are instruments of the US Embassy and behind these three organizations is the CIA . 
The contract between USAID and DAI in Venezuela confirms this fact :
The field representative will maintain close collaboration with other embassy offices in identifying opportunities , selecting partners and ensuring the program remains consistent with US foreign policy . 
There is no doubt that selecting partners  is another term for recruiting agents  and consistent with US foreign policy  means promoting Washingtons interests ,  despite issues of sovereignty .
Clearly , all DAI activities are directly coordinated by the US Embassy , a fact which negates the private nature of the organization .
The detention of a DAI employee is a very important step to impede destabilization and subversion inside Cuba .
This episode also confirms that there has been no change of policy with the Obama Administration towards Cuba  the same tactics of espionage , infiltration and subversion are still being actively employed against one of Washingtons oldest adversaries .
VENEZUELA SHOULD ALSO EXPEL DAI
Now that Cuba has exposed the intelligence operations that DAI was engaging in ( recruiting agents , infiltrating political groups and distributing resources destined to promote destabilization and regime change are all intelligence activities and illegal ) , the Venezuelan government should respond firmly by expelling this grave threat from the country .
DAI has now been operating in Venezuela for over seven and a half years , feeding the conflict with more than $ 50 million dollars and promoting destabilization , counterrevolution , media warfare and sabotage .
In an ironic twist , currently in the United States five Cuban citizens are imprisoned on charges of alleged espionage , yet their actions in US territory were not directed towards harming US interests .
But the DAI employee detained in Cuba  working for a CIA front company  was engaged in activities intended to directly harm and destabilize the Cuban government .
The distribution of materials to be used for political purposes by a foreign government with the intent of promoting regime change in a nation not favorable to US interests is clearly a violation of sovereignty and an act of espionage .
Development Alternatives , Inc. is one of the largest US government contractors in the world .
Currently , DAI has a $ 50 million contract in Afghanistan .
In Latin America , DAI is presently operating in Bolivia , Brazil , Colombia , Cuba , Ecuador , El Salvador , Guatemala , Haiti , Honduras , México , Nicaragua , Perú , República Dominicana and Venezuela .

Well it was Sunday bloody Sunday
When they shot the people there
The cries of thirteen martyrs
Filled the Free Derry air
Is there any one amongst you
Dare to blame it on the kids ?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding
When they nailed the coffin lids !
" Sunday Bloody Sunday " written by John Lennon and Yoko Ono in the aftermath of the massacre by British troops of civil rights protesters in Derry , Ireland during 1972
In my opinion , John Lennon should be recognised as the greatest Irish singer ever : his California - based biographer Jon Wiener after all said that Lennon " thought of himself as Irish . "
The Irish roots of the two main members of the Beatles , Lennon and Paul McCartney , has not yet been fully acknowledged , despite the fact that Lennon , like McCartney , also had two Irish Grandparents .
Incredible then , considering how well known the Irish roots of the world 's most popular duo of songwriters - they are for some strange reason , not listed for example in The Guinness Book of Irish Facts and Feats by Ciarán Deane ( Guinness Publishing , Enfield , Middlesex , 1984 ) .
The Beatles came from Merseyside - an area around the city of Liverpool which has the largest Irish population in England , mainly as a result of the exodus of people from Ireland during the Great Famine in the 1840's .
Early in their career , the Beatles had played in Ireland three times : in Dublin and Belfast in 1963 , and once again in Belfast in 1964 .
It was after the split of the Beatles in 1970 , that both Lennon & McCartney began releasing songs about the Irish question - all of which were all banned by the BCC : McCartney wrote Give Ireland Back to Irish which became a hit single in 1972 , and Lennon wrote Sunday Bloody Sunday , and The Luck of The Irish , both of which were on the album Some Time In New York City that was also released in 1972 .
On one hand The Guinness Book of Irish Facts and Feats informs you , for example , that the Socialist anthem , The Red Flag was written by Jim Connell from Co. Meath in Ireland ( d. 1929 ) , and under the heading " Top - selling contemporary Irish and Irish - related popular music artists " it lists only U2 , Van Morrison and Bob Geldof .
Under the heading " The London Irish " , it lists John Lydon from the Sex Pistols ( whose father is a Gaelic speaker from Co. Galway ) , Boy George , Elvis Costello and The Pogues - but nowhere is either Lennon & McCartney , or the Beatles mentioned - but then again neither is another world famous Irish singer - Mary O'Brien - commonly known as Dusty Springfield .
Lennon - like another famous son of Ireland , Che Guevara Lynch - was more Irish than for example than either President Kennedy or Ronald Reagan , but l suspect that the main reason why the Irish state has not given these two proper recognition is because they were both regarded probably as dangerous revolutionaries and atheists - in Lennon 's case , for example , he once sang about his opposition to the Catholic Church in Ireland , and expressed outright sympathy with the Irish Republican movement in his song Sunday Bloody Sunday : Repatriate to Britain
All of you who call it home
Leave Ireland to the Irish
Not for London or for Rome !
Lennon 's grandfather , John ( Jack ) Lennon was born in Dublin in 1858 , and like many Irish people after the Great Famine of the 1840's - when Britain allowed over a million Irish people to die of starvation - emigrated to Liverpool to seek better prospects of employment .
There Jack married an Irishwoman called Mary Maguire and started a family .
Sadly , their children , including Alfred , were orphaned early on and grew up in Liverpool orphanages .
As his father Alfred Lennon walked out and left him at the age of 5 , Lennon never knew either of his Irish grandparents or anything of his Irish roots .
This is probably because he was raised by his mother 's family , the Stanleys , were Welsh .
In later years he became increasingly interested in his Irish ancestry .
In 1975 , John give his second son the name Seán , the Gaelic version of his own name .
Like many Irish people , John Lennon came from a musical family , in this case a long line of minstrel singers and crooners .
His grandfather had earned his living as a minstrel singer , and his great - grandfather was also a known singer in Ireland .
Alfred Lennon had also earned extra money singing as a young man also .
The Lennon family tradition of crooning , which started back in Ireland , continued with John Lennon , and later through his own son Julian , who released his highly acclaimed debut album Valotte in 1984 .
The Irish Question However , while Lennon and McCartney had not focused upon their Irish roots during their years as members of the Beatles , it definitely attracted their attention after the break - up of the group .
This had coincided with the emergence of a civil rights movement in the North of Ireland , which was to prove the catalyst for both Lennon and McCartney to write songs about the Irish question .
What triggered this was the massacre by British troops of 14 unarmed civil rights protesters in Derry in 1972 , which became immediately known as " Bloody Sunday " .
McCartney , who had just formed his new group Wings , released their hit single Give Ireland Back to the Irish just four weeks after Bloody Sunday on February 25th 1972 .
The BBC immediately banned the song , and as a result of the controversy and censorship , some Wings concerts in the UK were picketed , and the brother of Wings guitarist Henry McCullough , a native of Derry , was beaten up by loyalists .
Shortly after this , Lennon recorded his song about the incident , Sunday Bloody Sunday , which appeared on his Some Time in New York City album : Sunday Bloody Sunday ( Lennon - Ono ) Well it was Sunday bloody Sunday
When they shot the people there
The cries of thirteen martyrs
Filled the Free Derry air Is there any one amongst you
Dare to blame it on the kids ?
Not a soldier boy was bleeding
When they nailed the coffin lids !
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday 's the day !
You claim to be majority
Well you know that it 's a lie
You 're really a minority
On this sweet emerald isle When Stormont bans our marches
They 've got a lot to learn
Internment is no answer
It 's those mothers ' turn to burn !
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday 's the day !
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday 's the day !
You anglo pigs and Scotties
Sent to colonize the North
You wave your bloody Union Jack
And you know what it 's worth !
How dare you hold to ransom
A people proud and free
Keep Ireland for the Irish
Put the English back to sea !
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday 's the day !
Well , it 's always bloody Sunday
In the concentration camps
Keep Falls
Road free forever
From the bloody English hands Repatriate to Britain
All of you who call it home
Leave Ireland to the Irish
Not for London or for Rome !
Sunday bloody Sunday
Bloody Sunday 's the day ! . . .
From the album Some Time In New York City ( 1972 )
It was during this period that Lennon began to identify himself as Irish , rather than British or Welsh and began to openly support both the Troops Out movement and the Civil Rights movement in the north of Ireland .
For instance , in his 1974 Walls and Bridges album , Lennon included a booklet contained a history of the Lennon name , in the form of the entry from Irish Families , Their Names , Arms and Origins by Edward MacLysaght .
The name Lennon is an anglicised form of ' O Leannain ' which historically has been common in counties Fermanagh and Galway .
The entry ends with , " No person of the name Lennon has distinguished himself in the political , military or cultural life of Ireland ( or England for that matter ) " , under which John wrote in this own handwriting , ' Oh yeh ?
John Lennon !'.
However , in an updated version More Irish Families ( Irish Academic Press , Dublin , Ireland , 1982 ) , MacLysaght writes : " (0 ) LENNON : Since the 4th edition of Irish Families was published John Lennon , an outstanding member of the Beatles group , assassinated in 1980 , has become well known outside Ireland not only as a talented musician but also for his connection With the peace movement . "
The FBI files on Lennon 's Irish political links In February 2000 , the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) released files that indicated that they had investigated links between Lennon and New York - based Irish Republican activists in the 1970s .
These are part of a 300 - page Lennon file which the FBI had resisted releasing since his murder in December 1980 .
Altogether , 80 pages were released after a court settlement with Professor Jon Wiener , a California - based Lennon biographer and author of Come Together : John Lennon in His Time ( Univ. of Illinois Press , 1984 ) .
Wiener said that the files include " the first solid evidence " that the FBI had an interest in Lennon 's involvement in Irish issues , as prior to that he had not been aware of the FBI 's connecting Irish Republican activists to Lennon in New York .
It goes without saying that both MI5 and MI6 would have also had an interest in Lennon and his political activities , and would have shared information with the FBI and the CIA in this regard .
In fact , Wiener says a further 10 documents still held by the FBI were " almost definitely " compiled with the help of MI5 .
The FBI claims that these 10 files are " national security documents " which originated with " a foreign government " ( i.e. Britain ) .
Wiener thinks that this probably has something to do with surveillance of Lennon 's political activities in the UK as well as his arrest for possession of cannabis in 1968 .
Lennon had got involved in Irish politics before Bloody Sunday in January 1972 .
He supported activists protesting against the policy of internment without trial , which was launched by the British army on 9th August 1971 , and resulted in 342 people being arrested without charge in brutal dawn raids that netted very few IRA members , but for example led to the detainment of several members of the civil rights movement .
The net was cast so wide and recklessly that within 48 hours 116 people had been released .
However , 14 were " selected " by the British army and the R.U.C. to undergo a series of " experiments " in sensory deprivation and other forms of torture .
It resulted in Britain being found guilty of using torture by the European Court of Human Rights for the second time - the only country in Europe which has this distinction ( the other occasion was the torture of Greek Cypriot resistance fighters in the 1960's ) .
Internment and the massacre at Bloody Sunday were the main reasons for many in the Nationalist community taking the decision to join the IRA and fight back .
Lennon appeared at an anti-internment rally in London in August 1971 , where he was photographed holding a sign that read : ' Victory for the IRA against British Imperialism !' "
When asked how he reconciled his support for nonviolence with his sympathy for the IRA , Lennon stated : " If it 's a choice between the IRA and the British Army , I 'm with the IRA .
But if it 's a choice between violence and non-violence , I 'm with non-violence .
So it 's a very delicate line . "
The FBI files also include an informers account of a meeting on February 6th , 1972 , at the Irish Institute on W. 48th Street , New York , just seven days after Bloody Sunday .
According to the FBI informer , some of the proposals included procuring weapons for the IRA , whilst another called for the boycott of British goods .
But one thing that caught the FBI 's attention was the willingness of Lennon to offer to perform at an " mass demonstration " organised by the Socialist Workers Party ( SWP ) .
The demo however , occurred sooner than expected - next day ( February 7th , 1972 ) in a rally in Manhattan organized by the Transit Workers Union .
Lennon joked at the rally how " the police were particularly cooperative as most of them were Irish " .
He then said that " The purpose of the meeting was to show solidarity with the people who are going to march tomorrow in Northern Ireland " Referring to his Irish ancestry , Lennon told the crowd , " My name is Lennon and you can guess the rest . "
He added that his native Liverpool was " 80 % Irish . "
Then along with Ono he sang " The Luck of the Irish , " which was his second song written in reaction to Bloody Sunday : The Luck Of The Irish ( Lennon - Ono ) If you have the luck of the Irish ,
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
You should have the luck of the Irish
And you 'd wish you was English instead !
A thousand years of torture and hunger
Drove the people away from their land ,
A land full of beauty and wonder
Was raped by the British brigands !
Goddamn !
Goddamn !
If you could keep voices like flowers
There 'd be shamrock all over the world .
If you could drink dreams like the Irish streams
Then the world would be high as the mountain of morn
In the Pool they told us the story
How the English divided the land ,
Of the pain , the death and the glory
And the poets of auld Eireland
If we could make chains with the morning dew
The world would be like Galway Bay Let 's walk over rainbows like leprechauns
The world would be one big Blarney stone
Why the hell are the English there anyway ?
As they kill with god on their side !
Blame it all on the kids and the IRA !
As the bastards commit genocide
Aye !
Aye !
Genocide !
If you had the luck of the Irish
You should have the luck of the Irish
You'd be sorry and wish you were dead
And you 's wish you were English instead !
Yes you 'd wish you was English instead !!
From the album Some Time In New York City ( 1972 )
At the time of the rally , Lennon was already in contact with the office of Irish Northern Aid , in New York , an organization which raises money for the families of IRA prisoners and supports Sinn Féin .
Furthermore , he assigned all the royalties from The Luck of the Irish to Irish Northern Aid .
Although it has been claimed by the former MI5 spy David Shayler that Lennon secretly funded the IRA at the time , this was denied by Yoko Ono , who was said to be upset by newspaper reports that MI5 allegedly had " proof " that Lennon had given money to the IRA according to The Sunday Times ( February 22nd 2000 ) .
Whatever the controversy about Lennon 's involvement with the Irish Republican movement and his support for Irish freedom , the fact is , he considered himself Irish and therefore should be recognised as such .
As The Guinness Book of Irish Facts and Feats points out : " Irishness is not limited to the Island of Ireland " .
The Great Famine in the 1840 's forced out millions of people over the decades that followed it - including Lennon 's grandfather .
From these people , there are over 60 million people worldwide who consider themselves Irish by heritage ( 43 million of which are in the USA ) .
Lennon has recently been nominated in Britain the greatest songwriter and performer of the 20th century - it is a shame that Ireland has not bestowed this honour on him as one of it's most famous sons from the Irish Diaspora .
Glacier scientist : I knew data had n't been verified
The scientist behind the bogus claim in a Nobel Prize - winning UN report that Himalayan glaciers will have melted by 2035 last night admitted it was included purely to put political pressure on world leaders .
Dr Murari Lal also said he was well aware the statement , in the 2007 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , did not rest on peer - reviewed scientific research .
In an interview with The Mail on Sunday , Dr Lal , the co-ordinating lead author of the report ’s chapter on Asia , said : ‘ It related to several countries in this region and their water sources .
We thought that if we can highlight it , it will impact policy - makers and politicians and encourage them to take some concrete action .
‘ It had importance for the region , so we thought we should put it in . ’
Chilling error : The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change wrongly asserted that glaciers in the Himalayas would melt by 2035
Dr Lal ’s admission will only add to the mounting furore over the melting glaciers assertion , which the IPCC was last week forced to withdraw because it has no scientific foundation .
According to the IPCC ’s statement of principles , its role is ‘ to assess on a comprehensive , objective , open and transparent basis , scientific , technical and socio-economic information – IPCC reports should be neutral with respect to policy ’ .
The claim that Himalayan glaciers are set to disappear by 2035 rests on two 1999 magazine interviews with glaciologist Syed Hasnain , which were then recycled without any further investigation in a 2005 report by the environmental campaign group WWF .
It was this report that Dr Lal and his team cited as their source .
The WWF article also contained a basic error in its arithmetic .
A claim that one glacier was retreating at the alarming rate of 134 metres a year should in fact have said 23 metres – the authors had divided the total loss measured over 121 years by 21 , not 121 .
Last Friday , the WWF website posted a humiliating statement recognising the claim as ‘ unsound ’ , and saying it ‘ regrets any confusion caused ’ .
Dr Lal said : ‘ We knew the WWF report with the 2035 date was “ grey literature ” [ material not published in a peer - reviewed journal ] .
But it was never picked up by any of the authors in our working group , nor by any of the more than 500 external reviewers , by the governments to which it was sent , or by the final IPCC review editors . ’
In fact , the 2035 melting date seems to have been plucked from thin air .
Professor Graham Cogley , a glacier expert at Trent University in Canada , who began to raise doubts in scientific circles last year , said the claim multiplies the rate at which glaciers have been seen to melt by a factor of about 25 .
‘ My educated guess is that there will be somewhat less ice in 2035 than there is now , ’ he said .
Forced to apologise : Chairman of the IPCC Raj Pachauri
‘ But there is no way the glaciers will be close to disappearing .
It does n’t seem to me that exaggerating the problem ’s seriousness is going to help solve it . ’
One of the problems bedevilling Himalayan glacier research is a lack of reliable data .
But an authoritative report published last November by the Indian government said : ‘ Himalayan glaciers have not in any way exhibited , especially in recent years , an abnormal annual retreat . ’
When this report was issued , Raj Pachauri , the IPCC chairman , denounced it as ‘ voodoo science ’ .
Having been forced to apologise over the 2035 claim , Dr Pachauri blamed Dr Lal , saying his team had failed to apply IPCC procedures .
It was an accusation rebutted angrily by Dr Lal .
‘ We as authors followed them to the letter , ’ he said .
‘ Had we received information that undermined the claim , we would have included it . ’
However , an analysis of those 500 - plus formal review comments , to be published tomorrow by the Global Warming Policy Foundation ( GWPF ) , the new body founded by former Chancellor Nigel Lawson , suggests that when reviewers did raise issues that called the claim into question , Dr Lal and his colleagues simply ignored them .
For example , Hayley Fowler of Newcastle University , suggested that their draft did not mention that Himalayan glaciers in the Karakoram range are growing rapidly , citing a paper published in the influential journal Nature .
In their response , the IPCC authors said , bizarrely , that they were ‘ unable to get hold of the suggested references ’ , but would ‘ consider ’ this in their final version .
They failed to do so .
The Japanese government commented that the draft did not clarify what it meant by stating that the likelihood of the glaciers disappearing by 2035 was ‘ very high ’ .
‘ What is the confidence level ? ’ it asked .
The authors ’ response said ‘ appropriate revisions and editing made ’ .
But the final version was identical to their draft .
Last week , Professor Georg Kaser , a glacier expert from Austria , who was lead author of a different chapter in the IPCC report , said when he became aware of the 2035 claim a few months before the report was published , he wrote to Dr Lal , urging him to withdraw it as patently untrue .
Dr Lal claimed he never received this letter .
‘ He did n’t contact me or any of the other authors of the chapter , ’ he said .
The damage to the IPCC ’s reputation , already tarnished by last year ’s ‘ Warmergate ’ leaked email scandal , is likely to be considerable .
Benny Peiser , the GWPF ’s director , said the affair suggested the IPCC review process was ‘ skewed by a bias towards alarmist assessments ’.
Environmentalist Alton Byers said the panel ’s credibility had been damaged .
‘ They ’ve done sloppy work , ’ he said .
‘ We need better research on the ground , not unreliable predictions derived from computer models . ’
Last night , Dr Pachauri defended the IPCC , saying it was wrong to generalise based on a single mistake .
‘ Our procedure is robust , ’ he added .
But she does not , actually .
For 60 years , TV could be watched only one way : through the television set .
Now , though , millions watch shows like “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” on demand and online on network Web sites like Ms. Sweeney ’s ABC.com and on the Internet ’s most popular streaming hub , Hulu.com .

How people watch TV on demand  and whether they should pay for the privilege  is a critical issue in the landmark deal , announced Thursday , that will give Comcast control of NBC Universal .
In the deal , Comcast will become a co-owner of Hulu .
Like all its broadcast rivals , NBC rushed to put its popular shows on the Web years ago , hoping to secure a piece of the booming online advertising market and offset an eroding audience .
The viewers came in droves , but the ad revenues have not materialized as expected .
By giving away TV episodes online , “ the industry is literally tossing money and premium content away , ” Barry M. Meyer , the Warner Brothers Entertainment chief executive , said in a speech in October .
Comcast , the country ’s largest cable operator , has already been using its considerable muscle to limit how many shows are available online , lest people think they can cancel their costly cable subscriptions and watch free online .
Now the company  which , if the NBC deal passes government muster , will own a piece of the biggest site that threatens to undercut its core business  is looking for ways to charge for ubiquitous access to shows .
It 's been quite a week .
Temperatures for the second time this winter in Yorkshire fell to - 14C ( 7 F ) , at Leeming in North Yorkshire on Thursday night .
In Scotland - 22C was recorded at Altnaharra in the Scottish highlands ; and in Wales , the Met Office station in Trawscoed in Ceredigion recorded - 14C while ice formed at the marina in Aberystwyth for the first time since the winter of1963 .
Across the northern hemisphere extremes of cold have been reported , but It 's important to point out that this pattern of weather is also leading to some areas of the world experiencing higher than normal temperatures too .
But what is causing it ?
The main culprit is the little known Arctic pressure oscillation .
It reversed sharply at the beginning of December and effectively shunted the jet stream much further south than normal , leaving us very much on the cold side of the jet , wide open to the influence of the Arctic and Russia .
So could we have forecast this severe cold spell of weather ?
One long range forecaster I spoke to this autumn was convinced that this winter was going to be cold .
His name is Joe Bastardi at Accuweather.com .
Joe has a common sense approach to long range forecasting , an old fashioned style that has almost gone out of fashion in a meteorological world so dominated by powerful computers .
He has an analytical mind second to none , and when I spoke to him he told me he was convinced that the weather patterns that we were having at the time reminded him of those which in the past had been followed by cold winters .
He even went on to say that not only could this winter be cold across the USA and Europe , but it could be similar to those we used to experience in the 1970's .
And this was way back in September .
Hindsight is a wonderful thing and I would be the first to admit that long range forecasting can be a mug 's game .
But there have been little clues along the way .
Firstly , the North Atlantic oscillation ( NAO ) went negative during September .
This in the past has been a good indicator of a colder , more anticyclonic winter in years gone by .
The current El Niño in the Pacific also offers clues .
El Niño's in the past have affected Europe 's climate late in the winter and into spring .
In particular February and March are often colder than average across Europe during Pacific El Niño events .
Interestingly the American model has consistently forecast a colder than average February .
( And The El Niño could give us a good warm summer but do n't quote me on that ! )
So why , at the same time that Joe Bastardi at Accuweather .com forecast a cold winter did the Met Office issue a forecast saying that this winter would be mild , with the chances of a cold winter less than 15 % ?
Clearly there is the rest of January and February to go , but such has been the intensity of the cold spell , which next week will run into its 4th week , then it would take something remarkable during the rest of winter for the Met Office 's forecast to be right .
It 's also worth remembering that this comes off the back of the now infamous barbeque summer forecast , and lets not forget last winter , which the Met Office said again would be mild , but turned out to be the coldest for over 10 years .
The answer may well be quite straight forward .
It 's likely that the all powerful and dominant Hadley centre supercomputer predicted very little chance of a cold winter , just like it did last winter , and that , as they say , was that .
Which begs other , rather important questions .
Could the model , seemingly with an inability to predict colder seasons , have developed a warm bias , after such a long period of milder than average years ?
Experts I have spoken to tell me that this certainly is possible with such computer models .
And if this is the case , what are the implications for the Hadley centre 's predictions for future global temperatures ?
Could they be affected by such a warm bias ?
If global temperatures were to fall in years to come would the computer model be capable of forecasting this ?
If you have time , read again my article called ' Could the sun cast a shadow on global temperatures predictions ' that I wrote before Christmas .
In particular , read David Archibald 's paper , peer reviewed in Energy and Environment journal , where he discusses the prolonged solar minimum we have been in , and what happened to CET temperatures ( the longest temperature data set in the world ) the last time we experienced such a solar cycle , and the implications for the weather across America and Europe .
Of course the fact that the severe winter has coincided with the very unusual solar cycle could easily be a coincidence , the winter just part of nature 's natural variability if you like .
Do n't forget global warming predictions do n't say that cold winters will never happen again , just that they will become less frequent in time .
And there 's no doubt about it we have been long overdue a prolonged cold winter .
At the very least , though , it 's food for thought on this bitterly cold January weekend .

I have yet traveled to Vietnam but I am a big fan of Vietnamese food , thanks to the Little Saigon in Orange County — the largest Vietnamese enclave outside of Vietnam and the place I shop , eat , and have cheap massages !
Last weekend , my friend Chef Danhi invited me to join his Little Saigon tour .
Towards to the end of the tour , he did a cooking demo of banh xeo ( pronounced as banh say - oh ) , or Vietnamese coconut crepes with pork , shrimp , and bean sprouts , a recipe that I have been wanting to learn .
I volunteered to help him make a serving of banh xeo .
The next day , I went to the market and got all the ingredients and practiced further at home .
While banh xeo is not that hard to make , getting the perfect shape without breaking the crepe is a skill I surely need to work on , or perhaps , I will have to acquire the pan flipping skill that would flip the banh xeo and land it on the pan instead of the kitchen floor .
According to Chef Danhi , banh xeo is a southern Vietnam recipe .
Xeo means “ sizzling ” so it ’s also known as sizzling Saigon crepes .
I used vegetable oil to make my banh xeo , but traditionally , it ’s made with lard .
To eat , just wrap it with a lettuce leaf and herbs ( Thai basil , Perilla herb , mint leaves ) and then dip in nuoc cham , the ubiquitous Vietnamese dipping sauce made of fish sauce , lime juice , and sugar .

Wal - Mart Using Fake Community Group to Manufacture Support
By Kevin Robinson in News on Jan 26 , 2010 6:00 PM
The controversy over Wal - Mart ’s attempts to break into the Chicago retail market has flared up again recently .
Opponents argue that Wal - Mart drives down wages , destroys local businesses and leads to no net increase in jobs or tax revenue for the city .
Wal - Mart and its allies contend that neighborhood residents deserve to have a say in what happens in their neighborhood , and people that do n’t live there should stay out of the matter .
The lack of good options available to people that live on the South and West sides of Chicago has been well - documented , and it ’s very plausible that there is a substantial and passionate movement in those neighborhoods to bring Wal - Mart to their communities as a solution .
Wal - Mart would have us believe that such a sentiment exists , but it turns out that support for their expansion into the city is being manufactured by the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce , a local public relations powerhouse , and by Wal - Mart itself .
A few weeks ago , a series of posts that I wrote on the subject attracted the attention not only of our regular readership , but also people that do n’t normally visit our site on a regular basis .
One reader in particular , going by the login “ Chatham ” took issue with the subject matter of the posts , but also with the arguments that Wal - Mart opponents have made .
Specifically , Chatham rebutted one of our regular commentors , Navin , when accused of being a “ paid Wal - Mart / Daley PR spammer . ”
After a discussion with the site ’s editor , Marcus Gilmer , I decided to take a look at who Chatham might be .
I checked out the URL that was associated with Chatham ’s comments , http://ourcommunityourchoice.com and discovered it 's a website promoting the opening of a Wal - Mart in Chatham , declaring that “ Everyone else but Chatham and the South Side are making the decisions - It ’s OUR CHOICE , NOT THEIRS . ”
At the bottom of the screen it announced that “ Our Community .
Our Choice . is proudly supported by the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce . ”
I wanted to know more about who was behind what appeared to be a community group that supported opening a Wal - Mart in the neighborhood , so I did two things .
First , I emailed the address that had been commenting on the site , asking for an on the record interview about their involvement in the movement to bring Wal - Mart to Chicago .
Then I looked up the IP address ( information provided with each comment ) and found the comments were made from an IP address associated with Serafin and Associates .
That name might sound familiar to you : they ’re the Chicago - based consulting firm that Wal - Mart has retained to manage its public relations campaign in Chicago .
That includes push polling done last summer in Chicago .
I reached out to Thomas Serafin via email but he did not respond .
A day after I emailed the ourcommunityourchoice.com address , I got a phone call from Haydee Caldero , a consultant with The Freeman Institute .
She told me that she represented the firm hired to manage the website and community contact related to Wal - Mart ’s expansion into Chicago , and directed me to Michael Mini , the Government Relations Director at the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce , whom I promptly emailed , requesting an interview .
He did n't immediately respond .
Also on the same day that I emailed the ourcommunityourchoice.com email address , the Chicagoist tipline received an email from the Walmart Community Action Network , suggesting that the site might help CAN engage readers that want to help Wal - Mart set up shop in Chicago .
I emailed that address requesting an on the record interview about their involvement in the Wal - Mart campaign .
A day later , Tara Stewart , the Regional Director of Media Relations for Wal - Mart emailed me back , saying that CAN had forwarded my email to her .
She said she was busy but could answer five questions submitted in writing .
While Chicagoist has on rare occasions conducted an interview via email for Arts & Events stories , our editorial policy for news issues is that we only do interviews face - to - face or via phone , and we never submit questions in writing in advance of the interview .
I explained this to Ms. Stewart and after some back and forth about who was authorized to speak on Wal - Mart ’s behalf , she stopped replying to my emails .
On January 22 , I emailed both Mike Mini and Tara Stewart to give them one last opportunity to sit with me for an interview .
Ms. Stewart refused to answer any questions that were n’t emailed ; Mr. Mini did respond and agreed to an interview .
Mike Mini told me that Wal - Mart is indeed a member of the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce , that they have “ a representative on the Government Affairs Committee , ” and that “ our process is kind of open .
Any member that expresses an interest can come to meetings and work on issues that are important to them . ”
Is the Chamber working on behalf of Wal - Mart in the city ?
“ We ’re working on behalf of policies that we feel further business and commerce in the city . ”
Because I got to Mr. Mini through Our Community , Our Choice , I asked what his involvement in the site was .
“ It ’s part of our advocacy effort to gain support , ” and that “ we set that up as a way to communicate with people .
We were expecting this to come up for a vote before the council sooner , but obviously it ’s been stalled . ”
I asked him if he was familiar with Serafin and Associates .
“ Yes , we have worked with them in our strategy sessions .
We ’ve worked with [ Thomas ] Serafin and his team . ”
When I told him that our site had gotten comments from the email address that led me to him and asked if he knew that it was being used to comment on blogs , he said “ no , not that I ’m aware of . ”
Are you surprised that an IP address from Serafin was being used that way ?
“ No , not in particular . ”
Why not ?
“ I really ca n’t comment without looking into it further . ”
Given that Wal - Mart supporters ( and the website run by the Chicagoland Chamber ) claim that opponents to Wal - Mart are outsiders that do n’t live in the neighborhood , I thought I should find out if Mike Mini lived in Chatham .
“ Uh , no . ” What part of Chicago you live in ?
“ No comment . ”
Do you even live in Chicago at all ?
“ No comment . ”
While Wal - Mart certainly has the right make its case to Chicago , the way they ’ve gone about this - creating a fake community group that purports to represent a community 's residents and interests - is sneaky and underhanded .
If what they have to offer Chicago is such a great deal , why did they need to go through the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce to set up a bogus grassroots group ?
When I started asking questions around their tactics , they refused to talk to me , except on their own terms .
Wal - Mart claims that Chatham residents should be the ones speaking up and making the decisions about what happens in their neighborhood .
Over the next few weeks , we plan to look even further into this issue , including talking to residents and community leaders in Chatham and their thoughts on the issue .
But it looks like Wal - Mart is working behind the scenes to make sure that the official corporate line is the only one being heard .
That ’s not what an organization that wants to be an active part of the community does .
That ’s not letting the community have a say in its own destiny - it ’s using race and class to divide people for profit .
And that ’s not something Chicago needs right now .
Child obesity levels have been rising for decades Scientists have discovered what they believe is a genetic cause of severe obesity in children .
The team concluded that the loss of a key segment of DNA can be to blame .
It said the findings might improve diagnosis of severe obesity - which on occasion has been wrongly attributed to abusive overfeeding .
The study , of 300 children with severe obesity by the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , appears in Nature .
Some of the children in the study had been formally placed on the social services ' at risk ' register on the assumption that their parents were deliberately overfeeding them .
They have now been removed from the register .
We hope that this will alter attitudes and practices amongst those with professional responsibility for the health and well - being of children
Dr Sadaf Farooqi
University of Cambridge Obesity is increasing throughout the world and is recognised as a major global public health concern .
Although much of the problem is due to lifestyle factors such as an unhealthy diet , and lack of exercise , some cases are thought to be down to genetics .
The latest study examined each child 's entire genome , looking for deletions or duplications of DNA , known as copy number variants ( CNVs ) .
Experts increasingly believe these CNVs play an important role in genetic disease .
Genome scan
By comparing the DNA profile of obese children with others of a normal weight they found certain parts of the genome were missing in the obese group .
In particular they zeroed in on a missing part of chromosome 16 which seemed to have a strong link to severe obesity .
Researcher Dr Sadaf Farooqi said : " Our results suggest that one particular gene on chromosome 16 called SH2B1 plays a key role in regulating weight and also in handling blood sugar levels .
" People with deletions involving this gene had a strong drive to eat and gained weight very easily .
" It adds to the growing weight of evidence that a wide range of genetic variants can produce a strong drive to eat .
" We hope that this will alter attitudes and practices amongst those with professional responsibility for the health and well - being of children . "
Dr Matt Hurles , who also worked on the study , said : " This is the first evidence that copy number variants have been linked to a metabolic condition such as obesity .
" They are already known to cause other disorders such as autism and learning difficulties . "
Dr Ian Campbell , medical director of the charity Weight Concern , stressed most children did not have significant genetic factors that predisposed them to obesity , and that lifestyle , diet and exercise remained important .
But he added that the causes of obesity - and the potential solutions - were complex .
He said : " The fact that several of the study children have been taken out of social care and returned to their parents as a result is disturbing in itself and must surely put an end to the claims by some that childhood obesity is a simple case of parental abuse .
" It clearly is n't .
These families need our support . "
Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , president of the UK Faculty of Public Health , said : " Far too many children are blamed or bullied because of their obesity , when it may be neither their nor their parents ' fault .
" What 's needed is a far better system of advice , help and support for overweight young people . "

There is a specter haunting America : the specter of a saner , updated version of Ross Perot .
He is lurking out there , ready to ride the free - floating anger and distrust of Washington .
He is out there now in one of his homes or private jets , getting madder by the day .
He is large of ego , full of money and cranky in mien .
When he enters the arena , he ’ll say that Washingtonians , all of them , are a bunch of failures .
Over the past five years , Washington has tried to reform Social Security , immigration , health care and energy policy .
All of these efforts have either failed or are close to failure  thousands of people working millions of hours and in all likelihood producing nothing .
He ’ll point out that Washingtonians , all of them , breed selfishness .
Republicans refuse to accept tax increases .
Democrats reject spending cuts .
They ’ve put the country on a highway to a fiscal crisis , and there are no exit ramps .
When he comes , he ’ll present himself warts and all .
Yes , I ’m an obnoxious S.O.B. , he ’ll say .
But you need me right now .
Yes , I am a blank slate , but people are so desperate that they ’re voting for blank slates .
When he comes  this billionaire Simon Cowell , this political Bobby Knight  he will change the political landscape , at least for a time .
There was a lot of razzmatazz and back - slapping in the US in early September as President Obama 's team announced a partnership with ten leading companies to provide federated digital identities acceptable for use with online government services .
All part of the big push towards better , more open government , as set out in Obama 's technology plan of October 2007 , and his memo from his first day in office .
The President 's cunning plan is that by using OpenID and Information Card technologies , US citizens will be able to use their existing online digital identities rather than having to register yet another ID and password to make use of online public services ( as is the case with the UK government 's online registration and enrolment service , the Government Gateway ) .
Equally important is that citizens will be able to have full control over how much ( or how little ) personal information they share with the government .
The use of the combination of Open ID and Information Cards offers strong privacy and security safeguards , including being able to use pseudononymous IDs with government sites when needed .
Smart thinking .
As a result , lots of envious eyes are looking to the US and wondering why we can't do something savvy like that here , instead of flapping around in the embarrassing death spasms of the UK 's national ID card fiasco .
Cheer up love , it might never happen
But hold on a moment .
Something about these ' new ' US proposals seems very familiar .
Federated identity ?
Trusted third parties being able to deliver online public services ?
It does n't take long to find out why : a quick Google finds the excitingly named e-government authentication framework from , er , December 2000 .
Yes , you did read that right .
It 's a nine year old document .
And more than that , it 's a UK document .
Which contains nuggets such as :
For most electronic transactions , government will accept authentication provided by accredited third parties , which will register individuals and organisations and issue them with credentials enabling them to authenticate themselves in subsequent transactions .
Also :
The Framework provides for those cases where anonymous or psuedonymous access is also acceptable .
And :
Government will encourage the provision of authentication services by a variety of bodies , including local authorities and the private sector , and will seek to make use of these services wherever possible ...
The Modernising Government white paper makes clear government 's intention to work in partnership with local authorities , the voluntary sector , and with third - party delivery channels such as the Post Office and private sector companies .
Where third - party service providers are conducting transactions on government 's behalf , they will be required to authenticate the citizens and businesses they deal with to the same standards as government itself would .
Government will in turn accept transaction data from those service providers , who will certify that they have carried out the authentication transaction to the agreed standard .
Hmm .
All of which sounds refreshingly modern and enlightened .
But also very similar to the ideas and principles recently announced in the US .
Indeed , a quick look at the US Trust Framework Provider Adoption Process ( TFPAP ) reveals a set of authentication levels and processes that seem remarkably like those set out back in 2000 for the UK , varying from a low level of trust ( no authentication required ) through to the top level , where you need to deposit your grandmother and a test tube of your best DNA .
Well , nearly .
To be fair , the Americans have been heard openly admitting that they found the UK policy documents useful .
And after all , they have n't just done a straight lift , but have updated them in the light of nearly ten years of change , particularly on the technology front .
It may seem foolish now , but when the UK government developed its original trust framework it thought that smartcards and PKI were going to be the answer .
Those were , of course , the heady days of the dotcom boom , when Royal Mail had told the government it was going to issue 4 million or more smartcards free to UK citizens ( remember ViaCode anyone ? ) .
Barclays , Natwest and others were equally optimistic about the new age of smartcards , which government saw as a great way to bootstrap federated , third - party identities for its own online services .
Then reality intervened and the dotcom implosion took out a lot of things , including smartcards and their backers .
But in its recent announcement , the US has recognised the pragmatic reality that today digital identity technologies such as OpenID and InfoCards are where the action is .
All of which is fine , but leaves a nagging question about if or when the UK might follow the US lead on identity and authentication , in much the same way that the UK has been outsourcing its IT strategy to the US and copying whatever is done there , such as with data.gov ( data.gov.uk ) and soon apps.gov .
Equally , there are hard questions to be asked about why the UK went from having a well - thought - through model of federated identity and trust back in 2000 , only to have wasted so much of the last decade on trying to impose the discredited and flawed monolithic thinking of the national ID cards programme instead ?
Let 's just hope that we do copy the Americans , and re-import another of our best exports , as we seem to have done with coffee shops and so much else .
It 's a shame the best part of ten years has been wasted , but at least we have the chance now to get back on track , even if it is courtesy of our transatlantic cousins .
If an incoming administration after the next general election wanted to do just one thing to finally sort out the UK 's identity strategy , it could do worse than cough politely and ask : " Mr President : would you be an awfully nice chap and kindly let us have our identity strategy back ... please ?

Lusty Lady performers had admirer from above .
Maybe he was just confused about how peep shows work .
Seattle police arrested a man around 2 a.m.
Saturday for investigation of malicious mischief after he climbed into the space above the ceiling at the Lusty Lady in an apparent attempt to get into the women 's dressing room .
According to a police report , the man came in the front door of the famed downtown peep - show club — backward — then went into a viewing stall .
He somehow got into the ceiling crawl space overhead .
Then , he crashed partially through the glass - panel ceiling above the dance floor , startling a performer below when his legs came through the glass .
The man was still in the crawl space when police arrived , and was arrested after he jumped down , the report says .
He was booked into King County Jail for investigation of malicious mischief .
The man made no statements to explain his actions , the report says .
But his Lusty Lady lark caused so much damage the club had to be shut down for the night , the report says .
The man was released from jail Monday night .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - A global water crisis is looming , but the path to profits is a muddy mess of regulated industries , giant companies with small water operations , and start - up technologies .

For Alex Miles , who once ran a water hedge fund and now manages $ 350 million at Kingfisher Capital , successful investing in water means going beyond it -- commodities , power and efficiency technology are all ways to make a portfolio splash .
Water scarcity has become a global issue as climate change alters water availability , population growth raises demand , and contamination threatens clean supplies .
But what seems to be an obvious investment opportunity has challenges -- in particular , the belief that water is a public good , not a profit source .
“ If water were not viewed as a human right , it would be a great investment , ” said Miles , who compares water shortages to gravity -- inescapable .
Miles ran Aqueduct , one of the first hedge funds in water from 2006 to 2009 .
His Kingfisher ’s Value Opportunity flagship fund , which has water as one focus , has outperformed the Standard & Poor ’s 500 index by 3.65 percentage points annually between its inception at the end of 2004 and the end of June 2009 , he said .
In an interview at a recent Green Power conference in San Francisco , he explained how to invest in ways that could help alleviate crisis as well as profit from its effects , such as higher grain prices .
“ The fault of the investment community is that they have looked at water too narrowly , ” he said .
PLUG INTO THE SMART GRID
Water investment can be made in primary industries , like utilities that produce , treat and transport water .
But it should also include related industries , such as smart grid and pollution management that could increase efficiency of water use , and products tied to water -- like food .
Heavy regulation limits returns at publicly traded water utilities , while the biggest players in water technology , such as General Electric Co and Siemens AG , are even bigger in other areas , diluting their value for someone wanting a targeted water investment .
One pure play would be small - cap Energy Recovery Inc , which makes equipment that cuts energy use at desalination plants and other enterprises that clean water .
Secondary industries that are closely related to water offer other opportunities .
Moving and heating water is a major energy draw , while water is crucial to producing energy , from mining to natural gas extraction to cooling power plants .
Bets on water include meter companies focused on water and building an electricity smart grid , Miles said .
He cited companies such as Badger Meter , Itron Inc , and EnerNOC , a demand response company that sells ‘ negawatts ’ -- contracts to cut demand when needed by power companies .
Miles declined to recommend any specific investment , but argued that many of the water companies had been chewed up by credit fears that had nothing to do with the underlying demand for their wares and services .
“ Investors in water have to take a long - term view , ” he said .
“ A lot of these stocks have struggled because of the global credit crisis rather than because of their business models . ”
FOLLOW THE CARBON FOOTPRINT
Water use is often energy - intensive , and thus carbon - intensive , while much industry endangers water .
So increased focus on carbon and water go hand in hand , he said .
“ Carbon prices should go up , reflective of ( the ) water crisis , ” he said .
Investing in the Climate Exchange Plc , the publicly traded company which itself runs exchanges for greenhouse gases , could be seen as water investment , he said .
Miles expects the crisis to intensify , despite technology improvements , and the best strategy for “ water crisis ” investors is grain and other soft commodities , he said .
Water prices will rise because needs will be so dire and governments such as the United States will have more pressing priorities .
But regulation and fragment markets mean the water price rise will lag price increases in products that use water -- like food -- which trade in global markets .
“ I want to be long agricultural commodities , ” he said .
The market already expects higher prices of grains from economic recovery , but it does not price in additional impacts of water crisis , he said .
Wheat could get a risk premium related to water in the same way that gold currently enjoys a premium because of currency risk in an unstable world economy .
Aside from trading directly in agricultural futures , investors could get exposure with exchange - traded funds such as the PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund or the PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund .
This Christmas lights in Bradfield , England are special not only because they look amazing but because there 's a charity box in the front garden of the house , like in some others of the village .

SALT LAKE CITY --
A man accused of beating his 86 - year - old landlord on New Year 's Day has been arrested in California .
According to the Unified Police Department , Arthel Martin turned himself in to the California Highway Patrol in San Francisco Monday afternoon .
The victim 's son said Martin 's arrest was a huge relief .
" I can't get my mind around how anybody can do this to a wheelchair - bound , 86 - year - old woman who had taken them in , " said Larry Maddocks .
Martin has been on the run since Jan. 1 , when he allegedly attacked his landlord Anne Smart - Pearce .
Martin had rented a room in Smart - Pearce 's Salt Lake County home a few days before the attack .
Smart - Pearce , who is still recovering from her injuries , says she can't remember what happened .
But she thinks Martin may have been on drugs because he was n't acting like himself when the attack happened .
" No , he never , never seemed aggressive , " Smart - Pearce said .
" He just was a gentleman . "
Authorities can't confirm that Martin was on drugs , but they say robbery may have been the motive .
Anne Smart - Pearce , holds a grandchild in a family photo .
Pearce , 86 , was found badly beaten Friday , Jan .
2 . Unified Police Department is looking for Arthel Martin .
Smart - Pearce said Martin seemed like a nice man .
She said he was helping her with a business she wanted to start .
She said she has n't slept well since the attack because she 's been scared .
" I have no animosity towards him .
I just have love and forgiveness because I do n't think he was himself , " Smart - Pearce said .
Smart - Pearce said she was hoping Martin would be arrested so he could n't hurt someone else .
She said he should serve prison time .
In their efforts to help investigators make an arrest , the family set up a Facebook page called " Help Catch Arthel Martin . "
Unified police said Martin will be booked into the San Francisco County Jail .
They plan to travel to California to interview Martin and work on the extradition process .

Your website could be the most beautiful site in the world but it does you no good if it takes forever to load .
Let ’s face it .
People are impatient and a slow website prevents potential customers from completing their purchase .
When I go online shopping , I expect pages to load at worst within 5 - 10 seconds .
Any longer than that and I get antsy or I leave the store altogether .
Sure , some people may be more patient than I am but why take the chance ?
Play it safe and make your business website as fast as possible .
Photo By Meddygarnet
Before you begin however , the first thing you need to determine is how fast is fast enough ?
This extent of your website optimizations largely depends on the analytics and demographics of your web visitors .
For example , 3 years ago when my wife and I first launched our online store , over 35 % of our customers were using dialup .
As a result , we had to make drastic cutbacks with our website design in order provide a brisk shopping experience assuming only a 56 K download rate .
Today , only 2 % of our customers are using dialup ( thank goodness ! ) so we can safely add more multimedia content without affecting the user experience .
To determine the maximum size of any given page , I usually multiply 5 seconds by the weighted average bandwidth of my web visitors .
For example , if most of my visitors are using DSL , I might assume a 1 M bit download speed and decide that 5 M bits is the maximum size any given webpage should be .
This is n’t an exact science .
Ultimately , you need to decide for yourself how fast your website needs to be .
In all cases however , faster is always better .
As I alluded to in my last post , website speed is n’t always a function of your webhost .
In fact most of the time , the webmaster is to blame for a sluggish website and not a slow server .
This article will describe some tips on how to speed things up .
Decide What Is Most Important And Reorder The Loading
Making your website faster is not always about cutting out images and content .
Sometimes , you might like your site exactly the way it is and you do n’t really feel like changing anything .
If this is the case and your website is slow , then often times you can get away with simply prioritizing the way your page loads .
What do you want the user to see first ?
In most cases , your visitors wo n’t mind a slower site as long as the important stuff loads first and the fluff finishes later .
For example with MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , I always make sure that all of the juicy content pops up first before the advertisements do .
That way if the ads are a bit slow to load , it does n’t drag down the entire blog .
Webpages always load in sequential order , so you should always place the stuff that you want loaded first at the top of your page and the least important stuff at the end of your html document .
In the case of elements that must appear in a specific position on the page , you can either use javascript or css to control the load order .
For example , even though my 728×90 leaderboard ad appears at the very top of my MyWifeQuitHerJob.com , I make sure it loads last by performing the following steps .
I create an empty < div id =” banner728 ″ > where the ad should be and I set it ’s id to “ banner728 ” .
This effectively creates a blank placeholder which I can later load using javascript
At the very end of the page , I include the following javascript snippet
< script type=” text / javascript ” >
document.getElementById( “ banner728”).innerHTML
= “ desired ad banner code ” ;
</script >
This code finds the placeholder “ banner728 ” that I set above and inserts the ad banner into the < div > .
Because this script is at the very end of the file , it loads last after everything else .
Do n’t Use HTML Image Resizing
A common mistake I see that many newbies make is to rely on html to shrink and resize images .
While this technique works and seems harmless , it will absolutely kill the performance of your website .
The reason is because the entire original image must be loaded before it is displayed even though you are only showing a much smaller image .
To prevent yourself from falling into this trap , make sure you take the time to shrink the image to the desired dimensions before displaying it on your site .
Do n’t just pull images straight off of your digital camera .
Optimize Your Images
The human eye is much more forgiving of image quality when looking at a standalone image on a computer monitor .
Therefore , you can get away with much lower quality images for your website .
Make sure you optimize and shrink your images as much as you can before displaying them on your page .
I often choose a JPEG quality of 50 percent or less using Photoshop with the images on my sites .
If you are using GIFS , make sure you are not using a larger color palette than you really need .
If you can get away with only 16 colors , then choose your GIF with only a 16 color palette .
Analyze all of your GIFS to make sure that none of the color slots are being wasted by duplicates .
Host Video And Large Images With A 3rd Party
Unless you are hosting your website on a beefy set of servers , rich multimedia content will slow down your site to a crawl .
In general , it is much more economical to host your videos and larger files on a third party service with a more robust infrastructure that better supports streaming .
For example instead of hosting videos on your own server , why not use YouTube or Vimeo ?
If you want to own the content that you produce , you can also pay and use a service like Amazon ’s S3 .
Leave the high bandwidth content for the big boys .
Avoid Using Third Party Code Or Hotlinked Images
Whenever you hotlink an image or leverage code that is hosted on another server , you are putting the speed of your website at risk .
If the third party server is slow or down , it could also take down your own website as well so it is important to minimize the use of 3rd party code .
In addition , every time your site accesses a third party server , a DNS lookup must be made which can take quite a bit of time depending on network congestion .
A few hundred milliseconds of delay may not seem like much but if you are pulling code from 10 different servers , these lookups can add up to several seconds of latency .
Take Advantage Of Caching And Compression
The bulk of most websites are text and text compresses extremely well .
That is why if you enable compression on your server , you can reduce download times by up to 75 % .
Unfortunately , not all shared webhosts have compression enabled on their servers .
If your website is on a shared webhost , be sure to ask them if their servers support mod_deflate or mod_gzip .
If compression is supported by your server , make sure you enable it on your website by following the steps outlined in this article .
If you are using WordPress , the WP - SuperCache plugin already handles compression for you .
In addition to compression , you can speed up your site by caching commonly accessed pages on your website .
For our online store , I actually take this one step further and create static pages for heavily trafficked webpages that do not change very often .
Speed Matters
Chances are , someone out there is probably viewing your website on a much slower connection than your own .
And you always need to account for the lowest common denominator in order to maximize the profit potential of your online business .
I was pretty shocked to see that our online store still has dialup customers !
If I still have them then you might too .

James Hansen is a great climate scientist .
He was the first to warn about the climate crisis ; I take what he says about coal , in particular , very seriously .
Unfortunately , while I defer to him on all matters climate , today ’s op - ed article suggests that he really has n’t made any effort to understand the economics of emissions control .
And that ’s not a small matter , because he ’s now engaged in a misguided crusade against cap and trade , which is — let ’s face it — the only form of action against greenhouse gas emissions we have any chance of taking before catastrophe becomes inevitable .
What the basic economic analysis says is that an emissions tax of the form Hansen wants and a system of tradable emission permits , aka cap and trade , are essentially equivalent in their effects .
The picture looks like this :
A tax puts a price on emissions , leading to less pollution .
Cap and trade puts a quantitative limit on emissions , but from the point of view of any individual , emitting requires that you buy more permits ( or forgo the sale of permits , if you have an excess ) , so the incentives are the same as if you faced a tax .
Contrary to what Hansen seems to believe , the incentives for individual action to reduce emissions are the same under the two systems .
This is true even if some emitters are “ grandfathered ” with free allocations of permits , as will surely be the case .
They still have an incentive to cut their emissions , so that they can sell their excess permits to others .
The only difference is the nature of uncertainty over the aggregate outcome .
If you use a tax , you know what the price of emissions will be , but you do n’t know the quantity of emissions ; if you use a cap , you know the quantity but not the price .
Yes , this means that if some people do more than expected to reduce emissions , they ’ll just free up permits for others — which worries Hansen .
But it also means that if some people do less to reduce emissions than expected , someone else will have to make up the shortfall .
It ’s symmetric ; there ’s no reason to emphasize only one side of the story .
And as far as I can see , the question about uncertainty is secondary ; the fact is that cap and trade works .
Hansen admits that the sulfur dioxide cap has reduced pollution , but argues that it did n’t do enough ; well , it did as much as it was designed to do .
If Hansen thinks it should have done more , he should be campaigning for a lower cap , not trashing the whole program .
Oh , and the argument that if you create a market , you ’re opening the door for Wall Street evildoers , is bizarre .
Emissions permits are n’t subprime mortgages , let alone complex derivatives based on subprime ; they ’re straightforward rights to do a specific thing .
It will truly be a tragedy if people generalize from the financial crisis to block crucially needed environmental policy .
Things like this often happen when economists deal with physical scientists ; the hard - science guys tend to assume that we ’re witch doctors with nothing to tell them , so they ca n’t be bothered to listen at all to what the economists have to say , and the result is that they end up reinventing old errors in the belief that they ’re deep insights .
Most of the time not much harm is done .
But this time is different .
For here ’s the way it is : we have a real chance of getting a serious cap and trade program in place within a year or two .
We have no chance of getting a carbon tax for the foreseeable future .
It ’s just destructive to denounce the program we can actually get — a program that wo n’t be perfect , wo n’t be enough , but can be made increasingly effective over time — in favor of something that can’t possibly happen in time to avoid disaster .
Taliban fighters have developed a deadly new generation of their most lethal weapon , the improvised explosive device , or IED , which is almost undetectable because it has no metal or electronic parts , military experts said last week .
IEDs have proved the Taliban 's most deadly weapon : three out of five coalition troops killed last year in Afghanistan were victims of the bombs .
At least 48 of the 108 British fatalities were caused by IEDs .
Chris Hunter , a former bomb disposal expert who served in Iraq and now runs his own consultancy said the new weapons were being manufactured from wood in Pakistan .
" The expertise for this new generation of bombs is likely to be coming from foreign fighters from places such as Chechnya , " he said .
" But they are being mass produced in Pakistan and are being wheeled out on an industrial level .
You see them everywhere . "
Earlier in the war , IEDs would be mostly triggered by two hack - saw blades separated using a spacer .
When the blades were stepped on or driven over they would complete an electronic circuit which so detonated the explosive – often an artillery shell .
Mr Hunter added that the metal saw blades have now also been replaced with graphite blades and the artillery shells with ammonium nitrate .
The damage is caused by the power of the blast rather than metal fragments , or shrapnel .
The number of IEDs used in Afghanistan has increased by 400 per cent since 2007 and the number of troops killed by them by 400 per cent , and those wounded by 700 per cent according to a report by a US group called Homeland Security Market Research .
One brigade commander posted to Afghanistan said that sniffer dogs were the most reliable way of detecting IEDs , but this method took a long time and required a lot of animals .
Already convoys have to move at very slow speeds while roads ahead are checked for explosives .

In the fall of 2008 , Roger Ailes , the head of Fox News , went to his boss , Rupert Murdoch , with two complaints : he had heard that Mr. Murdoch was considering endorsing Barack Obama for president in The New York Post , and he had read a book excerpt in Vanity Fair suggesting that Mr. Murdoch was sometimes embarrassed by the right - leaning Fox News .
Mr. Ailes threatened to quit , a person familiar with the conversation said .
Instead , Mr. Murdoch soon rewarded him with a new , more lucrative contract  he made $ 23 million last year in salary , bonuses and other compensation , more than Mr. Murdoch  and The New York Post endorsed John McCain .
In an interview in late December in his office at News Corporation headquarters in Midtown Manhattan , Mr. Ailes conceded that he had opposed an Obama endorsement .
( “ I did n’t think he had the experience , ” he said , adding , “ I do n’t tell Rupert Murdoch who to endorse . ” )
He was outraged by the Vanity Fair article but said he “ demanded nothing ” and did not threaten to quit .
He said he did not have to .
“ If you ’re making money and you ’ve hit your targets for five years , you do n’t need to demand a new contract , ” he said .
Here in a nutshell , is the insanity of the so - called healthcare debate going on in Washington .
But before I describe the lunacy ( or what should be called , how the politicians will protect the American health insurance industry ) , allow me to say something most of us already know .
Though a public option is no panacea , if we do n't get a real public option and force real competition on this parasitic industry , " reform " will be branded the Democratic catastrophe and President Obama will own this sham .
About a year ago , Wellpoint was faced with declining profit margins .
So what does any good for - profit insurer do , when profits are tanking ?
They raised their premiums .
Then what happened ?
Well recession depression battered Americans could n't afford these monstrous payments for junk insurance , so 189,000 Wellpoint customers gave up and dropped the coverage entirely .
Now it does n't take a genius to know that if you raise premiums , and they go from garden variety unaffordable , to unaffordable on steroids , and you do this in order to increase profits , you 'll lose a lot of customers .
This is exactly what happened .
Flash forward to October 2009 .
With enrollment still declining ( due to unaffordable premiums ) , Wellpoint is cutting jobs and the unaffordable health benefits it provides its own employees .
This is from Bloomberg .
Like the rest of us , Wellpoint employees will pay more for less .
They 're getting higher deductibles , higher co-pays , and less reimbursement .
This is known as cost - shifting , the employer shifts more of the costs onto the shoulders of the beleaguered employee .
WellPoint Inc. , the largest U.S. insurer , dismissed a " small number " of workers last week and announced cuts to employee health benefits today , in its latest attempt to deal with the recession ’s toll on enrollment .
Well Point eliminated the positions last week and expects to let more go before year ’s end , though the number will be " relatively small , " Kristin Binns , a spokeswoman , said in a telephone interview .
The company will also raise deductibles and premiums for some of its employee health benefits , the Indianapolis - based insurer told workers in a memo today obtained by Bloomberg .
WellPoint , like its competitors , has seen health plan enrollment shrink this year as employers cut jobs and benefits amid the recession .
Chief Executive Officer Angela Braly cut 1,500 positions in January , and last week the company said it was reviewing its " size and skills " to improve efficiency .
The job cuts are " really just an ongoing effort for us to cut costs and run more efficiently , " Binns said , calling the changes " economy - driven . "
In the memo from Randy Brown , WellPoint ’s chief human resources officer , the company said it would lower its contribution toward worker premiums and raise deductibles in two of its three benefit plans .
" Your cost per paycheck will probably increase , " the memo said .
WellPoint has 42,000 employees .
Now let 's move on to what 's being discussed in Washington , specifically the sort of junk insurance Max Baucus is trying to foist on the American people .
There 's a lot of talk these days on what is called actuarial value .
Essentially this is the amount of out - of - pocket costs you and I will be responsible for even after paying the unaffordable premium .
And would n't you know it .
Sure as day follows night , insurers are hard at work fighting to maintain the huge penalties being proposed for those Americans who choose not to buy their junk insurance .
Wellpoint employees ( those who have n't been fired ) , still have it pretty good .
Well Point covers 82 percent of its workers ’ health costs , which is well above the 65 % Mr. Baucus is offering on his bronze plan , which will undoubtedly be the only affordable option .
Do yourself a big favor and read this article from the New York Times .
It will give you a sense of the junk insurance the politicians intend to make us buy .
The four levels of coverage allowed by the Finance Committee have actuarial values ranging from 65 percent for the bronze plan to 90 percent for the platinum plan .
The Senate health committee prescribes three levels of coverage , with actuarial values from 76 percent to 93 percent .
The House bill also calls for three levels of coverage — basic , enhanced and premium — with values from 70 percent to 95 percent .
By contrast , the Congressional Budget Office says , the actuarial value of policies bought in the individual insurance market now averages 55 percent to 60 percent .
For insurance plans provided by employers , it said , the average value is 80 percent to 85 percent .
And according to the Congressional Research Service , the value is slightly higher , 87 percent , for the standard Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan available to federal employees , including members of Congress .
So here we are on October 6th , still very much in the woods about where all this is going , but with the fate of the only piece that matters , a strong public option , very much in doubt .
I want to leave you with a very moving video .
There was a demonstration outside the Minnesota headquaters of UnitedHealth , six people were arrested .
I think we 're going to see more and more of this sort of non violent action going forward , especially if the " reform " legislation mandates all of us to buy private , for - profit junk insurance without a public option .
It brought tears to my eyes .
The movement for healthcare rights is the civil rights battle of our generation .

Are Aliens Sinless ? [ refresh ]

My first thought was , “ No , why should religion crumble just because aliens were discovered ? ” and I was slightly surprised ( perhaps naively ) that apparently the opposite view is more widely held .
But according to
To address whether religious people really do feel that their beliefs would be threatened by contact , Peters has conducted a
So where does the notion that religion will crumble in the face of contact come from ?
Well , that was also partially addressed in the survey .
Respondents tended to assume that while those following their own religion ( or non-religion , in the case of non-affiliates and atheists ) would n’t be too shaken , _other_ religions would be .
“ So those other people would have the problems ! ” says Peters .
Question answered then : Religion will not crumble .
Or perhaps it ’s not that simple ?
Peters responded that he has also looked into the views of many Christian theologians , and there opinion differs .
Some believe that there could be only one incarnation — species - specific to humans .
Others allow for multiple incarnations , with other alien species ( or animals on Earth ) having their own “ Jesus . ”
To complicate matters further , it ’s also not clear that Christians _should_ believe that extra-terrestrials even need saving .
Peters described how C. S. Lewis once speculated that aliens may never have gone through the
But , if that is the case , then a sinless alien race could be out there waiting to ... inspire us ?
( Altruistic alien missionaries coming to Earth may not be a good thing either . )
Which brings me back to the initial assumption that any advanced alien race should have evolved beyond religion .

Yesterday I attended a meeting at the Royal Society in London about how the discovery of extra-terrestrial intelligence would affect people and society , and was introduced to a whole new discipline : astrotheology .
A big talking point at the meeting ( stated somewhat crudely ) was whether the discovery of alien intelligence would throw religion into crisis .
( Thank you to Mike Croft for his rejoinder yesterday : “ That ’s a very poor question .
Would science be in crisis if God was discovered ? ” )
My first thought was , “ No , why should religion crumble just because aliens were discovered ? ” and I was slightly surprised ( perhaps naively ) that apparently the opposite view is more widely held .
But according to Ted Peters , a Christian theologian ( who now also dabbles in astrotheology , pondering whether meeting our space neighbours could throw humanity into an existential crisis ) the issue is partly based on the unspoken assumption that religion is primitive and inferior , while science is superior .
Should aliens make contact with us , one would assume they are more technologically advanced than we are , and hence — the argument goes — more highly evolved , to such an extent that they will in fact have “ evolved beyond religion . ”
( I will come back to this point later . )
What would primitive earthlings do when faced with their more evolved scientific superiors ?
To address whether religious people really do feel that their beliefs would be threatened by contact , Peters has conducted a survey of people from various faiths to check the hypothesis that “ upon confirmation of contact between earth and an extraterrestrial civilization of intelligent beings , the long established religious traditions of earth would confront a crisis of belief and perhaps even collapse . ”
New Scientist has covered his findings in detail , so I will direct you there for the stats rather than typing them all out myself .
But the upshot — not very surprising to many of faith — is that Roman Catholics , mainline Protestants , evangelical Protestants , Orthodox Christians , Mormons , Jews , and Buddhists really are n’t too worried by the prospect that the universe contains other intelligent beings .
Anecdotal evidence from Muslims and Hindus suggest they feel much the same way .
Most disagreed that the discovery would shake their personal faith and many believe that others who share their own faith would also take alien contact in their stride .
( Some suggest it would even strengthen their faith and provide evidence for the existence of nonhuman intelligent beings described in sacred texts .
)
So where does the notion that religion will crumble in the face of contact come from ?
Well , that was also partially addressed in the survey .
Respondents tended to assume that while those following their own religion ( or non-religion , in the case of non-affiliates and atheists ) would n’t be too shaken , _other_ religions would be .
“ So those other people would have the problems ! ” says Peters .
Question answered then : Religion will not crumble .
Or perhaps it ’s not that simple ?
FQXi’s Paul Davies asked rather cuttingly in response to the survey , “ how many people have an understanding of their own religion ? ”
While he agreed that most religions could incorporate aliens into their worldview with little difficulty , he argued that for Christians there should be a serious problem : “ Can you really be a Christian and not believe that Jesus was the incarnation of God who came to save a particular species ?
” Peters responded that he has also looked into the views of many Christian theologians , and there opinion differs .
Some believe that there could be only one incarnation — species - specific to humans .
Others allow for multiple incarnations , with other alien species ( or animals on Earth ) having their own “ Jesus .
” To complicate matters further , it ’s also not clear that Christians _should_ believe that extra-terrestrials even need saving .
Peters described how C. S. Lewis once speculated that aliens may never have gone through the fall , that is , no alien Adam and Eve were tempted to eat of the forbidden fruit ( or the alien equivalent ) , and hence aliens do not need saving by a Christ - like figure .
I am aware that I am straying into areas of Christian theology ( let alone areas of alien Christian theology ) that I am not an expert on , so I should maybe open the floor to people who know more than me here .
But , if that is the case , then a sinless alien race could be out there waiting to ... inspire us ?
( Altruistic alien missionaries coming to Earth may not be a good thing either . )
Which brings me back to the initial assumption that any advanced alien race should have evolved beyond religion .
That may be the case .
Or they may provide an example of a more spiritual way to live .
In either case , how would their discovery affect you ( whether you are an atheist , a religious person , undecided , or unwilling to declare ) ?
Will it diminish your sense of human dignity if we meet beings that are more advanced than us ?
Should it ?
While you ’re pondering those questions , I ’ll leave you with Jon Chase ’s astrobiology rap , which was performed live for us at the meeting .

Depending on which religion you follow , likely so !
Or can a perfect God make an imperfect creation and say , " Whoops !
Need to try that again . "
It defies his definition as " Perfect " to say otherwise , right ?
Also , I 'd be careful of statements like this :
> I believe that religion would cope better with aliens than many scientists with God .
Scientists =/= Atheists .
Many scientists are religious .
I have no problem believing that there are some Atheists who would refuse to accept any evidence that God existed , just as there are some Christians who would refuse to accept any evidence that he did not .
True scientists , as a rule , should attempt to replicate the data and then redefine theories based on it , even if that data is evidence of God 's existence .

In our modern world these ideas have assumed an updated or scientific form of the ET or space alien .
Our capacity to project our emotional basis onto them is manifold .
Some aliens are friendly and benevolent , Spielberg ’s ET and Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind , or Sagans “ Contact . ”
Other aliens are less than friendly , the HG Wells Martians in book and movie forms , the Predator movies , and what I think were the ultimate space bad boys , the Gieger aliens which were hideous and almost implacable .
In the end we are projecting our mental and emotional framework onto the exterior world with these ideations .
So do ETs exist ?
I will say that I think the universe in the FLRW setting is k = 0 , which makes space infinite .
The field theory content we observe does not saturate the Bekenstein bound until about 10 ^ { 26 } light years out , and beyond that might be other “ pocket universes ” beyond an inflaton or scalar field induced barrier of sorts .
So anything which is not forbidden is ultimately mandatory .
I see no reason to presume that ET is impossible , so I suspect they very likely do exist .
Of course maybe the closest ET planet is 100 million light years out .
Our ideas about ET tend to be reflections of ourselves .
This was carried to impossible and ridiculous forms on Star Trek where you got aliens and humans bearing offspring , such as Spock is half Human and half Vulcan .
Nope , that is not going to happen .
Our ideas about ET most often are exaggerated forms of ourselves , such as the bug - eyed bulbous headed grey alien ideas portrayed so commonly .
They really are just variations of our selves .
This would extend to the idea that any ET would project their selves as we do .
The internal mental reality of an ET might be so radically different from anything we experience subjectively that we can’t possibly ever understand it .
This would likely , and I think almost certainty , be the case , even if we can decode their electromagnetic signals and figure out how they do mathematics and so forth .
The converse might likely hold as well .
So the concept of a God , such as projecting their internal mental reality out to infinity , might simply be outside their capacity to internally experience .
If they did decode a signal from us and garner our ability to project our minds , they might find this to be a unique way for what to them is an ET to experience external and internal existence .
Further , they might find the idea we have of God to be utterly beyond their ability to internalize or understand .
Of course this point is likely ever more the case when it comes to particular theological ideas we have .

I suspect this might have something to do with our development of language , for we began to tell stories about the natural world in anthropic terms sometime early in our evolution to Homo sapiens .
This permitted information necessary for survival to be passed down generations .
So ideas about spirits in the forest , totems , demiurges , gods etc were in nature religions a way of telling about the cycles of life and seasons --- when the fish came up river , when the buffalo migrated , when a certain corn plant went to seed and so forth .
We do these things today of course , consider in the USA with Superbowl time coming up the modern use of totems with sports teams .
The writing of fiction is another example of such projections .
The author projects their mind through a character onto words on a page which are then projected into and out of the mind of a reader .
Einstein ’s imagining what would happen if he were on a frame moving with an electromagnetic wave is also such a projection .

Many consider that any of the following : the discovery that the Earth is not flat , that it does n't lie in the center of the Universe , that the life forms evolve , and so on , is an enough reason to abandon religion .
They are of course surprised that all these do n't seem such obvious problems for the religious people , and this is why they consider them lacking intelligence .
On the other side , many religious people cannot understand why others do n't share their conviction that behind the wonders of this Universe must be a Creator , and consider them shallow .
For the human mind it is very difficult to live in uncertainty ; it has to have a firm opinion about everything .
But as hard it is for it to live in uncertainty , as easy it is to live in contradiction .
Forced to choose between completeness and consistency , it usually chooses completeness over consistency .

Do not underestimate the capacity of human mind to accommodate contradictory data .
The belief systems , when confronted with data which seems to contradict them , survive easily , mostly in one of two possible ways : 1. develop " antibodies " against the data which seems to contradict them , and 2 . suffer superficial mutations and adapt to the new data .

I 'm not trying to be critical , I 'm really not .
But your comment suggests that you are an athiest who believe that religion is a lot of evolutionary garbage .
It 's just not possible to teach anything to someone whose mind is closed .
Good luck with that .

If we meet extra -terrestrial intelligence then it will be the end for all terrestrial religions .
For example , if the aliens are green then their God will be green also .
They are neither Christians nor Moslems .
Since our religions exists on Earth only , it will be the proof that all religions are false .

view entire post I am of the opinion that our prospects for communicating with an ETI are pretty low .
I think life in its basic form is fairly common in the universe .
There have been some reasons of late to think life does exist on Mars .
Some of the Jovian and Saturnian might have life forms in oceans under their ice crusts .
Yet in these cases I would be surprised if there is intelligent life , or life forms ...
The idea of God , and our beliefs in supernatural beings such as gods or God , has far more to do with psychology than cosmology .
The human mind did not evolve to solve the problems of quantum gravity , or to prove the Riemann zeta function conjecture .
It evolved to permit us to survive in a wide range of environments by socially communicating information to each other .
It is a byproduct or happenstance that our brains are remarkably capable of solving abstract problems and of learning the structure of the universe .
In our early imaginative narratives about the nature of things we projected our conscious being onto the world , which resulted in ritual forms which encoded a sense of being - ness and meaning into spiritual forms .
We continue to do that , for when something goes bump in the night most of us at first wonder , " Who did that ? , " rather than " what caused that ? "
Children shown nature films will make remarkable statements , such as " The rocks are jagged so the bears can scratch their itchy backs . "
We are psychologically disposed to see the world according to external agencies , which are similar to ourselves , which act on the world with intentionalism and purpose .
The persistence of religion is a remarkable example of this as well .
Saul of Tarsus is probably the most famous and enduring author in history , and there is some possibility the guy actually existed .
Abraham , Moses and even Jesus are likely characters developed into narratives than actual people , or they might be compilations of various people around the time .
Certainly the literal concepts of the world as laid down in the Bible are wrong from the perspective of science .
Yet literal believers in the Bible number in the many tens of millions .
In the case of Christianity the thought - belief system has a highly compelling quality to it .
The idea was popular in the 1st century BCE , where Appolonius was supposed to be the incarnation of Hellenic gods , in particular Apollo .
This Hellenic idea got incorporated into the Egyptian religions , where Isis and Osiris spawned Mithras , it impacted as far as India with Krishna , and it co-opted Judaism into Christianity .
So this idea is not only specific to our psychological make up , but to ancient cultural traditions and their intertwined histories .
Christianity emerged as a European - Mediterranean religion , lost the Middle East to Islam , but later was spread as a world religion with the European expansion into the Americas and the world .
The religion early on found many converts in the late Roman period , expanded readily through the time of Charlemagne , and later converted many outside of Europe .
The notion of a God emerging as a person who then suffered and died for one ’s personal salvation is an apparently compelling narrative which plays pretty well to this day .
In spite of advances in science , and enormous world view changes such as biological evolution and inflationary big bang cosmology , many people reject these in order to maintain their belief in a God that acts as their personal savior .
I see not abrupt change in this either .

Well , the human race upon the planet earth is getting technologically sophisticated , to some degree .
Thank God they have n't noticed us .
We 've had quite a bit of luck communicating with them telepathically ; we do n't leave evidence that way .
If they do discover us , I give them 20 years before they can build a sub - light speed spaceship and show up at our doorstep .
Then what ?
It 's not they we 're worried they 'll attack .
It 's more likely we 'll have to send embassadors to earth .
I do n't want to be the first to get shot at , shot down and probed by humans .
Yes , they are curious about whether we exist or not .
Some of them are caring and naive .
Then , there are others who are highly intelligent , crafty , and would come up with highly imaginative ruses to get at our technology .
If that happens , how long will it be before the galaxy is swarming with crafty little humans looking for wealth ?
Can humans be neighborly ?
There is still quite a bit of disease , death and poverty on their planet .
I really do n't want to be the one that has to tell them , " sorry , we 'd like to help you , but we 're not allowed to share technology with you . "
I 'm pretty sure they would be nice enough to ask first , then take it by force .
I mean , shields and force fields work just fine .
But it 's hard to be a friendly neighbor from behind the safety of force fields .
Yes , they would rob us blind .
We would have to walk back to Alpha Centauri .
But there are technologies that we can teach them .
The problem is , telepathy and all that psychic / psionic stuff , it does n't lend itself to proof .
It also wo n't make anybody rich .
That is stuff we 've become very expert at .
In fact , some of the same principles by which telepathy works , are similar to how a hyperdrive works .
But for now , we 'll just work with those whom they call crazy / imaginative / strange/certifiable /crackpot/etc ...
On the brighter side , there are a few nations that have learned to behave a little better .
If we had to crash land somewhere , I think I would pick a European country .
I think the governments there would love to flaunt it in America 's face that they know how to conduct a first contact , properly .
Not like Ronald Reagan with his , " would n't it be great if we were in an interstellar war ... " speach .
All we can say is this : learn everything you can about hyper - drives and how to conduct a proper first contact with your neighbors .
Then , we 'll see about dropping by for a friendly visit .
Good luck earhling neighbors .

We have better things to spend money on then sending battle cruisers and alien infantry .
If humanity can figure out how they 're going to deal with a first contact , maybe we 'll visit .

Trying being a little more friendly and neighborly .
Practice saying this sentence :

We of the planet earth greet you with goodwill and friendship .
We hope that our two civilizations can share culture , knowledge and eventually trade with each other .

Well so much for finding intelligent life on earth .
Hyper - drive technology is expensive to operate .
So , we the aliens are supposed to come down to visit you , our neighbor ; several light years away , and I can't even get a reply or a comment ?
Hello !
Is there intelligent life down here ?
Are you so shocked and flustered that you can't even respond .
How can you ever hope to understand an alien religion that spans countless worlds if you can't even respond to another human being with some crazy ideas and a hyper - drive theory ?
If the Christian God created the universe , and the Infinite Intelligence of our religion also created the universe , do you suppose the Christian Deity and the alien Deity ( Infinite Intelligence ) could some how possibly be the same ?
Maybe ?

I discuss the issue of warp drives and their improbability in this book as well , but I will not dwell on that subject --- we have been around the block on that :-) .
It is likely that contact with ETI will be through electromagnetic means .
So if we get hailed by ETI it will not likely be by their landing on the Whitehouse lawn , but because they send radio signals , or use large ring - world like ribbons with spaces or masking that orbit their star .
The spaces might then generate a slight dimming of their star in periodic pulses which could be observed over large distances .
That is of course highly speculative , but not impossible .
If we should detect such a signal , then from there the problem is decoding it .
Without going into detail , I think the foundations of quantum gravity involve a quantum error correction coding system , which might serve as some universal encryption / decryption system .

report post as inappropriate I wrote the book Can Star Systems be Explored ?
which addresses some of these issues .
My book largely focuses on standard known physics required to get a probe to a star within a 50 light year distance .
There have been as well considerable discoveries on extrasolar systems , which point to a wide range of diverse configurations for solar systems .
In this book I discuss some estimates , based on chaotic dynamics and some Bayesian analysis , on the distribution of solar systems with a G - class star which can support the orbit of a terrestrial planet such as Earth .
If the Jovian planets are too close to the 1AU distance they perturb the orbit too much .
I frankly estimate that maybe around 1000 planets similar to Earth might exist in this galaxy .
Of course other planets may have life , even Mars may well have life , but conditions I think are fairly special for a planet with the degree of biological complexity seen on Earth .
So I think the probability of an ETI within the interstellar neighborhood of Earth is very remote .

Then , there are others who are highly intelligent , crafty , and would come up with highly imaginative ruses to get at our technology .
If that happens , how long will it be before the galaxy is swarming with crafty little humans looking for wealth ?
Can humans be neighborly ?
There is still quite a bit of disease , death and poverty on their planet .
I really do n't want to be the one that has to tell them , " sorry , we 'd like to help you , but we 're not allowed to share technology with you . "
I 'm pretty sure they would be nice enough to ask first , then take it by force .
I mean , shields and force fields work just fine .
But it 's hard to be a friendly neighbor from behind the safety of force fields .
Yes , they would rob us blind .
We would have to walk back to Alpha Centauri .
But there are technologies that we can teach them .
The problem is , telepathy and all that psychic / psionic stuff , it does n't lend itself to proof .
It also wo n't make anybody rich .
That is stuff we 've become very expert at .
In fact , some of the same principles by which telepathy works , are similar to how a hyperdrive works .
But for now , we 'll just work with those whom they call crazy / imaginative / strange/certifiable /crackpot/etc ...
On the brighter side , there are a few nations that have learned to behave a little better .
If we had to crash land somewhere , I think I would pick a European country .
I think the governments there would love to flaunt it in America 's face that they know how to conduct a first contact , properly .
Not like Ronald Reagan with his , " would n't it be great if we were in an interstellar war ... " speach .
All we can say is this : learn everything you can about hyper - drives and how to conduct a proper first contact with your neighbors .
Then , we 'll see about dropping by for a friendly visit .
Good luck earhling neighbors .

Otherwise appears a question :
Why the Jesus selected our planet only and ignore the rest of the planets with intelligence ?
Thus , if we do not find the Alien Christianity , it will be the proof that the Jesus is not the creator of the Universe .

So with the intelligent life forms we have on Earth , we might ponder whether any of them have mental ideas of a God .
Clearly a species of octopus with these ideas might have an eight legged God , and a dolphin species might have some idea of a god that swims and sings songs .
Yet we have no evidence of any of this sort of thing .
A “ Jesoid ” concept is further remote , for this is a particular theological notion which emerged from a cultural mixing of Hellenic and Judaic ideas in the first century BCE , which was completely foreign to many human cultures , say Chinese , up until recent times .
It is unlikely this is some universal idea across the universe to all forms of intelligent life .
IN fact to presume so is to project our minds onto other life forms , just as we project ourselves onto “ infinity ” in this ideation we have of a God .

We have life forms here on Earth which might be considered intelligent .
Cetaceans , whales and dolphins , are clearly one example .
The brain of a dolphin is bigger and more complex than the human brain , and behaviors of these animals is very complex and they communicate in complex forms .
Another example are cephalopods , octopi and squid , which while they are radically divergent from the mammalian evolutionary clade being invertebrates , they are very complex and communicate through rapidly variable skin tone and color .
Some octopi have brains the size of basketballs and define up to a quarter their body mass .
They are also very capable of solving problems .
Their deficit for being intelligent is they are not social beings and do n’t live terribly long .
So they ca n’t accumulate ideas or knowledge .

My understanding of John 1:1-5 -
" In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
He was with God in the beginning .
Through him all things were made ; without him nothing was made that has been made .
In him was life , and that life was the light of men .
The light shines in the darkness , but the darkness has not understood it . "
is that Jesus is ' The Word ' and participated with God in the Creation .
Yes ,
He also died on the cross for our sins , defeated death , and was resurrected to give us hope .

This is just my personal interpretation , but to me , the " Word " is the power to create laws of nature .
When I interpret it that way , I also think of the power that the president / congress have to create laws .
That gave me the idea that it might be possible to create multiple sets of laws of nature within the 3D space .

I am aware that it is common among Christians to think that Jews of the 4th to the 1st century BCE were waiting for Jesus , and read Isaiah as a prophesy of God coming to the world .
To be honest this is sadly mistaken .
The one who “ bore our stripes , “ or was “ rejected ” is not a single man , whether a next prophet or a God -made - man .
It refers to the people of Israel , and the messiah is not really a person so much as it is Israel which will bring light to the world .
In more recent times we have an individualistic sense of things , whereas in the Hebrew writings this is not the case , but where the “ group , ” here Israel , is represented allegorically as a person .
In fact this sort of allegorical projection is common in the Tanach in general .
This carries over to those who wrote the books of the Bible .
Writing then was not like today , where getting published and one ’s name advanced is paramount .
Back then it was the group which counted .
Individualism is a rather modern concept .
So the writers were followers of a certain mystical and ritual pedagogical form laid down by a founding sage , and they contributed their writings in these books ---- and did so under a single pen name and namelessly as individuals .

As for Paul , who knows , he may have believed what he believed , or he could have been one hell of an operator .
The idea of God becoming a man and existing in a physical form as attributed to Jesus is anathema to Judaism .
No Jew thought that God would manifest Himself as a man .
The Gospel of John does bring Jesus in as God , not just Son of Man , when Jesus tells the templer priests " I am , " which is what God said to Moses .
The reaction of the Sadduccee priests was not unexpected , for it is a complete blasphemy in Judaism for someone to say they are God .
So Paul , who was a Jew , certainly knew this was not going to be acceptable to Jews , but either he came to this passionate belief or saw the chance to become one of the most important people in history .
It is interesting to read the epistles of Paul and Orwell 's " 1984 " back to back .
Paul devised a serious mind control system , complete with crime thought ( hell - fire ) , double thought ( ignorance is freedom = Jesus makes the wise simple and simple wise ) and so forth .
Paul got Orwell beaten by 19 centuries .

Paul is probably the one character in the Bible we can say is maybe the most historical , or at least not a purely mythic character .
The subsequent apostolic writings leading to Tertullian and Origen and the development of the post - Pauline period are fairly clear and this gives some weight to Paul existing as a real person .
There was probably a pedagogical school which followed Paul , most theologians think Hebrews was not written by Paul , and those who penned the other books of the New Testament did so under various penned names .
The most wildly mystical trend was the followers of John , leading to the great flight of fancy seen in Revelations , while Paul was primarily devoted to codifying the “ Christos scheme ” into a legal and social format , with a degree of what might be called psychological conditioning required for believers .

It is hard to know what went on the mind of someone who lived nearly 2000 years ago .
I do n't want to go in the question of whether Jesus actually existed , but around the year 50 where was clearly a range of Jewish midrash coupled with what at the time would have been neo-Hellenic mythology about this character " Jesus . "
Around that time the writers of Gospels who penned themselves according to the name of the disciples began to write their accounts based on these stories , and there are " lost Gospels , " attributed to Thomas , Phillip etc , and recently found are those attributed to Judas !
Now it is nearly impossible to know for certain what went on .

The opening of John is a statement of Platonism .
Plato said that the world existed in two categories , pure forms which are mathematical and physical objects .
What gives physical reality a form which is mathematical is the logos , or word , which in Platonism is the unseen form behind the shadows we observe in his metaphor of being in the cave .
Curiously quantum mechanics has a feature similar to this , where entanglement and nonlocality are the " pure forms , " the atoms or particles the physical " stuff , " and quantum information as the " word . "
Some of the writers of the Hellenic text titled " John " on the life and theology of Jesus clearly understood Plato 's metaphysics .
The system was used as the allegory to frame the theology of Jesus Christ .
Here the pure forms we the Judaic God , the physical form is the world " God so loved the world ... " as John later says , and Jesus is the Logos .
Of course all the writers of the Bible , say books with their name in the Ketuvim or Prophets , as well as the books of the Hellenized “ Christos books , ” which form the New Testament , are really code names .

If they are , new cults will spread on Earth like wildfire and the new religions will overwhelm the established ones .
If we are , we will try to assimilate them .
This is no different from the case where Japan was forced to modernize after contact with the west in the middle of 19th century .
Another major factor will be the separation distance and the time it takes to have a message exchange .
If the distance is too big for practical communication , then nobody assimilates anybody and there will be a lot of apocalyptic scenarios perpetuated by madman thirsty for power .
Now this is a very dangerous scenario in the age of nuclear weapons .

The eastern Orthodox churches are not united , and they are very silimar with the church around 300 - 400 AD .
There are no big cathedrals in ( orthodox ) Eastern Europe , and the church is concerned mostly with nationalistic interests , as the church embodies the idea of the tradition and nation .
Orthodox churches are disconnected from modern theological debates and their current skeleton in the closet is their collaborationism with the oppressive communist states .
Catholicism is very much entangled with the political struggle across medieval Western Europe .
Over time , the Catholic Church lost the battle with the states for political supremacy and with a rich history they have nothing to prove by getting into contemporary debates .
Their skeleton in the closet is celibacy and widespread sexual abuse as a result of this .
Protestantism in Europe is mostly a nationalistic stance , but in US they represent the modern vibrant church connected to all relevant topics of the day .
Their big fight is with Darwin and science in general .
To a European , the argument against evolution in US looks bizarre ( a topic closed more than 100 years ago ) .
There is a big difference in the level of secularism between Eastern Europe , Western Europe , and US .
In Eastern Europe , 90 % of the population declares themselves christian , but churches are filled only by old people , and practical secularism is very high , about 90 - 95 % .
In Western Europe , the active believers are around 20 % and dropping , while in US the rate is steady around 60 % .
In US this is the Quaker ’s legacy combined with active competition between so many denominations it is hard to keep track of .
Rooted in nationalism , to an eastern orthodox church , proselytism is a sin and the church does not have any missionaries .
Catholic and Protestant churches have a lot of missionaries , but they have a different focus .
For Catholics , missionaries go mostly in Africa and Latin America ( Spain ’s legacy ) , focusing on church growth and helping the poor , while Protestant missionaries go all over the globe like China , and eastern Europe , and even North Korea focusing on spreading salvation and drawing strength from early church martyrdom .
report post as inappropriate Christianity has basically 3 main branches : Christian orthodox in Eastern Europe , Catholicism in Western Europe , and ( the many forms of ) Protestantism in Western Europe and North America .
Interestingly , the 3 main forms correspond to different time sections of Christianity across two millennia according to historical circumstances .

It ’s easy to see what will happen if aliens are discovered ( from the religious point of view ) .
We only need to look back into history .
Some new cults will be formed which will hope and pray to be rescued by the aliens , and Catholics and protestants will send in their astronaut missionaries to bring salvation to them .
The main thing will be who is more technological advanced ?
If they are , new cults will spread on Earth like wildfire and the new religions will overwhelm the established ones .
If we are , we will try to assimilate them .
This is no different from the case where Japan was forced to modernize after contact with the west in the middle of 19th century .
Another major factor will be the separation distance and the time it takes to have a message exchange .
If the distance is too big for practical communication , then nobody assimilates anybody and there will be a lot of apocalyptic scenarios perpetuated by madman thirsty for power .
Now this is a very dangerous scenario in the age of nuclear weapons .

I seriously doubt we will ever come to very close proximity to any ETI .
At best we will probably receive their EM or photon signals and they might receive ours .
To be honest the mixing of completely different planetary biologies could be a bad idea , and interstellar distances probably make good wall which as it goes " makes for good neighbors " --- assuming we ever make such contact .

report post as inappropriate I disagree ; the real question is : what does it take for a civilization to survive long enough to become advanced technologically ( advanced compared to us ) ?
Our greatest mathematical minds do not have what it takes to help our species survive for tens of thousands of years .
In fact , the physics community judges everything by how long it will last before it dies ( heat death , extinction , average life - time , ... ) .
Physicists are far removed from the real tools of long term survival , ... passion .
If we ever did meet an advanced civilization or an ETI , I 'll bet that they figured out how to perfect their religion ( relationship with a universal Creator ) .
That gives them the drive and the passion to continue to address real world problems with a love and zeal for life .
I expect that they will have created a quality of life that is better than ours .
They will ask questions that are better than ours .
They will ask , " how can we use our technology to make our civilization even better . "
Not like our physicists who ask , " how long until we die out ? " , " How long until the universe dies from heat death ? " , " How long until we go extinct ? " , " How long until the entropy of the universe turns the whole universe into a great big ball of garbage ? " " How long until this godless miserable universe puts us out of our misery ? "
Sending missionaries out to convert ETI somewhere in the near - local universe might be a bit like trying to convert dolphins or brainier species of octopi or cephalopods to some religious belief .
Even if this intelligent life form is capable of producing mathematical structures we can decipher from their signals , they might regard what we call religion as something unfathomable .
We might imagine from our perspective if they have some state of consciousness we can't neurologically experience , that they encode into what might be comparable to our sense of what gives being or meaning .
Even if we communicate with such beings it is likely that such communications will go little beyond what each side could decipher as mathematics and maybe physics .
I seriously doubt we will ever come to very close proximity to any ETI .

Here is a general physics - metaphysics or philosophy of things .
The foundations of the universe involve enormous symmetry systems , and I think underlying what we think lies the Fischer - Griess group , or the monster .
Yet as one goes to such depths you also have less and less --- indeed a vacuum .
Symmetry in its most basic form establishes how the vacuum remains a “ void . ”
But this symmetry is broken on certain scales , and as we get to these larger length scales there is the appearance of mass and classical information .
So as symmetry is reduced on these larger scales there is the occurrence of more complexity .
In an infinite spatial universe the range of diversity for complex systems is enormous --- maybe infinite .
Life is probably a fairly common thing in the universe , and on a few planets ( few 1000 per galaxy for instance ) life evolves into the exuberant level of complexity and diversity we have on Earth .
Yet on these other planets where this happens life is likely to be radically different from here , and this probably extends down to the molecular machinery .
So there might be an even lower density of intelligent life scattered about here and there , but they may have completely different ways they experience things .
An Earthly example might be seen with cats , which have no taste receptors for sugars .
The most expensive confectionary is to a cat a tasteless blob of goo .
They perceive things differently , and when it comes to intelligent life in the universe I suspect this analogously extends to how different mind - types which can possibly exist perceive the world and have a sense of “ self . ”
To presume that our religions extend to other intelligent life forms is a matter of extending our parochial experience of things into some universal principle .
I think this is not at all likely the case .

Metaphysics is the study of fundamental truths .

I agree that this can be expected to be the case .
There is , of course , the possibility that there is a true religion already known here on Earth .
I think that physics has nothing to say about this possibility one way or the other .
It can not be used to disprove religion ; because , it is limited to matters of non-intelligence .
It does n't explain .
It mimmicks the patterns of changes of velocities of matter .
It imagines what might be responsible for those patterns , so long as that which it imagines is not in anyway intelligent .
Finally , symmetry is something to be observed after the physicist has defined and used their original ideas in mathematical equations .
Those symmetries are the result of the initial assumptions that went into forming the original equations to describe effects .
Whatever occurs afterwards is defined by the initial assumptions .
So , if symmetries are found necessary , then something very important and fundamental is missing in those original equations .
Either theoretical physics can establish a step by step development , without artificial means such as transform equations , up from the fundamentals or it is forced to invent new ideas along the way .
Those fundamentals must depend fully upon empirical evidence .
That evidence always consists solely of measurements of changes of distance with respect to time .
Everything , mechanical , invented beyond distance and time are inventions of the mind .
It is true that at least one cause is necessary for effects ; however , we do not know what cause is .

Certainly , there are peculiar organizing qualities within biology that continue to stump to science community ; thus , the process of organization will fall outside of the line .

Theoretical sciences ?
I believe there is benefit to creating a category of such theoretical sciences as both a learning tool and a theoretical playground .
There are benefits to this .
First , those who fall below the threshold of scientific methodology will have some framework within which to speculate .
Anybody with a crazy idea will be expected to explain how it fits with established physics .
Second , those with ideas that are somehow related to established sciences ( FTL propulsion , etc ... ) know that they need something to observe .
Third , it provides a playground for creativity that is no longer reformed to scornfully as : those crazies with their weird ideas .
At least those who do have weird ideas are encouraged to clean them up and make them more presentable .
Forth , a casual perusal by theoretical physicists ( scientists ) might prove to be a rich source of ideas or new approaches .
Fifth , professors can now tell the more creative students that they should speak with professor X down the hall who deals with the speculative sciences .

I would agree .
The benefit , I see , is that we can proceed toward achieving useful results without knowing the reason why .
We can predict the outcomes of mechanical type activities without knowing why .
We simply substitute ideas for the unknown causes .
The difficulty , as I see it , is that the artificial ' whys ' are insisted upon as being real .
This act interjects artificiality into scientific learning .
I think scientific learning requires that we understand both that which we know and that which we do not know .

Twitter as a Professional Tool Posted by Mikko @ 08:04 GMT
I 've never been a fan of social networks .
I 'm not on Facebook .
Or Myspace .
Or LinkedLn .
But last year I decided to take a look at this Twitter thingy .
I gave myself a trial period of couple of months , until the end of 2009 to decide if Twitter is useful or not .
And if I would n't find it useful , I would quit using it .
During these months I 've learned that Twitter is quite different from the other social networks .
It is actually quite useful as a professional tool .
Many do n't really understand what Twitter is all about .
They think it 's a system where people can tell others about their daily chores ( " just had corn flakes for breakfast ! " ) .
This is not what Twitter is for .
Twitter is at its best when experts in their own field share notes , links and pointers to important developments they see .
In the field of data security , that would be a note about a new vulnerability .
A major outbreak .
Phishing run .
Or something else .
And today , the place where you would hear about it first would be Twitter .
Not the news .
Not the blogs .
Twitter .
I myself have now reached 5000 followers on Twitter ( thanks ! ) and plan on continuing .
And the neat thing about Twitter is that you do n't need to even sign up .
It 's all public .
You can just browse anyone 's Tweets or make a global search on search.twitter.com .
Before Twitter , when something major would be going on , the first warnings and initial discussion about it would be in private – via e-mail , private mailing lists and text messages .
Now much of that would happen in Twitter – in public .
And you would n't even need to have a Twitter account to follow it .
As an example .
Let 's say that a major website like TechCrunch would get hacked , Just by searching for " techcrunch hacked " in Twitter you would be able to see the very first warnings , read what 's the buzz and get the first expert opinions .
And the best part : Twitter is full of interesting figures from the field of computer security .
Signing off ,
Mikko
A century ago , before the start of World War I ( referred to in the history books as " The Great War " or , navely , " The War to End all Wars " ) , warfare as a means of settling disputes between nations was often regarded as an honorable undertaking .
Military officers , which came from the aristocracy , were respected and honored because of their impressive uniforms and the medals and ribbons on their chests .
Military veterans , dead or alive , were regarded as heroes and the acts of war they participated in were considered to be glorious .
Many of the males on the planet seemed to look forward to the exciting act of going off to war .
A century ago , little French and British schoolchildren , not yet the age of military conscription , were indoctrinated in the belief that Germany was evil incarnate and deserving of death , and German schoolchildren were taught to believe the same things about the French and the English .
The peace that had existed for decades in Europe since the Franco - Prussian War had resulted in tremendous progress in culture , commerce and international relations .
Europeans of all stripes crossed borders freely , despite the significant class and wealth disparity .
There was very little homelessness or chronic hunger .
The Christmas Truce Best Price : $ 26.16 Buy New $ 109.95 ( as of 12:30 EST - Details )
Jews and Christians intermingled and intermarried with few eyes being raised .
The majority of people were basically content , despite the knowledge of the excess luxury wealth of the ruling classes .
Non-democratic empires ruled by kings , emperors , capitalists , generals and the bureaucratic hangers - on of the ruling elite seemed to have everything going for them in order to stay in power .
Despite their wealth and power , many of the ruling classes were still looking for ways to enrich themselves or further secure the ill - gotten gains that they had already accrued .
Some of these elite were also hoping to expand their colonial empires by the use of military force directed against innocent peoples who were weaker or otherwise less able to defend themselves .
Some of those in power desired to recapture or maintain control of disputed territories ( ex. Alsace - Lorraine ) , but they all bound themselves by a complex web of treaties that promised nations to come to the military aid of another if one of them was attacked .
Truce Jim Murphy Best Price : $ 2.20 Buy New $ 7.00 ( as of 05:35 EST - Details )
When Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated in Sarajevo , the peace rapidly unraveled and , by a series of errors of judgment , bureaucratic inefficiencies , ineptitude , and a lack of communication skills and a refusal to risk the dishonor of " turning the other cheek " all the treaty nations declared war on each other in a domino effect and the first world war was on .
The momentum that had built up over the decades by the propaganda in the schools turned out to be unstoppable and the indoctrinated boys , ignorant of the tragedy of past wars and looking for glory and a way out of their boredom , rushed to the recruiting offices to sign up for war .
And the war was on .
The war ultimately destroyed four empires , chemically poisoned the earth and water supplies with the massive application of military toxins and killed off 14,000,000 people , 90 % of whom were young naïve combatants .
An entire generation of young French , British and German men was wasted , either killed , wounded or rendered insane or criminal .
Virtually all of the casualties had been brain - washed to believe that war was glorious rather than satanic .
Christmas in the Trenches John McCutcheon Best Price : $ 7.92 Buy New $ 17.63 ( as of 03:10 EST - Details )
Predictably , the Christian churches chimed in with their nationalistic blindness and refused to teach what Jesus had taught his followers about violence .
The pulpits on all sides , British , Scottish , French , German , Austrian , Hungarian , Russian , Italian , etc , all rang with patriotic fervor and flags waving , telling their doomed sons that it was their Christian duty to obey their secular leaders and to go off to war to kill the fingered enemy on the other side .
Five months into the mass slaughter of trench warfare , the Christmas holiday came , holidays that reminded them of the safe home they had foolishly left behind .
The physically exhausted , spiritually deadened and combat - traumatized soldiers on each side of No Man 's Land sought some respite from the cruelty of the frozen trenches .
The frontline soldiers were at the end of their rope because of the unrelenting sleep deprivation , hyperalertness , bad food , rats , lice , frostbitten toes and fingers , deadly artillery bombardments , machine gun massacres and suicidal assaults that were stupidly ordered by the commanding officers in the rear .
The horrors of No Man's Land were punctuated by the screams and pleas for help of the wounded soldiers who were helplessly hanging on the barbed wire or lying in the bomb craters , each one dying an agonizing death that often lingered for days .

Kaiser Wilhelm had ordered that 100,000 Christmas trees be delivered to the German trenches for Christmas eve , thinking that the expense of such an irrational act was justified because , after all , the war was soon to be won by the superior German army and so using the supply lines for such unnecessary items seemed to be an acceptable expense .
And then a spontaneous event happened at various spots on the 700 - mile - long trench line that stretched between Belgium and France .
The singing of Christmas carols started a chain of events that resulted in an event that was never to be repeated in the history of warfare after that night .
The tradition that has emerged from this famous and true story was that the Germans started singing Stille Nacht ( Silent Night ) and the British responded with another carol .
And the French and Scots joined in and all sides sang together in their own tongues , the Scots with their bagpipes , accompanying the German singing .

And the sense of their common humanity , which had been driven out of them in the schools and in basic training , broke through to consciousness .
Homesickness may have set in or perhaps the futility of the slaughter became clear or perhaps the realization that they would have had things if they had met in different circumstances .
Or perhaps their sheer exhaustion took the fight out of them .
However it started , the soldiers disobeyed the orders to kill ( their commanding officers were , after all , celebrating Christmas eve back where it was safe from the killing ) , dropped their guns and came out of their trenches to meet one another .
The former enemies shared pictures from home , chocolate candy , wine  and soccer games were played .
Friendships were made and every soldier who experienced the events was forever changed .
The motivation to blindly kill a person who had never done them wrong suddenly vanished , never to return .
So powerful was the experience , that most of the affected men had to be withdrawn from the front lines , replaced with fresh troops who had never had the life - changing experience .

Fraternization in time of war was an act of treason that was punishable by summary execution .
Unexpectedly , the commanding officers , not wanting to draw public attention to this aberrant but potentially contagious episode , and knowing that such actions would threaten the war effort if it somehow became widely known , ordered no executions .
There were punishments , however , with many of the German soldiers who refused to fight being transferred to the eastern front to kill and die in the war with Russia .
The prize - winning movie that beautifully characterizes the spirit of the Christmas truce of 1914 is Joyeux Noel ( French for Merry Christmas ) .
It is a moving tale whose basic story comes directly from surviving veterans who experienced the event and from letters from soldiers who wrote home about it , letters that somehow survived military censorship .
The story that is so beautifully told in Joyeux Noel needs to be retold again and again in this era of the cleverly orchestrated , bankrupting , perpetual " US - led " wars of empire that are being fought by our indoctrinated , soon to be exhausted young men and women , some of whom are doomed to a life overwhelmed by the horrendous realities of posttraumatic stress disorder , sociopathic personality disorder , suicidality , homicidality , loss of religious faith , permanent and virtually untreatable traumatic brain injury , and a host of other nearly impossible - to - treat problems that are eminently preventable .

Militarists remain fearful about allowing their combatants to experience the humanity of their future targeted victims , whether they are average civilians from Iran , Iraq , Afghanistan or North Korea .
Military chaplains , who are supposed to be nurturers of the souls of their soldiers , are also forbidden by their superior officers to talk about the Golden Rule or about love of enemies or about the ethics of the Sermon on the Mount .
They are a part of the apparatus that rejects all of the Ten Commandments , especially the one that says " thou shalt not kill . "
Military chaplains , in their defense , may themselves have never heard about the nonviolence of the gospels or the rejection of enmity because their home churches or their seminaries never emphasized those realities
Near the end of Joyeux Noel there is a powerful scene , a confrontation between the Christ - like chaplain and his Scottish bishop just as the chaplain was giving last rites to a dying Scottish soldier .
The bishop had come to relieve the chaplain of his duties and abusively ordered him to return to his home parish because of his " treasonous and shameful " behavior ( being merciful to the enemy ) in a war zone .
The chaplain tried to explain to the authoritarian , pro-war , German - hating bishop that he had just performed " the most important mass of my life " and wanted to stay with his troops who were losing their Christian faith .
On Christmas eve , German , Scottish and French Christian soldiers ( and one Jewish German officer ) had all gathered for the mass on Christmas eve , had prayed together and had listened to a powerful rendition of Ave Maria .
The bishop denied the request .
The bishop then delivered a pro-war sermon ( the exact words having been obtained from a sermon that was delivered by an Anglican bishop in England later in the war ) to the troops who were being brought in to replace the suddenly reluctant soldiers .
The dramatic response of the chaplain represents a serious warning to the Christian church in America and also to its war - justifying citizens and their political leaders .
This is a profoundly important and very moving film that deserves to be annual holiday fare , alongside Dickens ' A Christmas Carol .

It also came with a 10 x magnifying glass which I did n't need because my eye sight is HAWK LIKE .
But I 'm going to use it to look at ants or something .
Not believing in a Supreme Being takes more faith than believing in one , according to Pastor Rick Warren .
“ I do n’t have enough faith to be an atheist , ” Warren told Fox News anchors Steve Doocy and Martha MacCallum Monday .
“ You know , Steve , if I ’m walking down a mountain and I see rock out of place and I go ‘ that ’s an accident . ’
If I ’m walking down a mountain — on the trail — and I find a Rolex that ’s evidence of design , ” he explained .
“ It actually takes more faith not to believe in God than to believe in God . ”

Warren laughed at the idea that Humanists would place ads in large cities that read “ No God ? … No problem . ”
While Warren scoffs at atheists , he seemed to respect every other belief system .
“ The are 600 million Buddhists in the world .
There are 800 million Hindus .
There are one and a half billion Muslims and there are 2.3 billion Christians .
The actual number of secularists in the world is actually quite small outside of Europe and Manhattan , ” said Warren .
“ You know the future of the world — you may not like this — is not secularism , it ’s pluralism .
So we better find out what everybody believes . ”
Bashing on atheists is n’t new for the pastor who has also compared gay marriage to pedophilia .
In April of 2007 , Warren told Newsweek that he “ never met an atheist who was n’t angry ” and that “ far more people have been killed through atheists than through all the religious wars put together . ”
“ Thousands died in the Inquisition ; millions died under Mao , and under Stalin and Pol Pot , ” Warren said in 2007 .
“ There is a home for atheists in the world today — it ’s called North Korea .
I do n’t know any atheists who want to go there .
I ’d much rather live under Tony Blair , or even George Bush . ”

Christopher Lee To Release Symphonic Metal Album " Charlemagne "
Actor Christopher Lee , who has appeared in movies such as " Lord of the Rings , " " The Wicker Man , " and " Star Wars , " has announced he will be releasing a symphonic metal album under the title " Charlemagne . "
The album is focused on the story of King Charlemagne , the First Holy Roman Emperor .
Samples from the album , which will be released on March 15th , 2010 , can be found at this location .
The band also issued the following statement about the new album :
" The Carandinis , Lee 's maternal ancestors , were given the right to bear the coat of arms of the Holy Roman Empire by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa .
Through his Carandini ancestors , Christopher Lee has a direct link to Charlemagne , and has decided for the first time in his life to pay homage to his distinguished ancestor , who is credited as ' The Father of Europe ' .
Charlemagne is a concept album with original words and symphonic metal music .
Composer Marco Sabiu , best known for his collaborations with Kylie Minogue , Take That , Pavarotti , Morricone , has created a truly epic canvas by introducing modern metal symphonies , in a style which resembles a movie score .
Marie - Claire Calvet , a graduate from Bristol University , transports the listener into ' The Dark Ages ' , with a very powerful storyline and mesmerising lyrics .
A full orchestra , heavy metal musicians , choir and special guest vocalists bring the legend of Charlemagne to life . "

TONY EASTLEY : Television viewing has often been accused of rotting the human brain , but it seems the real risk may be that it 's doing some damage to the rest of your body .
Australian scientists have published research showing a link which suggests that the more people watch TV , the sooner they die .
The report says that every hour spent watching television increased people 's risk of premature death .
Meredith Griffiths reports .
MEREDITH GRIFFITHS : Channel surfers are being warned that all the time they spend in front of the box , may be harmful to their health .
DAVID DUNSTAN : What this study provides is the first compelling evidence linking television viewing to an increased risk of early death .
MEREDITH GRIFFITHS : Professor David Dunstan works for the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne .
He and his team followed more than 8,000 Australian adults for six years .
The ones who watched the most TV died younger .
DAVID DUNSTAN : People who watch four or more hours of television a day have a 46 per cent higher risk of death from all causes and an 80 per cent increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease .
MEREDITH GRIFFITHS : Professor Dunstan says the increased risk of premature death was independent of other risk factors like smoking , blood pressure , cholesterol , diet or exercise .
He says that that shows that too much sitting is bad for our health .
DAVID DUNSTAN : Essentially prolonged sitting , because that 's the default position .
And from that there 's an absence of muscle movement .
We know from extensive evidence that muscle contractions are so important for many of the body 's regulatory processes , such as breaking down and using glucose .
So that loss of muscle movement for prolonged periods may result in a disruption to the body 's regulatory processes .
MEREDITH GRIFFITHS :
The report stresses that sitting too much is different from not exercising enough
DAVID DUNSTAN :
The risks associated with prolonged sitting are also not necessarily offset by doing more exercise , because in this study , even people whom were exercising , if they also watched high amounts of television , they had an increase risk of premature death .
MEREDITH GRIFFITHS :
So is TV just a bit of a scapegoat here ?
Could n't part of the problem be the jobs we work these days ?
Lots of people are very sedentary in the office ?
DAVID DUNSTAN : That is a very good point .
We are actually starting to explore this and we have some preliminary evidence that indicates that nearly three - quarters of working hours in office - based employees is spent sedentary .
MEREDITH GRIFFITHS : Trevor Shilton from the Heart Foundation says this is a vitally important new field of study .
TREVOR SHILTON :
In just a couple of generations we 've gone from being a very active people to people who sit around for most of the day .
I can foresee a time where we will have , in addition to our guidelines , a defined 30 minutes of physical activity a day .
Also guidelines about moving more and standing more throughout the day , and about sitting less , standing up every 20 minutes , going for a walk at work , having rules around television and computer times for our kids .
MEREDITH GRIFFITHS :
The study is published in the journal Circulation today .

But Mr. Kust found his way to a small advocacy group at Stony Brook University , the National Committee of Grandparents for Children ’s Rights .
With the group ’s help he negotiated the two states ’ laws until , on the very last day he was eligible , Florida faxed New York the paperwork so he could apply for custody .
He had come so close to losing them that the foster family had already picked new names  Savannah and Nathaniel .
As Monica said recently , “ I hated that name Savannah . ”
On Nov. 17 , 2006 , a Florida caseworker arrived at Kennedy Airport with his grandchildren .
“ Nathan was 2 , he did n’t pay me any attention , ” Mr. Kust said .
“ But Monica smiled and smiled . ”
Since then , Nov. 17 has been a family holiday , homecoming day , celebrated at Friendly ’s .
But that first Nov. 17 , after the children were safe in his house , Mr. Kust lay in bed weeping .
“ I could n’t believe I ’d done it , ” he said .
According to Census data , 4.5 million children live in households headed by a grandparent .
Seventy - one percent of those grandparents are under 60 and most are working , said Amy Goyer , who has analyzed the data for AARP .
This is not a poverty issue  82 percent are middle class or above .
Indeed , the national spokeswoman for the grandparent group that helped Mr. Kust is Patti Page , the singer .
Twelve years ago , Ms. Page said in an interview , she took custody of her two granddaughters , now 16 and 14 , because their mother  her daughter  had drug problems .
“ It had to be done , ” Ms. Page said .
Typically there ’s heartache  an adult child unable or unwilling to be a parent  so it ’s not an issue much discussed publicly .
While virtually all grandparent caregivers , regardless of income , are eligible for a monthly federal child - only grant ( about $ 400 in New York , but it varies by state ) , less than 15 percent sign up , according to AARP .
Which is why in 2003 , Brigitte Castellano , who helped raise her grandson , founded the national grandparents committee with chapters now in 30 states offering legal and moral support .
At this month ’s Suffolk County meeting on Long Island attended by 20 grandparents , the experienced guided the newcomers .
A 47 - year - old woman who had just taken custody of her 2 - year - old granddaughter talked about how angry she and her husband were at their 19 - year - old daughter .
When their daughter was pregnant , they tried getting her to put up the baby for adoption , but she refused , only to be charged later with child neglect .
“ My husband and I ca n’t do anything on weekends but take care of this little girl , ” the woman said .
“ Sometimes I just cry .
Then I feel bad  she ’s this innocent little thing . ”

In our busy lives where our abilities are taken for granted , we forget that living along with us are challenged people who have special needs .
Who could better understand the needs of the visually challenged than someone who has suffered it herself ?
Madhu Singhal is visually impaired by birth .
Born into an upper middle class family in Haryana , Madhu had the affluence to lead a comfortable life .
But she chose not to be laid back and wanted to do something on her own .
After completing her MA in Hindustani Classical Vocal Music , Madhu came down to Bangalore to undergo specialized training in communication and counseling .
To her surprise and much difficulty , she found that there was very little support for her learning needs .
In the North , audio recordings of text books were made available for students like her , but here in Bangalore Madhu could n’t find any such help .
Fighting this difficulty she completed her studies and got out only to find that it was extremely difficult for her to get a job .
This is when Madhu decided that no one else should suffer what she suffered .
And Mitra Jyothi was conceived .
Mitra Jyothi is aimed at empowering the visually impaired by supporting their educational needs , finding suitable jobs and making them independent enough to take charge of their lives .
The organization ’s most popular initiative is its Talking Book Library .
Text books and books for general reading are given a voice by volunteers , and cassettes and CDs are recorded for circulation .
Over 22,000 cassettes of more than 2000 books have been recorded till date .
Mitra Jyothi set up its own recording studio to provide this service professionally .
Notably , Mitra Jyothi’s effort in this front was the first of its kind in Karnataka and over 5000 people have benefited from the library .
The organization is also extensively involved in Braille transcription and providing computer education to the visually impaired .
Mitra Jyothi runs a full - fledged job placement cell for its members , a service that has helped its members find suitable jobs in corporates and manufacturing units .
Another admirable service is that the organization runs special courses for women to impart independent living skills .

Mitra Jyothi has been serving the needs of the visually challenged for over two decades now .
It has extended its services to Kerala , Andhra and Tamil Nadu .
Madhu Singhal has nurtured the organization with her selfless commitment that grew beyond her impairments .
Madhu lives independent , travels abroad on her own , spearheads an organization and chairs important positions in various social service organizations – a true role model .
What she has achieved can be made possible for more visually challenged people .

The number of Americans filing for personal bankruptcy rose by nearly a third in 2009 , a surge largely driven by foreclosures and job losses .
And more people are filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy , which liquidates assets to pay off some debts and absolves the filers of others .
That is significant because a 2005 overhaul of federal bankruptcy laws aimed to encourage Chapter 13 filings , which force consumers to sign onto debt - repayment plans in exchange for keeping certain assets .
The changes were designed to make it more difficult for people to shed their debt , particularly in a Chapter 7 filling .
A " means " test , for example , was introduced to separate those who could afford to repay their debt from those who could n't .
A Chapter 7 filing is off the table if the means test determines a person is able to pay back at least a portion of the debt after it is restructured .
The worst U.S. recession in a generation is testing the effectiveness of these laws .
The economic downturn also has prompted more middle - class Americans to file for bankruptcy protection .
Overall , personal bankruptcy filings hit 1.41 million last year , up 32 % from 2008 , according to the National Bankruptcy Research Center , which compiles and analyzes bankruptcy data .
It is the highest level of consumer - bankruptcy fillings since 2005 .
Consumers rushed to file in 2005 before the new bankruptcy laws took effect in October of that year .
Everything you need to know about the U.S. aid effort to assist Haiti in the wake of the catastrophic earthquake can be summed up by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's touchdown in Port - Au - Prince on Saturday , January 16 : they shut down the airport for three hours surrounding her arrival for " security " reasons , which meant that no aid flights could come in during those critical hours .
If there was one day when the Haitian people needed aid to flow all day long , last Saturday was it because the people trapped under the rubble on Tuesday evening could n't survive much beyond that without water .
Defenders of Clinton will say that her disimpassioned , monotone , photo - op speech was needed in Haiti to draw attention to the plight of the Haitians .
But no one north of hell can defend her next move : according to airport personnel that I spoke to during my recent evacuation from Haiti , she paralyzed the airport later that same day to have a new outfit flown in from the Dominican Republic .
I am having a hard time readjusting to life back home after having survived the earthquake and witnessing so much death , so even typing those words is making my heart pound uncontrollably .
I guess for America 's rulers a new pantsuit is more valuable than the lives of poor , Black Haitians .
( Editors Note :
We are unable to corroborate the pantsuit part of this article and should not have published it .
We regret the error . )
Unfortunately , Clinton 's model of diverting and delaying critical aid to the Haitian people , while emphasizing security , has become standard operating procedure .
Alain Joyandet , the French minister responsible for humanitarian relief in Haiti , charged the U.S. with treating this as a military operation rather than an aid mission .
Mr. Joyandet told the Daily Telegraph he had been involved in an argument with a U.S. commander in the airport 's control tower over the flight plan for a French evacuation flight , saying , " This is about helping Haiti , not about occupying Haiti . "
But with the U.S. occupying Iraq and Afghanistan , and funding the Israeli occupation of Palestine , it seems our government knows how to do little else when it comes to international affairs .
The day I left the Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport I saw lots of crates of food , water and medical supplies piled on the tarmac .
But I did n't see that aid being transported out of the airport to actually be used by Haitians .
Undoubtedly , there has been some aid distributed , but because there was no serious effort to disperse that aid in the first four days after the quake , tens of thousands of people trapped under rubble have died needlessly because they could n't get a sip of water .
The Geneva - based organization Doctors Without Borders has been turned away from the airport numerous times to allow U.S. troops to land .
A ring of U.S. war ships surround Haiti to make sure that Haitians do n't escape the disaster and try to get to the United States .
The U.S. has taken control of Haiti's main airport and seaport , and is in the process of deploying 18,000 U.S. troops to bolster the 9,000 UN troops already occupying the island nation -- and as an eyewitness I can tell you those troops are guarding their own compounds rather than distributing aid .
The Obama administration will try to dress up their ambition to occupy and pillage Haiti in a humanitarian evening gown .
But clothing is in short supply in Haiti and we can't afford to waste it .
As a man from Leogane , Haiti , told Democracy Now ,
" Myself , if you look at me , I do n't have shoes , and I do n't have food .
Even my shoes , if you look at them , you see .
I need clothes .
We need everything .
Even medicines , we need . "

Forleden hadde jeg fødselsdag , og det ble feiret på lørdag .
som salutt valgte vi å « sende opp » to flasker av den typen som Steinar og jeg brygget , og som spredte seg ut over kontoret til Andrew Iversen da vi litt ondsinnet overbeviste ham om å åpne en flaske der
Denne gangen tok jeg visse forholdsregler , og den ble åpnet på plenen , med regnjakke , tykke arbeidshansker , hette og beskyttelsesbriller .
Jeg kan bevitne at det var futt i flaska .
Da korken på første kom fri , ble den dyttet med så stor kraft inn i hånda at det gjorde vondt ... gjennom de tykkhudede arbeidshanskene .
Jeg siktet ikke rett opp - av naturlige grunner , men mener at med ca 45 graders vinkel , så skjøt jeg strålen av øl og bunnfall ca 6 - 7 meter bortover i horisontal retning .
Her er en film , og under er gitt noen bilder .
Her står jeg og er litt skeptisk før første oppskytning .
Vil det bli et lite poff eller noe spektakulært ?
Vil flaska revne ?
Vil jeg få det hele i over meg ?
Første oppskytning .
Her klarte jeg ikke å få korken fort nok av , så litt av spruten gikk i korken og hanskene og slikt .
Fin , samlet stråle .
Andre oppskytning , fin stråle , men det er tatt litt tidligere i prosessen , så det er ikke fullt så imponerende .
Flaska var nesten helt tom etterpå , det var bare litt tyktflytende grums igjen , det er så vidt mulig å se det dryppe noe fra tuten .
Den « dråpen » var vel nesten det eneste som var igjen på flaska etter åpning .
Til slutt vil jeg gi skryt til de flaskene som Nøgne Ø bruker .
Jeg tror det er nye , tyske panteflasker .
Det er nok andre flasker som ikke ville tålt trykket , men disse flaskene har holdt .
De er ønskeflasker for enhver hjemmebrygger .
Takk til Bjørn
Ove for bildene , og Magni for filmen .
La meg til slutt nevne at dette ikke var ment som et realistisk øl .
Vi laget en batch der vi hadde problemer med filtreringen , og så dyttet vi restene på noen flasker under mottoet « se hva som skjer » .
Jeg bare nevner det , for etter det forrige innlegget har flere utvist forsiktighet i omgang med flasker som vi har brygget .
Det er ingen grunn til det .
Helt sant !

Fur is back in fashion .
It 's a trend which has been rapidly gaining momentum after seemingly fading away in the 1990s .
Top designers in New York , London , Milan , and this week no doubt Paris as well , have been showing real fur in their new autumn collections .
Supermodels , such as Cindy Crawford and Claudia Shiffer , who'd once said they would ' rather go naked than wear fur ' in the infamous Peta advertisements of the 90s are now modelling it on the catwalk - and wearing it in real life - without a second thought .
Click on the links below to read Daily Mail writer Anne de Courcy 's report on the rise of fur in fashion and read the case studies of four women who wear fur , and click on the links in the blue box , above , to see our picture gallery of celebrity and designer fur and tell us what YOU think on our message board .
In America the stars have taken to wearing fur much more quickly than their British counterparts and now the ladies who lunch in Manhattan and LA are donning real fur in their droves .
Recently Will Smith 's wife , Jada Pinkett Smith wore a chinchilla edged coat worth $ 10,500 to the LA premiere if her husband 's latest film , Ali , while Kate Moss wore a fox - fur cape to the opening of the new Yves Saint Laurent store in London .
Yet Moss and other celebrity fur wearers such as Madonna , Jennifer Lopez , Naomi Campbell and Joan Collins are all influential style icons .
So why has real fur become fashionable again when the fake versions look arguably just as good ?
For some fur smacks of cruelty and the unnecessary suffering of animals , for others it is all about status and wealth .
According to Dr Hans Van Tillburg , " [ the I - 201 submarine ] was nothing like anybody had in the Second World War .
It had a streamlined body and conning tower and retractable gun . "
They just found it in Hawaii .

According to Van Tillburg , it looks more like a Cold War submarine than a WW2 ship , build for high speed underwater travel .
The I -401 was its sister vessel .
That one was located in 2005 , and it was capable of carrying 144 people through 37,000 miles , it was three times the size of modern submarines .
Japan wanted to use these ships to launch aerial attacks in the continental United States .
To do this , it used three Aichi light bombers , each capable of carrying an 800 - kilogram bomb .
When their mission was complete , the bombers returned to the submarine , landing on the water using floats .
The Japanese also had a dirty trick in their pockets :
Use the submarines to drop big cans full of rats infected with the plague and insects loaded with cholera , dengue , and typhus .
They never were able to put that in practice , however .
The Americans delivered a big can full of atoms to them first .

These two submarines were so advanced that , after being captured and inspected by the United States , they were sunk so the Soviets could n't inspect them .
The Japanese were the pioneers in developing advanced aerial attack technology for submarines .
The sea - to - air cruise missile was developed later , during the Cold War period .
Nowadays , the US Navy is working on submarine - launched drones , which can take off from underwater .

Although the yields on all government bonds have been pushed higher in part as investors divert their money into the fast - rising equity markets , the comparison between the UK and elsewhere shows that British debt has been increasingly shunned since the pre-Budget report at the start of this month , which was widely criticised for failing to unveil a more ambitious deficit reduction plan .
With the credit ratings agencies having warned that unless the next Government scales down spending more radically , they are likely to remove Britain 's top - tier rating , many suspect 2010 could be the most testing year for government fund - raising in a generation .

Global Warming : Trick or Truth ?
For U.S. viewers , tune in to " Campbell Brown " for a look into the science , skepticism and secrets surrounding global climate change .
CNN , Monday , 8 p.m. ET .
For international viewers , tune into " Connect the World " for analysis and reaction on the opening day of the U.N. climate summit in Copenhagen , Denmark .
CNN International , Monday , 10 p.m. CET
Washington ( CNN ) --
A rise in skepticism among Americans over global warming is mostly due to changes among Republicans , according to a new national poll .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation survey , released Monday , indicates that two - thirds of all Americans believe global warming is a proven fact .
That 's down 8 percentage points since June 2008 , with views among Democrats holding steady and Republicans ' belief in global warming dropping 11 points .
" The growing skepticism among Republicans , with no matching shift among Democrats , suggests that the changes measured in this poll may be a reaction to having a Democrat in the White House rather than a shift in underlying attitudes toward global warming , " said Keating Holland , CNN polling director .
The poll 's release come as a United Nations climate summit opened in Copenhagen , Denmark .
That global conference began under a cloud of accusations , after international attention the past two weeks over hacked e-mails that suggest some scientists faked data to support the argument of global warming .
i Report : Share your thoughts on climate change
But Holland noted that polls released last month from other organizations have found similar shifts in views on global warming for several months .
That indicates the changes in the new CNN survey are not the direct result of the media attention to the leaked e-mails from climate researchers , he said .
According to the survey , roughly a third of the people who believe in global warming think it is due to natural causes , rather than manmade causes such as industrial emissions .
As a result , the number who say that global warming is caused by humans has dropped from 54 percent last summer to 45 percent now .
The poll indicates the number who say the United States should reduce emissions even if other countries do not follow suit has also dropped , from 66 percent in 2007 to 58 percent today .
" That drop is due to roughly equal changes among Republicans and Democrats , suggesting that economic conditions , rather than political factors , may be at play , " Holland said .
Why does a majority support lowering emissions when most Americans no longer think emissions cause global warming ?
" Americans may have other reasons to support a reduction in carbon dioxide and other gases , " Holland said .
" Pollution is pollution , and the country has been worried about clean air long before global warming became a topic of discussion . "
The CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted December 2 - 3 , with 1,041 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percent for the overall sample .

You may wish to take pains to ensure that your fire and its byproducts do n't bother your neighbors , depending on the wind direction .
We take no responsibility for the following procedure or your ability to follow it or not .
Fire is dangerous , so be careful .
Materials 55 gallon drum with lid
30 gallon drum with lid
4 fire bricks
Wood source for lump
Wood source for fuel

Constructing The Kiln Locate the drums you will need to made your kiln .
You can check garages , landfills , convenience centers , auto body repair shops , cleaning services .
All sorts of businesses have drums for you to drag away .
Cut a fuel feeder hole in the side of the 55 gallon drum near the bottom .
Make the hole about 10 inches high and 18 inches wide .
Use a metal cutting blade in a reciprocating saw or a jigsaw to make this cut .
Drill 5 holes about 3/8 or 1/2 inch in diameter in the bottom of the 30 gal drum .
Making The Lump Charcoal Prepare the raw material for the lump .
Big - R uses 4 - inch disks of oak , partly cured ( totally cured is better ) and whacks them into fist sized pieces .
Load / wedge as many pieces into the small drum as you can and still have the lid fit on .
Step 3 . ( C , D ) Prepare for the burn .
Lay two bricks flat in the bottom of the big drum and stand the other two bricks on edge to form a stand for the small drum inside the big drum .
Set the small drum on top of the bricks .
Place the lid on the small drum , leaving it cracked for moisture to escape .
Place the lid on the large drum , leaving it cracked to form a chimney of sorts .
You can use a piece of rebar for this .
Start a fire ( through the fuel feeder hole ) underneath the bottom of the small drum .
I use 1 plastic milk jug and some paper .
Layer on twig , branches and then small limb pieces until you have a good fire going .
Then feed the fire with whatever wood you have to keep it going .
I use split oak pieces .
Continue to feed the fire , hotter is better .
At about 4 hours close the lid on the small drum .
Most of the water should have been driven off and the lump should have begun to shrink in size .
The photo shows the lump - to - be after about 3 hours .
Continue to burn for 4 - 5 more hours until out gassing stops .
Outgassing is the burning of volatile elements in the lump , leaving only pure carbon charcoal .
You will be able to see jets of flame ( gentle or vibrant ) coming from the five small holes drilled in the small drum .
You can finish the lump in one of two ways .
One , after outgassing remove the small drum and set it in some dirt to let it cool without access to air .
This takes about 12 - 14 hours .
Alternatively , you can leave the burn alone during outgassing and let the fuel fire go out on its own .
Both work well .
the second way is easier but the first way seems to give less brittle lump .
After cooling WELL , open the small drum and harvest your own lump .
It will be brittle so be careful in handling .
It lights well and burns hot and long .
Here is the product of one session 's burning sorted into the big pieces and the rest .
Enjoy the fruits of your labor , an 11 hour butt on homemade lump .
No problems .
Researchers in the European Union are using telematics to create " road trains " that join the benefits of carpooling with the freedom of driving alone .
The latest concept , part of the EU's Safe Road Trains for the Environment initiative , groups cars with similar destinations into road trains over long stretches of highway .
The lead vehicle will be driven by an experienced motorist – it may even be a bus that regularly travels the route – while the functions of each following vehicle will be automatically controlled and tethered to the actions of the lead car so that individual drivers can hammer out e-mails or eat breakfast .
Despite the project 's name , cars can exit at any time .
While the project , which goes by the acronym SARTRE , sounds futuristic , all it requires are navigation systems that communicate with the lead vehicle and control acceleration and steering .
The project 's lead agencies estimate that vehicles will begin testing in 2011 and say a full - scale rollout is likely within a decade .
According to Ricardo UK , the firm in charge of SARTRE , no infrastructure investment will be necessary .
" By developing and implementing the technology at a vehicle level , SARTRE aims to realise the potentially very significant safety and environmental benefits of road trains without the need to invest in changes to road infrastructure , " project coordinator Tom Robinson said in a statement .
At the same time , Ricardo estimates that fuel savings from efficiency and aerodynamics gains will be upwards of 20 percent , while road capacity will increase at the same time that accidents from distracted or drowsy drivers decrease .
" This type of autonomous driving actually does n’t require any hocus - pocus technology , and no investment in infrastructure , " said Erik Coelingh of Volvo , one of the principal companies participating in the project .
" Instead , the emphasis is on development and on adapting technology that is already in existence . "

Greg Stejskal did n't need Mark McGwire coming clean Monday about his nearly decade - long steroid usage to know the real story .
Stejskal , a retired FBI agent , uncovered the details of McGwire 's doping regimen from informants almost two decades ago and , in retrospect , Big Mac is fortunate he was n't nabbed back then in the federal investigation .
Stejskal , who helped lead the first major federal investigation into illegal steroid distribution called Operation Equine , confirmed that McGwire and his then - Oakland A's teammate , Jose Canseco , were among those identified as steroid users during the probe .
The investigation ran from 1989 - 1993 and led to more than 70 steroid - related convictions , though authorities targeted only suppliers and not users like pumped - up ballplayers .
Federal authorities never considered bringing charges against McGwire , though Stejskal laments that nabbing a big - name athlete might have brought earlier focus to the issue of illegal steroids .
That came a decade later with the BALCO scandal and the laundry list of prominent athletes topped by Barry Bonds , Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery .
" With all those 70 some defendants , not one of them was just a user , " Stejskal said of the operation .
" They were all distributors .
Some were distributors and users .
We did n't have the resources .
We wanted the biggest bang for our buck .
We wanted to shut down the black market .
We worked the suppliers and there was no reason to go after low - level people . "
All these years , Stejskal simply rolled his eyes as Big Mac avoided the steroid question .
So he was surprised Monday upon learning of McGuire 's admission , which came as he prepares to return to the game as hitting coach with the St. Louis Cardinals .
" I figured that he would either continue to try and finesse the question or back out of the whole coaching thing and say , ' Fine , I 'm not going to do this .
I do n't need this , ' " Stejskal said .
" It is too bad he waited so long to do it , but I am glad he finally stood up .
" Now I hope he does what he said he was going to do in the [ 2005 ] congressional hearings , and that is taking a stand against these performance - enhancing drugs .
That he 'll fight for more stringent testing and punishment and all that kind of stuff .
I do n't know that it is going to help him in terms of [ election to ] the Hall of Fame .
I have heard some people speculate that that was part of this , his way of trying to give himself a chance to get into the Hall of Fame .
" But I think everybody suspected that he was doing them .
Before , maybe you could have gotten somebody to have given you the benefit of the doubt .
Now he is in a situation where you can't even give him the benefit of the doubt .
Clearly , he used steroids .
And you got to believe they affected his ability . "
In a statement made public Monday , McGwire acknowledged using steroids on and off for nearly a decade dating back to 1989 .
Knowing the questions that await , his admission was careful to specifically cover the 1998 season , when McGwire hit a then - record 70 homers as he and Sammy Sosa engaged in a season - long slugfest that brought a renewal of interest to the sport .
Stejskal said federal authorities , through their undercover operation , learned of McGwire 's steroid usage by 1993 .
A year later , Stejskal recalled that he shared information from the investigation related to baseball players with Major League Baseball 's then security boss , Kevin Hallinan , though the sport had no drug testing program at the time .
" We had two sources that told us they personally had seen [ McGwire ] use steroids , " Stejskal told ESPN.com .
" Not to mention the fact that Canseco said it as well , which gives you a third source .
But we knew it before Canseco said it .
And we knew specifics , too .
We knew this was n't a one - time shot or an experimental thing .
This guy had a regimen and stuff . "
Stejskal has steadfastly refused to identify the sources , though Curtis Wenzlaff has previously been reported to have been a supplier to several Major League Baseball players in the early 1990s , including McGwire .
Asked about the sources Monday , Stejskal said , " They were steroid dealers and users who provided information to us that McGwire was a user of steroids . "
He added that one " was present when he used steroids . "
Even so , McGwire stuck to his guns and fended off inquiries about his increasing robust physique and weight gain .
He was never more defiant than when he appeared before a congressional hearing in March 2005 .
Asked whether he took illegal steroids during his playing days , McGwire repeatedly answered " I 'm not here to talk about the past . "
That performance proved embarrassing and sent McGwire into hiding that past five years .
But he is n't about to become subject of a federal perjury probe after his admission Monday .
" He never denied , nor did he admit to the use of steroids , " Stejskal said of the Capitol Hill appearance .
" He finessed the question .
Perjury requires knowingly telling an untruth .
He does n't really say it .
He gives that [ expletive ] comment about , ' This is n't about the past . '
Clearly , it was about the past .
Now he realizes it was about the past because he clearly put himself in this situation .
" Maybe [ Cardinals manager Tony ]
La Russa or some of these other people said , ' Look , we can finesse this . '
So before spring training starts he is out there getting in front of it .
That is a good thing .
It is just too bad he waited so long .
" He had an opportunity to talk about it in Congress .
In a sense , it is vindication for people like the Hootens [ whose teenage son Taylor committed suicide while using steroids ] who testified just before he did before Congress .
Maybe baseball will now realize this was an extremely serious problem and that they are still not in front of it .
They are still playing catch - up . "

A dose of the hormone makes human game - players behave more fairly .
Higher levels of testosterone do not necessarily lead to more aggressive behaviour .
iStockphoto
The popular idea that testosterone always makes people more aggressive has been debunked by researchers .
A team based in Switzerland has shown that the hormone can make people behave more fairly in an effort to defend their social status .
Ernst Fehr , an experimental economist at the University of Zurich , and his colleagues used the ' ultimatum bargaining ' game to test how testosterone would affect behaviour in a group of 121 women .
Counter - intuitively , women who were given testosterone bargained more fairly .
But the idea that testosterone causes aggression in humans , as it clearly does in rodents , is so firmly ingrained in the human psyche that women who believed they had been given testosterone — whether or not they had — bargained much less fairly .
Women , not men , were tested because they have less variable ' baseline ' blood testosterone levels .
The study is published in Nature1 .
" It is a folk hypothesis that testosterone causes aggression , " says Fehr .
" But human society is more complex than this . "
Fair play
Several studies in humans have shown positive correlations between high blood testosterone levels and confrontational behaviour .
But it has been hard to determine experimentally whether the aggression is caused by testosterone or is instead a consequence of a challenge to a person 's social status .
The ultimatum game makes it possible to distinguish between these possibilities .
“ It is a folk hypothesis that testosterone causes aggression .
But human society is more complex than this . ”
Ernst Fehr
University of Zurich
In the game , two individuals must agree on the division of a sum of money .
The proposer suggests a particular splitting of the sum and the responder must accept or reject the offer .
The proposal is an ultimatum — the responder may not make a counter - offer .
If the responder accepts the proposal , the money is duly allocated .
If the responder rejects the proposal , neither the proposer nor the responder gets any money .
Responders normally reject very low offers as unfair — they would rather receive no money than see their partner carry off a disproportionate amount of cash .
Some proposers offer a 50 - 50 split because they are motivated by fairness , although most push to keep a bit more for themselves — but not so much more that they risk rejection and ending up with nothing .
Fehr 's team reasoned that if testosterone caused aggression , it would cause proposers to make low offers .
If , however , it promoted social - status - seeking behaviour , proposers would make higher offers to avoid the social affront of having their offers rejected .
Beggaring belief
The women were given either 0.5 mg testosterone or a placebo four hours before playing the ultimatum game for the sum of 10 money units .
Before they played , they were asked to say whether they believed they had been given testosterone or placebo .
Women who received testosterone made significantly higher offers than those who received placebo — an average of 3.9 money units compared with the placebo group 's average offer of 3.4 money units .
" In the socially complex human environment , pro-social behaviour , not aggression , secures status , " says Michael Naef , an experimental economist at the Royal Holloway , University of London , who is a co-author on the paper .
ADVERTISEMENT
The study has an additional , equally important message : those who believed they received testosterone , whether they had or not , made much lower offers — as low as 2 money units in some cases , or even nothing .
" We think their belief that they had received testosterone , and that testosterone promotes aggression , gave them an up - front excuse to act more aggressively , " says Fehr .
Responders remained as likely to reject a shabby offer when they were treated with testosterone as when they received placebo , showing that the hormone was not promoting altruistic behaviour .
Adam Goodie , a psychologist at the University of Georgia in Athens who works on decision - making , says : " The paper is a major blow to the popular wisdom that testosterone simply makes you more aggressive and less cooperative — the true picture is not nearly as negative . "
" And it takes the field of neuroeconomics an important step further by showing that not only does biology affect economic behaviour — but so does belief , " he adds .
The powerful impact of belief is a good lesson for neuroeconomists , adds Fehr : " Belief should always be controlled for in neuroeconomics studies , but often it is not . "
We all love to argue ( as is evidenced by the comments on some of the topics on Listverse ) but oftentimes an argument ends in a yelling match with insults flying and no conclusion being drawn .
Therefore , I have put together this list of tips to help all of us in our future debates – on the site and off .
If you take heed of all of my suggestions here , you will be in a much stronger position in future arguments .
If you find this list useful , I also recommend you read the book How to Argue & Win Every Time , by Gerry Spence .
10 Soft and Steady
When debating you should never raise your voice .
You should remain calm at all times .
The louder you talk , the louder your opponent talks – and the end result is a yelling match .
And of course , it goes without saying that you should definitely not resort to violence .
You can even try to talk quieter than normal – as this can draw people in to you and it can make you appear wise .
An argument is not won by the person with the loudest voice , it is won by the person with the most compelling arguments .
9 Get Your Opponent On Your Side
It is a good idea to try to get your opponent on your side by making statements that you know he agrees with – this puts you in the strong position in the debate .
You do n’t even need to use a fact relating to your debate – you could , for example , in a debate about the existence of God state “ I am sure you agree with me when I say that petrol is overpriced ” .
As soon as your opponent agrees , you have won a psychological battle .
You are no longer the opponent – you are a comrade .
This technique is so effective it is used by telemarketers all the time .
8 Do n’t Attack
It is not a good idea to blatantly tell your opponent that he is wrong – instead you should show that he is wrong through good counter - arguments .
Telling a person they are wrong merely annoys them and does nothing for your argument as ( at least until you can prove it ) , it is a subjective comment .
Be humble in the debate and show good will – not only will it make you look good if you win , it will show that you are a worthy opponent even if you lose .
7 Do n’t Play Dirty
Never resort to name calling – even if your opponent does .
You must attack your opponent ’s argument – not their person .
As soon as you begin to criticize your opponent , it becomes obvious that you have run out of ways to defend your view .
These types of insults ( ad hominem ) are a sure way to lose a debate .
You should be pleased if your opponent resorts to this feeble attempt to escape the real debate as it means you are close to victory .
6 Define The Fundamentals
When arguing , both parties need to agree on fundamental “ truths ” to begin with – if you do n’t , there can be no debate .
What is the point of arguing that the Bible was written by God , when your opponent does n’t even believe in God ?
First you should debate the existence of God .
If you both agree that He exists , you can then debate the smaller points .
If your opponent convinces you that God can not exist , there is little point in arguing about the authorship of the Bible .
This is the structure seen in the Summa Theologica by Saint Thomas Aquinas – he starts with the basic points , presents arguments and counter - arguments , and moves on when each point is “ proven ” by logic .
5 Stick to the Subject
When a person is beginning to lose an argument , it is quite common to see them try to divert the topic at hand to another – thereby hoping you will not notice their weakness and will get entangled in a whole new debate .
When this happens , do n’t fall for it .
Return to the original topic immediately .
Do not give any time to other topics ( no matter how tempting it may be ) until you have completed the first .
4 Ask Questions
This is the “ socratic method ” .
When your opponent states a “ fact ” – probe deeper in to the fact with questions that are designed to expose its flaws – these are usually “ tell me more ” type questions : “ can you give me an example ? ” , “ Another way of looking at this is … , does this seem reasonable ? ” .
These questions will invariably lead your opponent to the truth – and if they are honest , they will concede .
Unfortunately this is not always the case – I have seen frustrated people depart the debate in anger because they believe you are “ trying to trick ” them .
But do n’t worry – this is a win if it happens .
3 Be Silent
After making a strong argument , let your opponent do all the talking – especially if he lacks the facts to oppose you .
He will bluster and fumble – giving you a variety of new weapons with which to attack him .
This may not lead to him conceding defeat – but it may lead to him walking away from the debate – a clear victory for you .
Many an argument has been won by not arguing at all !
As an aside , this is an excellent method for getting your own way – make your request , and when it is declined remain silent .
This usually makes the other person so nervous ( as no one likes silence ) that they may give in just to get out of an uncomfortable situation .
2 Know Your Facts
Do not state that something is “ true ” unless you absolutely know it is – be prepared to prove it if necessary .
It is incredibly annoying to debate a topic with a person who is simply making up their argument on the fly .
You would n’t like it if people did it to you – so do n’t do it to others .
Only engage in a debate that you know you can win based on facts .
1 Know When You ’re Beat
If you have all the facts to back you up , you should be able to win your argument if your opponent is honest .
But there will always be times when your opponent gets the better of you and they corner you .
When this happens , be a gentleman and concede the win .
You should always be graceful in defeat .
Nothing is worse than a person who argues simply for the sake of it and absolutely will not give in – no matter how obvious their loss .
The U.S. National Team veteran is headed back to MLS .
New franchise Philadelphia Union have acquired the rights to U.S. National team veteran Danny Califf in a trade with the Houston Dynamo who will receive allocation money .
The 29 - year - old Califf will return to Major League Soccer after a very successful spell in the Danish Supeliga with Aalborg BK and most recently as a member of FC Midtjylland .
Califf has been capped 23 times for the U.S. National team and adds even more depth to head coach Peter Nowak 's defense .
“ There will be competition for every spot on the pitch ” Nowak said in a press release .
“ But with a seasoned veteran like Danny Califf , we ’re adding a player who will help us set the bar ever higher .
Danny understands the level of commitment our Technical Staff will demand daily and we ’re counting on him to not only help anchor our defense but push our younger players to greater heights too .
” Califf won an MLS Cup with Los Angeles in 2002 and spent five seasons in MLS before moving to Europe and has been a regular part of Bob Bradley 's setup during qualifying for the 2010 World Cup .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- UK - based company Light Blue Optics has introduced an extremely compact projector that converts any flat surface into an interactive touch video screen .
The Light Touch interactive projector is basically a hand - held computer that runs Windows CE and uses a proprietary holographic laser projection ( HLP ) system to project a virtual touch screen onto any flat surface .
The image projected is only 15 lumens , but remains in focus even at long distances .
Holographic refers to the method Light Blue Optics uses to create two - dimensional images by transforming original images into sets of diffraction patterns that are shown on a micro-display and then illuminated by laser light .
Diffraction patterns are used because of their high efficiency , since they direct light to where it is needed rather than indiscriminately .
Multiple diffraction patterns are calculated , with each producing a rough version on the image .
The viewer 's eye then separates the images from the noise and sees them as a clear video image that is always in focus , even when projected onto a curved surface .
The lasers produce vivid and bright image colors , and the wide throw angle produces large ( 10 - inch ) images even close to the tiny projector .
The Light Touch system detects interactivity via an integrated infrared system that in effect transforms any surface into a touch screen , and this allows users to run the projector and control applications by touching the image .
WiFi connectivity and Bluetooth technology are built - in to allow users to connect to the Internet for multimedia sharing and social networking via the projector .
The laser used in the Light Touch projector is a class 1 , which means it is completely eye safe , and the projected images are WVGA ( Wide Video Graphics Array ) , which produces a crisp , auto - focused image .
The standard flash memory is 2 GB , but there is a micro SD card slot to upgrade to 32 GB storage .
The battery life rating is for two hours .
The Light Touch projector , the first released product of Blue Light Optics , was demonstrated for the first time on 7 January at the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) in Las Vegas .

Stop eating by 7 pm for at least one week , but try to make it a lifelong habit .
Avoid alcohol , fast food and deep fried food ( at least while doing the liver cleanse , but try to make this , too , a lifelong habit . )
Follow this liver flush for a week :
Upon waking , drink the juice of 2 - 3 fresh squeezed oranges and 1 /2 lemon blended with one clove garlic , 1 Tbsp olive oil and a sprinkle of cayenne .
Follow that with a cleansing tea of flax , fenugreek , fennel , comfrey or nettles and mint , which can be enjoyed throughout the day .
For lunch and dinner have fresh fruit or vegetable salad .
Herbs such as milk thistle and dandelion are beneficial for the liver .
Milk thistle is often taken in capsule or tincture form , while dandelion root is often drunk as tea or taken as a tincture .
Fresh dandelion leaves can be added to salads .
About the author
( NewsTarget )
Stress of modern living and our standard American diet , which includes alcohol , fried food and fast food , strain our health , especially our Liver .
Stopping eating by 7 pm may be the best thing we can do for our health .
Looking to ancient Chinese medicine we find a clear explanation of why this is .
In Chinese Medicine , , or energy , runs though the body through a series of twelve main channels , or meridians .
For each meridian there is a two hour time period for which the energy is strongest .
According to Chinese Medicine , digestion is controlled by the Earth element .
The organs which correspond to the Earth element are Stomach and Spleen .
The Stomach meridian`s energy is strongest in the morning between 7 and 9 am , and the Spleen is strongest between 9 am and 11 am .
Therefore 7 am to 11 am is the best time to eat because our digestive energy is strongest .
Twelve hours later the energy of our digestive organs is the weakest , and we should stop eating by 7 pm .
Light meals of fresh fruits and vegetables or fresh juices are best if we are hungry in the evening since these foods are simplest to digest .
Digestion is naturally slower in the evening as the energy is weakest in those meridians at that time .
Food stays in the stomach and tends to ferment leading to gas , bloating and discomfort .
Energy is drawn from other organs to help digest food .
Overnight from 11 pm until 3 am the energy is strongest in the gall bladder and liver .
These organs cleanse the blood and control sleep .
They become taxed when we eat late at night .
We get indigestion , insomnia and a feeling of not being well rested in the morning .
In addition , our joints may ache or become arthritic .
Toxins get stored in our organs and joints when the liver cannot function properly .
Eating late at night strains our liver , drawing energy from it to help us digest food .
There are liver flushes and herbs such dandelion and milk thistle to cleanse and regenerate the liver .
Yet one of the best things we can do for the liver is to stop eating by 7 pm .
Once the liver energy is not being drawn away toward digestion , the liver is able to function and heal .
When we stop eating at 7 pm , many symptoms , even those which seem unrelated to digestion such as pain and arthritis , will disappear .
People often lose weight quickly as the body is able to rid itself of toxins .
The meridians balance and naturally become stronger when energy is not drawn into digestion overnight .
Steps to rejuvenate the liver are : Balch , Phyllis , A.. Avery Trade .

Two - time world champion Fernando Alonso says he is arriving at the Ferrari team at the best moment of his career .
The Spaniard will be joining the historic Maranello - based squad next year after two disappointing years at the Renault team .
He is replacing Kimi Raikkonen as Felipe Massa 's team - mate and the team is counting on him to revive its fortunes after a poor 2009 season .
Alonso says he could not be joining Ferrari at a better time .
" I 'm really looking forward to the start of next year , " Alonso said during a Cajastur event in Asturias on Monday .
" I 'm joining the best team in the world , Ferrari , and I 'm arriving at the best moment of my career .
Right now I feel like I 've never felt before .
I think I 'm at my best moment as a driver and as a person .
" I hope that joining Ferrari means winning titles to share with Asturias and Spain . "
LISTEN GUYS , I GREW UP among conservatives .
For all our differences politically , and philosophically , I know that for the most part you 're good people .
You love your children , you believe in doing good , you work hard .
Which is why the email I received today enraged me so .
You deserve better .
But you 're never going to get anything better until you stop allowing people to lie to you .
Here 's the email , and a few facts about it , which should give you an idea why I am so angry on your behalf :
Fw : White House Drops Christ from Christmas
This checks out on Snopes as " Verified Correct " .
Amazing what " Change " we are getting with our new President .
He did promise CHANGE !!!!!!!!
=====================================================
Subject : White House Christmas Ornaments
The White House will celebrate " Winter Holiday " this year , not Christmas .
I hope the people in this country wake up soon .
Thought you might be interested in this information from the White House .
This is n't a rumor ; this is a fact .
We have a friend at church who is a talented artist .
For several years she , among many others , has painted ornaments to be hung on the various White House Christmas trees .
The White House sends out an invitation to send an ornament and informs the artists of the theme for the year .
She got her letter from the WH recently .
It said that they would not be called Christmas trees this year .
They will be called Holiday trees .
And , to please not send any ornaments painted with a religious theme .
She was very upset at this development and sent back a reply telling them that she painted the ornaments for Christmas trees and would not be sending any for a display that left Christ out of Christmas .
Just thought you should know what the new residents in the White House plan for the future of America .
If you missed his statement that " we do not consider ourselves a Christian Nation " this should confirm that he plans to take us away from our religious foundation as quickly as possible .
Having had previous experience with this kind of email , I immediately checked Snopes.com to see if it was really rated " verified correct " .
It was n't .
It was rated " False " .
The White house has no such plans , and the contents of the email are lies .
In point of fact , the habit of choosing non-religious themes for Christmas ornaments was instituted by Laura Bush — probably in an attempt to be inclusive .
So why would anyone circulate such a story ?
It 's not hard to figure out .
It was n't aimed at me .
I was n't the least bit offended when Laura Bush chose non-religious themes , and I would n't be the least bit offended if the White House chose to call those trees " winter solstice trees , " let alone " holiday trees . "
It was aimed at you — the people who might find it offensive .
The writers of these conservative emails do n't have a very high opinion of you .
They think you are stupid enough to get all worked up over a story like this one .
They think you are stupid enough to believe it 's true .
They think you are stupid enough to believe that Snopes verified it , without even bothering to check .
They think you are stupid enough — and unethical enough — to forward it to your friends , thus vouching for the accuracy of something you never bothered to check .
They think your friends are just as stupid .
They have no respect for you at all .
They do n't think you are good people .
They think you are saps they can manipulate for their own purposes .
They 're playing you for suckers .
And , given the introduction to the email , their purposes are pretty clear .
They 're laying the groundwork for you to vote Republican in the next big election .
Which gives you a pretty good idea who " they " are .
It 's really come to that .
But you are n't stupid , any more than you are bad .
You just tend to trust the person you got the email from , who trusted the person who sent it to him or her .
And , because you have been bombarded by lies like these for so long , in emails , on talk radio , and through the Fox cable channel , you have been prepared to believe them .
But do n't .
No one who writes an email like this should be trusted , ever again .
No one who promulgates the kinds of lies that Limbaugh , Beck , and O'Reilly do have your best interests at heart .
You should be a little suspicious of their real motives .
You should ask yourself why they find it necessary to lie , and what their real opinion of you is .
You should be skeptical about everything else they say .
As George Bush once said , " Fool me once , shame on you , fool me twice ... "
Do n't trust them .
Question authority — especially in the form of an anonymous email .
At least , that 's what I think today .
cherrypy webserver benchmark : crash
pygame tests : some crashes , mostly work .
pygame.examples.testsprite : random pauses in the animation .
Tried out unladen swallow on two work loads today .
After the announcement they are going to try and bring it into core .
So I finally got around to trying it ( last time the build failed ) .
An hour or so later , the build finally finished and I could try it out .
The C++ llvm takes ages to compile , which is what took most of the extra time .
What follows is a review of unladen swallow - as it stands today .
The good part ?
Extensions work ( mostly ) !
w00t .
I could compile the C extension pygame , and run things with it .
Now to run code I care about , my work loads - to see if their numbers hold true for me .
The crashes I 've found so far seem to be thread related I guess .
The cherrypy one , and some of the pygame ones both use threads , so I 'm guessing that 's it .
Random pauses for applications is a big FAIL .
Animations fail to work , and user interactions pause or stutter .
Web requests can take longer for unknown reasons etc .
I 'm not sure what causes the pauses , but they be there ( arrrr , pirate noise ) .
LLVM is a big , fast moving dependency written with another language , and a whole other runtime ( C++ ) .
Unladen swallow uses a bundled version of it , since they often need the latest ... and they need the latest fixes to it .
This might make it difficult for OS packagers .
Or LLVM might stabalise soon , and it could be a non-issue .
Depending on C++ is a big issue for some people .
Since some applications and environments can not use C++.
The speed of unladen swallow ?
Slower than normal python for * my * benchmarks .
Well , I could n't benchmark some things because they crash with unladen ... so eh .
I might be able to track these problems down , but I just can't see the benefit so far .
My programs I 've tried do not go faster , so I 'm not going to bother .
Python 3 seems to be 80 % of the speed for IO type programs like web servers ( cherrypy ) ( see benchmarks in my previous post ) .
However unladen - swallow only seems to be 10 - 20 % slower for pygame games , but the random pauses make it unusable .
Python2.x + psyco are way faster still on both these work loads .
20 %-100 % faster than python2.6 alone .
Psyco , and stackless are both still being developed , and both seem to be giving better results than unladen swallow .
Using selective optimisation with tools like shedskin , tinypy C++ , rpython , cython will give you 20 x speedups .
So for many , writing code in a subset of python to get the speedups is worth it .
Other people will be happy to write the 1 % of their program that needs the speed in C .
This is the good thing about unladen swallow ... you should be able to keep using any C/C++/ fortran extensions .
Unladen - swallow has a google reality distortion bubble around it .
They only benchmark programs they care about , and others are ignored .
There are other peoples reports of their programs going slower , or not faster .
However the response seems to be ' that is not our goal ' .
This is fine for them , as they are doing the work , and they want their own work loads to go faster .
However , I 'm not sure if ignoring the rest of the python communities work loads is a good idea if they are considering moving it into trunk .
It 's too early to declare unladen - swallow done , and good imho .
I also think better research needs to go into it before declaring it an overall win at all .
Outside review should be done to see if it actually makes things quicker / better for people .
For my workloads , and for other peoples workloads it is worse .
It also adds dependencies to C++ libraries - which is a nono for some python uses .
Extra dependencies also increase the startup time .
Startup time with unladen swallow is 33 % slower compared to python for me ( time python -c " import time " ) .
Let 's look at one of their benchmarks - html5lib .
See the issue html5 lib no quicker or slower than CPython .
They arranged the benchmark so unladen - swallow is run 10 times , to allow unladen swallow to warm up .
Since Cpython is faster the first time through .
Notice , how jumpy the performance is of unladen on the other runs ?
This might be related to the random pauses unladen swallow has .
I do n't like this style of benchmark which does not account for the first run .
Many times you only want to run code on a set of data once .
When looking at their benchmark numbers , consider how they structure their benchmarks . , rather than believing benchmarks from vendors ..
It takes around two times as much memory just to start the interpreter .
The extra C++ memory management libraries , the extra set of byte code , and then extra machine code for everything has its toll .
Memory usage is very important for servers , and for embedded systems .
It is also important for most other types of programs .
The main bottleneck is not the cpu , but memory , disk , and other IO .
So they are trading better cpu speed ( theoretically ) for worse memory .
However since memory is often the bottleneck - and not the cpu , the runtimes will often be slower for lots of work loads .
It seems python2.6 will still be faster than unladen swallow for many peoples work loads .
If they do not get other peoples programs and workloads working faster , or working at all , it will not be a carrot .
As peoples programs work , and go faster with python2.6/2.7 it will be a stick *.
Unladen swallow has not ( yet ) got to it 's 5 x faster goal , and for many work loads it is still slower or the same speed .
For these reasons , I think it 's too early to think about incorporating unladen swallow into python . * ( ps... ok , that made no sense , sorry .
Sticks and carrots ?!?... donkeys like carrots , but so do ponies .
I do n't think we should hit people with sticks .
Also people do n't like carrots as much as perhaps chocolate or beer .
Perhaps all this time hitting people with sticks and trying to get them to do things with carrots is the problem .
Python 3 has heaps of cool things in it already ... but more cool things always helps !
Beer and chocolate would probably work best . )
And there are those who cannot be taught , because they refuse to learn .
Carico was one of the worst and most obnoxious trolls I ever met , and her ways could have made a saint angry .
I found my post from back then , and I still stand to it today , six years later :
" Her main argument , used again and again , is that Evolution is stupid and only propagated by evil Atheists who want to deny God .
If she had to admit that there were Christians who agree with the Theory of Evolution , she would either have to accuse you of not being a Christian ( which would get her banned again ) or admit that her main point is false .
I have never seen Carico to admit being wrong ... so all she has left is to ignore any post that would refute her points , answer her questions or go against her convictions .
Of course , constantly having the meaningful refutations of her posts ignored galls the other posters , and so a rather large amount of sarcasm and mocking is always part of Carico´s threads .
It seems to be inevitable - and of course these posts are the ones that Carico hooks onto : " Oh , all you have is attacks and slander - that proves you are wrong ! "
Which again infuriates the posters who can point to their well - written posts that do NOT contain attacks and slander .
So what is left ?
I have lost any hope to have a meaningful debate with Carico .
I have tried to ignore her before , but my believe in the good in humanity has turned me around .
I´ll try again .
...
If you don´t change your ways , and understand what communication means , you don´t deserve being answered . "

Holly was beaten so badly , it is feared she has suffered brain damage A vet is warning that a dog owner who beat his pet so badly it could have died must be caught .
Graham Blow treated the terrier cross-breed , named Holly by her carers , at the Bridge Veterinary Surgery in Pontllanfraith , Caerphilly county .
He said the dog had some of the worst injuries he had ever seen , including a broken jaw and three broken ribs .
The attack in Cefn Fforest , Blackwood , was eventually halted by a passer - by .
Police have appealed for information .
Mr Blow said : " When she came to us she had some of the worst injuries I have ever seen in a dog .
" Her lower jaw was shattered , she had three broken ribs , serious concussion , and severe swelling in the left side of her abdomen .
I have every reason to suppose that if this bloke is n't dealt with ... he 'll go on to harm other animals and probably people too
Graham Blow , vet " Dogs , even little dogs , are remarkably tough , so the ferocity which would have been needed to inflict such injuries on her is terrifying .
" Someone with that level of anger needs to be caught because the same attack on a human could easily , even probably , have killed them .
" Bones will heal in time , but with the internal injuries she 'd suffered , we were n't sure if we could save her , and even if we could , whether it would have been the kindest thing to do . "
But he said the swelling stabilised and she began to turn the corner , and he was now hopeful Holly would make a full recovery , " physically if not mentally " .
The attack took place at about 1500 GMT on 30 November .
It was witnessed by a member of the public who tried to intervene .
' Dangerous person '
He was verbally and physically threatened but thanks to his persistence , the attacker eventually threw down Holly 's lead and ran off .
The witness described the attacker as about 6ft 3in ( 1.9 m ) , slim to average build , in his twenties , with fair , light brown or dark blond hair .
He had a local accent .
Holly was released by vets this week , and is now being cared for by a foster family found through the Caerphilly council dog warden .
Mr Blow fears they may have difficulty re-homing her .
" She is extremely wary around men , and it 's possible that she 's suffered some brain damage , as she can be totally non-responsive for minutes or hours at a time , " he said .
" There 's certainly physical evidence that this was n't the first beating which Holly had suffered , so I have every reason to suppose that if this bloke is n't dealt with , in whatever way , he 'll go on to harm other animals and probably people too . "
Gwent Police said they would like to speak to anyone who may be able to identify the owner .
A spokesperson said : " We understand that people may be afraid to identify this dangerous person , but they can provide us with any information they may have anonymously through the 101 non-emergency police line , or via Crimestoppers on 0800 555111 . "

With the closed beta coming to an end and the open beta starting tomorrow , Star Trek Online is finally getting into the hands of Trek fans everywhere .
In anticipation of the launch , ZAM has just released a preview of ST : O's away mission mode .
We 'll be participating in the open beta and look forward to seeing our faithful readers in the world of 2409 !
Players will begin STO 's tutorial and " starting zone " area in avatar mode .
The first 20 minutes of the beta-version tutorial is your standard fare ; acclimating players to universal mechanics like movement , interaction , UI functions and combat ( and of course , the game 's own specific " brand " of these mechanics , some of which greatly differ from other titles ) .
STO 's avatar mode " feels " remarkably familiar to Champions Online 's gameplay — which should n't come as a surprise to many players , since both games were developed by Cryptic Studios .
In fact , based on our initial impressions of its graphics and gameplay , we would hazard to guess that STO 's avatar mode was developed using the same engine as Champions Online ( or many elements of it , at least ) .
The settings offered in the video menu are nearly identical , and the third - person character interaction feels noticeably similar .
However , that 's not to imply anything negative about STO 's third - person gameplay .
Aside from the opinion shared by some players that Cryptic 's latest graphics engine could have been optimized a little better ( its " scalability " on lower - end systems , that is ) , the client offers a solid third - person gameplay experience with impressive visual and shading effects .
Cryptic succeeded in re-creating the classic interior design of spaceship hallways and corridors that ' Trek fans have come to know and love throughout the years , while supplementing the environment with its own artistic vision of futuristic motifs and décor .

I listen to music on two computers : one at work , one at home .
Both run Linux and ssh , but neither is listening on an internet - accessible IP .
Furthermore , syncing a lot of music across the internet would suck up bandwidth that my coworkers might not appreciate being sucked up .
I often add new music to my collection at home , but I also sometimes rename or otherwise re-organize old music , and I would like all of those changes to be easily transferred to work .
The solution I 've found is rdiffdir , which is part of duplicity .
The man page describes how to use it pretty well , if a bit tersely :
rdiffdir [ options ] sig[ nature ] basis_dir signature_file rdiffdir [ options ] delta signature_file new_dir delta_file rdiffdir [ options ] patch basis_dir delta_file
So to copy my music collection changes from home to work , I would do the following :
1. Create a " signature " of the out - of - date directory at work .
This generates a fairly large file — about 200MB for my music collection and not really compressible at all — but it 's still much smaller than the actual directory contents .
work $ rdiffdir signature ~/ Music music.sig
2 . Bring the signature file home on a flash drive , and run the delta command .
This will compare the signature with the contents of the up - to - date directory , and put all of the required changes into a delta file , which will be quite large .
home $ rdiffdir delta music.sig ~/ Music music.delta
3 . Put the delta file onto the flash drive and take it back to work .
If it 's too large , you can split it up into multiple chunks of a given size :
home $ split -b 7G music .
delta
This creates files named xaa , xab , xac , etc. , which you can then join back together with cat :
work $ cat xaa xab > music.delta
4 . Now use the patch command to apply the delta to the out - of - date directory , updating its contents .
work $ rdiffdir patch ~/ Music music.
delta
All done !

Your imagination has been captured by the roaring rockets from Heinlein 's SPACE CADET or the Polaris from TOM CORBETT , SPACE CADET .
But are such rockets possible ?
How does one go about defining the performance of these atomic - powered cruisers ?
This document gives some hints and equations that will allow back - of - the - envelope calculations on such matters .
Though horribly simplistic , they are far better than just making up your figures .
This site was mainly intended for science fiction authors who wanted a little scientific accuracy so they can write SF " the way God and Heinlein intended " ( Arlan Andrews 's Law ) .
The technical term is Hard Science Fiction .
But anybody who is interested can play with the toys contained within , designing their own Planet Rangers Rocketships .
It is assumed that the reader has enough knowledge to know the difference between a star and a planet , high school mathematics , and enough skill to use a pocket calculator .
Computer spreadsheet and computer programming skills are a plus , spreadsheets in particular will make your life much easier .
The engine and the torchship pages explain how easily do some of the calculations using Nomograms .
The nomograms can be downloaded from those pages , or printed versions can be purchased from .
There is also a poster of the Atomic Rocket Cruiser Polaris .
Not to mention official Atomic Rockets coffee mugs and blank journals .
While this site originally focused on rocketry equations , as you can see it has grown to encompass other topics of interest to science fiction authors and game designers .
Things like galactic empires and interstellar trade .
This site started out as a small sheet of equations I wrote in 1997 .
You may find it amusing , abet very dated .

* Armani , Ralph Lauren , Oscar de la Renta will not give up
* Successor of any fashion house ’s founder will struggle
PARIS / MILAN , Dec 15 ( Reuters ) - Italian designer Giorgio Armani , who turned 75 in July , may be the pride of Italian fashion and a godfather of the industry but he is not immortal .
After suffering a bout of hepatitis , Armani says he is back in action but he looks thinner and frailer than before in spite of his permanent tan , raising the question ever more urgently of who will succeed him .
Armani will not divulge who could possibly take up the reins of his empire worth $ 2.4 billion in annual sales , only saying he is grooming a chosen few .
Insiders predict he will keep everybody guessing until the last minute .
But if mystery around his succession is understandable for commercial reasons , it is also a powerful reminder of how taxing and emotional it is to replace the founder and creative soul of a fashion house , particularly while he is still alive .
" Succession is an emotionally charged thing , especially when you talk about people like Armani who own the business , " Burberry 's BRBY .L Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey told Reuters last month .
The history of fashion is littered with examples of traumatic experiences and designers ousted after a short - lived attempt at filling the founder ’s shoes .
Tom Ford openly admitted Yves Saint Laurent made his life a misery when he took over as chief designer of the French fashion house in 1999 .
The founder of the fashion house was not supportive Ford ’s work and complained he did not respect the brand ’s heritage .
Today , the website of the Yves Saint Laurent maison does not even mention Ford in its corporate history section even though he worked there for four years .
Timing also plays a crucial role when planning a transition .
Fashion experts say Valentino Garavani left his company too soon after it was bought by private equity firm Permira in 2007 .
Unsurprisingly for many observers , Valentino was critical of his replacement Alessandra Facchinetti who lasted less than a year and left “ embittered ” .
STRIKING THE RIGHT TONE
Emanuel Ungaro has been through several stylists since the eponymous designer retired in 2004 -- critics say it is still struggling to strike the right tone , even though the company argues it is heading in the right direction .
Lars Nilsson , who replaced Gianfranco Ferre --
Dior ’s former designer -- after his death in 2007 , lasted five months at Ferre and was given the boot just days before one of its shows .
" Few people are able to let go ... Sometimes , it is just out of vanity , " said Jean - Jacques Picart , fashion adviser to Bernard Arnault , head of the world 's biggest luxury group LVMH LVMH .
PA , referring to long - standing founding designers .
The passing of the artistic torch is one of the most discussed subjects in the fashion world as it can make or break the survival of the brand -- but no fashion house is willing to talk about it officially .
Aside from Armani , the clock is ticking for a number of other fashion companies headed by 70 - something designers including Ralph Lauren and Oscar de la Renta in the United States and Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel in France .
The question will also eventually pose itself for Donatella Versace and Miuccia Prada .
KEEPING MUM
Oscar de la Renta , whose founding designer is 77 , did not respond to emailed requests for comments and the team behind Ralph Lauren , aged 70 , also did not answer phone calls or emails about his succession .
Likewise , Chanel refused to be drawn on the subject .
“ Karl Lagerfeld is the creative director of Chanel and enjoys a long - term contract which is absolutely not put into question , ” the fashion house told Reuters in an e-mailed statement .
“ His succession is not on the agenda . ”
German - born Lagerfeld , 71 , has successfully kept Chanel ’s two - tone flat shoes , camelia brooches and woollen suits as luxury must - haves since 1983 while consistently refreshing the brand .
“ Karl is not ready to pass on the torch , ” said Picart .
However , other people close to the maison say it is inconceivable that Chanel is not thinking about his succession .
Most fashion houses have several candidates in mind for the day when their top designer leaves but they keep the name secret to prevent their potential new recruit from being poached .
“ King Giorgio ” as he is called in his home country , Armani might not have said who will replace him but he has delegated more responsibility to non-family members .
He expanded the board with a new deputy chairman and appointed a finance director and general manager .
“ Of course I am not eternal , there comes a time when you must hand it over , ” Armani told reporters in October in Moscow , where he staged two fashion shows .
Fashion veterans say founders often struggle to find a person good enough to replace them .
“ He ’s ( Armani ) not the classic designer who wants to stay in the creative part and delegates the rest to managers , ” said Roberto Jorio Fili , a former executive at fashion houses Roberto Cavalli , Valentino and Gianfranco Ferre .
“ Armani is the business .
Not one person can replace him on their own , it would have to be several people and I think that ’s what he ’s probably thinking . ”
Paris , le 27 janvier 2010 – L’examen soudainement précipité de la loi LOPPSI donnera l’occasion à Brice Hortefeux d’imposer la censure des contenus sur Internet .
Au nom de la lutte légitime contre la pédopornographie contre laquelle il est démontré qu’il est parfaitement inefficace , ce dispositif ouvre la porte à de dangereuses dérives anti-démocratiques .
À l’heure où les industries du divertissement pro-HADOPI réclament le filtrage du Net que Sarkozy leur a promis , nous devons refuser cette instrumentalisation de la peur et de la protection de l’enfance !
Non à la censure du Net !
Grâce à la loi LOPPSI , le gouvernement pourrait désormais choisir une « liste noire » de sites qui seront rendus inaccessibles par les fournisseurs d’accès français à leurs clients .
Bien entendu , on nous assure qu’il s’agit uniquement de censurer les sites pédopornographiques , afin de protéger les enfants et les citoyens qui tomberaient « par hasard » sur de tels sites .
Or , l’étude d’impact fournie par le gouvernement s’avère parfaitement incapable de prouver l’efficacité de ce dispositif .
Le gouvernement allemand vient d’ailleurs de reculer après avoir un temps envisagé des mesures similaires .
Et pour cause : le filtrage des sites ne peut en aucun cas empêcher la diffusion de contenus pédopornographiques et leur commerce .
Le seul moyen efficace consiste à retirer les contenus à la source , c’est - à- dire des serveurs où ils sont hébergés , et d’arrêter les individus qui les produisent ou les distribuent .
Pour cela des dispositifs de coopération internationale existent .
Encore faudrait - il avoir la volonté politique et se donner les moyens de les renforcer !
En revanche , une fois mis en place , un tel dispositif de censure du Net pourra à loisir être étendu à d’autres contenus .
C’est d’ailleurs le président Sarkozy lui- même qui dans ses vœux l’a promis aux industries du divertissement .
« Impossible de croire Brice Hortefeux quand il explique que la censure du Net ne concernera que les contenus pédopornographiques , sachant que les industries du divertissement pro-HADOPI , proches du pouvoir , la demandent également au niveau mondial pour mieux faire la guerre à leurs clients .
D’ailleurs Nicolas Sarkozy a lui même parlé de filtrer « les sites pédo- pornographiques et illégaux » ce qui prouve bien son intention .
» affirme Jérémie Zimmermann , porte - parole de l’initiative citoyenne La Quadrature du Net .
La Quadrature du
Net appelle les députés et sénateurs saisis de la loi LOPPSI à refuser l’instrumentalisation de la peur , et à promouvoir des moyens efficaces de combattre la pédopornographie plutôt que d’accepter la mise en place d’une intolérable censure gouvernementale du Net .
« L’accès au
Net est aujourd ’hui indispensable à la participation à la vie démocratique , ainsi qu’à l’expression des idées et des opinions .
Il ne saurait sous aucun prétexte être restreint par le gouvernement , sous peine de porter atteinte aux valeurs les plus fondamentales de notre démocratie .
» conclut Zimmermann .
Hi ,
Have you ever heard about typelists in C++ ?
That just consists in using the functional way of defining lists , but with templates .
It looks like that :
template < typename Head , typename Tail > struct TypeList { typedef Head head ; typedef Tail tail ; } ;
However , we ’ll need a type representing an empty type list .
Ours will be the following .
struct EmptyList { } ;
How to write metafunctions ( compile - time functions , working over types and not values — actually , the types are in this context like “ values ” ) for these type lists now ?
Let ’s start with a metafunction computing the length of a type list :
// declaration template < typename Typelist > struct Length ; // the normal case : the head element of the list ( it 's a type ) , and the tail , which is itself a type list template < typename H , typename T > struct Length < TypeList < H , T > > { static const int value = 1 + Length <T>:: value ; } ; // the terminal case : our typelist is the empty list , we 're at the end of the list , so we wo n't add 1 neither we will go on with the recursion template <> struct Length < EmptyList > { static const int value =
0 ; } ;
Now , calling it on a given typelist will return us the good result :
Length < TypeList<int , TypeList< char , TypeList < bool , EmptyList > > > >:: value // equals 3
Do you want more ?
I guess you do , of course .
Let ’s tackle a more complicated one : Map .
It maps a type list to another one , computing the result of the application of a metafunction on each type of the type list .
Ok , let ’s start with the declaration .
template < typename TL , template < typename > class Func > struct Map ;
Now , the basical case , with a head element and the tail , will consist in computing the result of the application of the metafunction of the head element , and appending to it the result of Map on the tail .
Looks like that :
template < typename H , typename T , template < typename > class Func > struct Map < TypeList<H , T > , Func > { typedef TypeList < typename Func<H >:: type , typename Map<T , Func > :: type > type ; } ;
And the trivial case , on the empty list :
template < template < typename > class Func > struct Map < EmptyList , Func > { typedef EmptyList type ; } ;
And we ’re done with Map !
Let ’s see one more interesting function over type lists : Filter .
It ’ll filter ( really ?! ) the type list according to a compile - time predicate , and return the original type list without the types that did n’t match the predicate .
Here we go !
template < typename TypeList , template < typename > class Pred > struct Filter ; template < typename H , typename T , template < typename > class Pred , bool result > struct FilterAux { typedef typename Filter <T , Pred >:: type type ; } ; template < typename H , typename T , template < typename > class Pred > struct FilterAux <H , T , Pred , true > { typedef TypeList < H , typename Filter <T , Pred > : : type > type ; } ; template < typename H , typename T , template < typename > class Pred > struct Filter < TypeList<H , T > , Pred > { typedef typename FilterAux <H , T , Pred , Pred < H >:: value >:: type type ; } ; template < template < typename > class Pred > struct Filter < EmptyList , Pred > { typedef EmptyList type ; } ;
This one was trickier , because we needed an auxiliary template structure to have a bool against which we could specialize , to either go on without keeping the type in the type list ( in case it does n’t match the predicate ) or keeping it .
Now , I ’ll leave as exercise the following functions :
– Repeat : takes a type , a number , and returns a type list containing n times the given type
– Take : takes a type list and a number , and returns a type list contaning the first n elements of the typelist if possible , less otherwise .
– Interleave : it takes 2 two lists , say l1 = [ T1 , T2 , T3 ] and l2 = [ U1 , U2 , U3 ] and returns the list [ T1 , U1 , T2 , U2 , T3 , U3 ]
– Zip : takes two lists and returns a list of component - wise pairs of the types
– ZipWith : takes two lists and a function itself taking two types and returning a type , and returns a list compound of the component - wise application of the given function on both lists simultaneously
I ’ll try to post these during the upcoming days .
Good functional metaprogramming to all 😉

Yahoo today announced it will fully intergrate with Facebook Connect in the first half of 2010 .
Yahoo users will be able to log into Yahoo products -- from Flickr to Yahoo !
Finance -- using their Facebook accounts .
They will also be able to update and check their Facebook News feed from Yahoo .
We love this move !
For years , Yahoo's tried to build services to rival the likes of Facebook and Twitter .
We always wondered :
Why go through that pain when it can just tap into Facebook 's API and bring Facebook to Yahoo users for free ?
The service Yahoo performs for its users is n't building them poor copies of all the great stuff on the Internet , but , time and again , pointing out the great stuff on the Internet .
For Yahoo to survive , Yahoo.com has to consistently be the place Yahoo users find the best products and services on the Internet , whether Yahoo built them or not .
We 're greedy .
Next , we want Yahoo to fully integrate Twitter and then maybe work out syndication deals with Hulu and Pandora .
Here 's the full release :
Continuing its commitment to be the center of people 's online lives , Yahoo !

The integration is expected to begin in the first half of 2010 .
A talk to the incoming international students at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism , August 11 , 2009
Five years ago one of your deans at the journalism school , Elizabeth Fishman , asked me if I would be interested in tutoring international students who might need some extra help with their writing .
She knew I had done a lot of traveling in Asia and Africa and other parts of the world where many of you come from .
I knew I would enjoy that , and I have — I ’ve been doing it ever since .
I ’m the doctor that students get sent to see if they have a writing problem that their professor thinks I can fix .
As a bonus , I ’ve made many friends — from Uganda , Uzbekhistan , India , Ethiopia , Thailand , Iraq , Nigeria , Poland , China , Colombia and many other countries .
Several young Asian women , when they went back home , sent me invitations to their weddings .
I never made it to Bhutan or Korea , but I did see the wedding pictures .
Such beautiful brides !
I can’t imagine how hard it must be to learn to write comfortably in a second — or third or fourth — language .
I do n’t think I could do it , and I admire your grace in taking on that difficult task .
Much of the anxiety that I see in foreign students could be avoided if certain principles of writing good English — which nobody ever told them — were explained in advance .
So I asked if I could talk to all of you during orientation week and tell you some of the things my students have found helpful .
So that ’s why we ’re here today .
I ’ll start with a question :
What is good writing ?
It depends on what country you ’re from .
We all know what ’s considered “ good writing ” in our own country .
We grow up immersed in the cadences and sentence structure of the language we were born into , so we think , “ That ’s probably what every country considers good writing ; they just use different words . ”
If only !
I once asked a student from Cairo , “ What kind of language is Arabic ? ” I was trying to put myself into her mental process of switching from Arabic to English .
She said , “ It ’s all adjectives . ”
Well , of course it ’s not all adjectives , but I knew what she meant : it ’s decorative , it ’s ornate , it ’s intentionally pleasing .
Another Egyptian student , when I asked him about Arabic , said , “ It ’s all proverbs .
We talk in proverbs .
People say things like ‘ What you are seeking is also seeking you . ’”
He also told me that Arabic is full of courtesy and deference , some of which is rooted in fear of the government .
“ You never know who ’s listening , ” he said , so it does n’t hurt to be polite .
That ’s when I realized that when foreign students come to me with a linguistic problem it may also be a cultural or a political problem .
Now I think it ’s lovely that such a decorative language as Arabic exists .
I wish I could walk around New York and hear people talking in proverbs .
But all those adjectives and all that decoration would be the ruin of any journalist trying to write good English .
No proverbs , please .
Spanish also comes with a heavy load of beautiful baggage that will smother any journalist writing in English .
The Spanish language is a national treasure , justly prized by Spanish - speaking people .
But what makes it a national treasure is its long sentences and melodious long nouns that express a general idea .
Those nouns are rich in feeling , but they have no action in them — no people doing something we can picture .
My Spanish - speaking students must be given the bad news that those long sentences will have to be cruelly chopped up into short sentences with short nouns and short active verbs that drive the story forward .
What ’s considered “ good writing ” in Spanish is not “ good writing ” in English .
So what is good English — the language we ’re here today to wrestle with ?
It ’s not as musical as Spanish , or Italian , or French , or as ornamental as Arabic , or as vibrant as some of your native languages .
But I ’m hopelessly in love with English because it ’s plain and it ’s strong .
It has a huge vocabulary of words that have precise shades of meaning ; there ’s no subject , however technical or complex , that ca n’t be made clear to any reader in good English — if it ’s used right .
Unfortunately , there are many ways of using it wrong .
Those are the damaging habits I want to warn you about today .
First , a little history .
The English language is derived from two main sources .
One is Latin , the florid language of ancient Rome .
The other is Anglo - Saxon , the plain languages of England and northern Europe .
The words derived from Latin are the enemy — they will strangle and suffocate everything you write .
The Anglo - Saxon words will set you free .
How do those Latin words do their strangling and suffocating ?
In general they are long , pompous nouns that end in –ion — like implementation and maximization and communication ( five syllables long ! ) — or that end in –ent — like development and fulfillment .
Those nouns express a vague concept or an abstract idea , not a specific action that we can picture — somebody doing something .
Here ’s a typical sentence : “ Prior to the implementation of the financial enhancement . ”
That means “ Before we fixed our money problems . ”
Believe it or not , this is the language that people in authority in America routinely use — officials in government and business and education and social work and health care .
They think those long Latin words make them sound important .
It no longer rains in America ; your TV weatherman will tell that you we ’re experiencing a precipitation probability situation .
I ’m sure all of you , newly arrived in America , have already been driven crazy trying to figure out the instructions for ordering a cell phone or connecting your computer , or applying for a bank loan or a health insurance policy , and you assume that those of us who were born here can understand this stuff .
I assure you that we do n’t understand it either .
I often receive some totally unintelligible letter from the telephone company or the cable company or the bank .
I try to piece it out like a hieroglyphic , and I ask my wife , “ Can you make any sense of this ? ”
She says , “ I have no idea what it means . ”
Those long Latin usages have so infected everyday language in America that you might well think , “ If that ’s how people write who are running the country , that ’s how I ’m supposed to write . ”
It ’s not .
Let me read you three typical letters I recently received in the mail .
( I keep letters like this and save them in a folder that I call “ Bullshit File . ” )
The first one is from the president of a private club in New York .
It says , “ Dear member :
The board of governors has spent the past year considering proactive efforts that will continue to professionalize the club and to introduce efficiencies that we will be implementing throughout 2009 . ”
That means they ’re going to try to make the club run better .
Here ’s a letter to alumni from the head of the New England boarding school I attended when I was a boy .
“ As I walk around the Academy , ” she writes , “ and see so many gifted students interacting with accomplished , dedicated adults ” [ that means boys and girls talking to teachers ] and consider the opportunities for learning that such interpersonal exchanges will yield … ” Interpersonal exchanges !
Pure garbage .
Her letter is meant to assure us alumni that the school is in good hands .
I ’m not assured .
One thing I know is that she should n’t be allowed near the English department , and I ’m not sure she should even be running the school .
Remember : how you write is how you define yourself to people who meet you only through your writing .
If your writing is pretentious , that ’s how you ’ll be perceived .
The reader has no choice .
Here ’s one more — a letter from the man who used to be my broker ; now he ’s my investment counsel .
He says , “ As we previously communicated , we completed a systems conversion in late September .
Data conversions involve extra processing and reconciliation steps [ translation : it took longer than we thought it would to make our office operate better ] .
We apologize if you were inconvenienced as we completed the verification process [ we hope we ’ve got it right now ] .
“ Further enhancements will be introduced in the next calendar quarter ” [ we ’re still working on it ] .
Notice those horrible long Latin words : communicated , conversion , reconciliation , enhancements , verification .
There ’s not a living person in any one of them .
Well , I think you get the point about bad nouns .
( Do n’t worry — in a minute I ’ll tell you about good nouns . )
I bring this up today because most of you will soon be assigned to a beat in one of New York ’s neighborhoods .
Our city has been greatly enriched in recent years by immigrants from every corner of the world , but their arrival has also brought a multitude of complex urban problems .
You ’ll be interviewing the men and women who are trying to solve those problems — school principals , social workers , health - care workers , hospital officials , criminal justice officials , union officials , church officials , police officers , judges , clerks in city and state agencies — and when you ask them a question , they will answer you in nouns : Latin noun clusters that are the working vocabulary of their field .
They ’ll talk about “ facilitation intervention ” and “ affordable housing ” and “ minimum - density zoning , ” and you will dutifully copy those phrases down and write a sentence that says : “ A major immigrant concern is the affordable housing situation . ”
But I ca n’t picture the affordable housing situation .
Who exactly are those immigrants ?
Where do they live ?
What kind of housing is affordable ?
To whom ?
As readers , we want to be able to picture specific people like ourselves , in a specific part of the city , doing things we might also do .
We want a sentence that says something like “ New Dominican families on Tremont Avenue in the Bronx ca n’t pay the rent that landlords ask . ”
I can picture that ; we ’ve all had trouble paying the landlord .
So if those are the bad nouns , what are the good nouns ?
The good nouns are the thousands of short , simple , infinitely old Anglo - Saxon nouns that express the fundamentals of everyday life : house , home , child , chair , bread , milk , sea , sky , earth , field , grass , road … words that are in our bones , words that resonate with the oldest truths .
When you use those words , you make contact — consciously and also subconsciously — with the deepest emotions and memories of your readers .
Do n’t try to find a noun that you think sounds more impressive or “ literary . ”
Short Anglo - Saxon nouns are your second - best tools as a journalist writing in English .
What are your best tools ?
Your best tools are short , plain Anglo - Saxon verbs .
I mean active verbs , not passive verbs .
If you could write an article using only active verbs , your article would automatically have clarity and warmth and vigor .
Let ’s go back to school for a minute and make sure you remember the difference between an active verb and a passive verb .
An active verb denotes one specific action : JOHN SAW THE BOYS .
The event only happened once , and we always know who did what : it was John who activated the verb SAW .
A passive - voice sentence would say : THE BOYS WERE SEEN BY JOHN .
It ’s longer .
It ’s weaker : it takes three words ( WERE SEEN BY instead of SAW ) , and it ’s not as exact .
How often were the boys seen by John ?
Every day ?
Once a week ?
Active verbs give momentum to a sentence and push it forward .
If I had put that last sentence in the passive — “ momentum is given to a sentence by active verbs and the sentence is pushed forward by them ” — there is no momentum , no push .
One of my favorite writers is Henry David Thoreau , who wrote one of the great American books , Walden , in 1854 , about the two years he spent living — and thinking — in the woods near Concord , Massachusetts .
Thoreau ’s writing moves with simple strength because he uses one active verb after another to push his meaning along .
At every point in his sentences you know what you need to know .
Here ’s a famous sentence from Walden :
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately , to front only the essential facts of nature , and see if I could not learn what it had to teach , and not , when I came to die , discover that I had not lived .
Look at all those wonderful short , active verbs : went , wished , front , see , learn , die , discover .
We understand exactly what Thoreau is saying .
We also know a lot about him — about his curiosity and his vitality .
How alive Thoreau is in that sentence !
It ’s an autobiography in 44 words — 39 of which are words of one syllable .
Think about that : only five words in that long , elegant sentence have more than one syllable .
Short is always better than long .
Now let me turn that sentence into the passive :
A decision was made to go to the woods because of a desire for a deliberate existence and for exposure to only the essential facts of life , and for possible instruction in its educational elements , and because of a concern that at the time of my death the absence of a meaningful prior experience would be apprehended .
All the life has been taken out of the sentence .
But what ’s the biggest thing I ’ve taken out of that sentence ?
I ’ve taken Thoreau out of that sentence .
He ’s nowhere to be seen .
I ’ve done it just by turning all the active verbs into passive verbs .
Every time I replaced one of Thoreau ’s active verbs with a passive verb I also had to add a noun to make the passive verb work .
“ I went to the woods because ” became “ A decision was made . ” I had to add the noun decision .
“ To see if I could learn what it had to teach — two terrific verbs , learn and teach ; we ’ve all learned and we ’ve all been taught — became “ for possible instruction . ”
Can you hear how dead those Latin nouns are that end in i-o - n? Decision .
Instruction .
They have no people in them doing something .
So fall in love with active verbs .
They are your best friends .
I have four principles of writing good English .
They are Clarity , Simplicity , Brevity , and Humanity .
First , Clarity .
If it ’s not clear you might as well not write it .
You might as well stay in bed .
Two : Simplicity .
Simple is good .
Most students from other countries do n’t know that .
When I read them a sentence that I admire , a simple sentence with short words , they think I ’m joking .
“ Oh , Mr. Zinsser , you ’re so funny , ” a bright young woman from Nigeria told me .
“ If I wrote sentences like that , people would think I ’m stupid . ” Stupid like Thoreau , I want to say .
Or stupid like E. B. White .
Or like the King James Bible .
Listen to this passage from the book of Ecclesiastes :
I returned and saw under the sun , that the race is not to the swift , nor the battle to the strong , neither yet bread to the wise , nor yet riches to men of understanding , nor yet favor to men of skill , but time and chance happeneth to them all .
[ Look at all those wonderful plain nouns : race , battle , bread , riches , favor , time , chance . ]
Or stupid like Abraham Lincoln , whom I consider our greatest American writer .
Here ’s Lincoln addressing the nation in his Second Inaugural Address as president , in 1865 , at the end of the long , terrible , exhausting Civil War :
With malice toward none , with charity for all , with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right [ eleven straight one - syllable words ] , let us strive on [ active verb ] to finish the work we are in , to bind up [ active verb ] the nation ’s wounds , to care [ active verb ] for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan [ specific nouns ] , — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations .
Here ’s another American President , Barack Obama , also a wonderful writer , who modeled his own style on Lincoln ’s .
In his memoir , Dreams from My Father .
a beautifully written book , Obama recalls how , as a boy ,
At night , lying in bed , I would let the slogans drift away , to be replaced with a series of images , romantic images , of a past I had never known .
They were of the civil rights movement , mostly , the grainy black - and - white footage that appears every February during Black History Month .
. . .
A pair of college students . . . placing their orders at a lunch counter teetering on the edge of riot .
. . .
A county jail bursting with children , their hands clasped together , singing freedom songs .
Such images became a form of prayer for me [ beautiful phrase ] , bolstering my spirits , channeling my emotions in a way that words never could .
They told me [ active verb ] . . . that I was n’t alone in my particular struggles , and that communities . . . had to be created , fought for , tended like gardens [ specific detail ] .
They expanded or contracted [ active verbs ] with the dreams of men .
. . .
In the sit-ins , the marches , the jailhouse songs [ specific detail ] , I saw [ active verb ] the African - American community becoming more than just the place where you ’d been born or the house where you ’d been raised [ simple nouns : place , house ] .
. . .
Because this community I imagined was still in the making , built on the promise that the larger American community , black , white , and brown , could somehow redefine itself — I believed [ active verb ] that it might , over time , admit the uniqueness of my own life .
So remember : Simple is good .
Writing is not something you have to embroider with fancy stitches to make yourself look smart .
Principle number 3 . Brevity .
Short is always better than long .
Short sentences are better than long sentences .
Short words are better than long words .
Do n’t say currently if you can say now .
Do n’t say assistance if you can say help .
Do n’t say numerous if you can say many .
Do n’t say facilitate if you can say ease .
Do n’t call someone an individual [ five syllables ! ] ; that ’s a person , or a man or a woman .
Do n’t implement or prioritize .
Do n’t say anything in writing that you would n’t comfortably say in conversation .
Writing is talking to someone else on paper or on a screen .
Which brings me to my fourth principle : Humanity .
Be yourself .
Never try in your writing to be someone you ’re not .
Your product , finally , is you .
Do n’t lose that person by putting on airs , trying to sound superior .
There are many modern journalists I admire for their strong , simple style , whom I could recommend to you as models .
Two who come to mind are Gay Talese and Joan Didion .
Here ’s a passage by Talese , from his book of collected magazine pieces , The Gay Talese Reader , about the great Yankee baseball star , Joe DiMaggio , who at one point was married to Marilyn Monroe :
Joe DiMaggio lives with his widowed sister , Marie , in a tan stone house on a quiet residential street near Fisherman ’s Wharf .
He bought the house almost thirty years ago for his parents , and after their death he lived there with Marilyn Monroe .
. . .
There are some baseball trophies and plaques in a small room off DiMaggio ’s bedroom , and on his dresser are photographs of Marilyn Monroe , and in the living room downstairs is a small painting of her that DiMaggio likes very much [ how nice that sentence is — how simple and direct ] :
It reveals only her face and shoulders , and she is wearing a very wide - brimmed sun hat , and there is a soft sweet smile on her lips , an innocent curiosity about her that is the way he saw her and the way he wanted her to be seen by others .
[ Notice all those one - syllable words : “ the way he saw her and the way he wanted her to be seen . ”
The sentence is absolutely clean — there ’s not one word in it that ’s not necessary and not one extra word .
Get rid of every element in your writing that ’s not doing useful work .
It ’s all clutter . ]
And here ’s Joan Didion , who grew up in California and wrote brilliant magazine pieces about its trashy lifestyle in the 1960s .
No anthropologist caught it better .
This passage is from her collection of early magazine pieces , Slouching Toward Bethlehem .
There are always little girls around rock groups — the same little girls who used to hang around saxophone players , girls who lived on the celebrity and power and sex a band projects when it plays — and there are three of them out here this afternoon in Sausalito where the Grateful Dead rehearse .
They are all pretty and two of them still have baby fat and one of them dances by herself with her eyes closed [ perfect simple image ] .
. . .
Somebody said that if I was going to meet some runaways I better pick up some hamburgers and Cokes on the way , so I did , and we are eating them in the Park together , me , Debbie who is fifteen , and Jeff who is sixteen .
Debbie and Jeff ran away twelve days ago , walked out of school with $ 100 between them [ active verbs : ran away , walked out of school ] .
. . .
Debbie is buffing her fingernails with the belt to her suède jacket .
She is annoyed because she chipped a nail and because I do not have any polish remover in the car .
I promise to get her to a friend ’s apartment so that she can redo her manicure , but something has been bothering me and as I fiddle with the ignition I finally ask it .
I ask them to think back to when they were children , to tell me what they had wanted to be when they were grown up , how they had seen the future then .
Jeff throws a Coca - Cola bottle out the car window .
“ I ca n’t remember I ever thought about it , ” he says .
“ I remember I wanted to be a veterinarian once , ” Debbie says .
“ But now I ’m more or less working in the vein of being an artist or a model or a cosmetologist .
Or something . ”
Here ’s the first paragraph of an article of mine that originally ran in The New Yorker .
( It ’s now in my book Mitchell & Ruff . )
Jazz came to China for the first time on the afternoon of June 2 , 1981 , when the American bassist and French - horn player Willie Ruff introduced himself and his partner , the pianist Dwike Mitchell , to several hundred students and professors who were crowded into a large room at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music .
The students and the professors were all expectant , without quite knowing what to expect .
They only knew that they were about to hear the first American jazz concert ever presented to the Chinese .
Probably they were not surprised to find that the two musicians were black , though black Americans are a rarity in the People ’s Republic .
What they undoubtedly did n’t expect was that Ruff would talk to them in Chinese , and when he began they murmured with delight .
Five plain declarative sentences that get the story started at full speed — WHAP !
You ’re right in that room at the Shanghai Conservatory on that June afternoon in 1981 .
I ’ve given you these examples because writing is learned by imitation .
We all need models .
Bach needed a model ; Picasso needed a model .
Make a point of reading writers who are doing the kind of writing you want to do .
( Many of them write for The New Yorker . )
Study their articles clinically .
Try to figure out how they put their words and sentences together .
That ’s how I learned to write , not from a writing course .
Two final thoughts .
Some of you , hearing me talk to you so urgently about the need to write plain English , perhaps found yourself thinking : “ That ’s so yesterday .
Journalism has gone digital , and I ’ve come to Columbia to learn the new electronic media .
I no longer need to write well . ”
I think you need to write even more clearly and simply for the new media than for the old media .
You ’ll be making and editing videos and photographs and audio recordings to accompany your articles .
Somebody — that ’s you — will still have to write all those video scripts and audio scripts , and your writing will need to be lean and tight and coherent : plain nouns and verbs pushing your story forward so that the rest of us always know what ’s happening .
This principle applies — and will apply — to every digital format ; nobody wants to consult a Web site that is n’t instantly clear .
Clarity , brevity , and sequential order will be crucial to your success .
I emphasize this because the biggest problem that paralyzes students is not how to write ; it ’s how to organize what they are writing .
They go out on a story , and they gather a million notes and a million quotes , and when they come back they have no idea what the story is about — what is its proper narrative shape ?
Their first paragraph contains facts that should be on page five ; facts are on page five that should be in the first paragraph .
The stories exist nowhere in time or space ; the people could be in Brooklyn or Bogotá .
The epidemic I ’m most worried about is n’t swine flu .
It ’s the death of logical thinking .
The cause , I assume , is that most people now get their information from random images on a screen — pop-ups , windows , and sidebars — or from scraps of talk on a digital phone .
But writing is linear and sequential ; Sentence B must follow Sentence A , and Sentence C must follow Sentence B , and eventually you get to Sentence Z .
The hard part of writing is n’t the writing ; it ’s the thinking .
You can solve most of your writing problems if you stop after every sentence and ask :
What does the reader need to know next ? ”
One maxim that my students find helpful is :
One thought per sentence .
Readers only process one thought at a time .
So give them time to digest the first set of facts you want them to know .
Then give them the next piece of information they need to know , which further explains the first fact .
Be grateful for the period .
Writing is so hard that all of us , once launched , tend to ramble .
Instead of a period we use a comma , followed by a transitional word ( and , while ) , and soon we have strayed into a wilderness that seems to have no road back out .
Let the humble period be your savior .
There ’s no sentence too short to be acceptable in the eyes of God .
As you start your journey here at Columbia this week , you may tell yourself that you ’re doing “ communications , ” or “ new media , ” or “ digital media ” or some other fashionable new form .
But ultimately you ’re in the storytelling business .
We all are .
It ’s the oldest of narrative forms , going back to the caveman and the crib , endlessly riveting .
What happened ?
Then what happened ?
Please remember , in moments of despair , whatever journalistic assignment you ’ve been given , all you have to do is tell a story , using the simple tools of the English language and never losing your own humanity .
Repeat after me :
Short is better than long .
Simple is good .
( Louder )
Long Latin nouns are the enemy .
Anglo -Saxon active verbs are your best friend .
One thought per sentence .
Good luck to you all .
When Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet " There is nothing either good or bad , but thinking makes it so , " he must have had the city of Nashville in mind ...
Toronto's Classical Theatre Project presented Romeo and Juliet in the capital of Tennessee to an enthusiastic audience of 1,000 students and teachers Monday afternoon , but the performance was almost derailed Sunday night by a group of self - appointed censors who found the Bard of Avon a bit too racy for Music City , U.S.A .
David Galpern , artistic director of the theatre company , was taken aback when confronted with requests for a series of cuts to Shakespeare 's text and a general " toning down " of the bawdier elements in the show .
" We 've performed this for 100,000 people in Canada without a single complaint from a teacher or student .
Why should it suddenly change here ? " he said on the phone from Nashville Monday .
Since it was founded in 2001 , the acclaimed company has become Canada 's largest producer of classical theatre for youth and has played to more than 350,000 students .
The production of Romeo and Juliet being performed in Nashville was nominated for a Dora Award in 2009 .
Most of the worries were about the sexuality explicit in the script and how it was brought to accurate life by the group , especially in scenes involving the ribald Mercutio .
Charles Roy , co-founder of the company , admitted there was an element of bawdry in some of the passages , but , as he pointed out , " If Mercutio does n't offend the Nurse with his line about the bawdy hand of the dial being upon the prick of noon and she does n't try to exit in protest , then what happens to the rest of the play ? "
Despite the worries of some of the staff of the Program Services for Education department at the Tennessee Performing Arts Centre about the content they saw at Sunday night 's dress rehearsal , their director , Sherri Leathers , remained steadfastly committed to the show .
" The performance I saw ... was awesome , as I always knew it would be , " said Leathers .
She had come up to see the theatre group in Canada and was so impressed that she lobbied extensively to get them to perform in Tennessee and was anxious that everything should go right .
" Sherri has been totally supportive and we value everything she 's done for us , " volunteers Roy .
" We 're guests here and we do n't want to fight a cultural war , " adds Galpern , " but at what point are we starting to betray the work itself ? "
After much discussion , they decided to present the show as planned and Monday 's audience was , by and large , enthusiastic .
Danielle Moffitt , 18 , from Goodpasture Christian School , said , " The sexuality was a good thing , the way they addressed it openly back then , not like now . "
On the flip side , a woman who identified herself as Val , a home - school teacher from Hermitage , " struggled being here with my son .
The sexuality was too much .
Our children need to be more pure . "

Several other teachers echoed her opinion .
No matter how the rest of the week 's performances go , it seems the Toronto company has already fulfilled one of its missions , which Galpern sums up .
" We want them to think Shakespeare is the furthest thing from boring . "

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
On Sunday , Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano claimed that the attempt to blow up the Amsterdam to Detroit flight last week demonstrated that “ the system worked . ”
On NBC ’s “ Today ” show on Monday , she claimed that her comment was taken out of context , and that she agrees that the system “ failed miserably . ”
Ms. Napolitano ’s second attempt at honesty was just as disingenuous as the first .
In her interview on Monday morning , she claimed that her reference to the system working just dealt with how security responded after the attack had been thwarted .
Matt Lauer said , “ You made a comment over the weekend … about this incident aboard this Northwest flight and you said , ‘ When it came right down to it , the system worked . ’
A lot of people do n’t think the system worked at all , that the only thing that prevented disaster was luck . ”
And Ms. Napolitano replied , “ I think the comment is being taken out of context .
What I ’m saying is that once the incident occurred , moving forward , we were immediately able to notify the 128 flights in the air of protective measures to take , immediately able to notify law enforcement on the ground , airports both domestically , internationally , all carriers , all of that happening within 60 to 90 minutes … ”
But Ms. Napolitano ’s comments on Sunday were not just about the aftermath of the attack : “ What we are focused on is making sure that the air environment remains safe , that people are confident when they travel .
And one thing I ’d like to point out is that the system worked .
Everybody played an important role here .
The passengers and crew of the flight took appropriate action … ”
If her comment applies only to the aftermath of the attack , then she has an interesting definition of “ everybody . ”
The baggage and passenger screeners only had a useful role before the attack .
Management and updating of our watch lists only really mattered before the attack .
It is hardly obvious why the actions taken after the attempted attack should assure us that travelers should be “ confident ” that air travel is “ safe . ”
Nor is it obvious that the heroic actions taken by a passenger , Jasper Schuringa , who stopped the bombing , were part of some grand government design .
Mr. Schuringa put out the fire with his bare hands while he was screaming for someone to give him water .
The appropriate role of the Cabinet secretary charged with keeping terrorists off airplanes is taking responsibility for failure , figuring out exactly how the failures happened and then tightening security to make sure it does n’t happen again .
There are plenty of people in the Obama administration and out who can deliver self - serving spin on TV , but nobody else currently empowered to provide leadership to the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Agency .

I ’d never heard of Ibn Battuta , the famed 14th - century Moroccan lawyer who at the age of 21 wanted to perform the hajj .
Instead of a ride in an air - conditioned jet to Saudi Arabia , the trip in 1325 was a hazardous overland trek of 3,000 miles from Tangier to Mecca .
Ibn Battuta had to detour via Damascus , where he joined a lengthy camel procession for the final 40 - day trip to Mecca .
These were sophisticated caravans — like traveling towns — with judges who oversaw disputes and contingents of soldiers and food merchants , not to mention several thousand camels .
People embarked on these trips because every capable Muslim is required to perform the hajj at least once in his or her life .
A group of filmmakers — none of them Muslim — were so entranced with this epic trip that they made “ Journey to Mecca , ” which premieres Thursday in Washington at the Imax theater of the Smithsonian ’s National Museum of Natural History .
It runs through March 4 .
“ The pilgrimage to Mecca is one of the greatest cultural events on Earth , but we know less about it than traveling in space , ” said Taran Davies , one of the filmmakers .
“ This is the side of Islam you never see on TV . ”
The film , whose $ 13 million budget was contributed mainly by investors from Saudi Arabia , Morocco , France , the United States and Kuwait , was shot in 2007 and 2008 in English and Arabic versions .
Mr. Davies ’ partner , Dominic Cunningham - Reid , took two years to secure a set of unique permits allowing them to shoot a modern - day hajj on the ground in Mecca and from the air .
The helicopter shots taken of millions of pilgrims with an Imax camera “ has never been done before and probably wo n’t be done again , ” Mr. Davies said .
Because non-Muslims are not allowed in Mecca , filmmakers had to train three Muslim cinematographers in Los Angeles how to shoot Imax , with the help of an 85 - person support team from 30 countries .
The unusual width of Imax film — 70 mm instead of the usual 35 mm — demands specialized training on how to get an ultraprecise focus for a movie that will be shown on a seven - story - high screen .
A bevy of Saudi security personnel accompanied them .
“ We wanted to take an audience — that ’d never go to Mecca — to see this place , ” Mr. Davies told me .
“ Only three million Muslims are allowed there per year , so the vast majority of the world ’s Muslims will never get there . ”
He guesses the effort was the largest documentary production ever assembled in the Arabian Gulf region .
The caravan scenes alone — shot in Morocco — included 500 extras dressed in 14th - century garb , 320 camels , and 500 goats and chickens .
“ What has been fascinating to us is there are Muslims alive today who can recall stories of their grandparents ’ journeys to Mecca by pilgrimage caravan , ” Mr. Davies said .
“ People would come up to us during the screenings saying it was the first time they got a sense of what it was like .
It is a true picture of Islamic heritage . ”
The film also includes a replica of the kaaba — the 43 - foot - high cube - shaped building that is Islam ’s most sacred site — as it would have looked 700 years ago .
In contrast to the huge , multistoried mosque in which it sits now , back then it sat in a courtyard surrounded by desert .
Ibn Battuta ended up being an Islamic Marco Polo , traveling three times farther than the famed Italian .
Instead of returning to Tangier , he spent the next 24 years wandering the planet , visiting 40 countries , including Russia , India and China , and famous Islamic capitals such as Cairo ; Samarkhand , Uzbekistan ; and Baghdad .
As for the hajj , he completed it seven times .

A newspaper said Gerry McHugh is to become the first Fianna Fail MLA A republican member of the Northern Ireland Assembly has joined the Irish Republic 's biggest party , Fianna Fail .
Independent assembly member , Gerry McHugh , has joined the party but will continue to sit as an independent .
Speaking about his decision , Mr McHugh said he believed the party was best placed to a deliver a united Ireland .
Mr McHugh left Sinn Fein two years ago complaining that they had become " undemocratic " and said he disagreed with the direction the party had taken .
The 52 - year - old , who represents the Fermanagh / South Tyrone constituency , told the BBC he believed the nationalist parties in Northern Ireland were " quite confined " in their ability to deliver a united Ireland .
In comparison he said Fianna Fail had " the strength and political ability " to create a united Ireland .
His move comes more than two years after the former Fianna Fail Taoiseach , Bertie Ahern , announced his party was to organise in Northern Ireland .
' Ending occupation ' Reports of a possible link - up with the SDLP to take on Sinn Fein 's assertion that it was the only " all - island party " did not materialise however , and last summer , his successor Brian Cowen ruled out the probability of an imminent deal .
Fianna Fail has continued to recruit in Northern Ireland and the Electoral Commission says there is no legal barrier to the party standing in elections north of the border .
Gerry McHugh had been a member of Sinn Fein for over 30 years when he resigned from the party exactly two years ago this week .
At the time he said the direction Sinn Fein was taking was " more about appeasement of the British government and administrating British rule in Ireland rather than working towards the end of British occupation " .
Sinn Fein rejected his claims and questioned why he had not raised his concerns within the party before making them public .
As well as taking his seat in the assembly , where he sits on the Enterprise , Trade and Investment Committee , Mr McHugh is also a member of Fermanagh District Council .
Outside politics , the father - of three describes himself as an " energetic hill - walker " and takes an active interest in heritage and farming issues .

Three - second fish memory ' rubbish '
Forget what you know :
Fish have a memory that lasts much more than three seconds and are capable of deception and learning , say Australian researchers .
Dr Kevin Warbuton , an adjunct researcher at the Institute for Land , Water and Society at Charles Sturt University in Albury , New South Wales has been studying fish for more than three decades and says they 're much better at memory than we give them credit for .
Warbuton 's research has been focused on Australian freshwater fish , particularly in southeast Queensland .
He says the idea that fish have a short memory is wrong .
" It 's absolute rubbish , " says Warbuton .
" There 's been a lot of work done over the last 15 years on learning and memory in fish and it has been found that fish are quite sophisticated .
" Fish can remember prey types for months ; they can learn to avoid predators after being attacked once and they retain this memory for several months . "
Warbuton believes fish are capable of learning , albeit at a cost .
For example , his research on the silver perch revealed something unexpected .
" With one type of prey , the fish got more and more efficient at catching their food , " he says .
" But when we put two different types of prey in together , their overall efficiency dropped .
We think it was because they suffered from divided attention .
It 's a cost of learning . "
Art of deception
According to Warbuton , fish are also capable of exhibiting human - like behaviours , such as deception .
" Fish can recognise other individuals and modify their own behaviour after observing interactions between other individuals .
" Siamese fighting fish will attack other members of the same species more aggressively if they 've seen them lose contests with other fighters . "
Warbuton says cleaner fish - reef fish that eat parasites off other larger fish - will also be on the lookout to assess the situation and work out how best to take advantage .
" What 's fascinating is that they cooperate more with clients when they are being observed by other potential clients , " says Warburton .
" This improves their image and their chances of attracting clients . "
Misguided belief
Dr Ashley Ward , a fish biologist at the University of Sydney says where the three - second memory urban myth came from is hard to find .
" It seems to come from an advert many years ago , but nobody is sure what it was for , " he says .
Ward believes the misconceptions surrounding the intelligence of fish may stem from the early days of zoology .
" Back then [ zoologists ] tested their abilities based on what a human could do … so obviously the fish would fail . "
Ward says we now know of numerous of examples of fish displaying amazing memory skills .
He refers to one anecdote from the United States , where a Professor Charles Eriksen spent several months feeding a pond of fish while calling out " fish - fish " .
After a break of five years , Eriksen returned to the pond and called out " fish - fish " .
Immediately a number of the surviving fish swam to the surface waiting to be fed .
According to Ward , the frillfin gobbie , which during low tide lives in rock pools that are spaced apart , has an amazing memory .
" If it gets frightened by a bird it jumps from one rock pool to another .
To do this , it has to remember the topographic layout of the pools without being able to see them , " says Ward .
" Another example is the trigger fish , which is found around northern Australia , " he says .
" They have been shown to use tools and other smart tricks to outwit their prey . "
The Man in Black was busted in October 1965 when U.S. Customs agents found hundreds of pep pills and tranquilizers in his luggage .
There ’s a paradox in video game cinema .
The industry ’s stalwart money - making techniques of rampant special effects and gratuitous sexuality have , while nabbing some successful releases , ultimately failed so far in crafting a proven formula for adapting interactive entertainment into consistently lucrative film franchises .
While porting over similar budgets to more talented production crews may inch the transition closer to profitability , the twenty year past with video game films have made them toxic assets , a quick cash in on the momentary popularity of a video game license .
The paradoxical solution to the problem then surfaces : if the necessary innovation towards good video game films cannot be found in basic Hollywood , it must be discovered in independent cinema .
However , it is this same independent cinema that must also include the spectacle trappings of big budget films to attract a wide enough market for profitability .
It seems like an impossible compromise , asking low budget crews to film beyond their means in order to attract more wealthy companies into the fold .
… Enter “ Metal Gear Solid : Philanthropy . ”
Made on a micro-budget of 10,000 Euros ( or $ 13,000 , ) the film is the product of a small group of Italian students turned filmmakers .
The film was made available for free this past September , and can be found for both streaming and downloading ( on multiple formats ) at http://www.mgs-philanthropy.net.
There is n’t a more film - worthy video game character than Solid Snake .
The biggest argument lobbied against his native franchise of Metal Gear Solid is that the cutscenes – while cinematically presented and intricately dialogued – are too long .
Taking the series from the HD to the silver screen would seem common sense from a producer ’s standpoint , but so far the grizzled special - ops soldier has yet to have a Hollywood adventure .
He has , however , managed to make an appearance in an Italian non-profit fan film , and if Snake ’s future in theaters is as bright as captured by Hive Division , then action films have a new leading man .
Set in 2007 , at the brink of the second Metal Gear Solid ( Sons of Liberty ) game ’s opening exploits .
Solid Snake has joined with the radical fringe organization Philanthropy , whose aim of ridding the world of the walking weapons of mass destruction known as Metal Gears fits right into his own .
His mission right now is the infiltration of the “ Overnight Nation , ” aka a small Middle Eastern area in the made up Daskasan region near the Armenian border .
Snake ’s initial initiative is the recovery of United States Senator Abraham Bishop .
However , the mission quickly takes a turn for the near - supernatural as the region holds a weapons facility with many uncomfortable secrets .
Snake is not alone in this discovery , however , as he is joined on this mission by sniper - extraordinaire Pierre Leclerc and soldier - recluse Elizabeth Laeken .
The former sports a more laid - back attitude and acts as the film ’s philosophical voice towards the second half , with the latter having an unnerving past of dead commanding officers behind her .
As Snake ’s personality clashes with his officers , secrets about them all are slowly revealed as the tension – and gunfire – mounts .
The story of ‘ Philanthropy ’ oozes Kojima - love from the first frame onward .
Lofty prose mixes decently with the series ’ patented technical double - speak , the result successfully recreating the feeling of a Metal Gear game for the most part .
The unfortunate byproduct of such a close translation is that the film also recreates the initial difficulty inherent in the franchises ’ opening moments .
Fans of the series will immediately tack onto the buzzwords and adore the near - cheesy techno - militant style , but new - comers will most likely feel uneasy in the presence of such a mixture of cinematic traditions .
Those that stick with , however , will quickly acclimate to the style and by the time the character Elizabeth is introduced , will surprise themselves by how deep their interest in the narrative has grown .
‘ Philanthropy ’ also manages to tackle the game franchise ’s occasional self - reflexive humor , although the effect is 100 times tackier in film form .
The script is solid throughout , with the occasional breach of sense detracting from the immersion .
The film ’s English dub does a decent job for most scenes , with its more obvious lapses in translation breaking the narrative absorption only enough to be humorous .
Solid Snake ’s dubbed voice is incredibly true to character , enough to give him an emotional dimension that the dub regretfully strips from most other characters .
The biggest complaint that arises from the plot is its ending , a horrendous sputtering out of blatant cliff - hanger lines that feels more incredibly rushed .
Considering how much of the film ’s anemic length is spent on the expositional mission briefing , the lack of a balanced epilogue feels cheated .
The most astounding thing ‘ Philanthropy ’ has in its favor is its special effects , epitomized in vista and landscape shots that easily rival anything from Hollywood .
Model work has its moment in 360 - pan glory as well , in a level of pride that is refreshing to see such independent work taking .
The Metal Gears themselves also receive an exceptional degree of authenticity as well , even while admittedly lacking in the final polish that most Tinseltown money shots .
Bullet shots are above average , and bloodwork is incredibly well done for the 1 % it ’s not completely digital .
Sound design wise “ Philanthropy ” fares better than expected , the assorted electronic background beeps adding their expected layer of believability ( and yes , the codex call sounds are included and done as well as that mechanic can possibly be . )
The sound editing shines brightest with the Metal Gears , their animalistic wails of pain and grunts of effort successfully bringing out the mech ’s bestial under - tones to light .
The costumes recall the game ’s most recognizable assets with impressive attention to detail , Snake ’s own uniform bearing all the iconic trappings expected .
The final rearing of Hive Divison ’s fan - boy head is the film ’s framing , most non-action scenes shot with noticeable reverence to the game franchise ’s cinematography .
As the adrenaline picks up the film takes more distance than the video game series was comfortable with , the production crew favoring sweeping low angle tracking and panning shots that – while departing from the Kojima aesthetic – look bloody cool .
The ratio between dialogue and action mirrors the games , with a couple run and gun set - pieces spliced a bit too heavily towards the end .
Oddly enough , the film sports a couple of digitally over - exposed shots that add nothing to the scene , and only distract the attention of the viewer .
“ Metal Gear Solid : Philanthropy ” is the best movie based on a video game in history .
And it ’s that exact fact that is hopefully going to change as more people hopefully become aware of this independent gem .
The story runs into a brick wall at the end , and the directors seemed to favor an over - exposed motif for no apparent reason , but at its core , it ’s a fan project that can serve as a newcomer ’s entry into the franchise it adores .
From its costumes and cinematography to its script and its acting , “ Philanthropy ” is not only a glowing tribute , but an independent film that can stand on its own right .
Hollywood , take note , this is how you do it .
This is a guest post from Phil Carlisle , best known for his work on the Worms series .
You might remember his post from a couple of weeks ago , here .
His last post was very well received , and he agreed to write a follow up !
Read on below .
Last time , I talked about a number of potential behavioural artifacts that I would like to see in Overgrowth .
While discussing it on IRC , Jeff asked me to write a post about how the things I talked about might actually be created .
Here is the result .
The basics
Every AI has a set of basic requirements .
In the main , these can be broken down into a system for movement ( often called pathfinding and / or locomotion ) and a system for controlling agent logic .
In general the AAA part of the games industry has settled on the use of a technique called navigation meshes , which basically offers a simplified version of the 3D world against which an algorithm called an A * search ( or some variation thereof ) can be used to determine potential movement space .
A really nice explanation of WHY we 've settled on navigation meshes can be seen in this article on Game / AI .
This is often supplemented with local dynamic obstacle avoidance of some sort , the most prominent being some kind of " steering behavior " based on work by Craig Reynolds .
Although , a technique called velocity obstacles is gaining more interest , especially for crowd movements .
Luckily , these basics are actually the easiest to integrate , thanks to the work of Mikko Mononen , ex-Crytek AI programmer who has recently released libraries called Recast and Detour , which provide functionality present in many middleware AI libraries but as " free for commercial use " open source .
Given the pathfinding basics being provided by Mikko , the next part of the basics to cover , is to control the AI logic .
There are three typical approaches currently used in games .
Finite state machines are still used within the industry , however these are mostly now hierarchically based HFSM and have been superceded in many cases by the next two approaches .
The first is the use of planners , pioneered by the use of a " strips - like " planner in the monolith title FEAR implemented by Jeff Orkin and recently used in Demigod by Gas Powered Games .
The second approach to emerge , is more of a reactive approach called behavior trees .
BT's have been used in many titles recently , the Halo franchise being the prime proponent for that approach ( see Damian Isla 's talks at GDC for more info ) .
A great discussion on BT 's can be found on aigamedev.com .
Often , the BT approach is enhanced with the use of a " blackboard " which is essentially a repository of data stored about what the agent knows and / or feels .
This is closely linked to a sensory system that provides the agent with knowledge of its environment .
Typically via the use of spatial queries ( for example " how many agents are within this range " ) or via raycast queries ( for example " if I follow this line , can I actually see anyone ? " ) .
A lot of time is involved in this sensory processing and AI programmers tend to spend a lot of effort trying to ensure that this system is well optimised .
So for the basics , you have the tools for movement and navigation in space and logic to control action selection and monitoring .
With those you could make a game that works .
But it definitely would n't be a very exciting game .
So the next system you need to build , is some method of animating the character .
With modern games , you 'll see characters that can vault over small obstacles .
Jump up to ledges .
Jump across ravine 's etc .
To do this , you need to add an animation system to the basics of movment and logic .
The animation is what brings the character to life .
Animation typically takes the form of a set of rotational movements of a set of " bones " , each of which controls a particular part of the body .
You can see this in action with Overgrowths animation editor .
Each bone stores a rotational value and this is then " keyframed " into a number that changes over time .
There is another type of animation that is worth noting and it was popularised by the terminator films , specifically the film where the second terminator made of liquid metal changed shape .
This is what is known as " morph " animation .
I mention it here because morph animation can still be useful for facial animation , which we 'll get to shortly .
In order to control the bone based animation , many AAA developers used what is called motion capture to generate data for the rotations of the bones .
You can see a really fine example of this kind of technology here : avatar motion capture video .
The advantage of motion capture is that it genuinely captures real human performance ( i.e. its not done by hand by an animator ) .
The downside to motion capture , is that it is incredibly expensive and takes up a lot of memory and disk space .
An alternative to motion capture data and one that is being show in the rabbot character in Overgrowth , is the use of mathematical formula's for movement .
This is known as procedural animation and has been around since the early days of computer animation .
People like Ken Perlin have pioneered many interesting aspects of procedural animation .
These days , it is not unusual to see elements of both types of animation being used together .
I suspect that more procedural and physics based animation will pop up in games as the limitations of capturing and storing enough motion capture data hit developers ( the sheer volume of data needed can be staggering and if you are a console developer it can be a real problem ) .
The more advanced elements
So given the basics of movement and action selection via logic .
Plus the expression available via animation , we get onto the really new and fun stuff .
Emotion
When you watch a great peice of film , you experience it as a whole , you feel its performance and empathize with its characters .
But what makes you feel that way ?
This is the big question that many game developers are struggling with right now .
How can we create characters that are better than before ?
By actually allowing them to HAVE character !
When we interact with other people , we spend a huge amount of our time using our bodies to send non-verbal signals to whoever we are communicating with .
It might be we nod to let them know that we have understood a point they have made , or we might shake our head to disagree or slump our shoulders and sigh to signify our exasperation .
Similarly when we move we literally change the very strides we make as we show signs of fatigue , or we might move in a more confident manner after we have achieved a personal goal .
This is very much the modern AI battleground .
As AI programmers we want to create experiences that really immerse the player , engage them with the narrative and characters in the world , or just challenge them in a natural way by using other characters .
This is almost entirely achieved through changes in posture , gesture , proximity , kinesics ( touch ) , gaze etc .
If you look at most moden AAA games , you will most likely see that games have started to tackle that last one first .
Most games these days incorporate gaze ( the direction of focus of the eyes ) by procedurally animating the direction of the head to look at important things .
Gaze is only a tiny part of our human communication repertoire , yet it serves to control an awful lot of vital information to other humans .
With control of gaze , we can make characters seem bashful , flighty , thoughtful , ignorant , vacant , interested , seductive etc .
The addition of control over eye motions , eyelids and eyebrows as well as the overall direction of the head can really bring a character to life .
But gaze is just the beginning .
Now we are starting to look at these other aspects of human motion and incorporating them into our characters via the animation system .
Luckily , there are plenty of psychologists , anthropologists , animators and social scientists who have been investigating these things for decades .
People like Adam Kendon , Paul Eckman , Michael Argyle and a host of others have built up a solid body of academic work that we can use to inform improvements in these external expressions of emotion .
And that brings me to my final point .
The actual emotions themselves .
This might feel counter - intuitive because most of us think that artificial intelligence is all about logic .
But in real humans , there is not just rational ( i.e. logical ) thought , but also emotion .
We have grown over hundreds of thousands of years to use emotions as a regulartory system that feeds back responses from the body to the brain in order to control its processing .
What this means , is that we should really think of the brain less as an individual bodily organ and more as a part of the body .
The whole concept of a human existing as a brain in a jar is wrong , because without the body we simply would not be able to feel anything .
Literally we would be no longer ourselves because our whole " self " is our body and our brain together .
This is important , because a lot of the changes we see externally ( shifts in posture , gesture , gaze etc ) are physical manifestations of the emotional parts of the brain or are greatly colored by them .
I highly recommend reading " Descartes error " by Antonio Damasio ( professor of neuroscience ) to get a feel for how important emotions are to our daily lives .
The main academic work on emotions for computing is by Ortony , Chlore and Colins and offers what is called the OCC model .
Most academic work enhances this model with a personality model known as the OCEAN model or " big five " .
I recommend if you 're interested in this aspect of AI , to check out my article in game gems 8 , which should be out at the GDC this year ( or catch up with me at the GDC ) .
Conclusion
So right now , there are a lot of people looking at this whole notion of emotion and expression , because it offers us a chance to create dramatically interesting human - like characters .
Luckily we 've learnt that they need not be humans , or even be " realistic " to be human like .
Disney and others have taught us that these representations can be quite abstract .
Personally I find it fascinating to work in this field , because it offers me the chance to create virtual " actors " and eventually I think we 'll figure out an interface that lets anyone create really compelling AI character performances that will allow us to create new types of games .
Are there any other aspects of AI you 'd like to hear about from me ?
Although it may be hard to believe , many parts of the northern hemisphere are considerably warmer than usual at the moment .
Alaska and much of northern Canada is unseasonably warm for instance , with temperatures 5C to 10C warmer than expected .
That still leaves the air a biting – 30C ( – 22 F ) or so though .
Hardly a barbecue winter .
North Africa and the Mediterranean basin are warmer than average also , by up to 10C .
Elsewhere , such as across northern Europe , temperatures are coming in 5C or so colder than average .
It may be called a freak cold snap , but it 's actually a fairly routine distribution of winter weather , the Met Office insists .
The reason ?
Something called the warm - ocean cold - land phenomenon .
Cold places are kept cold because there is little wind .
Warm places are kept warm because of local winds coming off the warmer sea .
Like most weather systems , the cause can be traced to blocks of high air pressure , which tend to dictate wind direction .
" High pressure blocks act like heavy rocks in a stream , in the way that water has to flow around them , " a Met Office spokesman explained .
Such a stubborn block across eastern Europe and Siberia has halted the prevailing westerly wind across Britain , which usually brings soggy warm air from the Atlantic .
Instead , what wind there is comes down from the frozen north .
With it come the freezing conditions that have seen temperatures in parts of Scotland plunge .
Temperatures across many regions have failed to climb above zero during the day , while the mercury at the Met Office 's Eskdalemuir observatory in Dumfries and Galloway hit – 14C on Sunday , the coldest since December 1995 .
The offending high pressure block seems in no hurry to move on .
" There is no wind round there for thousands of miles , " the spokesman said , which means the Arctic conditions over the UK look set to continue well into next week .
When the weather does break , it could bring renewed chaos .
" It all depends how quickly the warmer and wetter air comes back from the west .
If it charges in and meets the cold surface air then we could have 3ft of snow or we could be skating across freezing rain . "
The chill wind of ClimateGate has blown over Al Gore ’s $ 1,200 - per handshake lecture at Copenhagen .
He has canceled the hot - air hoedown .
ClimateDepot dubbed the crumbling global warming conference next week “ Nopenhagen . ”
Blow , winds of change , blow :
Former Vice President Al Gore on Thursday abruptly canceled a Dec. 16 personal appearance that was to be staged during the United Nation ’s Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen , which begins next week .
As described in The Washington TImes ’ Inside the Beltway column Tuesday , the multi-media public event to promote Mr. Gore ’s new book “ Our Choice ” included $ 1,209 VIP tickets that granted the holder a photo opportunity with Mr. Gore and a “ light snack . ”
Berlingkse Media , a Danish group coordinating ticket sales and publicity for the event , said that “ great annoyance ” was a factor in the cancellation , along with unforeseen changes in Gore ’s program for the climate summit .
The decision affected 3,000 ticket holders .
“ We have had a clear - cut agreement , and it is unusual with great disappointment that we have to announce that Al Gore cancels .
We had a huge expectation for the event . …
We do not yet know the detailed reasons for the cancellation , ” said Lisbeth Knudsen , CEO of Berlingske Media , in a statement posted by the company .
The ClimateDepot , com , an online news aggregator that track global warming news reports , referred to the situation as “ Nopenhagen ” , and evidence that popular momentum for the Copenhagen conference “ is fading . ”

THERE are few facets of society that have remained untouched by the internet .
From business communication to leisure activity , the net has transformed the way we behave .
Yet at its heart the internet has stagnated .
As a slew of bandwidth - hungry services come on - stream , the fibre - optic backbone that forms its trunk routes are at risk of becoming overwhelmed by too much data .
It ’s due for an upgrade .
The first inklings of what the upgrade might look like can be seen in an ultra - fast 900 - kilometre fibre - optic link between Paris in France and Frankfurt in Germany …
KHL game cancelled after bench - clearing fight , teams get 691 PIM ( Photo © khl.ru )
A Saturday game between Vityaz Chekhov and Avangard Omsk in the KHL did n’t last any longer than 3 minutes and 39 seconds .
It was postponed after a massive brawl because there was not enough players to continue the game .
Teams got 691 PIM ( Update : KHL increased it to 840 ) , which look like a record in hockey history .
Just seconds after the game started Brandon Sugden , former AHL tough guy who recently joined Vityaz to replace Chris Simon , jumped on Alexander Svitov .
Other players present on the ice started fighting too , among them was a former NHL star Jaromir Jagr who fought Darcy Verot .
Here is an interview with Jagr on this fight .
After the first wave of fighting was gone the second wave came bringing a bench - and even a penalty - box - clearing fight .
However , goalies did n’t fight , they did n’t even remove their hockey goalie masks during the brawls .
“ What a disgrace .
I have no other words for it .
I ca n’t say why it happened , probably because Vityaz players wanted to entertain their fans .
Alas , there was only a bit of hockey today , ” said Alexander Svitov in an interview to Russian site shaybu - shaybu .ru after the game .
“ During the warm - up Sugden jumped on our captain , Svitov , ” said Anton Kuryanov of Avangard Omsk .
“ They fought and everything continued later in the game .
In the very beginning of the 1st period Darcy Verot attacked Jaromir Jagr , and this is not welcomed in our league .
Jagr plays hockey and if Verot wants to fight he should choose another sport . ”
On Sunday KHL will held a special meeting to analyze the situation and discipline the players .
Below is the full video of all fights .
“ People are dying in Haiti because they ca n’t get out , ” Dr. Green said .
It was not clear on Friday who exactly was responsible for the interruption of flights , or the chain of events that led to the decision .
Sterling Ivey , a spokesman for Mr. Crist , said the governor ’s request for federal help might have caused “ confusion . ”
“ Florida stands ready to assist our neighbors in Haiti , but we need a plan of action and reimbursement for the care we are providing , ” Mr. Ivey said .
Mr. Crist ’s request did not indicate how much the medical care was costing the State of Florida , but the number and complexity of the cases could put the total in the millions of dollars .
The expenditure comes at a time when the state is suffering economically and Mr. Crist , a Republican , is locked in a tough primary battle for the Senate seat that had been held by George LeMieux .
“ Recently , we learned that plans were under way to move between 30 to 50 critically ill patients a day for an indefinite period of time , ” Mr. Crist wrote in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius , the secretary of health and human services .
“ Florida does not have the capacity to support such an operation . ”
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the decision to suspend the flights was made by the military , not the federal health department .
A military spokesman said that the military had ended the flights because hospitals were becoming unwilling to take patients .
In her book , Sarah jokes about having had contractions during her infamous ‘ my Down Syndrome son is n’t due for a month and my water broke but I do n’t need to go to a hospital ’ speech in Texas .
And yet here ’s an excerpt from her press interview given to the ADN ( Anchorage Daily News ) just 4 days after the alleged birth of Trig Paxson Van Palin :
FAMILY FEELS BLESSED : Back at work already , governor says she was n’t in labor in Texas .
By LISA DEMER ldemer@adn.com Published : April 22nd , 2008 01:11 AM
Last Modified : October 20th , 2008 02:15 PM
“ I am not a glutton for pain and punishment .
I would have never wanted to travel had I been fully engaged in labor , ” Palin said .
After four kids , the governor said , she knew what labor felt like , and she was n’t in labor .
The full ADN article is archived here .
So which is it ?
And how , after delivering four other babies , could she not know that the slightest twinge of labour ( false or not ) can become fully engaged labour without notice or provocation ?
And why did n’t her ghost - writer know to check the local news archives so Sarah ’s book would reflect versions of events already in print or on tape ?
Had the writer never researched a book prior to ghost - writing this one ?
Would Harper Collins have sent a green ghost - writer to handle such an ambitious , potentially lucrative endeavour ?
Would they not have wanted to protect their investment with a proper writer ?
The idea that all the discrepancies in Sarah ’s book can be attributed to an inexperienced ghost - writer seems a bit too convenient to me .
And fishy too , also .
But put all that aside because we have other discrepancies upon which to focus today .
Below is a photo of Trig , a premature baby of almost 5 weeks , at a reported birthweight of 6 lbs 2 oz , being held by his grandmother , in the hospital corridor , just hours after he was allegedly born :
And here is a photo of Trig on Mercede ’s lap , in Sarah ’s dining room , at least 1 – 7 days after said birth :
Did you get that ?
Ok look at it another way .
BabyTrig , home from the hospital beside my friend with her ‘ just born ’ bub , Missimoo .
The two babies pictured above are meant to be only 1/4 pound different in weight .
Four ounces. 113 grams .
That difference is equal to 1 /2 cup of sugar , 1 stick of butter ( US ) or a 1/4 pound Big Mac ( without the bun and lettuce ) .
Look again at the photos of Trig , one allegedly taken only a few hours after his birth , and the other on or just after his homecoming ( which was reported to have been the day after his birth ) :
Now do you get it ?
The bub Trig in Mercede ’s lap is noticeably smaller than the newborn Trig in grandma ’s arms , and yet that photo was taken at least one day after Trig ’s birth .
The photos could not have been mislabelled or taken in any other order because the photos of grandma showing off her ‘ hours ’ old grandson ’ is well documented by newspaper and television crews .
Obviously , then , the aunt Mercede holding baby Trig while seated in one of Sarah ’s dining room chairs photo , had to have been taken after the hospital hallway photo , after mum and bub have gone home from the hospital .
And yet the two bubs in the photos of Trig do n’t appear to be the same age or weight .
Head – meet desk !
For the record , I had n’t really paid attention to any of these photos when they were first shown a year ago .
But some time after Missimoo was born , and I was looking through her hospital photos , the penny dropped .
Look how Trig fits in the crook of Mercede ’s arm .
She needs only one arm to support him and only the one hand to secure his bum and his classic premie - baby , fetal - positioned legs .
That was my epiphany .
That ’s exactly how my 4 lb 4 oz premie son looked and fit in the crook of my arm until he was about 5 lbs ( around 4 weeks old ) .
Missimoo , on the other hand , spills over her dad ’s arms ( see next ) and her brother needs both of his arms to balance his sister ( see summary ) .
Plus , when you look at the photos side by side , the bub in Mercede ’s lap has the look of a premature infant while the bub in grandma ’s arms , with his well - rounded face , clearly does not .
This is a 6 lb+ newborn baby :
This is not :
The only logical explanation is that Trig was actually born several weeks prior to his public debut and that the MySpace photos ( mysteriously wiped from the internet during the 2008 Presidential campaign ) more accurately depict his real homecoming .
Sarah ’s wild McRide across the US was an amateurish exercise in misdirection , deliberately executed to establish her pregnancy as fact and garner credibility and favour with the media .
The photo - op pictorial of Sarah ’s parents holding their newborn grandson in the hospital corridor the next day is as McPhoney as McSarah ’s new McCheekbones .
But it does establish her parents as willing cohorts in her scheme to separate the American McPeople from their McCash .
And for me , here ’s the icing on the cake – if it turns out that baby Trig was born not on April 18 , but in February or March , my ( and a lot of others ) original observation that Bristol and Levi , as two teenagers brought up under the misguided banner of abstinence only , erroneously thought they had a window of opportunity to safely engage in unprotected sex following Trig ’s birth , thus resulting in Bristol ’s falling pregnant a second time , fits surprisingly neatly into the timeline of a second son , Tripp , being born in December .
I cannot possibly know which of the Babygate theories is true , if any of them are true , but I can tell you that my eyes are not so old I ca n’t tell the difference between the premie look of the bub in the photos gleaned from Mercede ’s MySpace , taken in Sarah ’s home , and the more matured weight and look of the bub displayed in grandma ’s arms , allegedly taken no less than the day before the dining room photos and purportedly only a few hours after his birth for the benefit of news crew cameras .
If ( after you ’ve stopped banging your head on your desk ) you ’d like to explore this subject further , there are more opinions , theories and photos on several blogs dedicated to exposing the truth behind politicians in general and Sarah Palin specifically at the following links .
Some of my photos were pinched from news archives and these sites :

When I look at these all together in a group , an old Sesame Street song pops into my head .

President Obama has made his displeasure at the bonuses clear Firms in the US which received billions of dollars of government aid in the financial crisis are to be told to cut the pay of top executives .
The seven companies that received the most aid from the US Treasury will have to reduce the basic salaries of their 25 best - paid employees by up to 90 % .
The totals paid to each firm 's 125 top earners would be halved under the plan .
Details of the plans were confirmed ahead of schedule by Elizabeth Warren , who heads the oversight panel .
The US government is expected to announce the salary cuts for top executives within the next few days .
' Party 's over ' Speaking in an interview on CBS's The Early Show , Ms Warren , from the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Programme , which has organised the bail out of US banks , said reports of pending reductions in executive salaries are " real " .
She said those people being targeted had to take responsibility .
" Guys , you have to understand that you can't party on like its 2007 .
If you 're going to take taxpayer dollars , then the game has to change " , she said .
There has been widespread outrage over the high level of bonuses paid by firms that had to appeal for government help .
The seven companies affected would be Bank of America , American International Group ( AIG ) , Citigroup , General Motors , GMAC , Chrysler and Chrysler Financial .
Some companies , such as the Goldman Sachs Group and JP Morgan Chase , have already repaid bailout money .
' Offensive '
The US is expected to ofically announce the salary cuts for top executives within the next few days .
Kenneth Feinberg , the Treasury official appointed to handle compensation issues as part of the $ 700 bn Troubled Asset Relief Programme ( Tarp ) , will be in charge of the negotiations on salaries with each of the companies .
Officials close to Mr Feinberg say the plan , targeting the 25 top earners at each of the seven companies affected , will on average cut total compensation by about 50 % .
MARDELL'S AMERICA
With a growing sense of anger at the distance between Wall Street and Main Street , and a sense of unfairness that the bosses who'd helped fuel the crisis were getting rewarded for it , the administration obviously felt it had to act

The plan will also change the form of the pay to align the personal interests of the executives with the longer - term financial health of their companies .
The base salary of the executives will be cut on average by 90 % , while the remainder will be replaced by stock that can not be sold for years .
Executives will also need permission to claim perks worth more than $ 25,000 per year - including country club memberships and company cars .
Until now , companies were only required to provide guidelines for the use of such luxuries .
But it is still unclear exactly how much the executives will be allowed to earn , or how a figure will be determined by Mr Feinberg .
Bonus ' outrage ' President Barack Obama has been outspoken about the payment of bonuses - when the rest of the country is still suffering from the fall out of the global financial crisis .
Earlier this year , the president said he was " outraged " by plans by bailed - out insurer AIG to pay $ 165 m bonuses pledged to executives .
And this week his senior aide , David Axlerod , called the payouts " offensive " , telling the ABC that firms " ought to think through what they are doing and they ought to understand that a year ago lot of these institutions were teetering on the brink and the United States government and taxpayers came to their defence " .
Excessive pay and bonuses have been cited as one of the causes of the world economic downturn , with bankers accused of taking greater risks driven by potential rewards .
The recent G20 summit wanted bonuses linked to long - term performance .
However , the Pittsburgh meeting produced no plan for general caps on the amount banks could pay out - something that some European governments wanted .

The Growing Job Threat Falling Dollar Pushes Manufacturing Out of Europe

Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton .
One controversial feature of the health reform bill winding its way through Congress is “ community rating . ”
The term has a mellow ring but is apt to be divisive .
It allows opponents of the legislation to claim , with a straight face , that it will substantially drive up health insurance premiums .
It also allows proponents to claim , with a straight face , that the measure will drive down premiums and provide coverage to Americans who otherwise could never have afforded it .
I will discuss this concept in this week ’s post as I would teach it to a freshman economics class , ending with a question .
Next week , I shall argue that community rating has long been widely accepted in the United States — especially among members of Congress — and in virtually every other industrialized country .
“ Community rating ” refers to the practice of charging a common premium to all members of a heterogeneous risk pool who may have widely varied health spending for the year .
It inevitably makes chronically healthy individuals subsidize with their insurance premiums ( rather than through overt taxes and transfers ) the health care used by chronically sicker individuals .
The purpose of any insurance , of course , is to do precisely that : redistribute the financial burden from the unlucky to the lucky members of a risk pool .
The crucial distinction is whether that redistribution occurs “ ex ante , ” through the premiums paid into the pool , or “ ex post , ” through the claims made on the pool .
It is a subtle point .
We can use the stylized numerical example in the table below to illustrate the point .
To make the example textbook - simple , we assume that individuals either will not have medical bills at all in the coming year or , if they do , these bills can have only one of three distinct sizes .
In real life , of course , individuals would be spread over medical bills of many more different sizes .
We assume further that there are two distinct cohorts , A and B .
Once again to keep it simple , let ’s assume they are of equal size — e.g. , 100,000 members each — although this is not a crucial assumption .
It just makes the math simpler .
If cohorts A and B were perfectly segregated by expected risk , as we assume here , then within each cohort it would be impossible to predict which member would end up in which row of the table .
In the real world , an unregulated , price - competitive market for individually sold health insurance will in fact tend to segregate populations into such pure risk classes .
To continue with our illustration , suppose that the members of each risk cohort decide to form a cooperative into which each member will pay a common premium P at the beginning of the year , after which the pool will pay 100 percent of any medical bill incurred .
The premium P has two components : ( 1 ) the money needed to pay medical bills and , which we shall call the “ pure premium , ” and ( 2 ) an overhead allowance for managing the insurance scheme .
Let ’s focus strictly on the pure premium , that is , the money needed to pay claims .
Call that pure premium X . Actuaries would calculate it as the sum of the sizes of medical bills , with each bill - size multiplied ( weighted ) by the expected frequency of its occurrence .
For risk pool A , for example , actuaries would calculate X as
X = ( .85 ) $ 0 + ( .11 ) $ 5,000 + ( .03 ) $ 30,000 + ( .01 ) $ 100,000 = $ 2,450 .
If every member of cohort A paid $ 2,450 into the risk pool and the actuary had been accurate in predicting what fractions of that cohort would have medical bills of different sizes , then the sum of paid - in premiums would be just large enough to pay the medical bills of any member requiring care during the year ( abstracting , once again , from administrative overhead ) .
For risk pool B , the similarly calculated pure premium would be $ 6,600 .
Now imagine a country half of whose citizens fall neatly into risk cohort A and the other half into risk cohort B .
The country ’s leaders would sincerely like to assure citizens of a “ fair ” health insurance system .
But what would be “ fair ” ?
Would it be “ fair ” that the healthy individuals of cohort A pay a pure insurance premium of only $ 2,450 a year , while the sicker citizens in cohort B must pay $ 6,600 ?
This is , after all , how health insurance now is priced in most states for individuals .
Or does “ fairness ” require that the two groups be merged into one large national risk pool A & B , whose risk profile is shown in the right - most column of the table .
If each member of this merged pool is to pay the same pure premium , then the latter will have to be $ 4,525 to break even .
Such a premium would be said to be “ community rated ” over these two distinct risk pools .
With a community - rated premium for the two risk pools , it would be predictable ex ante that , on average , members of cohort A would be subsidizing members in cohort B .
We can infer the degree of subsidy from the premiums .
Relative to their premium in a perfectly risk - segregated market , the community - rated premium of $ 4,525 will cost members of low - risk cohort A $ 2,075 more and the sicker members of cohort B $ 2,075 less than they would have paid in a risk - segregated market .
Is that “ fair ” ?
So what should the political leaders of this imaginary country do ?
It would be interesting to have your reaction .
It is , after all , the very question our political leaders are tackling this moment .
Should you choose to respond , would you indicate your age ?
New York Magazine recently chronicled the career of funny boy Michael Cera , noting that the actor , known for his sheepishly charming cute dork roles , has n’t really , how do you say , branched out .
Ever .
As they put it , he plays “ a sweet , downtrodden , awkward wingman who falls for a confident spaz ” every time he appears on screen .
Which got us thinking , who else has made a career playing the same role in every film ?
While there are a boatload of older actors who have made a living perpetuating a specific character ( Steven Seagal , Jackie Chan , Woody Allen ) , none from our generation came to mind quicker than Ben Stiller .
While Stiller has played varying roles throughout his career , he has only shown audiences three sides of himself : the awkward romantic who ca n’t get anything to fall in place ; the neurotic yuppie searching for clarity ; and the bat shit crazy , overly - aggressive psychopath .
Let ’s start there .
Heavy Weights : Tony Perkis is an extroverted fitness freak who starts a fat camp to make fun of losers .

LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles judge has denied a request from an AIDS advocacy group calling for mandatory use of condoms on porn sets .
Judge David Yaffe on Tuesday rejected a petition from the AIDS Healthcare Foundation that contended county health officials had n’t done enough to prevent sexually transmitted diseases in the porn industry .
The group sued the county in July after data showed there were more than 3,700 STD cases over the past five years reported by a clinic that serves porn actors .
In denying the foundation ’s request , Yaffe said the county has broad discretion in how it oversees public health .
The group plans to appeal the decision .
Much attention has focused on the fact that his " Restoring American Financial Stability Act " differs from the administration and Frank proposals by creating an entirely new agency to function as a " systemic regulator " of nonbank financial institutions , instead of the Federal Reserve .
Far more important , however , is the regulatory and bailout powers it gives to the government .
Here the Dodd bill follows the same flawed ideas advanced by the administration and Mr. Frank , but in some ways make things worse .
Both bills are intended to cover more than just companies that are engaged in financial activities .
Following the administration 's lead , both provide that a company engaged in a financial activity " in whole or in part , directly or indirectly " could be subject to enhanced regulation and supervision .
The Frank bill seems intended to regulate all financial firms as though they are banks .
Thus it requires financial activities to be transferred out of operating companies into a separate entity , which would then be regulated like a bank ( even in its relations with its parent company ) .

In the article below we said that the body of Lindsay Hawker , a British teacher , was found at a flat in Ichikawa , east of Tokyo : in fact the city is Ishikawa
Police in Japan say they are questioning the man suspected of murdering Lindsay Hawker , a British teacher whose badly beaten body was found in an apartment near Tokyo in March 2007 .
TV reports said Tatsuya Ichihashi , 30 , had been arrested in Osaka , western Japan , days after it was revealed he had attempted to transform his appearance by undergoing extensive plastic surgery .
The development came just over two and a half years after Hawker 's body was found at Ichihashi's apartment in Ichikawa , a suburban town in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo .
The 22 - year - old , from Brandon , near Coventry , had been severely beaten and strangled , and her arms and legs bound with plastic cord .
The British teacher 's father , Bill Hawker , welcomed the arrest of her suspected killer as " a good day for the Hawkers " .
He said he would travel to Japan as he " wanted to look Ichihashi in the eyes himself .
We wanted justice and we 've finally got justice , " Hawker said .
He added that Ichihashi had shown " no remorse " over the past two and a half years .
" This has been a long hard battle and the battle is over .
We have worked tirelessly as a family , we have never given up , " Hawker said .
He added : " I hope the Japanese society give him the maximum punishment available . "
Early reports said police had stopped Ichihashi as he was about to board a ferry for Okinawa .
Earlier Ichihashi's mother called a TV programme to plead with her son to give himself up , the first public comment made by his parents , both wealthy medical professionals , since his disappearance .
" It 's mum , Tatsuya , " the woman said in an audio message aired on Fuji TV .
" Dad and mum have decided to speak about our feelings , although we know you wo n't like this . "
She said she and her husband were pleased to hear comments in the media by his construction site colleagues that he had been a hard worker and wanted to be good to his parents .
" If so , please go to [ the ] police station and tell them the truth .
Please . "
The Japanese media reported today that Ichihashi had lived in the Osaka area for just over a year until last month , working as a day labourer for a construction firm .
He is thought to have saved about 1 m yen ( £ 6,600 ) , enough to pay for cosmetic surgery .
Ichihashi's fingerprints were found in a dormitory belonging to the firm , along with comics , an English dictionary and a passport application , leading police to believe he may have been planning to flee overseas .
Ichihashi , who had stalked Hawker and followed her home on one occasion , evaded nine police officers when he was approached for questioning and has remained at large ever since , despite fleeing in bare feet and with no money .
Hours before her death , security cameras captured Hawker giving Ichihashi a private language lesson in a nearby cafe after he had begged her to teach him English .
One theory is that he lured her to his flat after pretending he had insufficient cash with him to pay for the lesson .
Subsequent leads have come to nothing , despite 8,000 reported sightings .
In June , police increased the reward for information leading to his arrest from 1 m yen to 10 m yen .
Hawker had been teaching English at a branch of the Nova English conversation school since October 2006 , after graduating from Leeds University that year .

Following - up various discussions we had about the need to provide a guide for people that want to understand our rather complex packaging eco-system , and how they can use it ,
I ’ve decided to start The Hitchhiker ’s Guide to Packaging .
The goals are :
consolidate in one single Sphinx - based powered website , tutorials and documentation on how to use the various packaging tools and how to package , release and distribute your Python application .
provide guidelines to the community that are up - to - date with the latest work done in packaging
see if it can be added in the Python documentation itself at some point when its mature , as Georg Brandl suggested .
If you want to join this documentation effort , by adding your existing documentation to this guide , by writing new one , or by helping on copy editing or reviewing , let me know ( #distutils on Freenode , or by mail )

Washington ( CNN ) --
Only one - quarter of Americans think the federal stimulus plan has helped the middle class , while a majority say it has helped bankers and investors , according to a new national poll .
A CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning indicates that 25 percent of the public thinks the stimulus has benefited the middle class .
One - third of the people questioned think the stimulus has helped low - income Americans , with just over four in 10 saying the plan has benefited business executives .
A majority , 54 percent , think the stimulus has helped bankers and investors .
" Opinions on the economic stimulus bill are colored by the perception that it has helped fat cats , but not ordinary Americans , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" It 's possible that the belief that the stimulus bill helped bankers and CEOs is due to the public confusing the stimulus bill with the various bailout bills that were passed at roughly the same time last year . "
The survey also indicates that one - quarter think the stimulus has helped people in their own community , with three in 10 saying it has hurt people in their community and 45 percent saying the plan has had no effect .
According to a CNN poll released Sunday , 56 percent of the public opposes the stimulus , with 42 percent supportive of the plan .
Last March , just weeks after President Obama signed the stimulus bill into law , a CNN survey indicated that 54 percent supported the program , with 44 percent opposed .
The program , formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 , attempts to stimulate the country 's economy by increasing federal spending and cutting taxes , at a total cost to the government of $ 862 billion .
No Republicans in the House of Representatives and only three in the Senate voted for the bill .
The stimulus was initially thought to have a price tag of $ 787 billion , but the Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday increased its forecast for how much the stimulus will add to the nation 's deficit , raising its estimate by $ 75 billion .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted January 8 - 10 , with 1,021 adult Americans questioned by telephone .
The survey 's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points .
CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report .

SEATTLE ( Reuters ) - Microsoft Corp said on Tuesday it could find no evidence that recent security updates were causing problems with its new Windows 7 operating system , which some have dubbed the “ black screen of death . ”
The problem , which has caused a small number of users to see a completely black screen after logging on , was identified by British software security firm Prevx last week , and received widespread attention after a report by the BBC on Tuesday .
Prevx had claimed that changes to Microsoft ’s operating system ’s registry -- the database that stores configuration settings -- were the most likely cause of the error , but Microsoft denied that .
“ Microsoft has investigated reports that its November security updates made changes to permissions in the registry that are resulting in system issues for some customers , ” said Microsoft representative Christopher Budd .
“ The company has found those reports to be inaccurate and our comprehensive investigation has shown that none of the recently released updates are related to the behavior described in the reports , ” he said .
He added that Microsoft ’s support teams were not seeing this as a big issue for users , but urged Microsoft customers to contact support for free assistance in the event of problems .

HeapMemView v1.05
Copyright ( c ) 2007 - 2013 Nir Sofer Description HeapMemView is a small utility that allows you to view the content of all memory blocks allocated in the heap of the process that you select .
This tool can be useful for developers that need to trace memory leaks in their software .
System Requirements
This utility can work on Windows 2000 , Windows XP , Windows Server 2003 , Windows Vista , Windows 7 , and Windows 8 ( Earlier versions of Windows are not supported ) .
there is also x64 version ( for Vista x64 ) available as a separated download .
Versions History Version 1.05 Added ' Automatically Sort On Refresh ' option .
Fixed the flickering while scrolling the upper pane .
Version 1.02 - Fixed bug :
The main window lost the focus when the user switched to another application and then returned back to HeapMemView .
Version 1.01 - Added support for saving memory blocks list as comma-delimited file .
Version 1.00 - First release .
Using HeapMemView HeapMemView does n't require any installation process or additional DLLs .
Just copy the executable file ( HeapMemView.exe ) to any folder you like , and run it .
After you start HeapMemView , you have to select the process that you want to inspect .
The main window of HeapMemView has 2 panes :
The upper pane displays the list of memory blocks allocated in the heap of the process the your selected .
The lower pane displays the contant of the memory block that you select in the upper pane .
Tips For Using HeapMemView
In order to decrease the number displayed memory blocks and to improve the performances , HeapMemView filter all memory blocks with size smaller than 80 bytes .
You can change this default filter by using the Memory Blocks Filter window ( F8 ) .
Be aware that without the 80 bytes filter , you may get a lots of small and meaningless memory blocks , and the loading process will be pretty slow .
Be aware that without the 80 bytes filter , you may get a lots of small and meaningless memory blocks , and the loading process will be pretty slow .
Each time that you press F5 , the newly added memory blocks are marked with '*' , as well as they are painted with pink color .
You can clear the ' new ' flag by using the ' Clear New Memory Blocks Mark ' option ( F6 ) .
In addition to the memory bytes displayed in the lower pane , You can view a sample of the memory bytes in the table of the upper pane - under ' Data Preview ' column .
In order to enable this feature , select Options -> Data Preview Mode ->ASCII or Hexadecimal .
By default , the first 32 bytes of the memory block will be displayed .
You can modify the default settings in Advanced Options window .
You can export all heap memory blocks to binary files for inspecting them in the future , by selecting all memory blocks in the upper pane , and then using ' Export Memory Data To File ' option ( Ctrl+E )
The ' Heap Handle ' value is the handle returned by HeapCreate or GetProcessHeap API functions .
The ' Data Address ' value is the memory address returned by HeapAlloc API .
When a program allocates heap memory with C/C++ memory functions ( malloc or new keyword ) , you may see some header bytes preceding the real allocated memory data .
Translating HeapMemView to other languages
In order to translate HeapMemView to other language , follow the instructions below : Run HeapMemView with / savelangfile parameter :

i think the guy saw a large murder , so he made one
i saw a person with their arms ripped off .
After protests by animal rights activists , scientists temporarily stopped an experiment on Thursday that involved burying pigs in snow and monitoring their deaths .
The two - week experiment was intended to determine which factors make it possible for people to survive an avalanche in an air pocket without suffering brain damage .
Hermann Brugger , co-director of the experiment led by the Institute of Mountain Emergency Medicine in Italy and the Medical University of Innsbruck , said the pigs did not suffer because they were sedated and given an anesthetic .
Animal rights activists called it cruel and pointless .
It ’s Monday and that means Bioware has released another batch of Dragon Age : Origins screenshots .
Before we get to those , though , I want to point out a post at Kotaku by Stephen Totilo , You Can Play Dragon Age : Origins Sort Of Like Four Other Games .
He tells us even more about the ways you can play DA: O , including creating AI ‘ scripts ’ that will control the characters you are n’t controlling directly .
He compares it to Final Fantasy XII ’s Gambit System .
Or you can play it almost like a 3rd person action game and let the computer handle the other members of your party .
Or jump from character to character .
Sounds like there ’s a lot of variety in how ‘ deep ’ into the game systems you want to go .
OK on to the new screen shots .
I ’m reading the second Dragon Age novel now , The Calling , and there ’s a hunter character in it that has a trusty canine companion .
I was happy to see some shots in this batch that appear to be that kind of character , so it looks like you can create the now - traditional ‘ archer with pet ’ style hunter .
( This might also be evident in the Character Creator …to be honest playing around with that was just making me anticipate the full game so much that I put it aside ! )
Bioware also released a couple pieces of concept art …the first two images in this gallery .
Warsaw tenants fight on , taking direct action , challenging the law and giving the politicians a hard time .
Things are getting hot for bureaucrats , property speculators and thieves as Warsaw tenants take more and more action .
Yesterday tenants protested at the parliament , burning the Law on the Protection of Tenants which they claim is meaningless and only protects the interests of property owners .
" At least we 'll put this meaningless paper to good use - by keeping warm , " claimed the tenants as they lit a bonfire .
They reminded people that throughout Warsaw , people must resort to burning all sorts of things in their homes to keep warm as many houses still have no heat and as slumlords cut off gas to drive people out of their homes .
At a time when many tenants , often elderly , are sitting home freezing , it is much better to take to the streets and protest .
Where there is no heat , there will be fire - our fires , the bonfires of resistance .
A growing group of hardcore activists are vowing to get better organized , take more action and to stop the state from their anti-social and thieving activities .
Warsaw ZSP is part of the Tenants ' Defense Committee which organized the protest yesterday and invited other associations with which it has contact .
The Committee has declared war on city bureaucrats who make horrendous policies to enrich speculators and to redistribute property to elites , heirs of former elites , speculators and developers .
Their cronies also earn on overpriced public tenders , often related to gentrification , but not the real improvement of public housing standards .
The Committee has been exposing corruption , blocking the plans of the local bureaucrats and intervening on behalf of tenants with direct actions .
It has publically opened a list of empty flats and buildings , suitable for squatting .
Tenant activity ranges from peaceful protest , to direct action to legal action .
Some people are trying to fight bandit reprivatization through the courts .
Today was such a case of a tenant from the Citizen 24 group who is seeking ways to legal overturn some of the conditions of reprivatization .
Reprivatization of public housing has been a tragedy for many hundreds of families in Warsaw , especially for the elderly .
Housing that was private before the Second World War is reprivatized .
The owners are dead , but the property goes to heirs , to people who claim to be heirs , to people who forged documents , or speculators who have nothing to do at all with the property but bought claims to the property years ago , when it seemed like getting property back would never happen .
In the meanwhile , tenants are transferred to a new , private landlord who wants to do nothing but raise the rent - or sell the building , even to be destroyed .
The law is constructed in such a way that the state is not required to provide them with alternative public housing .
Only if the new landlord decides to evict them and the tenants meet very rigorous criteria can they qualify to get on a waiting list for public housing ---- and these conditions , were an improvement over the old ones , a small improvement won by months of tenants ' protests .
Some tenants will fight losing their homes in any way possible .
Some refuse to move , blockade themselves in their houses , fight with the landlords , become illegal tenants or squatters .
Others are fighting now to overturn illegal privatizations - only again the law does not protect tenants .
Illegally privatized housing is often resold and the courts consider that the new owners purchased the property " in good faith " .
It is increasingly clear to even non-politically minded tenants that the law was made by property holders and speculators , for property holders and speculators , and tenants are only treated as possible sources of income for the parasitic speculators and landlords .
At yesterday 's demonstration , dozens of tenants spoke about the awful experiences they had with reprivatization , or with the city trying to get rid of them to gentrify their houses .
And as more and more of these stories are repeated in the press , more people are becoming aware of the extent of the problem .
At today 's court session , the courtroom was overrun by tenants who hope that the Constitutional Tribunal will declare at least some aspects of reprivatization laws to be against the Constitution .
Also today , we can gladly report that the pandemonium caused by tenants protests , and in particular the Committee 's analysis and protest of the city budget , means that Warsaw still has no budget approved for 2010 .
The politicians will try to pass one in an emergency session of the City Council next week .
The Committee has vowed to block , through direct action , any attempts to vote on the budget as long as the city does not allocate 100 million zloties for new housing .
Why 100 million zloties ?
Last year , the City Council voted on drastic rent hikes ( 200-300 % ) , which came into effect this year .
The lying bastards set up a neoliberal brainwashing / PR team to convince the press and public opinion that these increases were necessary and the politicians vowed to use 100 % of the money from the rent hikes to fund repairs to devasted public housing .
They attempted to accuse us of being " against repairs " and of wanting people to live in slums .
The counteroffensive to this propaganda took months and included going in a group of 100 people to the neighbourhood council and taking over the meeting .
The Committee pointed out time and time again that money for repairs were already set out in a four - year budget plan adopted a year earlier and that an analysis of previous repairs on public housing showed that a ) many repairs were made on gentrifying projects , including on housing that would later be sold or privatized b ) the money spent on repairs was often like the amounts the Pentagon spends on toilet seats - overinflated and c ) there were many fictious repairs , charged to the city , paid to contractors , but never made .
The Committee started to document this and often confronts the authorities with instances of corruption .
Public opinion started to change a little - and then a lot when we got our hands on a draft copy of the budget for 2010 .
The budget showed that the city not only does not plan to spend the money from increased rents on repairs , but reallocated the money to things like ... politicians ' salaries .
A major scandal broke out .
The Committee demands at the very least that the money be spent on what the bastards promised - or they can overturn the decision to raise the rents .
The city tried to respond with PR - but it did n't work .
The Vice - President of the City ( who is the head of the City Council ) has not shown up at the Council since tenants stormed his office a few months ago and officially demanded he be dismissed .
A few weeks ago he tried to " make ammends " by announcing that the city would build new housing and held a press conference about it .
The press asked the Committee for a response and we asked the politicians to say where they would get the money for this being that they did n't put it in the budget .
After some days of embarrassment , the City announced that in fact , yes , there was no money allocated in the budget for the marvelous housing projects that they presented to the press , but maybe the Council of Europe Bank would make the city ( another ) loan .
The Committee had another idea : since the city reallocated 100 million zloties from the funds to repair housing for things like politician 's salaries and their mobile phone bills , the Committee proposes that they just tighten their belts , stop chatting and give the money that they wanted to misappropriate to actually build these houses .
The bureaucrats have egg on their faces .
Next year is election year and they can't afford such a public relations disaster .
In addition , there is an opportunist opposition in the city government trying to gain off this embarrassment .
They have also decided to attempt to block the budget and give the ruling party a hard time .
Two weeks ago some tenants interrupted the Council .
Others stayed and heckled and vowed to block the budget voting with protests , except the opposition also blocked it from the floor .
Next week , before the emergency session , the Committee will try to make a final push on the city to at least build some houses .
Even though the neoliberal ideology is deeply ingrained in most of society , there is wide public support for these demands .
People have had enough of corruption .
But the movement , although it gained a loud voice in public discussion , is still not supported widely enough .
This is a typical problem of the passivity of Polish society .
More and more people will need to join , but for some , the lack of early response has already lost them their home .
People are being moved into containers , or are forced to crowd into relatives ' flats .
The city even officially tells people now that if they lose their flats , they can move in with their parents - even if they live in a totally different city .
( What better way to gentrify the town ? )
The Committee calls on people to take direct action , organize themselves to help each other , block evictions , hold politicians and speculators accountable for their corruption and to put as much pressure on the bastards as possible to force a better social housing policy .
In lieu of this , we say , take the law into your own hands , and burn it .

Google ' censors its website so anti-Islam searches fail to appear '
Search engine Google has been accused of censoring its results after users discovered it never suggests search terms when it comes to Islam .
In a time - saving feature the internet phenomenon , whose motto is ' do n't be evil ' , helpfully suggests common searches as people type in what they are looking for .
For example , if you type in ' Christianity is ' in the search bar a whole range of options flash up including controversial suggestions such as ' Christianity is fake ' and ' Christianity is a cult ' .
Google has been accused of censoring offensive searches relating to Islam
But anyone typing in a similar phrase which replaces Christianity with Islam gets no suggestions at all .
The anomaly has led some to conclude the firm , famed for its democratic approach to the world of information it controls , is censoring the search results .
Google 's normal search suggestions originate from searches made around the world , adverts and known web pages .
The company also says on its website : ' We try to filter out suggestions that include pornographic terms , dirty words , and hate and violence terms .
If you encounter a term that should not be suggested , please let us know by posting in the Google Web Search Help Forum . '
A Google spokesman claimed the strange absence of results was a software problem .
He said : " This is in fact a bug and we 're working to fix it as quickly as we can . '
Google also makes suggestions which are in the future tense .
Search for ' Islam will ' and the results are very balanced , including suggestions such as ' Islam will be destroyed ' and ' Islam will take over the world ' .

We 'll give it our all to beat Schumacher - Ferrari
The entire Ferrari squad wishes Michael Schumacher the best now that he has left the Scuderia for the Mercedes GP team headed by Ross Brawn , also a former Ferrarista .
The seven time world champion left under amicable circumstances after a three year stint as an advisor in Maranello .
“ What we have to say regarding Schumacher has been said by Chairman Montezemolo last week on the occasion of the traditional well - wishing with the Italian and international press , ” a Scuderia spokesman said .
“ We ’re giving our warm wishes to Michael : as of today he is our competitor and we ’ll give it our all to beat him as we do with all the others . ”
The Buddha delivered his first sermon , in which he laid out the essential framework upon which all his later teachings were based after his Awakening .
This framework consists of the Four Noble Truths , four fundamental principles of nature ( Dhamma ) that emerged from the Buddha 's radically honest and penetrating assessment of the human condition .
He taught these truths not as metaphysical theories or as articles of faith , but as categories by which we should frame our direct experience in a way that conduces to Awakening :
1 ) Dukkha ( suffering , unhappiness , discontent , etc. ) is inherently a part of life .
The Buddha is sometimes misquoted as saying that " life is suffering , " but although he stated that suffering is in the nature of life , he never said that our life experiences are limited to suffering alone .
The First Noble Truth may be understood in several ways .
For one thing , the conditioned phenomena of the universe in which we live are ultimately unsatisfactory , due to impermanence and other factors .
Not getting what one wants is dukkha ; getting what one does n’t want is dukkha ; separation from beloved persons and possessions is dukkha ; birth is dukkha ; pain is dukkha ; old age , disease , and death are dukkha .
For a more complete understanding of dukkha , one needs to see it in the context of the doctrines of anicca( impermanence ) and anatta ( not self ) , together understood as the three marks or characteristics of all existence .
Anicca is impermanence and transience .
Anatta is the doctrine of not - self , that there is not an essential , permanent metaphysical self
2.Dukkha arises due to craving ( tanha ) .
By craving is meant one of three things : desire for sensual pleasures , desire for existence and desire for non-existence .
While craving is not the only cause of dukkha , it is a primary cause — and also one that we do have some control over .
When we have a craving that we cannot fulfill , we then experience unhappiness .
In addition , craving ( along with other factors ) helps to perpetuate Samsâra ( the cycle of birth - and - death ) , inwhich we repeatedly experience dukkha .
While the Second Noble Truth asserts craving as a cause of dukkha and craving for pleasure undeniably can lead to suffering .
In the world , the eye ...... In the world , the ear … .
In the world , the nose … .
In the world , the tongue … .
In the world , the body … .
In the world , the mind has the characteristic of being delightful and pleasurable .
When this craving arises , it arises there .
3 ) Whatever is subject to origination is subject to cessation .
In other words , whatever has a beginning , also has an ending .
Dukkha can be brought to an end through detachment from , and relinquishing of craving .
When the cause of dukkha — craving — does not arise , then dukkha does not arise .
The state of total liberation from dukkha ( and its causes ) is called Nibbana ( Nirvana ) .
4 ) The Path or method of practice that leads to the cessation of dukkha ( through the cessation of craving ) is the Noble Eightfold Path .
The factors of this path are :
1 ) Right Understanding ( or view ) ,
2 ) Right Thought ( or intention ) ,
3 ) Right Speech ,
4 ) Right Action ,
5 ) Right Livelihood ,
6 ) Right Effort ,
7 ) Right Mindfulness , and
8 ) Right Concentration .
Because of our ignorance ( avijja ) of these Noble Truths and our inexperience in framing the world in their terms , we remain bound to samsara , the wearisome cycle of birth , aging , illness , death , and rebirth .
Craving propels this process onward , from one moment to the next and over the course of countless lifetimes , in accordance with kamma ( Skt. karma ) , the universal law of cause and effect .
According to this immutable law , every action that one performs in the present moment — whether by body , speech , or mind itself — eventually bears fruit according to its skillfulness : act in unskillful and harmful ways and unhappiness is bound to follow ; act skillfully and happiness will ultimately ensue .
Phenomena are preceded by the heart , ruled by the heart , made of the heart .
If you speak or act with a corrupted heart , then suffering follows you — as the wheel of the cart , the track of the ox that pulls it .
If you speak or act with a calm , bright heart , then happiness follows you , like a shadow that never leaves .
As long as one remains ignorant of this principle , one is doomed to an aimless existence : happy one moment , in despair the next ; enjoying one lifetime in heaven , the next in hell .
The Buddha discovered that gaining release from samsara requires assigning to each of the Noble Truths a specific task : the first Noble Truth is to be comprehended ; the second , abandoned ; the third , realized ; the fourth , developed .
The full realization of the third Noble Truth paves the way for Awakening : the end of ignorance , craving , suffering , and kamma itself ; the direct penetration to the transcendent freedom and supreme happiness that stands as the final goal of all the Buddha 's teachings ; the Unconditioned , the Deathless , Unbinding — Nibbana ( Skt. Nirvana ) .
Critical of the new mathematics ( Image : Andrew Hem )
What would Lewis Carroll ’s Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland be without the Cheshire Cat , the trial , the Duchess ’s baby or the Mad Hatter ’s tea party ?
Look at the original story that the author told Alice Liddell and her two sisters one day during a boat trip near Oxford , though , and you ’ll find that these famous characters and scenes are missing from the text .
As I embarked on my DPhil investigating Victorian literature , I wanted to know what inspired these later additions .
The critical literature focused mainly on Freudian interpretations of the book as a wild descent into the dark world of the subconscious .
There was no detailed analysis of the added scenes , but from the mass of literary papers , one stood out : in 1984 Helena Pycior of the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee had linked the trial of the Knave of Hearts with a Victorian book on algebra .
Given the author ’s day job , it was somewhat surprising to find few other reviews of his work from a mathematical perspective .
Carroll was a pseudonym : his real name was Charles Dodgson , and he was a mathematician at Christ Church College , Oxford .
The 19th century was a turbulent time for mathematics , with many new and controversial concepts , like imaginary numbers , becoming widely accepted in the mathematical community .
Putting Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland in this context , it becomes clear that Dodgson , a stubbornly conservative mathematician , used some of the missing scenes to satirise these radical new ideas .
Advertisement
Even Dodgson ’s keenest admirers would admit he was a cautious mathematician who produced little original work .
He was , however , a conscientious tutor , and , above everything , he valued the ancient Greek textbook Euclid ’s Elements as the epitome of mathematical thinking .
Broadly speaking , it covered the geometry of circles , quadrilaterals , parallel lines and some basic trigonometry .
But what ’s really striking about Elements is its rigorous reasoning : it starts with a few incontrovertible truths , or axioms , and builds up complex arguments through simple , logical steps .
Each proposition is stated , proved and finally signed off with QED .
For centuries , this approach had been seen as the pinnacle of mathematical and logical reasoning .
Yet to Dodgson ’s dismay , contemporary mathematicians were n’t always as rigorous as Euclid .
He dismissed their writing as “ semi-colloquial ” and even “ semi-logical ” .
Worse still for Dodgson , this new mathematics departed from the physical reality that had grounded Euclid ’s works .
By now , scholars had started routinely using seemingly nonsensical concepts such as imaginary numbers – the square root of a negative number – which do n’t represent physical quantities in the same way that whole numbers or fractions do .
No Victorian embraced these new concepts wholeheartedly , and all struggled to find a philosophical framework that would accommodate them .
But they gave mathematicians a freedom to explore new ideas , and some were prepared to go along with these strange concepts as long as they were manipulated using a consistent framework of operations .
To Dodgson , though , the new mathematics was absurd , and while he accepted it might be interesting to an advanced mathematician , he believed it would be impossible to teach to an undergraduate .
Outgunned in the specialist press , Dodgson took his mathematics to his fiction .
Using a technique familiar from Euclid ’s proofs , reductio ad absurdum , he picked apart the “ semi- logic ” of the new abstract mathematics , mocking its weakness by taking these premises to their logical conclusions , with mad results .
The outcome is Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland .
Algebra and hookahs
Take the chapter “ Advice from a caterpillar ” , for example .
By this point , Alice has fallen down a rabbit hole and eaten a cake that has shrunk her to a height of just 3 inches .
Enter the Caterpillar , smoking a hookah pipe , who shows Alice a mushroom that can restore her to her proper size .
The snag , of course , is that one side of the mushroom stretches her neck , while another shrinks her torso .
She must eat exactly the right balance to regain her proper size and proportions .
While some have argued that this scene , with its hookah and “ magic mushroom ” , is about drugs , I believe it ’s actually about what Dodgson saw as the absurdity of symbolic algebra , which severed the link between algebra , arithmetic and his beloved geometry .
Whereas the book ’s later chapters contain more specific mathematical analogies , this scene is subtle and playful , setting the tone for the madness that will follow .
The first clue may be in the pipe itself : the word “ hookah ” is , after all , of Arabic origin , like “ algebra ” , and it is perhaps striking that Augustus De Morgan , the first British mathematician to lay out a consistent set of rules for symbolic algebra , uses the original Arabic translation in Trigonometry and Double Algebra , which was published in 1849 .
He calls it “ al jebr e al mokabala ” or “ restoration and reduction ” – which almost exactly describes Alice ’s experience .
Restoration was what brought Alice to the mushroom : she was looking for something to eat or drink to “ grow to my right size again ” , and reduction was what actually happened when she ate some : she shrank so rapidly that her chin hit her foot .
De Morgan ’s work explained the departure from universal arithmetic – where algebraic symbols stand for specific numbers rooted in a physical quantity – to that of symbolic algebra , where any “ absurd ” operations involving negative and impossible solutions are allowed , provided they follow an internal logic .
Symbolic algebra is essentially what we use today as a finely honed language for communicating the relations between mathematical objects , but Victorians viewed algebra very differently .
Even the early attempts at symbolic algebra retained an indirect relation to physical quantities .
De Morgan wanted to lose even this loose association with measurement , and proposed instead that symbolic algebra should be considered as a system of grammar .
“ Reduce ” algebra from a universal arithmetic to a series of logical but purely symbolic operations , he said , and you will eventually be able to “ restore ” a more profound meaning to the system – though at this point he was unable to say exactly how .
When Alice loses her temper
The madness of Wonderland , I believe , reflects Dodgson ’s views on the dangers of this new symbolic algebra .
Alice has moved from a rational world to a land where even numbers behave erratically .
In the hallway , she tried to remember her multiplication tables , but they had slipped out of the base - 10 number system we are used to .
In the caterpillar scene , Dodgson ’s qualms are reflected in the way Alice ’s height fluctuates between 9 feet and 3 inches .
Alice , bound by conventional arithmetic where a quantity such as size should be constant , finds this troubling : “ Being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing , ” she complains .
“ It is n’t , ” replies the Caterpillar , who lives in this absurd world .
“ Wonderland ’s madness reflects Carroll ’s views on the dangers of the new symbolic algebra ”
The Caterpillar ’s warning , at the end of this scene , is perhaps one of the most telling clues to Dodgson ’s conservative mathematics .
“ Keep your temper , ” he announces .
Alice presumes he ’s telling her not to get angry , but although he has been abrupt he has not been particularly irritable at this point , so it ’s a somewhat puzzling thing to announce .
To intellectuals at the time , though , the word “ temper ” also retained its original sense of “ the proportion in which qualities are mingled ” , a meaning that lives on today in phrases such as “ justice tempered with mercy ” .
So the Caterpillar could well be telling Alice to keep her body in proportion – no matter what her size .
This may again reflect Dodgson ’s love of Euclidean geometry , where absolute magnitude does n’t matter : what ’s important is the ratio of one length to another when considering the properties of a triangle , for example .
To survive in Wonderland , Alice must act like a Euclidean geometer , keeping her ratios constant , even if her size changes .
Of course , she does n’t .
She swallows a piece of mushroom and her neck grows like a serpent with predictably chaotic results – until she balances her shape with a piece from the other side of the mushroom .
It ’s an important precursor to the next chapter , “ Pig and pepper ” , where Dodgson parodies another type of geometry .
By this point , Alice has returned to her proper size and shape , but she shrinks herself down to enter a small house .
There she finds the Duchess in her kitchen nursing her baby , while her Cook adds too much pepper to the soup , making everyone sneeze except the Cheshire Cat .
But when the Duchess gives the baby to Alice , it somehow turns into a pig .
The target of this scene is projective geometry , which examines the properties of figures that stay the same even when the figure is projected onto another surface – imagine shining an image onto a moving screen and then tilting the screen through different angles to give a family of shapes .
The field involved various notions that Dodgson would have found ridiculous , not least of which is the “ principle of continuity ” .
Jean -Victor Poncelet , the French mathematician who set out the principle , describes it as follows : “ Let a figure be conceived to undergo a certain continuous variation , and let some general property concerning it be granted as true , so long as the variation is confined within certain limits ; then the same property will belong to all the successive states of the figure . ”
The case of two intersecting circles is perhaps the simplest example to consider .
Solve their equations , and you will find that they intersect at two distinct points .
According to the principle of continuity , any continuous transformation to these circles – moving their centres away from one another , for example – will preserve the basic property that they intersect at two points .
It ’s just that when their centres are far enough apart the solution will involve an imaginary number that ca n’t be understood physically ( see diagram ) .
Of course , when Poncelet talks of “ figures ” , he means geometric figures , but Dodgson playfully subjects Poncelet ’s “ semi-colloquial ” argument to strict logical analysis and takes it to its most extreme conclusion .
What works for a triangle should also work for a baby ; if not , something is wrong with the principle , QED .
So Dodgson turns a baby into a pig through the principle of continuity .
Importantly , the baby retains most of its original features , as any object going through a continuous transformation must .
His limbs are still held out like a starfish , and he has a queer shape , turned - up nose and small eyes .
Alice only realises he has changed when his sneezes turn to grunts .
The baby ’s discomfort with the whole process , and the Duchess ’s unconcealed violence , signpost Dodgson ’s virulent mistrust of “ modern ” projective geometry .
Everyone in the pig and pepper scene is bad at doing their job .
The Duchess is a bad aristocrat and an appallingly bad mother ; the Cook is a bad cook who lets the kitchen fill with smoke , over - seasons the soup and eventually throws out her fire irons , pots and plates .
Alice , angry now at the strange turn of events , leaves the Duchess ’s house and wanders into the Mad Hatter ’s tea party , which explores the work of the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton .
Hamilton died in 1865 , just after Alice was published , but by this time his discovery of quaternions in 1843 was being hailed as an important milestone in abstract algebra , since they allowed rotations to be calculated algebraically .
Just as complex numbers work with two terms , quaternions belong to a number system based on four terms ( see “ Imaginary mathematics ” ) .
Hamilton spent years working with three terms – one for each dimension of space – but could only make them rotate in a plane .
When he added the fourth , he got the three - dimensional rotation he was looking for , but he had trouble conceptualising what this extra term meant .
Like most Victorians , he assumed this term had to mean something , so in the preface to his Lectures on Quaternions of 1853 he added a footnote : “ It seemed ( and still seems ) to me natural to connect this extra-spatial unit with the conception of time . ”
Where geometry allowed the exploration of space , Hamilton believed , algebra allowed the investigation of “ pure time ” , a rather esoteric concept he had derived from Immanuel Kant that was meant to be a kind of Platonic ideal of time , distinct from the real time we humans experience .
Other mathematicians were polite but cautious about this notion , believing pure time was a step too far .
The parallels between Hamilton ’s maths and the Hatter ’s tea party – or perhaps it should read “ t - party ” – are uncanny .
Alice is now at a table with three strange characters : the Hatter , the March Hare and the Dormouse .
The character Time , who has fallen out with the Hatter , is absent , and out of pique he wo n’t let the Hatter move the clocks past six .
Reading this scene with Hamilton ’s maths in mind , the members of the Hatter ’s tea party represent three terms of a quaternion , in which the all - important fourth term , time , is missing .
Without Time , we are told , the characters are stuck at the tea table , constantly moving round to find clean cups and saucers .
Their movement around the table is reminiscent of Hamilton ’s early attempts to calculate motion , which was limited to rotatations in a plane before he added time to the mix .
Even when Alice joins the party , she ca n’t stop the Hatter , the Hare and the Dormouse shuffling round the table , because she ’s not an extra-spatial unit like Time .
The Hatter ’s nonsensical riddle in this scene – “ Why is a raven like a writing desk ? ” – may more specifically target the theory of pure time .
In the realm of pure time , Hamilton claimed , cause and effect are no longer linked , and the madness of the Hatter ’s unanswerable question may reflect this .
Alice ’s ensuing attempt to solve the riddle pokes fun at another aspect of quaternions : their multiplication is non-commutative , meaning that x × y is not the same as y × x .
Alice ’s answers are equally non-commutative .
When the Hare tells her to “ say what she means ” , she replies that she does , “ at least I mean what I say – that ’s the same thing ” .
“ Not the same thing a bit ! ” says the Hatter .
“ Why , you might just as well say that ‘ I see what I eat ’ is the same thing as ‘ I eat what I see’ ! ”
It ’s an idea that must have grated on a conservative mathematician like Dodgson , since non-commutative algebras contradicted the basic laws of arithmetic and opened up a strange new world of mathematics , even more abstract than that of the symbolic algebraists .
When the scene ends , the Hatter and the Hare are trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot .
This could be their route to freedom .
If they could only lose him , they could exist independently , as a complex number with two terms .
Still mad , according to Dodgson , but free from an endless rotation around the table .
And there Dodgson ’s satire of his contemporary mathematicians seems to end .
What , then , would remain of Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland without these analogies ?
Nothing but Dodgson ’s original nursery tale , Alice ’s Adventures Under Ground , charming but short on characteristic nonsense .
Dodgson was most witty when he was poking fun at something , and only then when the subject matter got him truly riled .
He wrote two uproariously funny pamphlets , fashioned in the style of mathematical proofs , which ridiculed changes at the University of Oxford .
In comparison , other stories he wrote besides the Alice books were dull and moralistic .
I would venture that without Dodgson ’s fierce satire aimed at his colleagues , Alice ’s Adventures in Wonderland would never have become famous , and Lewis Carroll would not be remembered as the unrivalled master of nonsense fiction .
Imaginary mathematics
The real numbers , which include fractions and irrational numbers like π that can nevertheless be represented as a point on a number line , are only one of many number systems .
Complex numbers , for example , consist of two terms – a real component and an “ imaginary ” component formed of some multiple of the square root of - 1 , now represented by the symbol i .
They are written in the form a + bi .
The Victorian mathematician William Rowan Hamilton took this one step further , adding two more terms to make quaternions , which take the form a + bi + cj + dk and have their own strange rules of arithmetic .

THE OVAL ON TWITTER THE OVAL ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The White House has reached a tentative agreement with union leaders to tax high - cost medical plans , one of the final obstacles in the way of President Obama 's health care remake , officials said Thursday .
Details of the agreement were not immediately available .
The tentative deal was expected to be presented to congressional leaders Thursday as negotiators try to wrap up an agreement on core elements of the sweeping legislation as early as Friday .
The proposed tax has been a major sticking point because early versions from the Senate would have hit union members , who have negotiated generous health benefits , sacrificing higher wages .
House Democrats were strongly opposed , and did not include the tax in their bill .
But Obama favored the tax , citing the consensus opinion of economists that it would help hold down costs by nudging workers into less pricey coverage .
Union and Democratic officials spoke about the tentative deal on condition of anonymity because the talks were private .
Word of it came as the pace of negotiations quickened .
THE OVAL : Latest health care news from Washington WEDNESDAY : Lengthy health care talks House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel , D - N.Y. , told reporters that negotiators are pushing toward a broad agreement on the legislation by Friday , and would send the package to the Congressional Budget Office for its estimates .
The agreement in principle would cover key issues such as how many Americans would get coverage , and how to pay for it .
Certain issues , including restrictions on taxpayer funding for abortion , would be resolved later .
" We 're shooting for tomorrow , " Rangel said early Thursday after meeting with Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif . , and other leaders .
" We hope to have the whole thing , as much as we can have ( for the budget office ) to be able to start working . "
The budget referees must review the legislation before Congress can cast a final vote and send the bill to Obama .
On the high - cost insurance tax , officials familiar with the negotiations said Wednesday that options being considered to lessen the impact on union members included raising the threshold at which the tax would be levied — it 's $ 23,000 for family plans in the Senate - passed bill — and exempting collective bargaining agreements negotiated before 2013 from the tax .
Under that scenario the tax would n't hit until union contracts were renegotiated , delaying its impact on most union health plans until perhaps 2015 or 2016 .
There was also discussion of lessening the impact of the tax in high - cost regions of the country — where insurance premiums cost more — by imposing the tax on a sliding scale .
Obama and Democratic leaders spent all day Wednesday working intensely to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation , which would expand coverage to more than 30 million people now uninsured , bar insurers from denying coverage to people with medical problems , and attempt to rein in ruinous increases in health care costs .
Obama and senior Democrats emerged from the marathon talks late Wednesday with a declaration that they had made tough gains — but no deal just yet .
Negotiators were to meet again Thursday at the White House , and Obama planned to go to Capitol Hill to make a personal appeal to House Democrats , who are being asked to make major concessions .
Public support for the health care remake continues to drop , perhaps in part because of the messy debate in Congress , and lawmakers are feeling the pressure of other issues , from unemployment to ballooning budget deficits .
In Massachusetts , the race to fill the seat of the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy is turning into a referendum on the health care overhaul , with Republicans hoping to capitalize on voters ' misgivings .
House Democrats are uneasy over concessions they are being asked to make to preserve the 60 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate .
That includes dropping the government - run insurance option liberals have fought for and accepting some form of the high - cost health insurance plan tax .
House Democratic leaders are pushing for more generous subsidies to help make health insurance affordable to a greater number of middle - class households , as well as other concessions .
To help pay for that , Democrats want health care providers to bear more of the cost , said lobbyists speaking on condition of anonymity because conversations within the industry were confidential .
One said Democratic proposals include adding $ 10 billion to the $ 80 billion over 10 years that the drug industry had agreed to contribute , and raising the $ 20 billion in Senate - approved fees imposed on medical device makers by $ 10 billion .
Susan Feeney , spokeswoman for the American Health Care Association , said Wednesday that White House and Senate officials recently have asked the nursing home industry to agree to additional concessions .
Rep. Frank Pallone , D - N.J. , a senior member of the Energy and Commerce Committee , predicted Thursday that despite numerous complaints from rank - and - file House Democrats about losing liberal priorities in deference to a handful of Senate moderates , the House ultimately would sign off on the deal taking shape at the White House .
House leaders " clearly go to the White House knowing what is acceptable to the caucus , so I think that once that is negotiated with the caucus ' views in mind , it should be something that the caucus will accept and would pass . "
" The goal is to get it finalized and voted on in the next few weeks , " Pallone said .
The House and Senate passed the bills with just one Republican vote , and the GOP was not invited to the White House talks .
Republicans say they still have a chance to derail the bill .

THIS CONTEST IS NOW CLOSED TO ENTRIES .
We 'll announce the winner during the first week of January , 2011 .
Gadget Lab has been accused of being somewhat obsessed with the Apple tablet .
Guilty as charged !
We are obsessed , we admit it .
After all , who would n't be obsessed with a device that promises to revolutionize mobile computing , make our iPhones look tiny and stupid , overhaul book publishing , inject new lifeblood into the consumer electronics industry , and maybe even save the dying world of print magazines upon which our livelihoods depend ?
Okay , so we may be going a bit over the top , especially for a product that does n't exist – and may never exist .
It 's important to remember that Apple has never confirmed it 's even working on a tablet .
Everything up to this point is speculation and conjecture .
But the signs are very suggestive , and most industry observers , including Gadget Lab , expect Apple to release a tablet - like device in 2010 .
Even if Apple does n't release a tablet , other manufacturers likely will , from startups like Fusion Garage to ( rumors suggest ) HP , Dell , Nokia and others .
Still , most eyes are on Apple , thanks in part to its impressive track record with the iPhone .
Love it or hate it , the Cupertino company definitely knows how to reimagine a product category and reinvent an industry .
For that reason , we 'll keep covering the rumors , the leaks , and – if it emerges – the device itself .
We cover this topic because you readers have let us know , with your comments and your many , many clicks , that you are interested in it .
But that does n't mean we can't have a little fun with it .
So here 's the deal : Predict how many stories Wired.com will publish about an Apple tablet during 2010 .
Whoever comes the closest will win an actual Apple tablet ( assuming one exists ) .
If there is no such thing at the end of 2010 , we 'll give the winner a consolation prize : A subscription to Wired magazine .
Deadline :
All entries must be received by January 5 , 2010 , at 5 pm Pacific time .
At that point we will close the form and seal the spreadsheet until January 1 , 2011 .
Problems ?
Questions ?
Snarky remarks ?

The other day , when there emerged another photo - illustration of Demi Moore , smoothed and tightened beyond the point of recognizable humanity , we wondered when it was the Photoshop - embattled actress would release a " before " picture .
Turns out , there kind of is one .
Advertisement
It was right under our noses — or , rather , on Ashton Kutcher 's Twitter feed .

A tipster alerted us to the fact that on March 4 of last year , the actress 's husband uploaded this slightly blurry picture of Moore reclining in a near - identical pose to the eventual ad .
Let 's examine them side - by - side , shall we ?
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
We 're not out to play " gotcha " here — as far as we 're concerned , the main thing this behind - the - scenes snapshot proves is that Demi Moore is a fucking gorgeous woman .
But given the raft of manipulations her photograph underwent in the course of its transformation from something resembling the shot on the right to that creation on the left , it 's clear that to the contemporary beauty industry , being gorgeous is not enough .
Breasts need lifting , hair needs thickening and cloning , little bits of flesh around the shoulders and upper torso that might bulge out when lying down on a hard surface need siphoning off , cleavage needs enhancing , the little lines on palms and neck that show skin , you know , creases with movement — those need to be liquified away .
And skin needs a plasticky airbrushing , a total post - production resurfacing , because anything on a billboard that had a visual artifact of the texture of a human being might ... might what ?
Alienate the audience ?
The point is n't that Demi Moore looks bad because of this Photoshop .
It 's that Photoshop this thorough makes her look nothing like a human being .
We now live in a world that forces us to consider every image of a woman we encounter to have been extensively altered , unless and until proven otherwise .
And yet , unretouched shots of models and actors are just a click away — whether they be paparazzi snaps or candids tweeted by a loved - one .
In these circumstances , it only gets curiouser and curiouser that beauty companies insist on pursuing their relentless campaign of visual manipulation .
We can disprove these fallacious accounts of the stars ' appearances in seconds ; why the pretense ?

IT personality type No. 1 : The Empty Suit
It ’s also well established that Western women are beginning puberty earlier , and going through menopause later .
Dr. Maida Galvez , a pediatrician who runs Mount Sinai ’s pediatric environmental health specialty unit , told the symposium that American girls in the year 1800 had their first period , on average , at about age 17 .
By 1900 that had dropped to 14 .
Now it is 12 .
A number of studies , mostly in animals , have linked early puberty to exposure to pesticides , P.C.B. ’s and other chemicals .
One class of chemicals that creates concern — although the evidence is not definitive — is endocrine disruptors , which are often similar to estrogen and may fool the body into setting off hormonal changes .
This used to be a fringe theory , but it is now being treated with great seriousness by the Endocrine Society , the professional association of hormone specialists in the United States .
These endocrine disruptors are found in everything from certain plastics to various cosmetics .
“ There ’s a ton of stuff around that has estrogenic material in it , ” Dr. Goldfarb said .
“ There ’s makeup that you rub into your skin for a youthful appearance that is really estrogen . ”
More than 80,000 new chemicals have been developed since World War II , according to the Children ’s Environmental Health Center at Mount Sinai .
Even of the major chemicals , fewer than 20 percent have been tested for toxicity to children , the center says .
Representative Louise Slaughter , the only microbiologist in the House of Representatives , introduced legislation this month that would establish a comprehensive program to monitor endocrine disruptors .
That ’s an excellent idea , because as long as we ’re examining our medical system , there ’s a remarkable precedent for a public health effort against a toxic substance .
The removal of lead from gasoline resulted in an 80 percent decline in lead levels in our blood since 1976 — along with a six - point gain in children ’s I.Q. ’s , Dr. Landrigan said .
I asked these doctors what they do in their own homes to reduce risks .
They said that they avoid microwaving food in plastic or putting plastics in the dishwasher , because heat may cause chemicals to leach out .
And the symposium handed out a reminder card listing “ safer plastics ” as those marked ( usually at the bottom of a container ) 1 , 2 , 4 or 5 .
It suggests that the “ plastics to avoid ” are those numbered 3 , 6 and 7 ( unless they are also marked “ BPA - free ” ) .
Yes , the evidence is uncertain , but my weekend project is to go through containers in our house and toss out 3’s , 6 ’s and 7’s .

[ Congratulations !
This is the third prize winner in our 2009 Christmas Competition . ]
As we come to the close of another year I always look forward to the year in pictures put together by many of the television networks .
It gives us a chance to remember the year ’s triumphs and tragedies and to also look forward to the year ahead .
I thought it might be interesting to go back in time and look at what the year in pictures might have looked like 100 years ago .
This list is in chronological order and describes some important events that occurred in 1909 matched up with some fascinating photographs .
For comparison , I have also included descriptions and photos of what things look like today .
1 First Men to South Magnetic Pole January 16 , 1909
In 1907 the famous Anglo - Irish explorer Henry Shackleton recruited Douglas Mawson , an Australian geologist and 50 year old lieutenant Edgeworth David for a South Pole Expedition .
The plan was for Shackleton and three men to travel to the geographic South Pole while David and two companions traveled to the magnetic pole .
In October 1908 David ’s men followed the coast north .
Ten weeks and over 1,200 miles later the men arrived at the South Magnetic Pole .
The three men then took possession of the region for the British Crown and gave three cheers for the King .
Shackleton ’s team met with ferocious blizzards and hurricane force winds and were forced to turn back less than 100 miles from the geographic South Pole .
The photo above was taken by David and shows himself ( center ) and his teammates Dr. Alistair Mackay ( left ) and Douglas Mawson on the right .
100 Years Later
Today some scientists and calculations suggest the first explorers in 1909 might have been off the mark .
The magnetic South Pole is constantly shifting due to changes in the Earth ’s magnetic field and was recently calculated to be just off the coast of Wilkes Land , Antarctica .
A great deal has changed in the area over the last century since explorers first ventured to the South Pole .
Skidoos have replaced ponies and dog sleds and airbuses transport research scientists to and from the area .
Antarctica has no permanent residents , but a number of governments maintain permanent manned research stations throughout the continent .
In 2009 to commemorate 100 years since the first expedition to the South Magnetic Pole , a coin was struck by the Perth Mint .
2 William Howard Taft Inauguration March 4th , 1909
Taft was the 27th President of the United States and won the 1908 election by a wave of popular support thanks to previous president and fellow republican , Theodore Roosevelt .
A severe and unusual March blizzard hindered the Taft inauguration ceremonies .
It took 6,000 city workers and 500 wagons half the night to remove 58,000 tons of snow and slush to clear the parade route .
Due to the weather , the inauguration had to be held indoors in the Senate chamber .
Helen Herron
Taft , in the buggy pictured above , was the first First Lady to accompany her husband on the return ride from the Capitol to the White House .
100 years later
On January 20 , 2009 Barack Obama became the 44th President of the United States and the first African - American to hold the office .
Obama ’s inauguration set a record attendance for any event held in Washington , D.C.
The bible used during the swearing in ceremony was the same one used by Abraham Lincoln at his 1861 inauguration .
When Chief Justice Roberts ’ words strayed from the oath of office prescribed in the Constitution , it led to a re-administration the next evening .
The record attendance , vast television viewership and internet traffic , made President Obama ’s inauguration one of the most observed events ever by a global audience .
The photo above shows President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama walking the inaugural parade route .
3 Titanic Construction Begins March 31 , 1909
The R.M.S. Titanic was built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast Ireland .
It was designed to be the largest ship to ever take to the seas and took 3000 men 3 years to build at a cost of 7.5 million dollars .
Titanic ’s hull was launched on May 31 , 1911 without her engines , boilers , machinery , and furnishings .
She was then towed to deeper waters and was completed on March 31 , 1912 .
The ship was 882 feet 9 inches ( 269.1 m ) long and 92 feet ( 28.0 m ) wide and was built to carry a total of 3,547 passengers and crew .
There were 159 coal burning furnaces that made possible a top speed of 23 knots .
The photograph above shows the keel of the Titanic which is the first part of a ship to be worked on .
You can watch the “ Hundredth Year since Construction ” video tribute here .
100 Years Later
On May 31 , 2009 the last survivor of the Titanic , Millvina Dean , ( shown above ) died at the age of 97 .
She was only nine weeks old and the youngest passenger on board .
Since the Titanic wreckage was discovered in 1985 , there have been several expeditions to retrieve artifacts .
The Titanic exhibit travels around the world and displays 5,900 pieces of china , ship fittings and personal belongings worth $ 110.9 million .
To mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking , a Titanic Memorial Cruise is being offered in 2012 .
It will depart on April 8th from Southampton , England as the original ship did and arrive on April 15 at the spot where the Titanic sank .
The cruise will then head to Halifax to visit the cemeteries where Titanic victims are buried .
One of the largest ships today is the Knock Nevis , a Norwegian - owned supertanker .
It measures 1,504.10 ft ( 458.45 m ) in length .
4 First Men to Reach North Pole April 6 , 1909
In February 1909 , American Navy engineer Robert Peary , several Inuit tribesmen , and fellow American of African descent , Matthew Henson , left their ship anchored at Ellesmere Island ’s Cape Sheridan .
After traveling 480 miles the men reached the geographic North Pole .
Peary wrote in his journal : “ The Pole at last !!!
The prize of 3 centuries , my dream and ambition for 23 years .
Mine at last . ”
The photo above was taken by Peary and shows his crew in the vicinity of the North Pole .
Pictured from left to right is Ooqueah , Ootah , Henson , Egingwah , and Seegloo .
Matthew .
On his return from the Arctic Peary learned of a claim by another American explorer , Frederick A. Cook , who said he had reached the pole first on April 21 , 1908 .
Cook was unable to produce convincing proof , and his claim is not widely accepted .
100 Years later
Peary ’s claim to be the first to reach the North Pole has become controversial over the past century .
Some think Peary may have miscalculated a great distance and never got closer than 121 miles .
Today , journeys to the North Pole by air or by icebreaker have become routine .
There are even adventure companies that book tours to the North Pole like the one shown above .
In 2007 , Dutch performance artist Guido van der Werve performed a work of “ art ” at the North Pole .
By standing exactly on the Pole for 24 hours and turning slowly clockwise as the earth turns counterclockwise by just following his own shadow Van der Werve literally did not turn with the world for one day .

5 Tel Aviv Founded April 11 , 1909
Tel Aviv was founded on the second day of Passover , 1909 .
Sixty - six Jewish families gathered on a desolate sand dune outside Yafo which is now Rothschild Boulevard .
The plan was to build a Hebrew urban centre in a healthy environment according to the rules of aesthetics and modern hygiene .
They parceled out the land by a kind of lottery system .
They gathered 60 grey shells and 60 white shells .
Family names were written on the white shells and the plot numbers on grey shells .
The organizer then paired a white and grey shell assigning each family a plot .
The land was called Ahuzat Bayit meaning “ Homestead ” and then changed a year later to Tel Aviv which means “ Spring Hill . ”
100 Years Later
Tel Aviv is the now the second largest city in Israel with a population of over 390,000 .
The city is the home of some of Israel ’s largest companies and numerous world leading enterprises .
Tel Aviv is also known as , “ The white city ” named for the bright colored international style buildings built in the city from the 1930s by German Jewish architects who immigrated to the city after the rise of the Nazis .
The City has several colleges including Tel Aviv University , founded in 1953 which is now Israel ’s largest university .
In April 2009 hundreds of thousands of people crowded into Rabin Square for a series of the most lavish events in the city ’s history for their centennial celebration .
6 Heavier than Air Flight July 25 , 1909
This historic first heavier than air flight across the English Channel by French aviator Louis Bleriot was funded by a grateful family after Bleriot ’s wife saved their child from falling to his death .
They loaned the almost bankrupt Blériot 25,000 francs which helped him perfect his Blériot XI airplane .
The day he took off from Les Barraques , France to cross the channel , Blériot was on crutches because of a recent accident .
Twenty minutes into his flight he spotted Margaret ’s Bay which told him he was off course .
After adjusting his course he saw his friend waving the French Flag which marked his landing spot in Dover .
After a very rough landing that collapsed the landing gear , the Frenchman became an instant celebrity and won a thousand - pound prize offered by a London newspaper .
The photograph above shows Blériot with reporters after his landing .
You can see some great old film footage of Blériot ’s take off from France here .
100 Years Later
Other English Channel flight accomplishments since 1909 include : first human - powered aircraft in 1979 and just late last year Swiss pilot and inventor Yves Rossy ( shown above ) was the first to make it across by jetpack crossing in just 10 minutes at speeds of 100 mph .
On July 25 2009 , to celebrate one hundred years after Blériot ’s famous flight , it was reenacted by another Frenchman , Edmond Salis , in his restored Blériot XI .
About 500 people , some in period costumes , were on hand in Calais to see Salis take off .
He flew over the English Channel in 40 minutes ( slightly longer than Blériot ) and landed in the same location near Dover Castle .
You can see a great photo of Salis ’ reenacted flight here and what it might have looked like ( minus the houses and cars ) to Blériot as he flew near Dover Castle .
7 Indianapolis Motor Speedway Opens August 14 , 1909
The first motor race at Indy was actually with motorcycles rather than automobiles .
It consisted of 7 motorcycle races , sanctioned by the Federation of American Motorcyclists .
The first of the automobile races took place August 19 - 21 , 1909 , and consisted of 16 races sanctioned by the American Automobile Association .
The photo above shows the start of the1909 Wheeler - Schebler Trophy 300 - mile Race which featured 19 of the world ’s most powerful cars .
The race had to be ended after 235 miles due to deteriorating track conditions .
On that first day of car racing , William Baourque and his mechanic Harry Holcomb became the first to die at the speedway from injuries after a crash .
Later the speedway was paved with 3.2 million bricks to improve the track .
The first 500 mile race was held on Memorial Day , May 30 , 1911 .
100 Years later
Today Indianapolis Motor Speedway has permanent seating capacity for more than 257,000 people and infield seating that raises capacity to an approximate 400,000 .
It is the largest and highest - capacity sporting facility in the world .
The Speedway ’s two and a half mile oval track dimensions have remained essentially unchanged since 1909 .
Over the last 100 years , average speeds have gone from around 70 miles per hour to over 160 miles per hour .
In 2007 , the Speedway announced that it would host a round of Grand Prix Motorcycle Racing .
This marked the first motorcycle racing event at the facility since the speedway opened in 1909 .
You can see what motorcycles looked like at that recent event at Indy compared to what they looked like 100 years ago here .
8 First Paris Air Show September 25 , 1909
The first air show in Paris was held at the Grand Palais .
Visitors came to admire the early flying machines and also buy them .
“ A Wright aircraft cost 30,000 francs , a Farman biplane cost 23,000 and a Blériot like the one that just flew across the English Channel cost just 10,000 .
A magazine writer described the first Paris Air Show this way : “ Airborne mechanical locomotion , with its mysterious problems and future revolutions , could not fail to arouse the enthusiasm of the crowd .
Never have so many thronged to the Grand Palais ; police officers had to form a cordon to restrain the sea of visitors around these pieces of wood and canvas with which Wright had played at being a bird ” .
100 Years Later
The Paris Air Show is now one of the most prestigious in the world .
Major international manufacturers as well as the military forces of several countries attend the Show .
In 1973 the show suffered its worst accident when a Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 crashed killing a crew of six plus eight people on the ground .
In June 2009 , the Air Show celebrated its 100th anniversary with flight demonstrations from early 20th century aircraft .
One of the most popular planes on display was the Bleriot XI ( see number 6 ) which was also the star of the show at the first air show in 1909 .
A memorial service was also held at centennial air show for the victims of Air France Flight 447 that claimed the life of all 216 passengers and 12 crew members earlier in the month .
9 The Cherry Mine Disaster November 13 , 1909
The Cherry , Illinois mine disaster is one of the worst accidents in American industrial history .
The tragedy occurred after the electrical system went down and workers had to use makeshift torches .
As they were lowering a car full of hay to feed the mules stabled underground , a torch ignited the hay and filled the mine with smoke .
Of the 490 men and boys in the mine at the time , 259 died from the fire or the poisonous gases it produced and 12 died while trying to rescue their friends .
Twenty one miners were trapped but survived by drinking water from a pool of water leaking from a coal seam .
They were rescued eight days later .
It took approximately six months to remove all the bodies from the mine while funerals were held almost daily for the lost miners .
100 Years Later
On November 14 2009 , Cherry , Illinois dedicated a monument ( shown above ) that lists the names of the 259 workers killed a century ago .
Other items shown at the dedication included mining artifacts and a cross-section model of the mine .
This disaster forced a crackdown on lax child - labor laws .
Also introduced were stronger mine safety regulations which eventually paved the way for modern - day workmen ’s compensation laws and later the rise of the United Mine Workers Union .
To remember the lives lost , The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield , Illinois opened a major exhibit on November 1 , 2009 called “ The Flames Caught Us ” .
The exhibit runs through March 31 , 2010 .
You can watch a short film that is shown at the exhibit here .
10 Tallest Building in the World November , 1909
In 1907 the president of Metropolitan Life Insurance hired architect Napoleon LeBrun and Sons to design a marble office tower that would rival all other large skyscrapers in Manhattan .
When the Metropolitan Life Tower was completed in 1909 it became the tallest building in the world .
The building has 50 stories and is700 feet ( 213 m ) high .
It is modeled after one of the best known buildings in history , The Campanile in Venice , Italy .
There are four clocks , one on each side of the tower .
Each clock is 26.5 feet ( 8 m ) in diameter with each number measuring four feet ( 1.2 m ) tall .
The minute hands on the clock weigh half a ton each .
The Met Life building remained the tallest in the world until 1913 when it was surpassed by the Woolworth Building also in New York City which is 57 stories and 792 ft high .
100 years later
On October 1st 2009 it was announced that the exterior of the Burj Dubai was completed .
It is the tallest man -made structure ever built at 2,684 ft ( 818 m ) and has 160 floors .
During construction its final height was kept a secret due to competition .
The building is located on Sheikh Zayed Road near Dubai ’s main business district .
An Armani Hotel will occupy the lower 37 floors and floors 45 through 108 will have 700 private apartments .
Corporate offices and suites will fill most of the remaining floors .
The total budget for the Burj Dubai project was about 4.1 billion US .
The tower has the world ’s fastest elevators at speeds of 40 mph ( 64 km / h ) .
During high winds the tower sways a total of 4.9 ft ( 1.5 m ) at its tallest point .
If economic conditions permit , it is expected to be ready for occupancy on January 4th 2010 .
+ Interesting Facts about 1909
In 1909 none of these things had been invented : zippers , band - aids , traffic lights , bubble gum , penicillin , sunglasses , ballpoint pens , shopping carts , nylon stockings , kitty litter , and milk cartons .
In the US there were about 230 reported murders and the average life expectancy was 47 .
An accountant could expect to earn $ 2000 per year and a dentist $ 2,500 .
The average worker made between $ 200 and $ 400 per year , but sugar only cost four cents a pound and eggs were just fourteen cents a dozen .
Most women washed their hair only once a month and used Borax or egg yolks for shampoo .
The six leading causes of death were pneumonia , influenza , tuberculosis , diarrhea , heart disease and stroke .
From 1909 to 2009 the world population grew from 1.7 billion to 6.4 billion .
January 11 , 2010 at 06:33 Tags C & C ++
Pointers are a great source of confusion in C - newbies have a hard time grasping them .
But coupled with arrays , some of the semantics of pointers are complex enough to confound even more seasoned programmers .
Consider this code :
void test ( int ** p ) { } int main ( ) { int arr [ ] = { 30 , 450 , 14 , 5 } ; test ( &arr ) ; return 0 ; }
Take a moment to ponder - would you expect this code to compile cleanly ?
gcc is n't very happy about it , and issues a warning : passing arg 1 of test from incompatible pointer type .
C++ has stricter type checking , so let 's try running the same code through g++ .
As expected , we get an error : cannot convert int ( * ) [ 4 ] to int** for argument 1 to void test ( int * *)
So what 's the problem here ?
What 's wrong with the code above ?
Well , everything .
It 's simply invalid , and it makes no sense .
Some would think it should work because this works :
void test ( int * p ) { } int main ( ) { int arr [ ] = { 30 , 450 , 14 , 5 } ; test ( arr ) ; return 0 ; }
But this one works specifically because the C compilers should follow the C standard , which mandates that arrays " decay " into pointers when used as lvalues .
Thus , a pointer to the array 's first element is actually passed to test and everything works .
But the first code snippet is different .
While an array name may decay into a pointer , the address of the array does not decay into a pointer to a pointer .
And why should it ?
What sense does it make to treat an array so ?
Pointers to pointers are sometimes passed to modify the pointers ( simple pointer arguments do n't work here because C passes by value , which would only allow to modify what 's pointed , not the pointer itself ) .
Here 's some imaginary code ( wo n't compile ) :
void test ( int ** p ) { *p = malloc ... /* retarget '* p ' */ } int main ( ) { int arr [ ] = { 30 , 450 , 14 , 5 } ; int * ptr ; /* Fine ! ** test will retarget ptr , and its new value ** will appear after this call .
*/ test ( &ptr ) ; /* Makes no sense ! **
You cannot retarget ' arr ' , since it 's a ** constant label created by the compiler .
*/ test ( &arr ) ; return 0 ; }
ONE of Australia 's most loved feathered film stars has died .
Mr Percival - one of the pelicans to star in the 1976 South Australian film Storm Boy - died at Adelaide Zoo last night .
It is understood Mr Percival , who was 33 years old , died of old age .
The film , in which Mr Percival starred , was shot on the Coorong and was based on Colin Thiele 's novel about a boy who raises three pelicans but is forced by his father to set them free .
Adelaide Zoo senior keeper of birds , Brett Backhouse said Mr Percival had been a favourite with zoo staff since arriving from the former Marineland in 1988 .
" He was our number one breeder , leaving behind the seven offspring he sired with partner Alto , " Mr Backhouse said in a statement released today .
" Their last pelican chick was born in 2007 . "

Pulling a funny office prank can be so much fun but you ca n’t call yourself the office prank god( dess ) if you have n’t tried all types of pranks now can you .
I thought this one was funny and rather ingenious , but I suggest you stake out your target office workers keyboard before trying this funny office prank .
Buy a cheap or broken keyboard that looks similar so that you can whip out the good keyboard when the boss comes looking .
Luckily for us , this prank was done to someone else …
Now that I think about it , that could ’ve very well been extremely delicious …well , depends on what you do with your keyboard and mouse .

If you 're one of the Americans who thinks that controlling our southern border is a must -- that the potential for smuggling terrorists or their weapons imperils our national security -- perhaps you should join me in diagnosing everyone who wants to keep waging the War on Drugs as part of the problem .
Cue a New York Times story that answers the question , " What happens when you create a hugely lucrative black market in illicit substances ? "
The answer :
Mexican traffickers facing beefed - up security on the border that now includes miles of new fencing , floodlights , drones , motion sensors and cameras have stepped up their efforts to corrupt the border police .
They research potential targets , anticorruption investigators said , exploiting the cross - border clans and relationships that define the region , offering money , sex , whatever it takes .
But , with the border police in the midst of a hiring boom , law enforcement officers believe that traffickers are pulling out the stops , even soliciting some of their own operatives to apply for jobs .
“ In some ways , ” said Keith Slotter , the agent in charge of the F.B.I. ’s San Diego office , “ it ’s like the old spy game between the old Soviet Union and the U.S. trying to compromise each other ’s spies . ”
James Tomsheck , the assistant commissioner for internal affairs at Customs and Border Protection , and other investigators said they had seen many signs that the drug organizations were making a concerted effort to infiltrate the ranks .
“ We are very concerned , ” Mr. Tomsheck said .
“ There have been verifiable instances where people were directed to C.B.P. to apply for positions only for the purpose of enhancing the goals of criminal organizations .
They had been selected because they had no criminal record ; a background investigation would not develop derogatory information . ”
Perhaps it is n't worth keeping drugs illegal if the cost is the corruption of our border agents , murderous turf wars in our cities , billions of dollars spent jailing non-violent offenders , children of non-violent offenders growing up without their parents , the rise of paramilitary drug cartels destabilizing multiple Latin American countries and capable at any moment of using their smuggling channels to help terrorists , no - knock raids in American neighborhoods that regularly terrify innocents and sometimes kill them , and addicts who overdose more than they would if dosage and quality were controlled .

Craig Tracy is dedicated to creating surreal moments in time .
Without the use of digital manipulation or photographic tricks , he creates dazzling body painting compositions that have elevated this particular type of artistic expression into the realm of fine art .
He recently opened a gallery in New Orleans : the first gallery in the world dedicated to fine art body painting images .
Although he ’s been an artist his whole life , it took Craig Tracy a number of years to truly find his passion .
His first professional art job was airbrushing t- shirts in a shopping mall .
This experience gave him the foundation that would later lead him to discover that he could – and should – paint on unusual surfaces .
After college , Tracy went on to become an illustrator .
Like many artists , he found the work dreary and depressing .
With no artistic freedom and no way to imbue the projects with his own style , he felt trapped .
After retiring from illustration and declaring his freedom from stuffy commercial work , he discovered that body painting was the only type of art that truly made sense for him .
Starting out painting faces , he progressed to painting bodies and eventually began showing and selling prints of his body paintings in his own gallery .
Since then , Craig Tracy ’s work has developed into a full - time passion .
His body paintings show the strength and aching fragility of human bodies , juxtaposed perfectly with the fluidity and transience of the pigments in which they are covered .
In some paintings , the model blends with the background , creating a stunning illusion .
In others , the painted model is the focus of the piece .
The above piece ( bottom right ) , named “ Butterfly ” as a reference to the subtle butterfly disguised as a nose , features a woman as the leopard ’s nose bridge .
Her bottom forms the big cat ’s top lips .
The artist took 24 hours to paint the model and backdrop , pausing only for a one - hour nap .
Unlike Emma Hack , an artist who uses body paint to melt models into the background of her paintings , Tracy seems to celebrate the human form present in his work .
Rather than hiding the model , he allows the curves and shadows of her body to interact with the entire piece , adding a depth , texture and powerful mystery to the paintings .
In doing this , he travels to a rather artistically dangerous zone .
Just how much should the model ’s form be allowed to influence the shape and direction of each piece ?
At what point does the body cross the line between canvas and subject ?
Each of Tracy ’s paintings seem to play with these limits , exploring the human form as both the focus of the painting and an incidental part of it .
Between those two extremes are many shades of grey , each of which is explored lovingly by the brush of the artist .
( all images used with permission of Craig Tracy )
The result of his playful and experimental approach to art and his obvious passion for what he does have made Craig Tracy one of the most respected contemporary body painting artists in the world .
If you ’d like to see more of the artist ’s work , Craig Tracy Gallery can be found in New Orleans .
It ’s the only gallery in the world dedicated to fine art images of body paintings , and it also features videos of the body painting process for those interested in seeing the paintings unfold .
Not since 1981 , when Wayne Gretzky broke important records held by Phil Esposito ( points ) , Bobby Orr ( assists ) , Maurice Richard and Mike Bossy ( fastest 50 goals ) , has one player made such a broad - spectrum assault on the record book in one calendar year as Martin Brodeur did in 2009 .
Unlike Gretzky , who in ' 81 was making his first assault on seasonal records and the storied names that held them , Brodeur was writing new sections on the career records page .
Not that that makes them any less impressive , but perhaps explains why his name was once again omitted when the Lou Marsh Award was being discussed .
Brodeur 's legacy is one of longevity , endurance , and consistent excellence over a very extended period .
The man has been a machine at compiling numbers across a very wide statistical spectrum .
Consider the following career milestones achieved by Brodeur in 2009 :
March 1 : Recorded his 100th career shutout with a 3 - 0 blanking of Philadelphia .
March 14 : Tied Patrick
Roy 's career record of 551 regular season
Wins by with a 3 - 1 victory right in Marty 's home town of Montreal over Roy 's old club Les Habitants .
March 17 : At next opportunity , set a new career Wins mark with his 552nd , a 3 - 2 home win over the Chicago Blackhawks .
April 23 : Tied Roy 's record of 23 playoff shutouts with a 44 - save , 1 - 0 win over Carolina .
November 4 : Tied Roy 's record of 997 career decisions in a 3 - 2 home win over Washington .
November 7 : Broke Roy 's record with his 998th career decision , a 3 - 2 win at Ottawa .
November 27 : Passed Roy 's record of 60,235 minutes played during a 2 - 1 shootout win at Boston .
December 7 : Tied Terry Sawchuk 's NHL record of 103 career shutouts with a 3 - 0 whitewash at Buffalo .
December 16 : Tied Roy 's record of 1,029 career GP during a 2 - 1 home win over Montreal .
December 18 : Broke Roy 's record with his 1,030th GP , a 4 - 2 win over Ottawa .
December 19 : Yanked after allowing 3 first period goals in Atlanta , recorded his first no-decision since November 10 , 2000 , crystallizing his personal mark at 571 consecutive games played with a decision .
This is NOT a record ( Sawchuk for one never had a no- decision until his 11th season ) but is surely a modern standard during the two - goalie era , likely by a very wide margin .
December 21 : Broke Sawchuk 's NHL record and tied George Hainsworth 's major league record with his 104th career shutout , a 4 - 0 blanking of the Stanley Cup champions right in Pittsburgh .
December 30 : Broke Hainsworth 's major league record with his 105th career shutout , a 2 - 0 home win over Pittsburgh .
Also was named to Canada 's Olympic team for the fourth time , a distinction he shares with just Chris Pronger in men's hockey .
( Hayley Wickenheiser , Jayna Hefford , Jennifer Botterill , and Becky Kellar have matched this feat on the womer 's side . )
That 's a pretty amazing last couple of months .
A common factor in all those games is that the Devils won them all , and by oh - so - typical scores .
The only one where they put as many as 5 goals on the board was that one anomaly in Atlanta , where Brodeur got pulled after the first period and the team roared back to take him off the hook , eventually winning 5 - 4 .
The Devils on the winning end of low - scoring games has been a frequent outcome since Brodeur 's arrival in Jersey in 1993 - 94 .
How frequent ?
Have a gander at the graph after the jump .
Click to enlarge .
The three lines on the graph represent the Devils standings Points ( blue ) , Goals For ( green ) and Goals Against ( red ) since 1987 .
All are expressed as a percentage of league average , meaning that variations in league wide goal - scoring and the darned Bettman point have both been factored out .
Note that the two positive values , points and GF , are expressed as NJD over league average ; whereas the negative one that is GA is expressed as the inverse of that ( league average over NJD ) .
Thus the objective in all three cases is to attain results greater than 100 % .
Note also how closely the team 's points mirrors its defensive record , with both being routinely excellent while offensive performance has been all over the map .
The years before Brodeur arrived the Devils were a slightly above average team .
In 1992 - 93 they scored at 101 % of the league rate , and defended at 102 % , for a points yield of 103.6 % above the league norm ( then a reliable .500 ) .
Brodeur arrived in ' 93 - 94 , winning the Calder Trophy .
The Devils ' defensive record immediately soared to 123.6 % of league and the team 's results soared right alongside , finishing second overall behind the New York Rangers , the club that eventually eliminated the Devils in the conference finals in 7th game double OT .
The following , lockout - shortened season , the Devils fared less well in the regular season , but rolled to a surprise Stanley Cup , starting every series on the road .
Brodeur held the opposition to 2 goals or fewer in all 16 Devils victories .
Many folks credited / blamed Jacques Lemaire 's notorious Neutral Zone Trap for this outcome , but the kid at the back end who fielded the shoot - ins and started the puck on its way out of the defensive zone again and again likely deserved more credit than he got at the time .
The next year the Devils were still powerful defensively , but the team 's offence completely tanked to just 83.3 % of league levels , and the squad missed the playoffs .
Scoring issues were subsequently addressed , and while rarely great , were never again so terrible .
The Devils have been a fixture in the playoffs ever since , as their defensive performance has fluctuated between merely excellent and truly outstanding , never once falling to within 10 % of league average during Brodeur 's stellar career , now in its 16th season .
The closest thing to a blip happened during the Robbie Ftorek / Larry Robinson years of 1998 - 2002 , when the Devils put an unaccustomed emphasis on offence .
Even during those seasons their defensive record remained strong , between 110 % to 116 % of league rates .
Brodeur 's save percentage took a bit of a hit during those four seasons , falling to just above the league average rather than his typical 10 to 15 points higher than that .
Based on that one category , some analysts - primarily those devotees of what I laughingly call the Church of Save Percentology - ascribe to him an extended mid-career slump .
I note that he carried on playing 70 + games annually , winning 40 + of those , plus a Stanley Cup , two Conference titles , and Olympic Gold during that span , as evidence he was still playing alright .
My own guess is that while that team excelled at shot prevention ( in large part due to Brodeur 's ongoing contributions in this respect ) , the shots they did allow against the flow of play perhaps tended to be of higher quality .
For sure the rest of Brodeur 's stats -- Wins , Shutouts , GAA -- suffered hardly at all ; it was like his batting average dropped from .340 to .310 while he kept right on scoring and driving in 125 runs a year .
In 2001 - 02 the Devils returned to their underscoring ways , so Lou Lamoriello fired Robinson , hired Kevin Constantine and turned the emphasis back to defensive play .
In 2003 they captured their third Cup , the second of which was achieved by a club that did n't score at even the league average rate .
Brodeur recorded 7 shutouts in the playoffs , breaking Dominik Hasek 's record of 6 in one postseason .
Subsequent Devils teams have struggled to reach league average scoring rates , while defensively the club has continued to excel .
After the lockout the club lost the core of its defence with the retirements of Scott Steves and Ken Daneyko and the free agent defections of Scott Niedermayer and Brian Rafalski , and by and large replaced them with a bunch of no -names .
Moreover , the New NHL featured a no - go trapezoid for goaltenders - widely known as the Brodeur Rule - which limited but hardly eliminated Brodeur 's outstanding strengths in puck retrieval and distribution .
New coaches followed with different systems , but one constant remained : Martin Brodeur , mainstay of the defence .
Despite all the changes the club 's defensive record remained strong , notably finishing second in the East in 2006 - 07 despite an offence that scored at just 89.3 % of the league rate ( 27th overall ) .
That season Brodeur won a remarkable 20 games in which his team scored 2 or fewer real goals .
Brodeur still has a few mountains to climb , notably in the playoffs where his impressive record nonetheless must play second fiddle to that of Patrick Roy , at least when measured in GP and Wins .
Next up is a mark for the asterisk crowd : Brodeur has won 33 games via shootout , a new wrinkle not in play during Roy 's career .
Thus Brodeur has 550 Wins in regulation or overtime , whereas Roy had 551 .
The record book has become shifting sands in Gary Bettman 's NHL ; all the guy can do is keep playing , and winning , by the rules , whatever they may be .
I 'm not here to say Marty Brodeur is the greatest goalie of all time - I 'll leave that to the eminent hockey people in the video at bottom .
From my perspective he 's still making his case , and statistically it is a strong one indeed .
After years of inexorable build - up he has begun to frequently overwrite some of the greatest names in the record book - Hainsworth , Sawchuk , Roy - with his own .
I do think the case can already be made that Martin Brodeur is the most efficient netminder the game has ever seen .
Stolen e-mails have revealed no scientific conspiracy , but do highlight ways in which climate researchers could be better supported in the face of public scrutiny .
The e-mail archives stolen last month from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) , UK , have been greeted by the climate - change - denialist fringe as a propaganda windfall ( see page 551 ) .
To these denialists , the scientists ' scathing remarks about certain controversial palaeoclimate reconstructions qualify as the proverbial ' smoking gun ' : proof that mainstream climate researchers have systematically conspired to suppress evidence contradicting their doctrine that humans are warming the globe .
This paranoid interpretation would be laughable were it not for the fact that obstructionist politicians in the US Senate will probably use it next year as an excuse to stiffen their opposition to the country 's much needed climate bill .
Nothing in the e-mails undermines the scientific case that global warming is real — or that human activities are almost certainly the cause .
That case is supported by multiple , robust lines of evidence , including several that are completely independent of the climate reconstructions debated in the e-mails .
First , Earth 's cryosphere is changing as one would expect in a warming climate .
These changes include glacier retreat , thinning and areal reduction of Arctic sea ice , reductions in permafrost and accelerated loss of mass from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets .
Second , the global sea level is rising .
The rise is caused in part by water pouring in from melting glaciers and ice sheets , but also by thermal expansion as the oceans warm .
Third , decades of biological data on blooming dates and the like suggest that spring is arriving earlier each year .
Denialists often maintain that these changes are just a symptom of natural climate variability .
But when climate modellers test this assertion by running their simulations with greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide held fixed , the results bear little resemblance to the observed warming .
The strong implication is that increased greenhouse - gas emissions have played an important part in recent warming , meaning that curbing the world 's voracious appetite for carbon is essential ( see pages 568 and 570 ) .
Mail trail
A fair reading of the e-mails reveals nothing to support the denialists ' conspiracy theories .
In one of the more controversial exchanges , UEA scientists sharply criticized the quality of two papers that question the uniqueness of recent global warming ( S. McIntyre and R. McKitrick Energy Environ .
14 , 751–771 ; 2003 and W. Soon and S. Baliunas Clim. Res. 23 , 89 –110 ; 2003 ) and vowed to keep at least the first paper out of the upcoming Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
Whatever the e-mail authors may have said to one another in ( supposed ) privacy , however , what matters is how they acted .
And the fact is that , in the end , neither they nor the IPCC suppressed anything : when the assessment report was published in 2007 it referenced and discussed both papers .
“ The theft highlights the harassment that denialists inflict on some climate - change researchers . ”
If there are benefits to the e-mail theft , one is to highlight yet again the harassment that denialists inflict on some climate - change researchers , often in the form of endless , time - consuming demands for information under the US and UK Freedom of Information Acts .
Governments and institutions need to provide tangible assistance for researchers facing such a burden .
The e-mail theft also highlights how difficult it can be for climate researchers to follow the canons of scientific openness , which require them to make public the data on which they base their conclusions .
This is best done via open online archives , such as the ones maintained by the IPCC ( http://www.ipcc-data.org) and the US National Climatic Data Center ( http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html).
Tricky business
But for much crucial information the reality is very different .
Researchers are barred from publicly releasing meteorological data from many countries owing to contractual restrictions .
Moreover , in countries such as Germany , France and the United Kingdom , the national meteorological services will provide data sets only when researchers specifically request them , and only after a significant delay .
The lack of standard formats can also make it hard to compare and integrate data from different sources .
Every aspect of this situation needs to change : if the current episode does not spur meteorological services to improve researchers ' ease of access , governments should force them to do so .
The stolen e-mails have prompted queries about whether Nature will investigate some of the researchers ' own papers .
One e-mail talked of displaying the data using a ' trick ' — slang for a clever ( and legitimate ) technique , but a word that denialists have used to accuse the researchers of fabricating their results .
It is Nature 's policy to investigate such matters if there are substantive reasons for concern , but nothing we have seen so far in the e-mails qualifies .
The UEA responded too slowly to the eruption of coverage in the media , but deserves credit for now being publicly supportive of the integrity of its scientists while also holding an independent investigation of its researchers ' compliance with Britain 's freedom of information requirements ( see http://go.nature.com/zRBXRP).
In the end , what the UEA e-mails really show is that scientists are human beings — and that unrelenting opposition to their work can goad them to the limits of tolerance , and tempt them to act in ways that undermine scientific values .
Yet it is precisely in such circumstances that researchers should strive to act and communicate professionally , and make their data and methods available to others , lest they provide their worst critics with ammunition .
After all , the pressures the UEA e-mailers experienced may be nothing compared with what will emerge as the United States debates a climate bill next year , and denialists use every means at their disposal to undermine trust in scientists and science .

Alan Power was accused of becoming aroused at work
A police employee who claimed he was sacked because he thought psychics could solve crimes was not a victim of discrimination , a tribunal ruled .
Alan Power , 62 , from Merseyside , had accused Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) of forcing him out of his job in 2008 because of his spiritual beliefs .
Despite winning a ruling that his views should be seen as a faith , the tribunal said GMP did not dismiss him unfairly .
" We welcome all races and religions , " a police spokesman said .
During the tribunal in Manchester it was claimed a number of reasons were behind him being sacked .
Frisking process
The tribunal heard the police law trainer , described as a " ghostbuster " , was playing the part of an arrested shoplifter during a session at Bruche police training college , near Warrington , in 2004 .
But he became visibly aroused during the frisking process .
A sergeant from Merseyside Police who witnessed the scene vowed never to use him again , and Cheshire Constabulary made the same decision because of his " inappropriate behaviour " , the tribunal heard .
The information only came to light in October 2008 after Mr Power , who denied the allegations , secured a job as a specialist trainer and a co-ordinator with GMP .
He was sacked three weeks later , with the force citing his " current work in the psychic field " as a reason .
It was also alleged Mr Power , who claimed to have seen ghosts since childhood , had distributed inappropriate research materials to Merseyside officers featuring the World Trade Center attacks .
Assistant Chief Officer Julia Rogers said : " GMP notes and fully supports the judge 's ruling .
" This matter has never been about Mr Power 's beliefs and we vehemently deny any claim he was discriminated against on those or any other grounds .
" GMP welcomes all races and religions and employs and actively recruits people with diverse beliefs and from many different ethnic backgrounds . "
In an earlier hearing , the employment tribunal said his psychic beliefs fell under the Employment Equality ( Religion or Belief ) Regulations 2003 .
Greater Manchester Police Authority had claimed his beliefs did not amount to religious views .

I want everyone to keep this thread as civil as possible .
I 'm not going to name names but there is a certain I want everyone to keep this thread as civil as possible .
I 'm not going to name names but there is a Flash fan and and Jaedong fan I hope to god do n't post in this thread .
Before you start reading the interview : Flash has moved on , so stop gay ' what if zomg ' or ' counter what if zomg '
UPDATE : KT Coach Lee Ji Hoon says
Flash misunderstood
( Hi Hoon , this is Wax following up for you )
the following quote from head coach Lee regarding the Flash 's statments :
" I think there 's a misunderstanding with Youngho ( Flash ) about KeSPA telling us there was a replay .
We requested a replay , but the power outage made it so one could n't be saved .
After that , what happened was that we asked for specific evidence supporting their decision ( to give Jaedong the decision victory ) , which was refused , so we requested a rematch .
The Association did not say that there was a replay . "
- How were you after the MSL Finals ?
▲ I just want to start off and say that this will be the absolute last time I will talk about this so I hope people can respect that too .
At the finals , I have expected everything except a game decision done by the Kespa refs .
When they decided that Jaedong won the match , I knew deep down inside I will lose the finals .
Any progamer in my shoes would 've lost the whole thing too after the decision .
- After the Kespa Refs made their decision , you left and talked with your coaching staff .
What did you talk about ?
▲ Frankly , I do not remember anything during that one hour .
All I could remember was asking myself “ what is going on ” and panicking .
I did n't know what to do after the 3rd game and all I could think about were my family and fans who came a long way from home to watch me play .
I even came to a point where I just wanted to forfeit my next match , but I could n't just leave because of what happened in my last match .
I lost everything at that moment ; confidence and will to do anything .
- At game 4 you played worse than usual .
Was it because of you previous game ?
▲ The whole decision done by kespa really got me down .
However , I can not blame my 3rd set for losing the 4th set .
Regardless of the outside factors , 4th set was a pure loss .
That is why after the 4th set I went up to Jaedong hyung and congratulated him as soon as possible .
But I still felt empty because of the refs .
- At set 1 , your heater was n't there
▲ At the first game my hands were near frozen .
I was so nervous and my cold hands made me lose set 1 in a disappointing fashion .
So my only choice was to get a heater as soon as possible .
- If set 3 was decided to be a rematch , what would 've happened ?
▲ If there was a rematch , it 's no secret that I would 've been at a huge advantage .
Jaedong hyung prepared a strange build but I also prepared a strange build too .
Also , the map is so good for Terran .
However , the decision has already been made ...
It 's just depressing .
We were having such a good game too .
It 's so depressing it had to end that way .
- Both fanbases are still arguing who would 've won the game or not
▲ It really is a sad sight to see .
[ T/N : Unlike foreign fanbases ( SHAME ON YOU FOREIGN FANBASES )
I 'm not saying this because I lost , but I seriously was at a decent situation at that point .
That 's why it made me so depressed .
After the finals a lot of people told me while practicing that “ You were at a decent situation ” which made me angrier .
His call was unfair to me .
But this is n't the real reason why this whole thing made me angry .
I know I 'll eventually get over the decision , but what truly made it difficult for me to get over this was their attitude .
3 Referees came up to and told me “ We saw the replay , it 's over . ”
But then our coaching staff found out that there was no replay at all .
When we confronted them with this evidence , they did n't answer our question and told us “ we saw all your mineral , gas and all your units count behind you . ”
You were there too journalists sirs , the refs were nowhere near us .
I do n't think anybody can see the mineral count that far away .
They lied to us yet they just acted like nothing happened .
All I ask for is an apology from the referees , yet instead of the referees apologizing to us their boss apologized instead .
When the higher ups were apologizing , the refs just stood there staring blankly at us .
I saw the same 3 referees today , and this time they ignored us and kept fooling around with each other and laughing .
It was so absurd .
- You saw Jaedong today
▲ I did see him today , although it did feel really awkward .
I did n't have a chance to talk to him , but before I was sent to play we saw each other for a second .
We both smiled and exchanged greetings .
Even though I congratulated Jaedong hyung at the MSL finals , I 'm still the loser of the finals so I guess there is no other choice but to be awkward .
But we 're best friends so as time goes by the awkwardness will eventually all vanish .
I will make sure I 'll get to the finals next season and not to mention Jaedong Hyung promised me to buy me food when he wins !
After the OSL RO8 I kept my promise with Jaedong hyung and bought him a nice dinner too .
- Is there anything you wanted to say about the MSL finals that you could n't ?
▲ This will be the last time I 'll be doing an interview related to the whole MSL final , I hope the journalists can respect my decision .
I just wish this will never happen to anybody from now on .
- Last words ?
▲ A lot of my fans are worried , but I won the OSL and got a silver medal which is more than I expected from myself .
Also I still believe there is a lot of room for improvement for me .
This is not a tragedy for me , but a whole new experience in the path of my life .
Hopefully all of these things will help me become a better player .
Our team owner came up to me and told me “ This is an experience no other player can ever experience .
Think of this whole thing as a trial for you to become a great player . ”
Many people cheered me up so I will try my best to challenge dual league finals once again .
Also I just want to say Jaedong hyung better be ready .
I 'm going to order the most expensive dinner in Korea ( laughs ) .

Former Heisman Trophy winner Herschel Walker last played football in 1997 .
He ’s now 47 , an age when many ex-NFL players already are hobbled by arthritis and other degenerative ailments .
But not Walker .
Despite what he cheerfully describes as “ my advanced years , ” he has come to San Jose to train for a new career in the burgeoning brutal sport of mixed martial arts .
He ’s scheduled to climb inside a steel cage for his debut Jan. 30 in Miami .
And , yes , he knows everyone has a simple question :
What the heck are you thinking ?
“ I would n’t have gotten into this if I did n’t know I could do it , ” said Walker , a fifth - degree black belt in tae kwon do .
“ I can fight . ”
Walker added that he does n’t need more money or publicity .
But he does need competition .
That ’s why he now is spending his days sweating with other MMA fighters at San Jose ’s American Kickboxing Academy , which has become a hub for the emerging sport .
One grueling session this week saw him repeatedly punching and kicking a heavy bag , then grappling with rising heavyweight star Cain Velasquez , who is 20 years his junior .
Although there are hints of his age in his facial features , Walker looks just as athletic as when he was a workhorse running back who retired as the NFL’s No. 2 combined - yardage leader — right down to a sculpted physique featuring washboard abs .
“ I understand why people would hear that he wants to fight and say , ‘ Yeah , right , ’ ” said American Kickboxing Academy head trainer Javier Mendez .
“ But he ’s not a 47 - year - old man .
He ’s got the body of a 20 - year - old .
He ’s absolutely ripped .
He ’s not normal .
He ’s one of a kind . ”
Football legend , Olympian , danseur
Walker was one of the most heralded running backs in football history .
He won the 1982 Heisman at Georgia before playing 15 pro seasons .
Despite eye - catching statistics like once rushing for 1,514 yards with Dallas , Walker is most remembered for the blockbuster 1989 trade where the Cowboys sent him to Minnesota for five players and six draft picks .
He also could evade conventional thinking as deftly as would - be tacklers , always marching to the beat of his own drummer .
A world - class sprinter , he competed in the two - man bobsled at the 1992 Winter Olympics .
He danced ballet .
He now owns a food company and earlier this year appeared on “ The Celebrity Apprentice ” reality TV show .
In 2008 , Walker also created a stir with the memoir “ Breaking Free , ” which asserted he had suffered for years with dissociative identity disorder , a controversial mental illness also known as multiple personality disorder .
He described how the condition nearly drove him to suicide , destroyed his marriage and is the reason he does n’t remember winning the Heisman .
But treatment brought the disorder under control , he said .
“ When the book first came out , everybody would look at me and make a cross with their fingers like I was a vampire because of the stigma , ” said Walker , a Dallas resident .
“ Now when I walk in an airport , I have five people come up to me and start telling their story like I ’m Dr. Walker . ”
He even uses the condition to poke fun at himself as he talks about his MMA goal .
“ This will be my 20 - year - old personality fighting in the cage , ” Walker joked .
“ The 40 - year - old one wo n’t come back out until afterward . ”
One reason Walker wants to fight is simply because he can .
Always a fitness fanatic , he has stayed in supreme condition with a daily workout regimen highlighted by 3,500 sit-ups and from 750 to 1,500 push - ups .
He eats one meal a day — mostly salads and soups , and never red meat — and sleeps only three to four hours a night .
“ I could still play football today , ” said Walker , who is 6 - foot - 1 and 217 pounds .
“ Now I could n’t take every snap .
I ’ve slowed down a little bit , but I ’m still faster than 80 percent of the guys in the league .
That ’s why I know I can step into the cage . ”
‘ Green ’ but driven , Walker ‘ no joke ’
MMA combines elements of martial arts , boxing and wrestling .
And San Jose has become something of a mecca for the sport as it gains mainstream acceptance .
The promotion company Strikeforce , which is putting on Walker ’s fight , is based here .
He decided to temporarily move to San Jose because the American Kickboxing Academy gym is one of the country ’s top fight camps .
“ He ’s no joke , ” Mendez said of Walker .
“ He ’s green .
But he ’s got unbelievable ability and is really , really strong .
He also has a willingness to learn .
You can see why he was such a great football player .
He wo n’t shy away from anything . ”
The September announcement that Walker had signed with Strikeforce raised eyebrows .
But one person all but chortled with laughter — Dana White , the outspoken leader of Ultimate Fighting Championship , the sport ’s top promotion company and a Strikeforce competitor .
“ Freak show ” also is how he dismissively refers to a Walker bout .
“ He ’s too old for football , but he thinks he ’s young enough to fight ? ”
White added .
“ Fighting is a young man ’s sport .
You need speed , agility , explosiveness .
All that stuff goes away with age . ”
Walker is aware of the taunting .
“ Dana is just mad because he ’s not the only show in town , and that ’s fine , ” said Walker , who plans to donate his MMA earnings to charity .
“ But he really does n’t know what kind of athlete I am . ”
The plan is for him to spend the next two months at the American Kickboxing Academy , proving to trainers Mendez and Bob Cook that he ’s ready .
For now , Walker is a rookie again .
New fighters at the gym have to do chores , which is why Walker will be cleaning equipment Sunday morning .
“ He does n’t complain and has n’t expected any special privileges , which is good because he ’s gotten none , ” Mendez said .
After a workout , Walker was thanking Velasquez and other fighters for their help .
“ I might not be up to the best fighters yet , ” Walker said .
“ But I ’ll tell you what : I ’m working at it . ”

The following is a guest contribution .
Reuters is not responsible for the content and the views expressed are the authors ’ alone .
Dr H.A. Hellyer is Fellow of the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations , University of Warwick , author of “ Muslims of Europe : the ‘ Other ’ Europeans ” and Director of the Visionary Consultants Group .
By Dr H.A. Hellyer
The real inheritors of European liberalism need to stand up and make themselves known because the struggle to maintain pluralism in Europe is only going to get tougher from here on in .
People will differ as to when they started , and why , and who is to blame .
But one thing is for sure .
The problems in Europe around the Muslim presence are not going to go away – they are going to intensify .
And real European liberals are going to have make their voices be counted , or say farewell to a Europe that fought so hard to ensure civil liberties and freedom could find homes on the continent .
It did not have to be this way , but the tell - tale signs have been there for a very long while .
For years now , there have been two main set of trends that have been increasingly worrying , and which now have intersected with each other to produce a scenario that people should have tried to avoid .
The first was the movement of the political spectrum towards the far - right .
Let ’s be clear – it is not that the far - right suddenly became a lot more popular , and a lot of votes were cast in their favour .
That , in one respect , would have been more manageable .
The real success of the far - right has been to affect the national agenda itself , and make elements of their own political program more palatable to voters in mainstream political parties all across Europe .
We see it in the UK , in how a lot of mainstream political discourse has changed , in order to keep votes away from the far - right like the British National Party ( BNP ) .
We see it in France , where mainstream politicians now openly say things in regards to immigration and Muslim minority groups that years ago only far - right politicians would ever utter .
There are many examples across the board and in this regard , mainstream political parties have a lot to answer for .
Instead of dealing with the issues that the far - right brought up , which stirred up fears ( often baseless , but fears nonetheless ) of huge swathes of the local populations , they chose to focus more on their political survival , and allow populism to disproportionately influence national debates on the Muslim presence .
And that Muslim presence is now the test Europe must face in order to decide once and for all – is this a continent for all , or are some more equal than others ?
The second trend has also been strategically rather abysmal .
Muslim communities in Europe , by and large , originate ( not exclusively though ) in migrations that took place in the 1970s and since then .
For very normal political and historical reasons , the left - wing focused on getting their support , and the Muslim community was naturally more endeared to parties that spoke to their rights as members of the labour class .
All well and good , particularly when the left wing began to swing back into power in the 1990s .
But no party stays in power forever .
Towards the beginning of the 21st century , one could see the right wing coming back , and the influence of the far - right impinging disproportionately on national discourse across Europe .
Muslim communities had not , for normal reasons , vested a lot of time and effort in building coalitions that focused on the right - wing .
As a result , Muslim voices are rare and few , making their influence understandably insignificant in directing the debate , even when it is about them .
These trends are continuing , and their intersections are going to continue to erupt like little earthquakes for years to come – hence the ban on minarets in Switzerland .
But herein lies a great opportunity .
Real European liberals , if they understand what is going on , can make a real difference , if they move quickly .
The situation in Switzerland caused consternation among so many different sectors of society , within and without Switzerland .
The political elite and the media were broadly against the ban .
If an organised movement of Swiss citizens can make the argument that this is bad for Switzerland , ethically and morally , and create a coalition that reaches all sectors of societies , including Muslim Swiss , it could make a real difference .
The ban itself is immaterial – another referendum can simply cancel out the one that just took place .
But it is important that be done as the final move in a campaign that seeks to co-ordinate elements in civil society , political life and the grassroots that support a Switzerland for all its citizens .
And ultimately , a Europe that we can all be proud of , regardless of our race or creed .
The reality is that this could be quite easy – huge swathes of public opinion all over Europe are shocked at what happened .
But the case needs to be made that this is not an isolated incident , but a sign that not all is well and good in Europe .
There are fears , perceived or otherwise , and there is the need for liberals , Muslim and non-Muslim alike , to take advantage of the situation by really offering a better alternative to the fear - mongering and scare tactics that we saw in the run up to this minarets vote .
Or indeed , to the now emerging discourse in France , where it seems this small and relatively powerless religious minority is being accused of having the ability to bring down the Republic .
Just recently , the French President told the Muslim community in clear terms that they would have to be less ‘ visible ’ in order to be integrated .
What citizen is ever told that ?
Religion does cause many in Europe to have second thoughts – and Islam in particular .
In that regard , Muslims are a bit unique ( although probably only a minority even practices Islam regularly ) .
But Muslim Europeans are Europeans , and they do not appear to be going anywhere .
We Europeans have to make our choice now , and decide whether we are going to go down the path of intolerance , or if we are going to carve a fresh future for ourselves , our children and generations to come .

A new and previously unknown species of spider has been discovered in the dune of the Sands of Samar in the southern Arava region of Israel by a team of scientists from the Department of Biology in the University of Haifa - Oranim .
Unfortunately , however , its habitat is endangered .
" The discovery of this new spider illustrates our obligation to preserve the dune , " says Dr. Shanas , who headed the team of scientists .
The Sands of Samar are the last remaining sand dune in Israeli territory in the southern Arava region .
In the past , the sands stretched across some 7 square kilometers , but due to the rezoning of areas for agriculture and sand quarries , the sands have been reduced to fewer than 3 square kilometers .
During a course of studies that Dr. Shanas 's research team has carried out in the region , they discovered this new spider , a member of the Cerbalus genus .
Since it has been found in the Arava , it has been given the name Cerbalus aravensis .
The researchers say that this spider 's leg - span can reach up to 14 cm. , which makes it the largest spider of its type in the Middle East .
Even though details are still lacking to enable a full analysis of its biology and of its population in the sands , the scientists know that this is a nocturnal spider , mostly active in the hottest months of the year , and that it constructs an underground den which is closed with a " lifting door " made of sand particles that are glued together to camouflage the den .
The scientists ' excitement is indeed mixed with apprehension .
According to Dr. Shanas , the Israel Land Administration intends to renew mining projects in the Sands of Samar in the near future , which will endanger the existence of the newly discovered spider .
He adds that it is possible that there are additional unknown animal species living in the sands , and therefore efforts should be made to preserve this unique region in the Arava .
" The new discovery shows how much we still have to investigate , and that there are likely to be many more species that are unknown to us .
If we do not preserve the few habitats that remain for these species , they will become extinct before we can even discover them , " Dr. Shanas concludes .
It was Michael Atherton 's monumental masterpiece .
He scored 185 not out ; the innings lasted 643 minutes ; he faced 492 balls ; and he felt as fresh as a daisy at the end of it all .
Atherton wrote at the start of a chapter in his autobiography , Opening Up : " If he is lucky , a batsman may once play an innings that defines him ; one that , whether he likes it or not , he will be remembered for . "
The 185 was his innings and that chapter was simply entitled " Johannesburg " .
Cricket followers needed no more explanation .
It was 1995 , England 's first tour to South Africa since the end of apartheid , and it was one of the greatest match - saving knocks ever played by an England captain .
Or by any captain .
Now it is tempting to think that such an innings could never be repeated .
Atherton acknowledges that this may well be the case , but not for the obvious reason .
" There are several players around now who could play that type of innings .
Andrew Strauss could .
I 'm sure Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid could .
So might Mike Hussey .
But they probably would not do so .
Today they would be going for the win .
" In 1995 we never thought about winning that Test .
It never occurred to us that it was feasible .
That 's changed .
Expectations have risen .
Sides have proven that you can chase 400 - plus successfully . "
At Johannesburg in the second Test of the series after a much - criticised , delayed declaration by Hansie Cronje , England , having been outplayed from the start of the match , required a notional 479 for victory in just over five sessions .
They finished on 351 for five having faced 165 overs .
To win , England would not even have needed to score at three runs per over .
Today Tendulkar , Dravid , Hussey and even Strauss might have fancied their chances of victory .
Virender Sehwag certainly would have done .
His blitz in Mumbai on Thursday , in which he smashed 284 in less than a day from 239 balls against Sri Lanka , meant he has now hit three of the four fastest double centuries in Test history .
Sehwag , more than anyone , epitomises how the approach to batting has been overhauled in the 21st century .
As a teenager he might have admired Atherton 's epic .
He shows no sign of wishing to emulate it .
The advent of Twenty20 is one reason for the revolution ; it has opened up the horizons of batsmen .
The elimination of risk is no longer the highest priority , except in remote pockets of Yorkshire .
Three weeks ago South Africa 's Twenty20 batsmen knocked up 185 in 70 minutes on their way to amassing 241 in 20 overs at Centurion .
It took Atherton almost 11 hours to get that far .
Yet in the grand scheme of things Atherton 's innings will remain far longer in the memory .
A Twenty20 match is too short to permit a truly epic performance , which Atherton 's certainly was .
By the end of it everyone in Johannesburg was in awe of a new cricketing superstar , albeit a scruffy , shy , self - effacing one .
Fourteen years on Atherton says : " Whenever I do see old footage , it feels like a different person out there .
It 's like an out - of - body experience .
It 's as if I 'm watching somebody else .
I dread to think what I 'd say now if I were commentating on that innings .
Contrary to what many thought , I was a technically flawed batsman .
I think I 'd have to point that out . "
But he was at his peak , aged 27 , still unencumbered by the back problems that would restrict his movement at the crease in the second half of his career , and in his own low - key way he was striving to lead England to some brave new world , just as Strauss is doing now .
In many ways it seems more than 14 years ago , a more colourful , haphazard time in which the captain had to bear more of the brunt on tour .
John Barclay , an Old Etonian , a former Sussex captain and the current president of the MCC , was the tour manager ; Raymond Illingworth of Pudsey was there as chairman of selectors and coach and some of the time he was assisted by two hand - picked ( by Illingworth ) colleagues from his generation , Peter Lever and John Edrich .
And there was a physio , a scorer and a doctor who , Atherton concluded in his tour report , did not have enough to do .
On the first day of the tour , while the players were concentrating on physical work at the Wanderers in Johannesburg , Illingworth and his fellow coaches popped round the corner for a round of golf .
Somehow Illingworth , in the weeks before the tour was able to do several , well - remunerated articles in the Sun outlining the defects of some of England 's cricketers .
This was another era .
Once the tour was under way it became apparent that Illingworth could not get on with Devon Malcolm , who could not get on with Lever , either .
Atherton and Illingworth could get on OK – they were often bridge partners – but had numerous disagreements over the cricket .
Meanwhile Barclay , who became a lifelong friend of Atherton , buzzed around trying to keep everyone heading in the same direction .
" It was a happy dressing room , I think , " Atherton says , " but there was plenty of colour and niggle .
It would have been interesting to write about . "
Atherton is now the consummate media man , eager for a bit of spice at press conferences , which represents a considerable change of priorities to when he was captain .
He admires the two Andys – Strauss and Flower – enormously , but as a journalist he just wishes that they were not quite so sensible .
Dear old Illy never failed to provide good copy .
The first Test of the tour at Centurion had been a rain - ruined draw , in which Graeme Hick played one of his best innings for England , 141 , which would soon be forgotten after a thunderstorm prevented South Africa from having to bat in the match .
At the Wanderers in the second Test England , having chosen to bowl first , squandered the new ball .
South Africa took a first - innings lead of 132 , which was extended to 478 when Cronje , eager that Brian McMillan should reach his century , belatedly declared 27 minutes before lunch on the fourth day .
So began the first of Atherton 's great duels with Allan Donald .
( The reprise took place at Trent Bridge in 1998 .
There Atherton survived an appeal – justified – for a gloved catch , afterwards signing the offending glove for Donald to raffle in his benefit year . )
Atherton talked me through his innings at the Wanderers two days after the match and we decided that the barrage from Donald was reminiscent of the spell he faced from Courtney Walsh in Jamaica in 1994 .
On that occasion Walsh bowled 14 ferocious consecutive overs , not resting until he had got his man .
" Donald bowled as quick as you can get , " Atherton said then , " as quick as Walsh but he was not so hostile .
Nor was the crowd .
Every time Donald bounced me I made a conscious decision to stare at him , to make eye contact and let him know I was n't cowed .
After a while that became an automatic reaction . "
Shaun Pollock , in his first
Test series , was equally tricky , but with Alec Stewart as his partner , 75 runs were scored at a good rate at the start of England 's second innings .
Atherton found himself hooking the short balls .
" It was n't intentional .
There is a balance between being pumped up and controlled and maybe Stewie and I were too aggressive for a while . "
They were not going for the win , of course , merely trying to assert themselves against a fired - up South Africa attack .
But soon Stewart was bowled by McMillan .
Mark Ramprakash , in one of his hopeless phases as an England batsman , followed two balls later , driving wildly .
" There was no point in my worrying about Ramps ' state of mind out in the middle , " Atherton recalls now .
" I went to see him that night . "
Atherton alone appeared up to the task .
Graham
Thorpe scored one run in 18 overs after tea before succumbing to the first ball he faced from Meyrick Pringle ; Hick soon became Donald 's 100th Test wicket .
At the close England were a precarious 167 for four , with Atherton 82 not out .
That night Atherton dined – and drank a few glasses of wine – with Stewart and Thorpe at Tokyo's , a Japanese restaurant a short walk from the team hotel .
He slept well and woke early .
Looking back now Atherton recalls that he was not great at resuming an innings the next day .
" Sometimes I would shut myself away , avoid alcohol , do all the right things and get out straight away the next morning .
Later on I realised I needed to get out of the room , to stop thinking about cricket .
Strauss has had a similar problem , often failing to get going the following morning . "
Maybe he should take note .
However , Atherton was not so fluent on the resumption of play .
" My feet were moving across rather than down the pitch . "
He was usually motionless between deliveries , relaxing and conserving his energy , but even he tried some Robin Smith - style skips to get his body moving ( Smith was now his partner ) .
He nudged to 99 , aware that he had been dismissed twice for 99 in his Test career .
He clipped a short ball from Donald off his hip .
" When I hit it I thought that 's three . "
In fact it hit the midriff of Gary Kirsten at short leg and bounced to the ground .
" It would have been an unlucky dismissal .
But the adrenalin was pumping now .
I was waiting for a short one next ball . "
It duly arrived and Atherton hooked it for four .
He embraced a startled Smith , who expected Atherton to show his customary reserve in his celebrations – " I just released all my emotions for a minute or so . "
Now the fluency returned .
But at 11.45 am
Smith was out , caught at third man .
Enter Jack Russell .
Meanwhile in the dressing room Dominic Cork sat next to Angus Fraser , watching the game on television .
Superstition demanded that he stayed in the same seat for the next five hours , rising only in between overs to stretch and go to the loo .
Somehow Russell survived until lunch .
Atherton ate spaghetti , browsed through the papers , did not bother with a shower and carefully fixed Thorpe 's grille to his own helmet ( a bouncer from Pringle had dented his ) .
He said to Russell : " They 'll start twitching if they do n't get a wicket in this session . "
In the afternoon Russell looked more secure .
After mid-session drinks the 12th man , Richard Illingworth , reported back to the dressing room : " Jack 's looking knackered but Athers is as fresh as a daisy . "
Atherton described his state of mind in his autobiography .
" By the afternoon , and for the only time in my career I was in the zone .
It is a state much talked about by sports psychologists and while I can describe my feeling , I could n't begin to explain how to replicate it … I was in an almost trance - like state .
It was a state of both inertia and intense concentration and I knew that I was in total control and they could n't get me out . "
They could not get Russell out , either .
" At tea the mood in the dressing room was still tense but more upbeat , " Atherton says .
" We had come so far that the thought of losing the match made me sick in the stomach .
This was a different sort of pressure , the worst kind .
Now it would be a massive cock - up if we failed to save the game . "
Cork , still in the same chair , experienced the same agonies .
By now the South Africans were flagging , too exhausted to make much use of the third new ball .
When the bails were removed Atherton had the energy to run from the field .
" Bob Woolmer [ the South Africa coach ] congratulated me graciously , the players engulfed me , Illy gave me a handshake . "
But do not take that to mean that Illingworth was only mildly impressed .
It 's is just that he and his generation did not do embraces .
He said that Atherton 's innings was " one of the greatest ever played – I have never seen a better or gutsier knock … I have often said that there is a lot of Geoff Boycott in Mike and he proved it that day . "
Fourteen years ago , our own Kevin Mitchell made a similar comparison in these pages .
" There is one Englishman in South Africa who could once have done what Atherton did ( possibly still could ) – but it is doubtful if the nation would have wrapped Geoffrey Boycott in as ample and loving a hug as it did the man from Lancashire . "
For Atherton that evening there were drinks aplenty , with Ian Botham among others .
Back at the hotel Russell , to his astonishment , was reunited with his wife , Aileen , surreptitiously flown out that day to South Africa by Barclay .
Atherton was excused the next match at Paarl .
Instead he was taken fly - fishing by Barclay for the first time in his life and he soon discovered that he liked it , which was not so surprising .
You need patience in abundance for that as well .

Morality police targeted New Year 's revellers
Fifty - two unmarried couples could face charges of sexual misconduct and jail terms after being caught in hotel rooms by Malaysia 's Islamic morality police .
Scores of officers conducted raids on budget hotels on New Year 's Day in the western state of Selangor .
Those detained in the early hours of New Year 's Day were mainly students and young factory workers .
The Muslim couples are expected to be charged with the offence of close proximity , or Khalwat .
Under Malaysia's Islamic Sharia Law , couples who are not married to each other should not be in a secluded area or confined space , which could give rise to suspicion that they were engaged in immoral acts .
A spokesman for the Selangor State Islamic Department says they chose New Year 's Day because many people are known to commit this offence when celebrating a major holiday .
If convicted , the couples could get a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a fine .
Sharia laws in Malaysia apply only to Muslims , who make up over half the population .
Caracas , January 19 , 2009 ( venezuelanalysis.com ) – Venezuela ’s Superintendency of Banks and Other Financial Institutions ( SUDEBAN ) announced that it has taken over three small private banks , InverUnion , Banco Del Sol and Mi Casa due to “ serious ” administrative problems on Monday .
“ The three entities have been subject to administrative action by the Supervisory Authority and their intervention has become necessary and urgent as their required recovery plans are not considered to be viable , ” a SUDEBAN statement said .
The statement cited “ serious administrative and managerial problems ” in all three banks , “ which has left them in a situation of illiquidity that does not allow them to cover their obligations in the short term . ”
The auditors will decide whether rehabilitation is possible .
If not , the banks will be liquidated , in which case the Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund ( FOGADE ) will guarantee customers savings .
“ The government and financial authorities of the country will continue their efforts to ensure the health and stability of the domestic financial system and the protection of the rights and savings of all citizens , ” the SUDEBAN statement continued .
The latest interventions follow government takeovers of eight small private banks after a fraud scandal in the country ’s banking sector in November and December last year .
Of the banks taken over , Canarias Bank , BanPro , Baninvest and Banco Realwere liquidated , while Confederado , Banco Bolivar , Banorte , and Central Banco Universal , were nationalised and merged with the state - owned bank Banfoandes , to form a new public investment bank called , Banco Bicentenario .
Ten bankers and public functionaries were arrested as a result of the scandal , including Ricardo Fernández Barrueco ( former owner of Canarias Bank ) , Arné Chacón Escamillo , ( the owner of Banco Real and brother of former Science and Technology Minister Jesse Chacon ) , and Antonio Márquez , ( the former president of the National Securities Commission ) .
Judicial orders were also issued prohibiting a further 28 banking executives from leaving the country pending the outcome of the investigations .
However , it is believed that 23 of the bankers have fled the country , including Alejandro Uzcátegui , a member of the board of directors of Banco Real and also president of Entrepreneurs for Venezuela ( Empreven ) , - a nominally pro-government business federation .
The bankers are thought to be located in the United States , Spain , and Curacao .
In an unrelated case , the Criminal Chamber of the Supreme Court announced on January 18 an that it is initiating extradition proceedings for the former international operations manager of Canarias Bank , Ramon Javier Claparol Amposta who is in Spain and is wanted on charges of aggravated and continuous fraud and forging of bank documents .
SUDEBAN also sanctioned a further 10 banks on Tuesday with fines totalling more than 23 million bolivars , or US $ 5.34 million ( at the 4.3 bolivar exchange rate ) , for failing to comply , during 2009 , with financing regulations in the agricultural sector established by the Law of Credit for the Agricultural Sector .
The banks sanctioned include private banks ; Banco Sofitasa Banco Universal , Banco Guayana , Bancos Carona , Banplus , Banco Federal , Banvalor Banco Comercial , Interunión Banco Comercial , Totalbank , Banco del Sur Banco Universal and the state - owned Banco de Venezuela .
Oh sure , Boeing 's new 787 Dreamliner is made of composite materials and it's super fuel efficient , but unless you own an airline , the only thing you care about is how comfortable it is .
Boeing knows this , and has striven to give passengers an experience unlike any other airplane .
The aerospace company decided an all - new airplane needs an all - new interior and went all - out to make the 787's interior as innovative as its airframe , aerodynamics and engines .
From the air you breath to the turbulence you ( wo n’t ) feel to the windows you look through , the passenger experience promises to provide something new at every stage of your flight .
“ When you go inside a 787 mockup , you get this ' wow ! ' " said airline analyst Scott Hamilton , who got to see a demo interior at Boeing 's facility near Seattle .
You know the 787 is something different the moment you step inside .
Boeing wastes no time giving passengers a new experience .
As soon as you board the Dreamliner , you 're greeted by an open area just inside the door .
The ceiling resembles a skylight , complete with blue LED lighting that mimics the sky .
" They 've designed this kind of lounge area instead of coming in next to a galley , " Hamilton says .
" It really gives you a welcoming area instead of entering into somebody 's kitchen . "
Of course , it 's up to the airlines buying the planes to decide what you see , and some of them way well modify the boarding area and other features of the plane .
But even if they muck it up completely , there 's still a lot of " wow " in the 787 cabin .
The onboard lighting is one of the coolest features .
Anyone who has flown across more than a couple of time zones knows how difficult it is to sleep , and to be awakened with the flick of a switch that floods the cabin in fluorescent white light .
Boeing 's LEDs allow the crew to adjust the lighting to match different phases of the flight .
Boarding Lighting
The light is fairly standard during boarding and while cruising .
During meals it is adjusted to warmer tones .
Once you 're done eating and want to tilt the seat back and relax , the cabin can be bathed in a relaxing lavender hue .
When it 's time to sleep , the lights are turned way down .
But it 's how the crew wakes you that 's the best part of the Dreamliner 's lighting .
Instead of flicking the lights on and flooding the cabin in light , the cabin will brighten slowly , with the light transitioning from the purples and oranges of a sunrise to yellows , and eventually white against a blue sky .
Boeing 's thought is mimicking the light schedule of your destination , some of the dreaded jet lag can be alleviated
Dining Lighting
Sleep time brings up another innovation .
Gone is that dreaded moment when , after you finally fall asleep , that passenger in the window seat raises the shade to make sure the Pacific Ocean is still there and fills the cabin with sunlight .
The windows of the 787 do n't have shades .
They use an electrochromic dimmable system .
You can let in all the light you want – or none at all – at the flick of a switch .
Of course , the crew has a master switch , so when it ’s time to sleep , that guy in the window seat can only get just enough light to confirm the Pacific has n’t gone anywhere without bothering everybody else .
Sleep Lighting
He 'll have a better view , too .
The 787's windows are 65 percent bigger than the windows in other planes .
Boeing made them taller , so kids and NBA players can enjoy the same view as the average passenger .
Boeing spent a lot of time focusing on how passenger 's perceive the cabin .
Let ’s face it – you 're sitting in a tube .
It 's only so big – the fuselage is 18 feet 11 inches wide – and there 's only so much space you can use .
Things are always a little more spacious in first class , but Boeing wanted to make sure even those of us crammed into coach feel like we have more room .
To do that , Boeing 's designers gave the 787 an open , airy design .
It 's another reason for the skylight - like lighting .
" The upper ceiling designs are arched in such a fashion that you get a much more open feeling than you do in a typical wide - body airplane , ” " Hamilton says .
Even the overhead bins have been redesigned .
To accommodate the trend of more carry - on bags due to baggage fees and the unwillingness of some passengers to part with their luggage , Boeing made the bins about 30 percent bigger .
They 're easier to load because they lower when opened and tuck away when raised .
That should be a big help for people who do n't understand what a carry - on should be and make it easier for the rest of us to stash our stuff and get out of the aisle .

The composite structure of the 787 means the Dreamliner is lighter and more aerodynamic , which is a boon for airlines .
But the composite construction means the airframe is n't prone to corrosion like aluminum .
That means the crew can increase the humidity of the cabin , reducing that parched feeling you have after a long flight .
And thanks again to the composite fuselage , the interior cabin pressure can be increased .
This means the cabin will be pressurized to an altitude of 6,000 feet instead of the typical 8,000 feet .
These combined factors should make breathing much more comfortable and lead to fewer headaches , fatigue and other health issues common to many passengers .
Another factor that often leads to headaches and general annoyance is noise , especially if you 're sitting behind the engines .
The new serrated engine nacelles on the 787 make the plane quieter – both for passengers and those who live in the plane 's flight path .
Even the fan blades inside the engine are designed to be quieter .
One of the more innovative passenger comfort systems on the 787 is the computer - controlled turbulence - reduction system .
Boeing claims the Smoother Ride Technology will provide an eight - fold reduction in the number of people experiencing motion sickness .
Sensors throughout the airplane detect subtle changes in air pressure indicative of turbulence and direct the fly - by - wire flight controls to move flaperons on the wings to counter the vertical motion .
It wo n't eliminate all the bumps , but Boeing says it will work especially well on the moderate turbulence that causes most airsickness .

All of this technology puts the 787 well ahead of the competition , Hamilton says .
He points out that if you only know the standard airline interior , you wo n't feel like you 're missing anything .
But even the most modern of interiors in other airplanes does n’t compare .
" Airbus had done a complete makeover of the A320 interior in 2007 , " Hamilton says .
" But it 's a conventional looking interior .
It 's very good , but having been inside the 787 , you just get that ' wow ' factor . "
And the new interiors will make the airlines happy as well .
From the windows to the bathrooms and everything in between , the 787 interior is designed to be easier to clean and cheaper to repair or replace .
The Dreamliner is two years overdue and Boeing has lost orders because of those delays .
But Hamilton and others say once the flight test is finished and the first loads of passengers have flown on the new airplane , most of the bad memories should be erased .
He says there are likely to be a few more hiccups between now and then , but is confident both the airlines and the flying public will appreciate the new design .
" Boeing is going to have a real winner on its hands , " he says .
We 'll find out in nine months .
That 's when Japan 's All Nippon Airways starts service with the first passenger carrying 787 .

Xeni asked me to give a brief analysis of her earlier post on the International Olympic Committee 's decision regarding sex tests for athletes like South African sprinter Caster Semenya .
Caster is one of the millions of people in the world who challenge our simplistic male / female sex binary by their very existence .
Most intersex people are unremarkable in appearance ; in fact , many people who would be classified as intersex do not even know it .
The only time it becomes an issue is when they are subject to our prevailing reproductive ideology , which organizes the world around procreation .
People like Caster are so controversial because they challenge many of the most deeply - held beliefs people have about sex .
The comments sections in my recent posts here show what a hot - button topic reproduction is , even among techno - progressives , hipsters , and people who are on the leading edge of other critical 21st - century paradigm shifts .
Reproduction as well as policing sex and gender boundaries will get increasingly more complex in coming decades , and technology always outpaces ethics .
Reproduction issues have major ramifications for other causes near and dear to Boing Boing readers , including privacy , intellectual property , mind / body hacks , and the pathologization of human diversity .
Still , it 's often considered impolite or too political or too controversial , so it does n't get discussed enough .
Caster also challenges our most deeply - held beliefs about sports .
Sporting has a long tradition of " fairness " that expresses itself in numerous forms .
Boxers and wrestlers are evenly matched by weight class , for instance .
We currently ban performance - enhancing drugs as " unnatural " and " unfair . "
Another South African runner , amputee Oscar Pistorius , raised questions about whether his prosthetic legs gave him an " unfair " advantage over those with " natural " legs .
We usually do n't care if someone is a " natural " athlete .
But what if we decided anyone over 7 feet is " too tall " to compete fairly in basketball ?
That 's the question Caster poses in terms of sports philosophy .
Caster is being subjected to the latest " sex science " in order to fit her into our neat little binary , so that the apartheid of sex can be upheld within the sporting tradition .
Many people who consider " race science " intellectually problematic ( e.g. , eugenics , The Bell Curve , etc. ) think " sex science " is no problem at all .
They often imagine sexologists as noble and objective iconoclasts tackling a topic full of shame and taboo , rescuing human sexuality from morality and religion .
Many feel that anyone who has concerns about sex science is just a prude , or a religious fanatic , or anti-porn feminist , or an anti-science zealot , or sex criminal , etc .
This simplified " us vs. them " is often perpetuated by journalists , since it 's the story sexologists themselves want to present .
In fact , lazy journalists know that writing about the latest evidence produced by " sex science " is a guaranteed ratings winner for their media outlet .
That has led to a certain kind of laziness endemic in science journalism .
As an example , hardly a news special , talk show , or documentary exists where the authors / producers do n't trot out some " sexpert " to explain sex and gender minorities like Caster or me , since we are clearly unable to articulate anything but subjective viewpoints , and we 're incapable of self - analysis .
The few outlets critical of bad science journalism are rather obscure and are largely ignored .
Sex science emerged from the eugenics movement at the same time as race science , criminology , phrenology , and a number of other fields used to intellectualize and justify state action against " the unfit , " in what Edwin Black calls " the war on the weak . "
Early sexologists sought to categorize and pathologize traits and behaviors deemed " degenerate , " caused by bad genes that were the opposite of those deemed " eugenic " ( good genes ) .
Sexology oppresses women and sexual minorities by describing their bodies , desires , and behaviors as exotic and diseased .
The latest technologies like fMRI get misused in the service of biological reductionism and neo-eugenics ( euphemistically called sociobiology and evolutionary psychology ) .
What we are seeing with Caster is no different than the blood quantum laws that used to be in place to maintain slavery and anti-miscegenation laws .
The only difference is the newfangled tech being misused .
What we are seeing with Caster is no different than the standardized tests used to classify people into normative categories based on personality or intelligence , testing that has in the past led to " scientific " categories like moron , idiot , and imbecile , and led to sterilization of the " unfit " here in the US ( a key tenet of reproductive ideology ) .
Unless you 've been affected by it , understanding how social realities like a sex binary get reified and justified through technology can be hard to see .
It all gets framed as " natural " and " normal , " while anything that disrupts social realities gets labeled " unnatural " and " abnormal . "
The words created by " sex science " reinforce the binary and uphold the primacy of procreation : homosexual , bisexual , transsexual ( across to the " opposite " sex ) , intersexual ( between two ) .
There 's an inherent danger with looking to the body for absolute truths , but that 's in fashion right now .
Famed sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld believed in " justice through science , " meaning that findings would eliminate prejudice against sex and gender minorities .
That has not come to pass .
We know of several genes that affect skin and hair pigment , and that has n't stopped racism .
We know of several genes and environmental factors that affect characteristics associated with sex , but that has n't stopped sexism .
Researchers have recently found genetic repetitions implicated in gender identity and expression , but that has n't stopped transphobia .
In fact , science , as we see in the Caster case , it often misused to reinforce prejudice and prevailing ideology .
One of the most troubling aspects of the Caster case is the repeated use of the controversial term " disorders of sex development " ( DSD ) .
This disease model of human diversity was concocted by a handful of misguided and short - sighted academics .
I 've called it " The Sextard Movement " in earlier commentaries about this controversy .
The person who has made the most money from promoting this terminology is Alice Dreger , a former mommy blogger turned bioethicist who exemplifies the reproductive ideology behind DSD .
Dreger is sort of the Diane Arbus of academia , exploiting conjoined twins , transgender and intersex people , people of short stature , or any other vulnerable minority where its members rarely get to speak for themselves .
She got paid to be a key promoter of the term " disorders of sex development , " even working with the DSD Consortium to jam their ideology down the throats of everyone else through a number of pamphlets and unilateral " consensus statements . "
As you might imagine , hack sex journalists love Dreger for the reasons enumerated above .
Organisation Intersex International is the world 's largest support group for intersex people , and they actively oppose Dreger and the " disorder " terminology that 's being foisted onto their community by " sex science . "
What is the " disorder " Caster has ?
Clearly she has a naturally - occurring advantage under current sporting rules , so that 's not the disorder .
Being declared a disorder means that there is an order .
In a social order based on racial ideology , blood quantum laws were not devised for whites who were " too black . "
They were devised for blacks who were " too white . "
In a social order based on reproductive ideology , sex tests in sports were not devised for men who are " too feminine . "
They were devised for women who are " too masculine . "
It 's nothing new : check out this trailer for the remarkable documentary Pumping Iron II : The Women .
This social order will be challenged again and again in coming decades .
That 's what 's really being challenged here : the belief that human diversity can fit into some clean orderly binary of male and female .
Caster 's " disorder " is that her body disrupts the social order .
As with my other posts on these very complex topics , I 'm just skimming the surface to make more people aware .
This post 's title is a reference to Martine Rothblatt 's 1995 must - read book on the topic , The Apartheid of Sex : A Manifesto on the Freedom of Gender .
Martine is one of the many super - brilliant trans women who have made major scientific contributions ( real science , not sex science ) , and she is also a leading voice in the transhumanist movement .
Her work was very influential in my own political awakening , and I feel this book holds up 15 years later .

Finally – A Government Agency That ’s Actually Doing Its Job
The United Farm Workers recently sent out an alert .
The Texas Board of Eduction is “ erasing Cesar Chavez and all Hispanic historical figures from public school text books . ”
Given the size of the Texas schoolbook market , its government specifications tend to have a wag - the - dog effect on the national industry .
Chavez , in particular , was eliminated on the grounds that he “ lacks the stature … and contributions ” and should not be “ held up to our children as someone worthy of emulation . ”
According to the UFW press release , the state School Board and its appointees have complained of “ over representation of minorities ” in the current social studies standards .
This is in keeping with the Board ’s broader approach , which includes downplaying the contributions of the organized labor movement and exonerating Joe McCarthy .
If Cesar Chavez fails to meet the Board ’s notability requirements or serve as a proper role model , however , that ’s not true of “ the causes and key organizations and individuals of the conservative resurgence of the 1980s and 1990s including Phyllis Schafly , the Contract with America , the Heritage Foundation , the Moral Majority , and the National Rifle Association . ”
No , seriously .
( They forgot to mention Fred Phelps . )
This is actually an old story in Texas .
For years , state education authorities have been a prime target for the most reactionary and troglodytic lobbyists in the country , because of the state ’s disproportionate influence on the national textbook industry .
Frankly , I do n’t know why anyone should be surprised by this sort of thing .
Texas being what it is , you might expect the Bob Jones University rejects on its state School Board to be a little more over - the - top than average .
But other than that , they ’re doing essentially what the publik skools are supposed to .
As George Carlin put it ,
“ There ’s a reason that education sucks , and it ’s the same reason it will never ever ever be fixed … .
Because the owners of this country do n’t want that ….
“ [ T ] hey do n’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking .
They do n’t want well informed , well educated people capable of critical thinking ….
That does n’t help them .
That ’s against their interest .
You know something , they do n’t want people that are smart enough to sit around their kitchen table and figure out how badly they ’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago … .
“ They want obedient workers , obedient workers .
People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay , the longer hours , the reduced benefits , the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it . ”
If you think what Carlin said is an overstatement , just read the work of John Taylor Gatto or Joel Spring , and you can find plenty of quotes from the founders of the modern public education system saying the same thing , in almost exactly the same words ( minus an f - bomb or two ) .
The whole point of the state ’s education system , from its beginning , was to process human raw material into docile and obedient “ human resources , ” just intelligent enough to carry out their assigned tasks as efficiently as possible , without ever stopping to examine the system that employed them , or question the authority figures behind desks who assigned those tasks .
If dissatisfaction with the further nationwide bastardization of history and social studies texts gives some more impetus to open - source textbook initiatives , that will be good .
But more than anything , this should serve to reinforce the need to circumvent the state ’s education system altogether .
As long as there have been civilizations , there have been unending wars for power and land .
These wars have produced some of the fiercest warriors the world has ever seen .
Men who are not only exceptional at hand to hand combat but who were also great leaders and brilliant strategists .
There were so many brave individuals who could fit on this list but I think these represent warrior states from around the world and throughout the ages .
10 . Richard I ( Lionheart )
Richard I was given the nickname Lionheart ( or Coeur de Leon ) for his exceptional fighting ability and courage .
The duke of Normandy and the Count of Anjou , he ascended to the throne of England in 1198 after defeating his father Henry II with the help of his powerful mother Eleanor of Aquitaine .
Richard took the cross in 1188 when he heard of Saladin ’s successful conquest of Jerusalem .
He raised funds by selling official titles , rights and lands to the highest noble bidder .
He left for the Holy Land in 1190 along with French King Philip II and most of the military forces of Christendom .
After being waylaid first in Sicily and then in Cyprus , Richard and Philip arrived in the Holy Land in June 1191 .
The joint forces first took Acre and then moved onto Arsuf before fortifying Ascalon .
Arguments between who was to become King of Jerusalem escalated and Philip quit the Crusade and returned to France .
Richard pressed on but when he realized he had no way of securing Jerusalem even if he had managed to capture it , he signed a peace treaty with Saladin and returned to Europe .
He spent his final five years reclaiming his throne from his brother John and fighting against Philip ’s advances into Normandy .
9. Spartacus
Born in Thrace in 109 BC , Spartacus is most widely known as the gladiator who led the revolt against Rome during the Gladiatorial War .
It is not known for sure how Spartacus became a gladiator but the leading theory is that he once fought for the Roman army but deserted and became a thief .
He was arrested and sold as a gladiator due to his strength .
In 73 BC he and seventy followers escaped from a gladiator school near Capua and fled to Mount Vesuvius where they were joined by local slaves .
His army continued to grow until it was 90 , 000 men strong and they began wreaking havoc in southern Italy , defeating two Roman armies and plundering any city they came across .
From there they marched north into Gaul where he tried to free his men but they refused to leave and they marched again into Italy for more plunder .
Spartacus was killed in a battle at Lucania in 71 BC and his men were crucified .
He has been remembered as a legendary commander not only for his successes in battle but for his own courage strength and compassion .
8. Saladin
Known to the western world as the antihero of the Third Crusade , he is revered in the Middle East as the hero who returned Jerusalem into Muslim hands .
The Kurdish Sultan was born in 1138 in Mesopotamia ( now Iraq ) and grew up during the First Crusade .
He was trained as a soldier by his uncle Asad al - Din Shirkuh and early in his military career he worked on uniting Arab forces under his control first in Egypt then in Syria and Palestine .
He then set his sights on Jerusalem and conquered King Guy de Lusignan at the Battle of Hattin .
The battle was a tremendous success for Saladin as his army almost wiped out the Crusaders in the Holy Land .
The city of Jerusalem fell into his hands when he came to terms with Balian of Ibelin who defended the city after the capture of Guy .
His capture of Jerusalem influenced King Richard of England to join forces with King Philip of France and set out for the Third Crusade to the Holy Land .
The Christian forces made their way to Ascalon when Richard fell ill and signed a peace treaty with Saladin that left Jerusalem in Muslim hands as long as Christians would be able to safely make their pilgrimage .
His reign of Jerusalem was short lived however as he died of a fever on March 4 , 1193 .
Saladin is most often recognized as much for his generosity and chivalry as he is for his impressive military accomplishments .
7. Lieutenant Audie Murphy
Born the son of a poor Texas sharecropper in 1924 , Audie went on to become the most decorated American soldier of World War II .
In an attempt to free himself of his hardships , he joined the army as a private in 1942 .
After his basic training he was shipped to Casablanca , Morocco where he continued with his training .
He saw action in North Africa , Sicily , France and Germany and was distinguished by his quick thinking and bravery .
He not only destroyed several of the enemy ’s machine guns in minutes but also jumped onto a burning tank destroyer and turned its machine gun on the enemy as well as cutting off a German counterattack of six tanks and 250 Infantry practically by himself .
For these acts of courage he has received countless decorations including the Medal of Honor , Distinguished Service Cross , two Silver Stars , the Legion of Merit , two Bronze Stars , and three Purple Hearts ; as well as the French Legion of Honor and two Croix de Guerre .
He returned to America as a hero and turned his wartime fame into a successful film career .
With help from his friends , Audie penned an autobiography entitled To Hell and Back , which was later made into a movie in which he played himself .
While on a business trip he died in a plane crash on May 28 , 1971 and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with military honors .
6. Miyamoto Musashi
The greatest sword fighter of his time , Miyamoto Musashi , also known as the Sword Saint , is one of the best - known samurai in Japanese history .
Born in 1584 in Harima Province , Musashi was raised by his uncle in Shoreian temple .
By the time he was 13 he had already won his first duel against Arima Kigei , a student of the Shinto Ryu school of military arts .
For the next 16 years he made a name for himself , fighting in more than 60 duels ( including against the Yoshioka School and his most famous duel against Sasaki Kojiro ) in which he was undefeated .
During this time he also enlisted in Toyotomi Hideyoshi’s army and although he was on the losing side , he escaped , crawling among corpses and drinking from muddy puddles to survive .
After the war , he turned his attention to teaching swordsmanship and he is credited with creating the nitoryu technique in which you fight with two swords .
Later in his life , he became a master painter and writer .
His most famous written work is The Book of Five Rings , which covers the sum of his experience as a sword fighter including strategy , tactics and philosophy .
At the age of 62 , Musashi died of thoracic cancer in Reigando Cave ( the same cave where he lived as a hermit while writing The Book of Five Rings ) .
5. Gaius Julius Caesar
The greatest general in Rome ’s history , Caesar came to power first as a quaestor and praetor before being elected as consul and proconsul in 59 BC and organizing the First Triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus .
He distinguished himself by leading campaigns in Gaul , Britain and Germany but his growing power scared the senate and he was asked to disband his forces .
Not only did he refuse this request , he marched on Rome .
He started an outbreak of civil war that lasted until December 49 BC when he held a dictatorship in Rome for eleven days while he was elected as consul .
He then chased Pompey to Egypt where he remained living with Cleopatra for several years .
On his return to Rome he improved the living conditions of his people and drew up elaborate plans for consolidation of the empire .
In 44 BC he became dictator for life , a title that was short lived because on the Ides of March ( March 15th ) 44 BC , he was stabbed to death by a group of his friends and protégés including Cimber , Casca , Cassius and Brutus .
4. Hannibal Barca
A Carthaginian General , Hannibal was a master strategist who developed outflanking tactics .
Dubbed the father of strategy by military historian Theodore Ayrault Dodge , he grew up with a fierce hatred of the Romans .
After the death of his brother - in - law Hasdrubal , he took command of the Gaulo - Cathaginian army and set his sights on Rome .
He set out in the spring of 218 BC and fought his way through the Pyrenees and the Alps with a force of 46,000 soldiers and 37 war elephants .
When he was in Roman territory , he ravaged hundreds of towns leaving complete destruction in his wake .
Some of his greatest victories were at Trebia , Lake Trasimenus and Cannae , even turning some Roman cities against his enemies .
Scipio eventually defeated him in his homeland at the Battle of Zama , after which he signed a peace treaty in 201 BC .
After several years as a suffete , he was accused by his political enemies of conspiring with King Antiochus of Syria .
At the threat of a Roman investigation , Hannibal fled to the court of King Prusias of Bithynia where he poisoned himself before the Romans could force him to surrender .
3. Sun Tzu
A Chinese General , Sun
Tzu was the author of the first and most sophisticated book on military theory ever written , The Art of War .
While not much is known about the man , it is generally accepted that he was an accomplished General who served the King of Wu in the period of the Warring States in the 4th century BC .
It was at this time that he wrote The Art of War , which covers logistics , espionage , strategy and tactics with a deep reliance on philosophy .
The main points it stresses are the high cost of war , the unpredictability of battle , the correlation between political and military policies and the ineffectiveness of setting hard and fast rules .
Not only has it influenced Asian military thinking for centuries , but it has also formed the base of the military strategies of Napoleon , Mao Zedong , General Norman Schwarzkopf Jr. and Henry Kissinger .
In more recent times , The Art of War has been adopted by business students in Tokyo , New York and London as a text on business strategy .
2. Leonidas I
Best known for his heroic last stand at the Battle of Thermopylae , Leonidas ’ early years have barely been documented although legend has it that he was the descendant of Heracles .
His reign began somewhere around 490 BC and he shared control with Leotychides , as was Spartan custom of the time .
The Persian army , led by King Darius , had been conquering Greece for close to ten years when Leonidas became King .
When Darius died in 481 BC his son Xerxes continued his father ’s expansion into the Greek mainland .
In an attempt to stop the advancing army in their tracks , Leonidas ( despite warnings by the Oracle of Delphi that told of his death ) went to meet Xerxes with 7000 troops including the famed 300 Spartans , at the Pass of Thermopylae ( aptly nicknamed the Hot Gates ) .
Xerxes sent in wave after wave of troops including his Immortals who were in turn slaughtered by the Greeks .
After a few days of fighting a Greek traitor told Xerxes of a mountain trail which he could use to outflank his enemy .
Leonidas learned of the betrayal and sent away most of his men keeping only the 300 Spartans that made up his personal guard .
Leonidas ’ 300 valiantly fought off the advancing Persians down to their last man .
Leonidas was killed and his body was beheaded and crucified which only served to anger his fellow Spartans who expelled the Persians from Greece a few months later at the Battle of Plataea .
1. Alexander the Great
Arguably one of the greatest generals of antiquity , Alexander ’s conquests extended the Macedonian kingdom from Greece to India , almost the entire known world at the time .
Born in 356 BC his early years were spent under the tutelage of the philosopher Aristotle .
His early military career was spent releasing Greece from the grasp of the Persians .
From there he moved through Syria , Egypt ( where he founded the city of Alexandria and visited the oracle of Ammon and claimed his divinity ) , and Asia Minor before his final conquest into India .
He then returned to the west and began making preparations to invade Arabia but before he could achieve this conquest , he fell ill and died in June 323 BC .
Throughout his reign , the casualties of his troops compared to those of his enemies were considerably less , mostly due to his quick tactical thinking and his love for the men who fought under him .

Before the US House of Representatives , December 9 , 2009
Madame Speaker , I rise to introduce the Free Competition in Currency Act of 2009 .
Currency , or money , is what allows civilization to flourish .
In the absence of money , barter is the name of the game ; if the farmer needs shoes , he must trade his eggs and milk to the cobbler and hope that the cobbler needs eggs and milk .
Money makes the transaction process far easier .
Rather than having to search for someone with reciprocal wants , the farmer can exchange his milk and eggs for an agreed - upon medium of exchange with which he can then purchase shoes .
Gold and silver are anathema to governments .
This medium of exchange should satisfy certain properties : it should be durable , that is to say , it does not wear out easily ; it should be portable , that is , easily carried ; it should be divisible into units usable for every - day transactions ; it should be recognizable and uniform , so that one unit of money has the same properties as every other unit ; it should be scarce , in the economic sense , so that the extant supply does not satisfy the wants of everyone demanding it ; it should be stable , so that the value of its purchasing power does not fluctuate wildly ; and it should be reproducible , so that enough units of money can be created to satisfy the needs of exchange .
Over millennia of human history , gold and silver have been the two metals that have most often satisfied these conditions , survived the market process , and gained the trust of billions of people .
Gold and silver are difficult to counterfeit , a property which ensures they will always be accepted in commerce .
It is precisely for this reason that gold and silver are anathema to governments .
A supply of gold and silver that is limited in supply by nature cannot be inflated , and thus serves as a check on the growth of government .
Without the ability to inflate the currency , governments find themselves constrained in their actions , unable to carry on wars of aggression or to appease their overtaxed citizens with bread and circuses .
At this country ’s founding , there was no government - controlled national currency .
While the Constitution established the Congressional power of minting coins , it was not until 1792 that the US Mint was formally established .
In the meantime , Americans made do with foreign silver and gold coins .
Even after the Mint ’s operations got underway , foreign coins continued to circulate within the United States , and did so for several decades .
On the desk in my office I have a sign that says : “ Do n’t steal – the government hates competition . ”
Indeed , any power a government arrogates to itself , it is loathe to give back to the people .
Just as we have gone from a constitutionally - instituted national defense consisting of a limited army and navy bolstered by militias and letters of marque and reprisal , we have moved from a system of competing currencies to a government - instituted banking cartel that monopolizes the issuance of currency .
In order to reintroduce a system of competing currencies , there are three steps that must be taken to produce a legal climate favorable to competition .
The first step consists of eliminating legal tender laws .
Article I Section 10 of the Constitution forbids the States from making anything but gold and silver a legal tender in payment of debts .
States are not required to enact legal tender laws , but should they choose to , the only acceptable legal tender is gold and silver , the two precious metals that individuals throughout history and across cultures have used as currency .
However , there is nothing in the Constitution that grants the Congress the power to enact legal tender laws .
We , the Congress , have the power to coin money , regulate the value thereof , and of foreign coin , but not to declare a legal tender .
Yet , there is a section of US Code , 31 USC 5103 , that purports to establish US coins and currency , including Federal Reserve notes , as legal tender .
Historically , legal tender laws have been used by governments to force their citizens to accept debased and devalued currency .
Gresham ’s
Law describes this phenomenon , which can be summed up in one phrase : bad money drives out good money .
An emperor , a king , or a dictator might mint coins with half an ounce of gold and force merchants , under pain of death , to accept them as though they contained one ounce of gold .
Each ounce of the king ’s gold could now be minted into two coins instead of one , so the king now had twice as much “ money ” to spend on building castles and raising armies .
As these legally overvalued coins circulated , the coins containing the full ounce of gold would be pulled out of circulation and hoarded .
We saw this same phenomenon happen in the mid-1960s when the US government began to mint subsidiary coinage out of copper and nickel rather than silver .
The copper and nickel coins were legally overvalued , the silver coins undervalued in relation , and silver coins vanished from circulation .
[ efoods ]
These actions also give rise to the most pernicious effects of inflation .
Most of the merchants and peasants who received this devalued currency felt the full effects of inflation , the rise in prices and the lowered standard of living , before they received any of the new currency .
By the time they received the new currency , prices had long since doubled , and the new currency they received would give them no benefit .
In the absence of legal tender laws , Gresham ’s Law no longer holds .
If people are free to reject debased currency , and instead demand sound money , sound money will gradually return to use in society .
Merchants would have been free to reject the king ’s coin and accept only coins containing full metal weight .
The second step to reestablishing competing currencies is to eliminate laws that prohibit the operation of private mints .
One private enterprise which attempted to popularize the use of precious metal coins was Liberty Services , the creators of the Liberty Dollar .
Evidently the government felt threatened , as Liberty Dollars had all their precious metal coins seized by the FBI and Secret Service in November of 2007 .
Of course , not all of these coins were owned by Liberty Services , as many were held in trust as backing for silver and gold certificates which Liberty Services issued .
None of this matters , of course , to the government , which hates competition .
The responsibility to protect contracts is of no interest to the government .
The sections of US Code which Liberty Services is accused of violating are erroneously considered to be anti-counterfeiting statutes , when in fact their purpose was to shut down private mints that had been operating in California .
California was awash in gold in the aftermath of the 1849 gold rush , yet had no US Mint to mint coinage .
There was not enough foreign coinage circulating in California either , so private mints stepped into the breech to provide their own coins .
As was to become the case in other industries during the Progressive era , the private mints were eventually accused of circulating debased ( substandard ) coinage , and with the supposed aim of providing government - sanctioned regulation and a government guarantee of purity , the 1864 Coinage Act was passed , which banned private mints from producing their own coins for circulation as currency .
The final step to ensuring competing currencies is to eliminate capital gains and sales taxes on gold and silver coins .
Under current federal law , coins are considered collectibles , and are liable for capital gains taxes .
Short - term capital gains rates are at income tax levels , up to 35 percent , while long - term capital gains taxes are assessed at the collectibles rate of 28 percent .
Furthermore , these taxes actually tax monetary debasement .
As the dollar weakens , the nominal dollar value of gold increases .
The purchasing power of gold may remain relatively constant , but as the nominal dollar value increases , the federal government considers this an increase in wealth , and taxes accordingly .
Thus , the more the dollar is debased , the more capital gains taxes must be paid on holdings of gold and other precious metals .
Just as pernicious are the sales and use taxes which are assessed on gold and silver at the state level in many states .
Imagine having to pay sales tax at the bank every time you change a $ 10 bill for a roll of quarters to do laundry .
Inflation is a pernicious tax on the value of money , but even the official numbers , which are massaged downwards , are only on the order of 4 % per year .
Sales taxes in many states can take away 8 % or more on every single transaction in which consumers wish to convert their Federal Reserve Notes into gold or silver .
In conclusion , Madame Speaker , allowing for competing currencies will allow market participants to choose a currency that suits their needs , rather than the needs of the government .
The prospect of American citizens turning away from the dollar towards alternate currencies will provide the necessary impetus to the US government to regain control of the dollar and halt its downward spiral .
Restoring soundness to the dollar will remove the government ’s ability and incentive to inflate the currency , and keep us from launching unconstitutional wars that burden our economy to excess .
With a sound currency , everyone is better off , not just those who control the monetary system .
I urge my colleagues to consider the redevelopment of a system of competing currencies and cosponsor the Free Competition in Currency Act .

what is a minimalist ’s diet ?
True to the minimalist mind - set , a MD ( Minimalist Diet ) is about reducing food down to what is essential .
Although I refer to it as a diet here , in this case I mean diet in the case of ‘ a way of eating ’ or a long - term lifestyle , not a fad diet that claims you can lose several pounds in 30 days .
When it comes to diets , the important thing is to find a balance and to keep trying new things until you find what is best for you .
Our bodies are all different in a thousand subtle ways ; we all react to food a little differently .
I am not a nutritionist , so please do n’t take this as medical advice .
I have also taken into account my current lifestyle , I am a student , with very little money to spend , so some of the steps have come out of necessity rather than choice .
For me , an ideal model for a MD is the traditional Japanese diet .
Japanese cuisine is well known for the little cooking that is applied to the food .
A lot of food is eaten raw or lightly vinegared , such as Sashimi , or otherwise just steamed or boiled .
As for flavouring , the Japanese tend to season lightly , or use simple dipping sauces such as soy sauce .
This does n’t mean the food is bland and tasteless , it simply means that food is eaten the way it is , as close as possible to how it occurs in nature .
My take on a good MD is cutting down on too many foods that are processed and cooked for long periods of time .
A lot of people cut out meat as well , and although a vegetarian or even vegan diet is definitely very ‘ minimal ’ , you do n’t have to abandon meat if you do n’t want to .
what are the benefits ?
Some of the advantages of a Minimalist Diet are that :
You spend less money .
You ’re on a student budget , which , unless you ’re very lucky , is n’t much .
Processed food tend to cost more because the manufacturer needs to make a profit over all of the ingredients and chemicals they used to make it .
Buying carrots and chopping them up yourself makes a much cheaper side dish than oven chips which the food company had to grow , chop , flavour , process , package , market , distribute and store whilst making money to stay in business .
It is healthier .
Most food companies , and restaurants , do n’t care about your health .
They care about money .
So , they make their food products tasty and convenient because that is what will encourage you to buy them again .
But at what cost ?
The tastiest foods are packed full of sugars and fats .
And the most ‘ convenient ’ foods are sprayed full of chemicals so that they can be stored longer and cooked in less time .
Cutting out processed foods means you ’ll be filling your body with natural foods , so there are fewer ‘ sugar rushes ’ or ‘ oily breakouts ’ , which leaves you in a much happier mood and better able to focus and concentrate .
Moreover , I was in the supermarket one day and I noticed that a burger costs £ 1 , whereas a bag of salad was about £ 1.50 .
The question occurred to me :
What is in that burger that makes it cost less than a bag of leaves to make ?
A bag of leaves !?
It ’s better for the environment .
Eating foods that do n’t come with copious amounts of packaging saves from adding to landfill .
Plus , eating fresh food means it probably spent less time travelling , which saves enormous amounts of oil and carbon dioxide emissions .
If you cut down on meat , you will be ‘ saving food ’ , since raising livestock costs more plant material than the energy and nutrition you would get from eating the plants themselves .
There is already a global food shortage problem , and although realistically you wo n’t make much of a difference by yourself , at least you would know you are doing you best not to make it worse .
how to get started
Here are a few steps you can take towards a Minimalist Diet :
1 . Make your own .
Takeaways are extremely expensive compared to the cost of making a meal for yourself .
You do n’t have to make a profit over the effort you put into making your own dinner .
Of course , there is a need for one every now and again , but if you make meals in bulk then all you have to do is heat up a portion for the next night .
One of the biggest money - saving things you can do is making your own sandwiches for lunch .
A quick price comparison shows how much you can save , the average cost of a sandwich is £ 2.00 , if you buy 4 - 5 a week that comes to almost £ 10 .
But a supermarket loaf of bread is only about £ 0.60 and even adding the cost of most fillings like tomatoes , cheese , salads and butter that will last you more than one loaf still makes bringing your own much cheaper .
2 . Cut out junk .
If you know you eat a lot of chips , biscuits , crisps , cakes , pastries and drink a lot of fizzy drinks , you do n’t have get rid of it all straight away , otherwise the chances are you wo n’t last very long and you ’ll be tempted to switch back .
Instead , you can just cut down little by little , and substitute foods at the same time ( see below ) to make up for it .
This step can be difficult , and I know it is easier said than done but it is one of the quickest to implement and the results can be very rewarding .
3. Substitute .
Replace the junk you left out with healthier snacks .
If you can cut out fries as a side part of you main dish , replace it with vegetables .
Perhaps replace your morning cup of coffee with green tea instead .
Try stirring honey into your tea instead of sugar .
If you really feel like something sweet , try a handful of grapes , they ’re packed full of the fruit sugar fructose .
Instead of taking a bag of crisps for lunch , switch it for an apple .
Get creative !
4 . Think simple .
If you ’re not very good at cooking , or ca n’t afford to buy much ( I mean , we are students ) , why not just make something simple ?
Buy simple ingredients .
When cooking , instead of going for complicated recipes , why not try methods like steaming and boiling ?
These procedures are fairly easy and usually do n’t take very long either .
One of my favourite tricks is steaming practically any vegetable , or even fish in a sieve over boiling water with a lid on top , what is more simple / frugal / MacGyver than that ?
5 . Eat less .
Now , I ’m not suggesting you go anorexic here .
But if you are overweight , it may be worth calculating a rough estimate of how much you eat in terms of calories and seeing if you ’re over your Recommended Daily Allowance .
If there ’s one thing that remains consistent between all diets , even those dreaded fad diets , it is that in order to lose weight , you should replace junky carbohydrate heavy foods with simple , protein rich foods .
Consuming minimally can help you slim down , reduce landfill , save money and improve your overall well - being .
Please remember that all of these tips are just suggestions .
There is n’t an ‘ Official Minimalist Diet ’ rulebook that states you should not eat meat , or that you must eat less than you do now and so on .
These steps are a result of combining some of the things I have learnt as a result of having an interest in health , nutrition and of course minimalism .
I do realise that some of these points apply to a healthier diet in general , but I guess that is what a MD really breaks down to .
This is an approach to food that I have found to work for me , I hope it will help others but of course anyone can change it around as they like .
What does a ‘ Minimalist Diet ’ mean to you ?
Do you have any ideas about how to be more minimal when it comes to food ?

A demonstration of one of those highfalutin — and highly invasive — full - body airport scanners caught a Swiss Army Knife and a cellphone , but none of the , uh , bomb components .

The big reveal comes at around 2:07 , and is moderately to extremely terrifying .
As Schneier on Security points out , the subject did n't get scanned from the side .
That 's reassuring until you see that there were still a few front - facing explosive bits that got through , and he did n't even have to hide anything in a body cavity .

So , to sum up : full - body scanners are equal parts creepy and ineffective , the end .

Dissatisfaction with capitalism is widespread around the globe 20 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall that heralded the demise of European communism , a poll released Monday showed .
Only 11 percent of people surveyed across 27 countries thought free market capitalism is working well , while nearly a quarter — 23 percent — said the system is “ fatally flawed . ”
A bare majority , 51 percent , believed its problems can be solved with more regulation and reform , the poll said .

In only the United States ( 25 percent ) and Pakistan ( 21 percent ) , did more than one in five people agree that capitalism works well in its current form , the poll conducted for BBC World said .
The survey of 29,033 adults comes after the worst global financial crisis since the 1930s Great Depression and amid celebrations of the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , which abruptly ended the Cold War .
And it reflects growing concerns among the public and politicians that the world ’s economic system has failed to live up to its promises .
In Europe ’s post - communist eastern bloc , where residents have lived through both communism and capitalism , a poll released last week suggested capitalism is losing favor with the public .
Research by the Pew Research Center showed the percentage of people approving of democracy was markedly lower in the former Soviet bloc compared to a similar 1991 poll .
Eighty - five percent of respondents in East Germany supported the change to democracy , but even this was down six percent from 1991 .
The figure dropped 24 percent in Bulgaria , 20 in Lithuania , 18 in Hungary and eight in Russia .

Japan ’s recently - elected center - left prime minister , Yukio Hatoyama , launched a broadside last month against the excesses of capitalism in his first parliamentary address since taking office .
Speaking on his vision of a kinder , gentler society guided by the spirit of “ fraternity , ” Hatoyama said market forces were useful for a country but must be tempered in order to create a livable society .
“ It is self - evident that free economic activity in markets invigorates society , ” said Hatoyama , 62 , who swept to power in August elections , ending more than half a century of almost unbroken conservative rule .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ But it is also obvious that the idea of letting markets decide everything for the survival of the strongest , or the idea of ‘ economic rationalism ’ at the expense of people ’s lives , does not hold true any more . ”
Doug Miller , chairman of polling firm GlobeScan , which co-conducted the BBC survey , said : “ It appears that the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 may not have been the crushing victory for free - market capitalism that it seemed at the time — particularly after the events of the last 12 months . ”

Michael Boldin is the founder of the Tenth Amendment Center , found
HERE .
Mike and his team have produced documents that are known as the “ Ten - Four Pledge . ”
This document consists of ten affirmations on government and ten pledges to be solemnly kept by officeholders while they hold public office .
So , candidates for office , whether at State or Federal levels , are encouraged to sign one of these 10 - 4 Pledges and post it at the Tenth Amendment Center website .
The ten affirmations speak to the foundational truths of the Constitution of the United States .
They are as follows :
As a public office holder , or a candidate for public office , I affirm that :
1 . All just political authority is derived from the People , and government may only be established and maintained with their consent .
2 . The People of each State have the sole and exclusive right and power to govern themselves in all areas not delegated to their government .
3 . A government without limits is a tyranny .
4 . The Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that which has been delegated by the people to the federal government in the Constitution , and also that which is necessary and proper to advancing those powers specifically enumerated in the Constitution of the United States .
The rest is to be handled by the state governments , or by the people themselves , as they determine .
5 . In order for a federally - exercised power to be “ necessary and proper ” it must be a ) something that , without which , would make the enumerated power impossible to exercise , and b ) a lesser power than that which has been enumerated
6 . The “ Interstate Commerce Clause ” in Article I , Section 8 of the Constitution , does not permit Congress to regulate matters that merely affect commerce among the States .
It only permits Congress to regulate trade among the States .
7 . The phrase , “ general Welfare , ” in Article I , Section 8 does not authorize Congress to enact any laws it claims are in the “ general Welfare ” of the United States .
The phrase sets forth the requirement that all laws passed by Congress in Pursuance of the enumerated powers of the Constitution shall also be in the general Welfare of the United States .
This was affirmed by James Madison when he wrote : “ With respect to the words “ general welfare , ” I have always regarded them as qualified by the detail of powers connected with them .
To take them in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the Constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not contemplated by its creators . ”
8 . The federal government is not authorized to tax the People to raise monies for unconstitutional purposes .
Likewise , the federal government is not authorized to condition funding to State or local governments on compliance with mandates which require them to do what the federal government is not authorized to do directly .
9 . When Congress enacts laws and regulations that are not made in Pursuance of the powers enumerated in the Constitution , the People are not bound to obey them .
10 .
When the federal government exceeds its Constitutional authority , a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy .
Without that remedy , the People would be living in a tyranny , under the unlawful and excessive control of one or more branches of the federal government .
Then , the document calls the candidate to take an oath that :
As a public office holder , or a candidate for public office , I promise that , as long as I hold office :
1 . My votes will always be in favor of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this State .
Every issue .
Every time .
No exceptions .
No excuses .
2. I do , and will continue to , oppose any and all efforts by the federal government to act beyond its Constitutional authority .
3 . I will proactively introduce and support measures designed to adhere to the Tenth Amendment and preserve , to their fullest extent , the powers of the People in my district , and of the legislators and administrations of my State .
4 . I will introduce , sponsor and support resolutions affirming the sovereignty of the People of this State under the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States .
5 . I will introduce , sponsor , and support legislation that nullifies , within my state , actions of the federal government which exceed its Constitutional authority .
6 . I will introduce , sponsor and support legislation that provides such relief as is necessary and proper to provide fair redress to the citizens of my State in response to actions by the federal government which exceeds its Constitutional authority .
7 . I will introduce , sponsor and support legislation which refuses federal funding made on condition that my State comply with federal mandates not authorized by the Constitution .
8 . I will only vote in favor of a bill that I have thoroughly read , considered and understood .
9 . I will be accountable to voters .
Upon request , I will make public every vote I cast while in office .
10 .
I will keep this pledge public , and will provide a link on my website which directs constituents to the text of this pledge .
Mind - boggling , is n’t it ?
If you go to the The 10 - 4 Pledge page at the website , you can see all of the pledges that have been posted by candidates from all over the USA .
You can also download a copy of the pledge HERE .
These 10 - 4 Pledges are not just for newbie candidates alone .
These should be signed by incumbents who wish to keep their jobs , also .
I live in the state of Georgia .
Sadly , there are only two candidates who have signed and posted the Pledge .
Even the state legislators that drafted the Tenth Amendment resolution that passed in the Georgia Senate last term have not signed this Pledge .
There is a wave of anti-government sentiment slowly building in America .
The Tea Party movements show that some citizens are seethingly infuriated with government , and are looking for that one solution that will return to them their freedoms .
For example , on Tuesday night , Scott Brown of Massachusetts clubbed the Democratic candidate to win Teddy Kennedy ’s old Senate seat … a seat that had been Democratic for over 40 years .
The race was not even close …. in the Democratic fortress that is Massachusetts .
Please do n’t misunderstand .
Scott Brown is not the solution .
Scott Brown wanted to become a member of the Washington criminal class , and he got his wish .
And in my opinion , Republicans and Democrats are like identical twins that come from the same mother ’s womb .
Brown SAID a lot of things that sounded like principle .
We ’ll see if his principles will fight Leviathan or succumb to the DC blandishments of power and privilege .
Americans are beginning to understand that there are only two ways to control Washington … nullification and finally , secession .
My greatest concern is that the American populace will be blind - sided by the looming economic meltdown before they can fully understand nullification and secession .
But , I also believe that no force less severe than an economic collapse will focus the minds of Americans toward secession .
Secession is the Hope For Mankind .
Who will be first ?

Facebook to ban Berlusconi threat groups Social network says ' violent content against the rules '
( See related Berlusconi coverage ) ( ANSA ) - Rome , December 15 - Administrators of the US social networking website Facebook on Tuesday promised to remove groups containing threatening messages directed at Premier Silvio Berlusconi .
The statement followed an appeal by the interior ministry to take down content praising Sunday 's attack on Berlusconi by a man who hurled a metal statuette of the Milan Cathedral at him .
The premier suffered a fractured nose and two broken teeth , which are expected to keep him in hospital until Wednesday .
Immediately following the episode , over 50,000 Facebook users joined groups applauding the attack , a few under such sinister headings as ' ' Let 's toast to Berlusconi 's death ' ' .
In its statement , Facebook promised to '' carefully examine all of the groups brought to its attention by the Italian government and remove any with threatening or violent content ' ' .
The social networking site explained that all such content was '' strictly against its policy ' ' and would eventually have been taken down anyway .
Facebook gave as an example a group called '' Let 's Kill Berlusconi ' ' that caused a stir among politicians in October .
The group initially changed its name upon request from administrators , but was later banned altogether when users tried to change it back .
But the web giant affirmed its role as ''a meeting place where over 350 million people from around the world come together to express their opinions ' ' .'' Some of those opinions may be offensive or controversial , but that is not , by itself , reason enough to remove them , '' it said .
Administrators also pointed out that '' the exchanges on Facebook are simply a reflection of things people tell each other every day in their homes or over the telephone ' ' .
On Tuesday , Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said the government was considering legislation to block websites , like the Facebook hate groups , that '' incite users to commit crimes ' ' .
The proposal met with stern criticism from members of the opposition Democratic Party who feared the legislation could infringe upon Italians ' freedom of expression .
The PD 's telecommunications pointman , Senator Franco Laratta , emphasized that '' the idiots who post these sorts of messages are a tiny minority ' ' and that current laws on hate speech were '' more than sufficient to deal with them ' ' .
An MP with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party , Benedetto Della Vedova , agreed that ''it would be a mistake to let a few people 's ramblings get in the way of our freedom ' ' .

There is something rotten in the state of Ireland .
I am not talking about corrupt politicians or bent bankers , or for that matter unscrupulous trade union leaders fixated on bankrupting the country .
I am talking about the death of the student movement .
Students have often been the champions of identity politics in Ireland .
They have , in the distant past , protested and marched to defend the civil liberties of many minority groups that made up its ranks or were continents away .
Today the student movement is a paltry shadow of its former glory .
The reasons for this are varied but the growing strength of minority groups within the student movement and the relative wealth and comfortable lifestyle experienced by students are the two of the biggest .
Students , and to a greater extent student leaders , live in a bubble .
Protected by university life many students are immune to the effects of social injustice .
They are , after all , continuing to enjoy a privilege not available to those from more deprived backgrounds .
Of course third level education is ‘ free ’ , more or less , in this country .
Student leaders ( and the left ) would have you believe that there is nothing free about higher education .
This is true if one chooses to view the € 1,500 Registration
Fee as fees ‘ in all but name ’ , but that is a political viewpoint , and not an unbiased one .
Do we for one second believe that the hard working ordinary taxpayer would tolerate paying for gym and library membership , doctors , archery equipment , ego - masturbatory aids such as student publications and elections or ski trips to Alpine resorts for undergrads who , for the most part have n’t contributed a cent to the exchequer ?
I think not .
It is dishonest for student leaders to brand a charge that they lobbied for as a heavy burden on students , when the services and activities it provides for would be considered luxuries by those in the dole queues .
Last year saw Minister O’Keeffe put ‘ tuition fees ’ back on the agenda .
A brave and correct move by the Minister .
Student leaders were quick to galvanise ordinary students and organize a coordinated lobbying and public protest campaign across the country .
Whilst impressive , it did little to sway the Minister who simply brushed aside the students protestations and moved on to more pressing matters .
There was a naivety too in how student leaders protested , for instance holding a national rally the same day as the protesting pensioners .
The tuition fees issue was quickly relegated in terms of news importance .
The campaign also took a dive into the macabre with the violent behaviour of certain student groups towards Government Ministers .
Campaigning students on a self - serving issue is not something to be applauded .
It is natural for students ’ unions to rally the troops on an issue such as third level fees .
However it would be more morally incumbent on student leaders to have a full and open debate on third level fees , when both the sector and the country are crying out for more money .
But do they ?
Of course not .
Instead the students ’ unions chose to condemn those who tried to compromise and angrily silenced those within its own ranks that proposed a more engaging policy .
The issue of fees is an ideological one for the student movement .
A sane rational debate is forever unlikely .
This was not always the case .
On fees , well yes , but not on other ideological issues .
Student movements across the world have marched for change ; be it national or international .
They have lobbied against injustices , boycotted , protested and even rioted for causes that were of little relevance to them but they held a fiery passion for .
In Ireland these issues used to be numerous .
Civil rights in Northern Ireland , the Vietnam War , hunger and debt in Africa , gay rights and Iraq to name but a few .
All synonymous with the iconic image of the dirty , hairy , ragged , skinny stoned hippy student .
Today ’s ugg wearing , Astra driving , sunbed - using spoilt students know little of poverty except for the pictures they have seen on the back of a Trócaire box .
Whilst our economy is suffering , and nobody is free from the downturn , their ability to empathise with this suffering has been significantly compromised by their privileged upbringing .
An exaggeration ?
Let ’s look at what vexes our students these days .
Car park spaces .
Sofas .
Water Coolers .
The student movement has lost all sight of what is truly worth fighting for .
It has become materialistic , inward looking and is afraid to take on those it aspires to be .
Students ’
Unions continue to avoid any issue of real contention , issues of real concern .
They fail to educate their membership on these issues and shy away from encouraging them to become empowered to campaign .
Within the student movement there is a gap between those who lead , and those who are unwillingly led .
Turn out at students ’ union elections is an example of how irrelevant to their membership local students ’ unions have become .
In last years DCUSU election just fewer than 2,000 students turned out to vote .
That ’s just 25 % of the full - time student undergrad population .
More worryingly this figure is much healthier than other students ’ unions .
So if one were to take the DCUSU elections as an example , the students ’ union President who received 45 % of the first preference vote holds a mandate of 11 % .
What government could survive on this , or justifiably engage in any unpopular policy with such a mandate ?
How can these student leaders really speak on behalf of their members ?
With such low turnouts the true democratic representative weight of even that 11 % is totally diluted .
The student movement once fought for the end of apartheid , the legalisation of contraceptives in Ireland and the dissemination of information on abortion .
Today it shies away from the controversial even though nothing engages students more than controversy .
It is the local politics of students ’ unions that has destroyed the student movement .
It has heralded the dawn of the compromising national student leader , a person more concerned with partnership than social justice .
It is not that ordinary students do n’t have the capacity to care , they are not allowed too , and the Union that purports to represent them is unwilling to inspire .
Unemployment , freedom of speech , the environment , health cuts , fair trade , the erosion of democracy , militant Islam , unjust wars : these are issues students and indeed Ireland need to address and highlight .
A student movement that fights for what students believe in , not what it thinks students should believe in , could go a long way in promoting social change in Ireland once more .
Irish society needs a robust , vocal and rebellious student movement .
We need the young , the rash , the idealistic to widen the narrow vision of Irish society and our political leaders .
In times of such uncertainty our politicians are hesitant to make rash decisions and neglect those issues that transcend the fickle .
The student movement has in the past focused the attention of our leaders and our media on the pain and suffering of those with no voice .
Students must challenge their leaders , educate themselves on social injustice and prove to the public and politicians that some things are worth standing up for .
All politics is local and local students ’ unions can easily make a difference nationally and internationally .
The death of the student movement has led to a society that is resigned to selfish protectionist politics .
Students were able to grab headlines by simply chaining themselves outside an offending embassy or Government department ; headlines that informed and educated .
Headlines that motivated us all .
The rebirth of the student movement could energise Irish politics for years to come .
Many rebellious student leaders of the past are now high profile national politicians .
If our student leaders really have an eye on a political career they would do well to take heed of a simple truth – political parties always believe it is better to be pissing out of the tent than into it .
Energy , passion and ideals are attractive qualities to political parties , and are qualities that can be molded .
Maybe the best thing that ever happened our youth and social conscience is the end of the Celtic Tiger .
Let us pray that our youth never have it so easy so they cherish what they have and campaign for others to have it too .

One aim is to make Brecon a net exporter of electricity A UK scheme to generate power from mountain streams is one of three winners of a £ 1 m prize for saving carbon emissions at the local level .
The prize is awarded by the lottery - funded body Nesta , which encourages innovation in the UK .
The Green Valleys project in Wales ' Brecon Beacons currently generates power from 10 wild mountain streams .
The eventual aim of the venture is to make the Brecon area a net exporter of electricity .
' Intelligent support '
Normally , hydro - power relies on dams but Brecon uses micro- hydro , which involves diverting up to 50 % of a stream 's flow into buried pipes which lead to camouflaged generators .
The project is planning 40 more of such micro-power stations .
With extra help from energy advice surgeries , super - efficient vehicles and wood - burning stoves , 13 local communities in Brecon have cut carbon emissions by about 20 % in a year , according to Nesta .
Grenville Ham , who founded Green Valleys , said the Environment Agency imposed strict rules to protect the water level of the streams and ensure that wildlife in the streams was not harmed .
National Park rules ensured that the schemes were heavily disguised visually .
" We put a few rocks into a stream to ensure that enough water is held back to cover the inlet to the pipe , " he said .
" Then the pipes have a mesh on so fish can't get caught .
And the generators are all housed in huts no bigger than a garden shed and built of local stone with turf roofs .
We normally put them among farm buildings so they blend in . "
Lord Puttnam , chairman of the Nesta judges , said : " Whilst Copenhagen showed just how difficult it is to reach consensus amongst governments , the Big Green Challenge shows how local efforts can triumph .
" When people are empowered and are given intelligent support they can make the world of difference in the fight against climate change " .
Enterprise Another prize - winner is the Isle of Eigg , where 38 families are working together in a bid to halve their carbon emissions .
The initiative is being led by the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust and involves a wide range of projects from installing insulation and solar panels to producing local food and developing low - carbon community transport .
They are attempting to live within a five kilowatt ( kW ) / household energy cap .
The trust says its approach has generated interest from Ecuador , Galapagos and Alaska , as well as Birmingham and Edinburgh .
Nesta says Eigg cut CO2 emissions in the past year by 32 % .
The other £ 300,000 prize was taken by Ludlow 's Household Energy Service - a volunteer - led company that helps households reduce carbon emissions , improve energy efficiency and save money on fuel bills .
It provides free energy surveys - conducted by volunteers - that identify practical energy - saving measures along with estimates of the financial savings they could generate .
HES has expanded into Shropshire , Herefordshire , Radnorshire and Montgomeryshire - increasing its reach to 15,000 homes .
HES cut CO2 emissions in the past year by 10 % , according to Nesta .
While Nesta applauds the enterprise of community - led schemes , other energy analysts would point out that for the UK to achieve its long - term emissions targets there would need to be a revolution in energy generation and supply way beyond the reach of small communities like these .

The observable universe spans 13.7 billion light years , with the background radiation aftershock of the Big Bang as the oldest , and farthest , signal .
At that end of the universe lies the oldest material in creation , which , thanks to billions of years of expansion , has accelerated to almost the speed of light .
That layer forms an event horizon past which not even light can travel , ringing our universe in what is essentially an inside out black hole .
An angry loser ( right ) came to Syracuse University to make a fool of herself by spreading pathetic hatred and was treated to a happy mutant style stunt by this smiling student , named Chris Pesto ( left ) .
I decided that because this woman thought it was okay to make me feel uncomfortable in my home , I would retaliate and make her feel just as uncomfortable , if not more .
This woman was wearing a ankle - length corduroy skirt , which , as we all know , is a fashion nono .
So , in order to make her feel uncomfortable , I stood next to her and held a sign that said Corduroy skirts are a sin !
I do n't think I have ever drawn so much attention in my life .
SO many people asked to take a picture with me , I got laughs , high fives and there were the few that even cursed off the woman standing behind me .
As I drew interest to what was going on with myself and the woman with the hateful sign , I started to draw a crowd that stood with me in support .
Before I knew it I had 100 + people holding signs for gay rights asking people to honk their horns to support .
I was interviewed by a news station , and more than 5 student organization papers , and the post standard of syracuse .
I never expected anybody to come stand by me and support and I appreciate it so much that everyone came !
It meant so much and it proved to those ignorant people that we are n't afraid , and we will put up a fight .
I 'm proud that Syracuse has such a homosexual friendly community .

Hilbert curve of order 4
The Hilbert curve is a remarkable construct in many ways , but the thing that makes it useful in computer science is the fact that it has good clustering properties .
If we take a curve like the one above and straighten it out , points that are close together in the two - dimensional layout will also tend to be close together in the linear sequence .
I say " tend to be " , because we can never get this perfectly right - we can show that any curve of this type will have some points that are close to each other spatially but far from each other on the curve .
It turns out , however , that the clustering behaviour of the Hilbert curve is pretty much as good as we can currently get .
For one example of how this property can be useful , imagine that we have a database with two indexes - X and Y .
We know that we will be doing frequent queries on those indexes , asking for records where X and Y fall within specified ranges .
We can visualise this as retrieving rectangular regions from a two - dimensional space .
Given this scenario , how can we lay out the records on disk to minimise disk access ?
Information on disk is stored sequentially , so what we want is a layout that maximises the likelihood that records in any given rectangular region will also be adjacent on disk .
In other words , what we want is a way to order our two - dimensional space of records so that records close to each other in two dimensions also tend to be close to each other in the sequential order .
This is exactly the outstanding property of the Hilbert curve , so one solution is to store our records on disk in Hilbert order .
Visualising the Hilbert curve : A first stab
I 've long felt that the usual visualisation of the Hilbert curve - like the one shown at the top of this post - does n't really do its clustering properties justice .
The lines - and - vertices approach demonstrates how to construct the curve very nicely , but it does n't give us any intuitive feel for how close points on the curve are to each other on the plane .
In the remainder of this post , I take a stab at visualising the Hilbert curve as the great mathematician in the sky intended - completely covering the plane , and with each pixel visually encoding its proximity to its neighbours along the curve .
One way to proceed would be to find a way to assign a colour every pixel in a Hilbert - order traversal of a square image .
Imagine the RGB colour space as a cube where each colour is uniquely identified by a set of ( r , g , b ) co-ordinates .
Here 's one with 20 colours to a side :
A 20x20x20 RGB colour cube
We 'll use a somewhat larger colour cube - 256 colours to a side , giving us 16 777 216 unique colours .
This colour cube is familiar to pretty much everyone , since it 's precisely the colour space we use when we specify HTML - style #rrggbb colours .
We can project the RGB colour cube at 1:1 resolution onto a square with 4096 pixels to a side - this exactly matches a Hilbert curve of order 12 .
Now we need a method for traversing the colours in the colour cube .
One trivial way to do this is to simply snake through all the points in the cube .
In two dimensions , it would look like this :
16x16 Zigzag
This generalises to 3 or more dimensions easily - just imagine " stacking " plates of two - dimensional traversals in such a way that one plate 's end point is adjacent to the next plate 's starting point .
For want of a better term , I 've called this Zigzag order .
When we project a Zigzag traversal of the RGB colourspace onto a Hilbert - order traversal of the plane , we get this :
Zigzag on Hilbert
That 's ... ugly .
You can vaguely make out the shape of the Hilbert curve by dividing the image into quadrants , and traversing them in the order in which they blend into each other .
But there 's a problem - if we traverse the RGB colour space in Zigzag order , many colours that are close to each other in 3d space - and therefore visually similar - are quite far from each other in our traversal order .
This is what causes the blotchy artifacts in the image above .
What we really want is a traversal of the RGB colour space that is as smooth and continuous as possible - meaning that colours that are close to each other in the cube are also as close as possible to each other in the traversal order .
Wait a minute ... that sounds familiar , does n't it ?
Drawing the Hilbert curve in N dimensions
What we really want is a 3d Hilbert curve traversal of the RGB colour cube .
This would mean that our colour clustering - making sure that similar colours are as close as possible to each other in the sequence - would be close to optimal .
We should then see the clustering properties of the 2d Hilbert curve as patches of similar colour .
So , does a 3d analogue to the Hilbert curve exist ?
Sure it does - here 's a somewhat befuddling picture of an example rendered with POV - Ray :
3d Hilbert curve of order 3 - the green bulb is the start of the curve
We can do even better than 3 dimensions , though , by generalising the Hilbert curve to N dimensions .
Concretely , we would like to find a way to translate an offset along the N - dimensional Hilbert curve to co-ordinates , and vice - versa .
The algorithms to do this are somewhat tricky , but are well known and widely described .
A particularly nice exposition can be found in the paper " Compact Hilbert Indices " by Chris Hamilton .
This section is based on Hamilton 's version of the classic algorithm first devised by A. R. Butz in the 1970s ( though , see comments in my code for corrections to some minor errors in the paper that may trip up implementers ) .
We start with a slight detour - the surprising connection between the Hilbert curve and Gray codes .
Recall that Gray codes are a way to traverse all numbers of a given bit width in such a way that only one bit differs from each value to the next .
Here , for example , are the 2 - bit and 3 - bit Gray codes :
2-bit
0 , 0 0 , 1 1 , 1 1 , 0
3-bit
0 , 0 , 0 0 , 0 , 1 0 , 1 , 1 0 , 1 , 0 1 , 1 , 0 1 , 1 , 1 1 , 0 , 1 1 , 0 , 0
Now , watch what happens when we treat each set of bits in the N - bit Gray code as co-ordinates in N - dimensional space ( with X being the rightmost bit ) , and draw the resulting curves :
2 - bit 3 - bit
Voila , the Order 1 Hilbert curves in 2 and 3 dimensions !
A bit of pondering shows that this generalises to any dimension - if we have a hypercube with dimensions 1x1x1 ... , the Gray code will traverse all the vertices of the cube by changing only one dimension at a time .
Specifically , we can say that the N - bit Gray code is a Hilbert order traversal of the vertices of an N - dimensional hypercube .
Effectively , this means that we can now draw the Order 1 Hilbert curve for any dimension - so let 's refresh our memories of how the Order 1 curve relates to the higher orders .
O1 O2 O3
Notice that as we move from one order to the next , we replace each vertex with a sub-curve that has the same shape as the O1 traversal .
I 've marked one path through this recursive process in the images above , showing the subcurve for the upper - left vertex in every step of the recursion .
At every step , we also need to transform the subcurve through rotation and reflection to make sure that its start matches the end of the previous subcurve , and its end matches the beginning of the next subcurve .
This process generalises trivially to N dimensions .
Since the O1 curve is just a Gray code traversal of the N - dimensional cube , we can think of the Order M Hilbert curve as a collection of hypercubes nested M deep .
Now , let 's see if we can use this construction process to figure out the co-ordinates of a point , given the offset along the Hilbert curve .
We 'll ignore the rotations and reflections for the moment .
We start with the O1 curve of dimension N , and the N most significant bits of the offset .
By checking which vertex of the hypercube this maps to , we can peel off the most significant bit of each co-ordinate .
For example , if we wanted to locate offset 63 in the 2 - dimensional Order 3 curve ( the upper - left corner ) , our first two bits would be ( 1 , 1 ) .
This is the fourth point in the Gray code traversal of the hypercube , which gives us the upper - left quadrant of the O1 cube .
We now know that the most significant bit of our X co-ordinate is 0 , and the most significant bit of our Y co-ordinate is 1 .
Doing the same thing for the matching sub - hypercube in the O2 curve will give us the next bit , and we can drill down through the hypercubes in this way peeling off one bit of each co-ordinate , until we have all M bits .
This process also works in reverse - if we start with a set of co-ordinates , we can drill down through the hypercubes , determining N bits of the curve offset at every step .
So , generally , at every step of the Gray code recursion we get a nested hypercube of dimension N , and N bits of co-ordinate or offset information .
Finally , we need to deal with the rotations and reflections required to make the heads and tails of the Gray code subcurves match up .
We 'll need to perform this transformation at every step , before we extract our information bits .
All we need is a way to rotate and reflect a given hypercube to make its beginning and end match up with its position on the curve .
The transform required turns out to map to a simple set of bit operations described in Section 2.3.1 of Hamilton 's paper .
And that 's it - using this general process , we can now calculate co-ordinates or offsets for points on an N - dimensional Hilbert curve .
Hopefully , I 've managed to give some intuition for how this algorithm works , but I 've glossed over pretty much all the details .
See the original paper or the code I 'm publishing for specifics .
I should also note in passing that this is just one way to draw the Hilbert curve - at higher dimensions there are many , many different well - formed Hilbert curves .
A portrait of the Hilbert curve as a young fruit salad
At last we are in a position to traverse the 3 - dimensional RGB cube in Hilbert order , and have another stab at visualising the 2d Hilbert curve .
Hilbert on Hilbert
Ladies and gentlemen , I present a Hilbert curve traversal of the three - dimensional RGB colour space , projected onto a two - dimensional Hilbert curve covering the plane .
I think it 's absolutely damn beautiful .
Like some weird piece of abstract art - a Kandinsky or perhaps a Pollock - the more you look at this image , the more structure you see .
If you divide it into quadrants , and sub-quadrants , and sub- sub - quadrants , you can trace the path of the Hilbert curve at every level of recursion by following the flow of colours ( use the 2d Hilbert curves elsewhere in this post for reference if you 're having trouble ) .
If you 're looking at the full - size image , this works even at very large magnifications , until the human ability to perceive colour differences starts to fail .
Incredibly , this image contains exactly the same set of colours as the unattractive Zigzag visualisation at the start of the post - the only difference is the way the colours are arranged .
This is so remarkable that you might want to verify this yourself using the colour analysis functionality of your favourite image editor ( make sure you use the full - size images for best effect ) .
We 've also achieved the goal we set out with - the clustering properties of the 2d Hilbert curve are directly visible as patches of similar colour .
By the way - if Hilbert curves float your boat , you may also be interested in a previous post of mine , in which I visualise an IP geolocation database with Hilbert curves .
The code
git clone git://github.com/cortesi/scurve.git
I 've released the code used to render the images in this article as a Python project called scurve ( for space - filling curve ) .
This project aims to be collection of clear implementations of algorithms related to space filling curves , together with a set of tools for visualising them .
If you 're interested in this kind of thing keep an eye on the project - I plan to add more interesting goodies in the next few weeks .
Does this mean nevermore ?
For the first time since 1949 , a black - clad figure known as the Poe Toaster failed to show up at Edgar Allan Poe ’s gravesite in Baltimore to celebrate the anniversary of the writer ’s birth 201 years ago .
The visitor , whose identity has remained a mystery , would raise a Cognac toast and leave behind three red roses , along with the remnants of the Cognac bottle .
About 30
Poe fans stood in the cold for hours early on Jan. 19 as they waited for the mysterious visitor , The Baltimore Sun reported .
Some speculated the toaster might have just had the flu or car trouble — or that he had died .
“ So many people have said : ‘ I hope it ’s not over .
It was such a nice tradition , ’ ” Jeff Jerome , curator of the Edgar Allan Poe House , told the newspaper .
“ But maybe it has just run its course .
It was n’t going to last forever . ”
is on its way toward becoming a giant hit , and a major reason for all that cash is the 3D factor , allowing theater owners to charge more for tickets and offering a pretty strong reason for catching the movie in theaters rather than on DVD .
So once again , for what seems like the 10th time in the last 3 years , the 3D craze is on .
According to The Wrap , Ridley Scott is pushing Universal to make a 3D version of his upcoming , despite the fact that the movie was n't shot for 3D ( though that would be a better explanation for all the shots of Robin pointing an arrow at the screen in the trailer ) .
There 's also talks about re-releasingin 3D , and of courseis on its way .
Basically there 's no reasonto put a movie in 3D , at least until they make an especially stupid decision ---- that makes us all realize it 's just a gimmick for taking our money .
Depending on how good an idea Ridley Scott has here , may turn out to be that particular Waterloo .
THE passion is palpable in his bearing , in the onrush of words and his forceful gestures .
The accomplished physician morphs into the adventurous neuroscientist , and yet again into the curious psychiatrist .
His brinkmanship with science is breathtaking .
The fame of Dr V.S. Ramachandran , Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience and Director of the Centre for Brain and Cognition at the University of California , San Diego , the author of the path - breaking work Phantoms in the Brain and its coda , The Emerging Mind ( delivered initially as the Reith Lectures 2003 ) , of the recipient of many academic honours and awards , sits lightly on him as he excitedly delves into the unknown :
How do you see the intrusion philosophy has made into neuroscience ?
Inevitably , when you do neuroscience cognitive neuroscience or behavioural neurology it throws up all kinds of philosophical questions , such as what is mind , what is the relationship between qualia , sensations , the activity of neurons , what is the nature of the self , the question of personal identity .
But , as we advance in science , this has enormous implications for philosophy .
Some people could regard these as antithetical , but they really are not , because , obviously , quantum mechanics has profound implications for understanding causality , the meaning of causality .
Some of the greatest philosophers like Kant and Ernst Mach also inspired Einstein .
So its always a cross-fertilisation of ideas .
Would you say that as neuroscience continues to discover more and more of whats happening in the human mind or the brain , philosophy will recede and be painted into a corner ?
I think with some philosophical questions , that will happen , they will be painted into a corner .
But there will always be some fundamental issues of epistemology , such as : why do we exist ?
Why is there anything , rather than nothing ?
Science doesnt attempt to deal with these questions .
On the other hand , the strange thing about consciousness is that we are not even sure whether it is a philosophical question or a scientific question .
Within the brain , certain areas seem to be more involved in what we call consciousness .
And what we call consciousness also seems to be several processes which we are lumping together in one word .
And its possible we can dissect these different processes and map them in different brain structures .
That will enrich your understanding of consciousness .
And then questions like , where is consciousness , or what is it , will recede into the background .
Its a bit like when people ask : what is life ?
You know , living things are different , they have the vital spark .
Now we know there is no vital spark , theres the DNA molecule , DNA replication , transcription , theres RNA , the Krebs cycle ... once you understand all these processes nobody comes and says , yes , but you have to tell me what life is .
It would seem it is subjective consciousness that is the problematic area .
What is called qualia , right ?
You see , theres an analogous problem in physics where once Einstein came up with the idea of a space - time metaphor , the notion of what the present is .
The whole idea of passage of time , it has been claimed , is an illusion , its not something that physics acknowledges .
Yet we know that time passes .
We are not even sure whether this is a philosophical problem or a scientific one .
Similarly , with consciousness and qualia , it is intimately linked to your sense of self .
If you dont have a self , theres no question of qualia , right ?
The whole question of me experiencing red if there is no me , there is no question of experiencing red .
So these are dual aspects of the same phenomenon , the sense of personhood , the sense of me .
And the ability to know that you are aware of green , which I call a meta representation .
So these are two sides of the coin .
Now , thats proving to be the most elusive problem in all of neuroscience , all of biology .
But as scientists , what we are trying to do is to approach this problem indirectly , just as people understood heredity and DNA by looking at viruses .
Are viruses half alive ?
We crystallise them , they behave like chemicals .
But we also know that they replicate , and now we know that there are RNA molecules .
So once we have understood DNA , nobody asks if the virus is really alive or not .
Similarly , in consciousness , one day we may achieve a mature enough understanding of what it is .
You seem , in your [ Reith ] lecture , to assume that many brain functions are localised .
For example , you talk of the fusiform gyrus for analysing colour information .
Are many cognitive processes localised thus ?
Some functions are localised fairly sharply in specific brain areas as well .
Nobody would deny that the cough reflex , which is also a function of the brain , is a specific reflex that goes to the brain stem .
Now , whether these are localised or not is an empirical question .
Some may turn out to have small sets of circuits involved , others may involve large chunks of neural tissue .
But this should not be transformed into a philosophical question , like Fodor and others have tried to make it .
Now , I welcome their contribution in that they try to clarify what you mean by localised , what you mean by not localised .
But they dont take it any further .
What I want to know is : which function is localised , where is it localised , to what extent is it localised ?
Its a bit like the nature / nurture question .
When I ask is it mainly genes , or is it environment , it turns out this is a meaningless question because theres always an interaction between the two .
You can take an ape and put it in a public school .
Its not going to develop a proper public school accent .
On the other hand , if a human is raised in a cave hes never going to be a scholar .
This is obvious .
Its amazing how much acrimony goes into this without understanding that the only way to understand this is to do experiments .
And some things , like the cough reflex , nobody would say you learnt it .
Its completely genetic , or mostly genetic .
But in something else , say language , learning is involved to a large extent , especially your lexicon , the words .
Nobody would deny that .
How much credence would you give to the functionalist interpretation of neural states that some philosophers seem to promote ?
We are not opposed to functionalism as a theory .
But as a methodology , its seriously flawed .
For example , with heredity , you can only get so far with functionalism .
Its only when they did X - ray crystallography and understood the double helical structure that they saw the genetic code .
If some philosopher had said , No , No , heredity is a function and needs functional analysis , wed still be stuck with Mendelian genetics ; we wouldnt have understood DNA .
I think the same is true of the brain .
Is your approach to cognitive science based on empirical studies or intuition ?
Intuition is what gets you started ; and then you need empirical studies .
In every lab now in the United States , in every corner , theres an fMRI being done , an EEG being done .
Now , there is so much of it being done that purely by accident some of it is going to be good .
Technology often drives science just think of the telescope , the microscope and so obviously its a good thing overall .
But the brain behind the microscope , the brain behind the telescope , is just as important , if not more important .
Hundreds of children were using telescopes as toys , but Galileo had to come along and look at the stars .
Likewise , brain - imaging technology often lulls you into a false sense of having understood whats going on .
Would you then care to speculate on the nature of consciousness ?
The word consciousness , like life , is used in many different ways .
Its a collection of different mechanisms .
One is qualia .
And then theres the notion of self awareness .
I am aware that I am seeing red .
Its debatable whether a cat is aware that it is seeing red no doubt it sees red and it reacts appropriately .
Now , theres a tantalising question : if you are not aware that you are seeing red , are you even aware of red ?
In other words , without knowing that you know , the word know doesnt mean anything .
But the poet Rimbaud says you should no longer say I think .
You should say , it thinks me .
Its interesting you should mention Rimbaud , because hes also synesthetic .
Thats one of the phenomena weve been studying lately , where people get their senses muddled up .
When they hear tones , they see colours .
When they see numbers , they see colours .
People used to think this was some kind of quirk .
People even used to think it was bogus , that they were making it up .
About seven or eight years ago , my student Ed Hubbard and I showed that this is a genuine sensory phenomenon , which parts of the brain are involved , and that it has deeper implications for understanding things like what is metaphor .
Now we have become very interested in this discovery of mirror neurons .
These are neurons in the front of the brain .
You record from them this has been done by Giaccamo and Rizzolatti in 1996 or 97 , I believe and these neurons in the frontal lobes recorded from a monkey fire every time the monkey reaches for a peanut .
So one neuron fires when the monkey reaches for the nut , another neuron fires when it pulls a lever , another when it pushes something , another neuron when the monkey picks up a nut and puts it in its mouth .
Now , what Rizzolatti found , to his amazement , was that some of these neurons would fire when the monkey watches another person performing that action .
This was truly extraordinary .
I said that this was going to do for psychology what DNA did for biology help explain a host of hitherto mysterious mental capacities , like the early emergence of language , words , proto language , metaphor , your ability to transmit culture through imitation , through emulation , empathy , your ability to put yourself in another persons shoes , look at the world from his point of view .
The neurons are allowing you to put yourself in the other monkeys shoes , the other persons shoes .
So I call them the empathy neurons , or the Dalai Lama neurons it fires in you when you hurt somebody else !
This neuron is telling you that , in some sense , you are literally feeling his pain .
One of the things we have discovered in our lab is the cause of the cruel disorder called autism , which you see in children .
The word autism literally means aloneness .
Autistic children have grossly impoverished language and communication skills , no empathy for other people , and inability to adopt another persons point of view .
And , as has been known , they have a huge problem with metaphor , the metaphoric use of sentences .
A bulb flashed in my mind and I said : My God , whats gone wrong in autism are precisely the functions of mirror neurons .
So maybe autism is caused by deficits of mirror neurons .
If autistic children reach out and grab something , the neurons fire .
But when they watch somebody , there is no activity .
When studying animal brains one can induce lesions , which may not be possible with human brains .
So you are left with non-interventionist techniques for a good part , arent you ?
Yes , but sometimes nature gives you an experiment , because you may have a patient with a very small lesion .
If the stroke is sufficiently small , with the imaging techniques now available , you can pinpoint .
You can find another patient with a lesion in a different location .
And then you do the behavioural experiment and correlate .
Even better than that , now youve got magnets which can temporarily inactivate a part of the brain .
And then you see how does the behaviour change .
On the ethical dimensions of neuroscience experimentation .
Obviously , there are tremendous ethical issues here .
But I would say no more than the problems of cloning , the problems of abortion , the problems of nuclear weapons they are ethical problems , but they are in a sense political as well .
They have to be tackled politically .
Imagine five centuries from now I am a mad neuroscientist and I produce a brain in a vat .
I take your brain and put it in a vat .
I can give all the right patterns and make you think youre Bill Gates , Hugh Hefner , Mark Spitz , Crick ... everybody you want to be but retaining your identity .
In other words , your personal cherished memories of upbringing in Kerala I am not wiping off all that , but , as bonus , you also have the abilities of a Crick , of a Gates , and so on .
I give you the choice of that artificial brain or the real you continuing .
Now , ninety per cent of people pick the real you .
Exactly .
Because , logically , youre already a brain in a vat there is the cranial cavity and all that .
I ask you which vat do you want and you prefer the crummy vat !
But to create the simulations in the vat , you have to understand the brain enough to understand culture , for instance .
And culture , by its very nature , depends on the contingencies of what happened .
Without understanding that , how can you programme it in the vat ?
So you could say that this Frankenstein scenario will never happen .
You could argue both ways : that the time will come when all this will be understood ; or that given the uniqueness of cultural trajectories , and without a peculiar concatenation of environmental and genetic circumstances , how can you create it ?
The brain , with a trillion or so synapses , is such a fascinating field .
Yes , but before that you may think that this brain in the vat business is some science fiction stuff .
Its not going to happen any time .
And I agree its not going to happen soon .
But we are approaching that .
Your blog , your i-way - , i-view , email , webmail we are all being already assimilated into the brahman of cyberspace .
What is the individual , but a node in this huge Internet ?
We are approaching that stage where we are becoming like the brain in the vat .
Grokster has vowed to return with a legal downloading service
Under the deal , Grokster is permanently banned from taking part in the spread of copyrighted music and movie files .
It agreed to stop activity that leads to copyright infringement , as well as paying $ 50 m ( £ 28.7 m ) in damages .
Grokster 's decision has been seen as a victory for the entertainment industry 's fight against online piracy .
Grokster 's website was changed on Monday and now says its existing peer - to - peer ( P2P ) service was illegal .
" The United States Supreme Court unanimously confirmed that using this service to trade copyrighted material is illegal , " a statement on its website said .
This settlement brings to a close an incredibly significant chapter in the story of digital music
Mitch Bainwol , Recording Industry Association of America
" Copying copyrighted motion picture and music files using unauthorised peer - to - peer services is illegal and is prosecuted by copyright owners , " it added .
Piracy charges
The decision comes four months after a US Supreme Court ruling that file - sharing services can be held liable for actions of their users .
In June , justices ruled that the entertainment industry could file piracy lawsuits against technology companies caught encouraging customers to steal music and films over the internet .
" This settlement brings to a close an incredibly significant chapter in the story of digital music , " Mitch Bainwol , head of the Recording Industry Association of America , said in a statement .
" This is a chapter that ends on a high note for the recording industry , the tech community and music fans and consumers everywhere . "
Brand survival
However the settlement , submitted at a Los Angeles court , will not mean an end to illegal file - sharing using Grokster software .
Grokster users will still be able to copy music , movies and software directly from each others ' hard drives , as the decentralised nature of most peer - to - peer software makes it impossible to control once it is released on the internet .
And the sharing of copyrighted material shows few signs of slowing down .
An average of 9.2 million users were logged on to peer - to - peer networks in October , up from 6.3 million a year ago , according to online analysts BigChampagne .
Its co-defendant in the long - running case - Streamcast Networks - has also vowed to continue fighting the lawsuit launched by major US record companies , film studios and music publishers .
The Grokster brand is expected to survive .
A statement on its site says it " hopes to have a safe and legal service available soon " .
Reports suggest the group is in the process of being sold to legal downloading site Mashboxx , and a legal fee- charging Grokster service could be available within 60 days .
Mashboxx , which signed a licensing deal with music giant Sony BMG in June , is partly headed by former Grokster president Wayne Rosso .
