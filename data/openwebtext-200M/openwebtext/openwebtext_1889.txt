I 've mentioned here before that I 'm the secretary at my mosque .
Well , over the past few weeks we 've been getting a number of calls from people wanting to buy a bulldog , saying that our number was part of an online listing they saw .
I finally managed to track down the actual listing , and discovered that the same user had made postings in a number of different cities listing various breeds of dog for sale and with the phone numbers of mosques listed .
Which wins my award for weirdest form of telephone harrassment ever .
So if any of your mosques start getting calls about a dog for sale , check Yahoo Pets Classifieds section and see if you can get the listing taken down .
White House , Pentagon cite executive privilege to hold up documents on friendly fire victim Tillman Michael Roston
Published : Friday July 13 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Henry Waxman ( D - CA ) revealed on Friday afternoon that the White House and Pentagon were holding up a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigation into the friendly fire death of former professional football player and Army Corporal Patrick Tillman .
" [ T ]he Committee wrote to White House Counsel Fred Fielding seeking ' all documents received or generated by any official in the Executive Office of the President ' relating to Corporal Tillman 's death , " noted a press release from the Committee .
But the White House has apparently again invoked its executive privilege to hold up the documents sought by Waxman and Ranking Minority member Tom Davis ( R - VA ) .
" The White House Counsel 's office responded that it would not provide the Committee with documents that ' implicate Executive Branch confidentiality interests ' and produced only two communications with the officials in the Defense Department , one of which was a package of news clippings , " the Committe noted .
" The response of the Defense Department to the Committee 's inquiry was also deficient . "
In their letter to Fielding , Waxman and Davis doubted that the two documents were the limits of White House - Pentagon communication over Tillman 's death .
" It is difficult to believe that these are the only communications that White House officials had with the Department of Defense between April 22,2004 , the day Corporal Tillman died , and May 29 , 2004 , the day the Bush Administration publicly announced that Corporal Tillman 's death was a result of fratricide , " they wrote .
They also explained what they believed was at stake in this probe .
" These questions have implications for the credibility of the information coming from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan and raise significant policy issues about how to prevent the future dissemination of untrue information , " Waxman and Davis wrote to Fielding .
" They also have a profound personal impact on the Tillman family .
It is for these reasons that the Committee requested documents from the White House . "
The Committee said that it expected a response to the Friday letter by July 25 .
Waxman also scheduled an additional hearing on the announcement of Tillman 's death for Aug .

There are a few things lawmakers have decided really ought to be handled with the " care and oversight " that only the government can provide : e.g. , tax collection , radioactive materials , biohazards , guns , and CDs .
CDs ?
No , I 'm not talking about financial Certificates of Deposit , though that might make more sense .
I 'm talking about Compact Discs .
New " pawn shop " laws are springing up across the United States that will make selling your used CDs at the local record shop something akin to getting arrested .
No , you wo n't spend any time in jail , but you 'll certainly feel like a criminal once the local record shop makes copies of all of your identifying information and even collects your fingerprints .
Such is the state of affairs in Florida , which now has the dubious distinction of being so anal about the sale of used music CDs that record shops there are starting to get out of the business of dealing with used content because they do n't want to pay a $ 10,000 bond for the " right " to treat their customers like criminals .
The legislation is supposed to stop the sale of counterfeit and / or stolen music CDs , despite the fact that there has been no proof that this is a particularly pressing problem for record shops in general .
Yet John Mitchell , outside counsel for the National Association of Recording Merchandisers , told Billboard that this is part of " some sort of a new trend among states to support second - hand - goods legislation . "
And he expects it to grow .
In Florida , Utah , and soon in Rhode Island and Wisconsin , selling your used CDs to the local record joint will be more scrutinized than then getting a driver 's license in those states .
For retailers in Florida , for instance , there 's a " waiting period " statue that prohibits them from selling used CDs that they 've acquired until 30 days have passed .
Furthermore , the Florida law disallows stores from providing anything but store credit for used CDs .
It looks like college students will need to stick to blood plasma donations for beer money .
Why this trend , and why now ?
It 's difficult to say , but to be sure , there is no love lost between retailers who sell used CDs and the music industry .
The Federal Trade Commission has scrutinized the music industry for putting unfair pressures on retailers who sell used CDs , following a long battle between the music industry and retailers in the mid 90s .
The music industry dislikes used CD sales because they do n't get a cut of subsequent sales after the first .
Now , via the specter of piracy , new legislation is cropping up that will make it even less desirable to sell second - hand goods .
Can laws targeting used DVDs be far behind ?
The music industry has never been a big fan of the Doctrine of First Sale , and the rise of digital music sales will only exacerbate the tension between consumers who believe that they " own " what they pay for , and the music industry .
As more and more content - oriented goods transition to digital formats that are distributed free of physical formats , this issue is going to get tricky because it will be harder to spot the counterfeits from the authentic products , and consumers will still expect to exercise robust rights with the content that they 've paid for with their hard - earned cash .
Hacking Reputation in MySpace and Facebook
I ’ll be the first to admit it : I know next to nothing about MySpace or Facebook .
I do know that they ’re social networking sites , and that — at least to some extent — your reputation is based on who are your “ friends ” and what they say about you .
Which means that this follows , like day follows night .
“ Fake Your Space ” is a site where you can hire fake friends to leave their pictures and personalized comments on your page .
Now you can pretend that you ’re more popular than you actually are :
FakeYourSpace is an exciting new service that enables normal everyday people like me and you to have Hot friends on popular social networking sites such as MySpace and FaceBook .
Not only will you be able to see these Gorgeous friends on your friends list , but FakeYourSpace enables you to create customized messages and comments for our Models to leave you on your comment wall .
FakeYourSpace makes it easy for any regular person to make it seem like they have a Model for a friend .
It does n’t stop there however .
Maybe you want to appear as if you have a Model for a lover .
FakeYourSpace can make this happen !
What ’s next ?
Services that verify friends on your friends ’
MySpace pages ?
Services that block friend verification services ?
Where will this all end up ?

NEW YORK — The jeopardized health of Earth 's depleted ecosystems is putting our own health in danger as more and more diseases like AIDS , West Nile and Ebola could jump from animals to find a home in humans , new research shows .
Urbanization , deforestation and other habitat changes wrought by humans and global warming are contributing to the decline of many species : a 2006 report in the journal Conservation Biology estimated that nearly a quarter of the world ’s plant and vertebrate animal species could be extinct by 2050 .
One of the most arresting potential consequences of this biodiversity loss , discussed here at a recent symposium at the American Museum of Natural History , is the likelihood that animal diseases will cross the species barrier and begin infecting humans faster than ever in recorded history .
“ I think biodiversity is a big factor [ in disease emergence ] , ” said ecologist Richard Ostfeld of the Institute of Ecosystem Studies , in a telephone interview .
“ And clearly climate change is affecting biodiversity . ”
But predicting which diseases might make this leap is complicated by the fact that researchers know so little about the origins of many of the diseases that plague humans now .
Zoonoses
Humans have suffered from infectious diseases for millions of years , but many pathogens have reared their ugly heads only in the last 11,000 years , since the rise of agriculture .
It was then that people began living in denser communities that facilitated the spread of diseases .
Many of these “ newer ” diseases transferred to humans from animal hosts : some may have jumped from closely related species ( for example , AIDS from chimpanzees ) , while others may have spread from distantly related species that we came in close or constant contact with ( such as smallpox from domestic animals ) .
These animal - to - human jumpers , or zoonoses , can be caused by bacteria , viruses and other infectious microbes .
“ The role of these pathogens in causing human disease may be particularly important because many of these are highly lethal , ” said ecologist Kate Jones of the Zoological Society of London .
But according to a new study in the journal Nature , scientists know very little about the origins of many long - established human diseases — a conundrum that makes predicting which disease might next make the jump to humans , and how it will do it , even more difficult .
Sources and stages
The Nature study examined the suspected sources of diseases found in temperate and tropical climates .
Many of the temperate diseases , such as measles , mumps , smallpox , influenza A and tuberculosis , are believed to have come from domestic animals as farmers came into close contact with them .
Many tropical diseases , on the other hand , came from wild non-human primates , such as chimpanzees .
Though they are not as abundant as domestic animals , these primates are our closest cousins and therefore pose the weakest species barrier for pathogens to morph to our physiology .
In both tropical and temperate zones , virtually all other diseases came from mammals and sometimes birds .
For example , rodents , while far removed from us genetically , are in frequent close contact with humans in some places , and so easily spread diseases such as the Black Plague , which wiped out a third of Europe 's population in the Middle Ages .
The study authors listed five stages that infectious diseases transition through , from those found exclusively in animals to those that infect only humans :
Stage 1 : pathogen is only present in animals and is not transmitted to humans
Stage 2 : animal pathogen can be transmitted to humans but not between humans ( e.g. rabies )
Stage 3 : animal pathogen can be transmitted between humans for a few cycles , causing occasional outbreaks that die out quickly ( e.g. Ebola )
Stage 4 : animal pathogen can undergo more extended transmission between humans ( e.g. yellow fever , dengue fever and cholera )
Stage 5 : pathogens exclusive to humans that either co-evolved with us or made the animal - to - human jump ( e.g. measles , mumps , rubella , smallpox , syphilis and HIV )
Most animal pathogens never pass Stage 1 : adapting to an entirely different physiology is not an easy thing for a pathogen to do .
But recently , we ’ve been helping them make that leap through blood transfusions , international travel and intravenous drug use , the authors said .
“ People move pathogens around , ” Ostfeld , who was not involved in the Nature study , said .
Biodiversity
Still , one of the biggest factors these days that could affect the emergence of zoonoses is biodiversity , which is used as a measure of an ecosystem ’s health : the more variety of living beings there is , the healthier the system is .
“ Biodiversity can reduce pathogen transmission among hosts and therefore protect our health , ” Ostfeld said at the symposium .
He has done work to show that infection rates decrease as species numbers increase .
One example he cited looked at hantavirus infection rates in two small rodent “ reservoir ” species , or those that easily become infected with the disease .
In areas of the South American forest where other rodents were cleared out by the researchers , the reservoir species became infected at a greater rate .
It is thought that the hantavirus thrives in this case because the rodents no longer have to compete with other species for resources , so they became more abundant and encounter each other more often , spreading the disease by fighting .
Another example is West Nile virus , which is spread by certain species of birds .
The virus seems to be thwarted in areas of high bird diversity , where the virus might encounter a duck instead of a crow , the former being a poor reservoir .
“ It ’s a dead end for the virus , ” Ostfeld told LiveScience .
But when reservoir species are all that exist in an ecosystem , humans are more likely to come into contact with an infected animal , increasing the chances that the virus could jump species .
Potential patterns
Another study presented at the symposium by ecologist Jones mapped the emergence of infectious diseases since 1940 and found they had increased in recent decades and mostly emerged in the American Northeast and Europe .
Ostfeld said this finding made sense considering the low biodiversity associated with these areas compared to the tropics .
Most of the emerging diseases had jumped to humans from wildlife , Jones found , “ which supports the suggestion that these kinds of human pathogens [ or zoonotic diseases ] are an important source of future epidemics and future disease emergence in humans , ” Jones said .
Diseases can be exposed to new hosts as the planet warms : the spread of warmer temperatures enlarges the potential habitats of organisms , such as mosquitoes , that spread disease , into higher latitudes and altitudes than they inhabited before , Ostfeld explained .
But UCLA 's Nathan Wolfe , lead author of the Nature study , cautions that much is still unknown about the impact of biodiversity on disease transmission and emergence .
He added that even with high biodiversity , there will always be diseases .
“ There will continue to be new diseases that enter into the human population , ” Wolfe said .
“ That ’s inevitable . ”
To better understand the movement of pathogens and how they might spread and jump to humans , the authors of the Nature study and scientists such as Jones have called for better research into the origins of existing diseases and the development of predictive models and warning systems to alert us to any potential emerging threats — otherwise , the next big outbreak might catch us by surprise .

It ’s been a while since I updated one of these , but this seems like a good time for an inventory review .
Crude inventories are very high , distillate inventories are about normal , and gasoline inventories were gradually clawing their way back , but are still very low for this time of year .
But in a big surprise this week , gasoline inventories sharply reversed direction from their recent trend .
( However , falling inventories are the norm for this time of year ) .
Some highlights from the text file :
Refineries operated at 91.0 percent of their operable capacity last week .
However , gasoline production dropped compared to the previous week , averaging nearly 9.2 million barrels per day , while distillate fuel production fell slightly , averaging nearly 4.0 million barrels per day .
Total motor gasoline imports ( including both finished gasoline and gasoline blending components ) last week averaged 915,000 barrels per day .
Gasoline imports were strong while prices were at record highs .
Looks like prices may need to head back that direction to attract more imports .
That gasoline import number is pretty weak , considering gasoline imports have been running at well over a million barrels per day .
I suspect today ’s report means gasoline prices will continue their recent climb , after bottoming out a couple of weeks ago .
That refinery utilization number is another big story .
We have yet to see 92 % utilization this summer .
You have to go all the way back to 1991 to see summer utilization numbers in this range .
Last year 's June number was 93 % , and it was over 97 % in June of 2004 and 2005 .
U.S. commercial crude oil inventories ( excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ) declined by 0.5 million barrels compared to the previous week .
However , at 352.1 million barrels , U.S. crude oil inventories remain well above the upper end of the average range for this time of year .
Total motor gasoline inventories fell by 2.3 million barrels last week , and remain below the lower end of the average range .
That is a sharp reversal from previous weeks , in which inventories – buoyed by very strong imports – were heading back toward the lower end of the average range .
I would have to check , but I suspect gasoline inventories are back in record low territory again ( for this time of year ) .
Over the last four weeks , motor gasoline demand has averaged over 9.6 million barrels per day , or 1.3 percent above the same period last year .
Record demand in the face of still very high prices .
I do n’t think people are getting the message that these new , higher prices are unlikely to be temporary .
I also get the feeling that people have lost sight of the fact that despite the recent climb in gasoline inventories , they remain well below normal for this time of year .
Here are some excerpts from what OPIS published in their 7/18/07 report :
After showing some weakness earlier this week the gasoline futures market got a boost from some bullish DOE data in the form of a draw of more than 2 million bbl when the market was anticipating a build .
DOE analysis shows that the four - week demand average is the highest ever .
Also data from the API through the first six months of 2007 painted a strong demand picture as well .
The biggest shock was the draw of 2.3 million bbl from gasoline inventories and as the DOE pointed out most of the draw came from the finished gasoline category , while blending components was only down slightly .
Gasoline got a " triple whammy " of sorts with gasoline output slipping , imports dropping below 1 million b/d and demand moving past the 9.7 million b/d mark .
Demand for gasoline has been relentless most of the summer , according to government data .
Last week , demand rose to 9.7 million b/d , and over the last four weeks demand growth is ahead of last year by 1.3 % .
I will not be surprised to see spot shortages , as were caused when the recent Coffeyville refinery went down .
A large refinery outage in just about any location could lead to shortages relatively quickly .
But if we coast through the rest of the summer with no major hurricanes or other problems , the general public may never know just how precarious the situation was this year .
To me , the country 's gas supply right now is like a homeowner without homeowner 's insurance .
That 's just fine , until you need it .

Free Drink Vending Machines in Japan
Thirsty Japanese will soon be able to drink coffee or other non-alcoholic beverages at a low price or even for free — as long as they watch a 30 - second advertisement on the vending machines .
Vending machine operator Apex Corp. will start a service next month to turn its machines into a new medium for advertisers , who will pick up the partial or full cost of drinks .
Apex runs 35,000 vending machines across Japan that serve drinks in paper cups , generally priced at 70 to 120 yen ( 60 cents to one dollar ) a cup .
Under the â€˜MediCafe ’ project , the vending machine will play an advertiser ’s video for around the 30 seconds it takes to pour the drink and dispense a paper cup with an advertisement printed on it .
Apex said some of its vending machines are at public places ideal for selective advertising such as supermarkets , amusement parks , office buildings and schools .

A COUPLE of years ago when waging war in Iraq seemed like a good idea , Americans famously dubbed the reluctant French , “ cheese - eating surrender monkeys ” .
Wisely , they failed to diss that other staple of the French diet , wine , the producers of which clearly have the stomach for a fight .
Earlier this month a group of radical wine producers calling itself CRAV released an al - Qaeda - style video in which seven balaclava - wearing men threatened violence unless the French government put up the price of wine .
How seriously to take their threat that “ blood will flow ” is uncertain , but it would be unwise to dismiss it .
Already there have been reports of attacks with small explosive devices against supermarkets selling foreign plonk in the Languedoc region , believed to be home to the shadowy CRAV , the Union for Viticultural Action .
Shots have been fired at a lorry bringing wine from abroad .
The last time the wine industry revolted , exactly 100 years ago , the army fired at the demonstrators , killing six .
Nicolas Sarkozy , the new president of France , no doubt expects a battle with his country 's notoriously combative workers as he tries to make good on his promise to modernise the economy .
But he probably did n't think that his first fight would be a war on terroirism .
How he handles it will be watched closely by foreign investors , who have high hopes that “ Sarko ” can make France a great place to do business .
Mr Sarkozy has certainly sent many encouraging signals , not least by delivering a campaign speech in London , now home to 300,000 French people — by some accounts , France 's entire stock of entrepreneurs .
He seems determined to shake up the country 's paralysing labour - market regulations .
He seems far more likely to deliver economic reform than his predecessor , Jacques Chirac , or his socialist rival in the election , Ségolène Royal — which is why The Economist endorsed him for the Elysée Palace .
At a recent gathering in San Francisco , one leading American venture capitalist was so enthusiastic about Mr Sarkozy that he told The Economist that France and America may be about to swap economic models .
But in truth , this probably owed as much to his gloom about America 's growing risk - aversion and enthusiasm for regulating business as to a detailed knowledge of France and the prospects for change .
Although Mr Sarkozy talks of modernisation , he has long been an economic nationalist and a promoter of French business champions , quick to spout protectionist rhetoric .
At last week 's European Union summit he reportedly caused a stir by opposing the inclusion of a clear statement in favour of “ free and undistorted competition ” in the EU 's new constitution , oops , treaty .
( A French president opposing competition ?
Whatever next !)
It will not be much of a surprise if the president decides to treat French wine as a national champion , rather than as a test of his determination to reform the economy .
AFP
Drinking it up
Over -regulated labour markets are not the main problem facing the French wine industry — though other policies are partly to blame .
The European Commission is about to announce a big reform of Europe 's wine - market regulations , which will give Mr Sarkozy a chance to show where he stands .
Although this plan will involve no reduction in the generous budget to support European wine , signs are that there will be widespread resistance from wine - growing countries , including France .
Mariann Fischer Boel , the EU 's agriculture commissioner , says that “ there is more tension in wine than I have seen in any other agricultural product ” .
The EU 's plans include shifting government spending to promote European wines abroad and to foster a wider range of businesses , including wine tourism , in wine - growing regions .
Another proposal is to pay low - quality growers to quit the industry .
Each year about half a billion euros goes to subsidise winemakers whose output is of such poor quality that , instead of being drunk , it is turned into industrial alcohol .
Brussels has also suggested ploughing up thousands of acres of vineyard in the Languedoc region .
The CRAV claims that it will fight the plan much as the French resistance fought the Nazis .
Two things have gone wrong for French winemakers .
First , producers elsewhere in the world have got much bigger and much better , especially at exporting and marketing .
Second , the French have been protected to some degree by the complex regulations governing their industry domestically and within the EU .
Perhaps as a result of weak competitive pressures , they have been slow to respond to innovations by foreign producers , who tend to stress grape varieties and branded blends rather than place of origin .
Of course , the very best French wines remain highly sought - after , and exactly where they come from matters a lot , and rightly so .
But that is not true for much vin ordinaire .
Allowing “ free and undistorted competition ” would strengthen the French wine industry in the long run , even though many of the low - quality producers would need to find another career .
But , unless Mr Sarkozy is a truly bold reformer , this year 's clarets are likely to be ready for drinking long before that happens .
The CRAV would have been meat and , er , drink to Frederic Bastiat , the great satirical French economist and early fan of The Economist .
In his famous “ Candlemakers ' Petition ” of 1845 , he argued on behalf of candlemakers that the French government should block out the sun , to prevent its unfair competition with their products .
Were he around today , he would no doubt have adapted this petition for the CRAV .
It would call on President Sarko to stop the sun shining on the vineyards of the Mosel and Piedmont , New South Wales , the Cape and Napa , so that its rays fell only on the grapes of France .
Defence Secretary Robert Gates is facing some stiff questions
But Robert Gates said the US would have a " good idea " of the Iraqi government 's success before many new troops went in .
The plan , by which more than 20,000 more troops will be sent to Iraq , may begin in earnest around the first week in February , he told a Senate hearing .
Both Democrats and some Republicans have criticised the plan .
Mr Bush plans to send at least 20,000 more troops , saying it will help bring security to Baghdad 's streets .
' Sound plan '
Mr Gates is facing the Senate Armed Services Committee together with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Gen Peter Pace .
I think that any time you announce a specific deadline ... for departing in a situation as volatile as this , you basically give your adversaries the confidence that all they have to do is wait you out
Robert Gates
Can new way forward work ?
UK ' faces big decision '
Press savages Bush plan
But he appears to have had a less hostile reception in the Senate than Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , who was grilled by the Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday .
Florida Senator Bill Nelson put this down to the fact that Mr Gates was a " breath of fresh air " , having only joined the Bush administration in December .
In his opening statements , Mr Gates acknowledged widespread concern over the strategy .
But he emphasised that US military commanders on the ground in Iraq backed the president 's plan .
" They believe it is a sound plan that can work - if the Iraqi government follows through on its commitments , " he said .
Responding to questions , he said the new troops would be sent in gradually .
One brigade will go in the middle of this month .
A second brigade wo n't go until the middle of next month , " he said .
For America to supply more troops while the Iraqi leaders simply supply more promises is not a recipe for success in Iraq

Committee chairman
Bush speech at a glance Reaction to Bush speech
" And then they will flow at roughly monthly intervals , so that after we have sent in just two or three of the brigades , I think we will ... have a pretty good idea whether at least on the military side the Iraqis have stepped up to the plate in terms of fulfilling their commitments .
But Mr Gates did not say what the US would do if the Iraqi government failed to meet the commitments .
He also said there should be no announcement of a troop pullout , whenever this was to happen .
" I think that any time you announce a specific deadline or specific time - line for departing in a situation as volatile as this , you basically give your adversaries the confidence that all they have to do is wait you out , " he said .
But both Democrats and Republicans have continued to criticise the strategy .
Democrat Senator Carl Levin , the committee chairman , said he opposed sending in more troops " without condition , without limitation " .
" For America to supply more troops while the Iraqi leaders simply supply more promises is not a recipe for success in Iraq , " he said .
Disappointment
The hearing also sought to address concerns about possible military action against Iran .
Gen Pace denied that President Bush 's promise to tackle Tehran 's interference in Iraq would lead to US military operations inside Iran .
" From a military standpoint , no need to cross the Iranian border , " he said .
Mr Bush made his announcement of a " surge " force of troops in a televised speech on Wednesday .
Alongside criticism from Democrats - who now control both houses of Congress - several Republicans have publicly expressed their disappointment with the move , which runs counter to recommendations by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group .
The Democrats have promised a non-binding vote in both houses of Congress on the strategy .
The general population really does n’t understand digital technology .
And it ’s costing them money .
This was brought home to me last weekend while helping a friend choose a new TV .
In the local shop , I noticed a variety of HDMI cables for sale .
Now HDMI , for those of you not familiar with it , is quite a nice standard .
It provides digital video and digital audio down a single compact and convenient connection .
Much neater than the bulky DVI , VGA , SCART etc which preceded it .
However , notice that it ’s a digital standard .
This means that , subject to major failures , what goes in at one end ought to come out at the other .
Why , then , does the store sell a variety of cables of different qualities and prices ?
In the days of analog connections , there was something to be said for low - impedance connections and for careful screening .
Who knows , those articles in the hi- fi press extolling the virtues of gold plugs and low - oxygen copper cables might even have had something to them .
But in the digital world , if you put ones and zeros in one end of a cable and do n’t get something recognisable as ones and zeros at the other , you do n’t get a slightly worse picture or sound .
You get complete breakdown , and major image or sound corruption .
A cable which does that should not be sold at a cheaper price ; it should n’t be sold at all .
Better - quality cabling will allow things to work over greater distances , but for the average user with a DVD player under his TV , it will make no difference at all .
For example , my ( quite expensive ) CD player is connected to my ( quite expensive ) amplifier through a digital COAX connection .
I use a single phono - phono cable I bought for about $ 1 in a Radio Shack sale .
And the sound is perfect .
So I asked the nice man in the shop about the fact that they sold a modest - length HDMI cable for over £ 100 just beside the one for £ 15 ( which , incidentally , probably costs less than a dollar to make ) .
“ Oh yes ” , he said , “ it does have an effect .
We had a customer do a side - by - side test just recently and he could see a difference .
He bought the more expensive cable . ”
“ But how ? ” , I asked .
“ It ’s ones and zeros !
You do n’t get better quality ones or nicer - shaped zeros by paying more !
How could there be a difference ? ”
“ Well , the customer said there was one .
I do n’t really understand the science behind how it all works … ”
The customer is always right , you see .
Even when science is against him .
And now back to my copy of Richard Dawkins …
Followup : Gizmodo did some tests and agreed with my assertion .
It makes no difference whether you have cheap leads or expensive ones for short distances .
It can be worth paying the extra if your cable is more than 50ft long .

On Monday , the Commission charged with investigating Israel 's military campaign against Lebanon last summer issued its scathing report to Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
Last night on " The Daily Show , " Jon broke down the contents of the report and noticed some staggering parallels between the conduct of Olmert and Bush .

On a more serious note , Glenn wrote about the report yesterday :
All of this underscores a fundamental difference between Israel and the right - wing faction in the U.S. For Israel -- whatever else you might think about its policies and government -- war is an extremely serious matter .
They do n't send other people 's children off to fight the wars they cheer on ; their own children fight the wars .
During the invasion of Lebanon , missiles continuously landed deep in Israeli territory , killing killing or wounding hundreds and forcing hundreds of thousands to flee their homes or live in bomb shelters .

The team produced ray traced versions of the video game Quake
At the tech - fair Cebit , a team from the university demonstrated a lighting technique , known as ray - tracing , using relatively low - powered processors .
Before now , many powerful computers were needed to generate the life - like images this technique can produce .
But the scientists have shown they can achieve the effect using custom - made chips or a high - end PC graphics card .
Graphics in computer games are typically rendered via a technique known as rasterisation which involves drawing all the elements of a scene using polygons .
The holy grail for game makers is to use ray - tracing to depict scenes far more realistically because it models the way rays of light bounce around a scene and are reflected off objects .
Cinema quality effects
However the computational power needed to keep track of the light has meant that it can only be done using large numbers of dedicated machines .
You can even do reflections on reflections on reflections
Daniel Pohl University of Saarland
Film studio Pixar uses ray - tracing to produce the images for its cartoons and Peter Jackson used the technique in the Lord of the Rings to make special effects look convincing .
But Professor Philipp Slusallek and co-workers from the University of Saarland have developed a series of ray - tracing algorithms that promise to make it much easier to use the technique .
Daniel Pohl , one of the researchers who has worked with Professor Slusallek , has used the algorithms to produce ray - traced versions of the Quake 3 and 4 video games .
" It gives much higher image quality in shadows and reflections , " said Mr Pohl .
" You can even do reflections on reflections on reflections . "
This is something that would be impossible with traditional rendering techniques .
The algorithms are well - suited to the next generation of PC chips that have multiple processing cores inside them .
Separate cores could be used to model different rays to make good use of the available computer power , said Mr Pohl .
The algorithms are being made available to anyone to use via the Open RT project .
For the most part , the White House press corps has decided that George Bush commuting the sentence of a convicted perjurer and obstructor of justice to protect his own administration 's wrongdoings is old news and not worth pursuing .
But every now and then , one of them feels a tiny spark of the reason they became a journalist and brings up that pesky miscarriage of justice :
Q Tony , you noted this morning that the sentences in the Border Patrol case were within the federal sentencing guidelines .
They also were in the Libby case .
So those guidelines are not a hurdle around here ?
MR .
SNOW : Well , actually -- no , if you take a look , actually , there is some dispute in legal circles about what the proper boundaries were for the sentencing in the Libby case .
And I 'll leave it at that .
I 'll leave it to the lawyers -- Q
No one recommended no jail time .
MR .
SNOW : On the other hand , there are differing benchmarks there for the use of it .
What you do have is you 've got probation , you 've got a $ 250,000 fine .
That 's a significant punishment .
Q
Is it the administration 's position that the sentence in that case was beyond the federal sentencing guidelines ?
MR .
SNOW : Again , I will -- I 'm not going to try to get myself into the legal cases , but you 've seen arguments on both sides .
I think if you took at look at the court papers -- I 'm not going to try to fob myself off as a lawyer on this .
I 'll let the lawyers argue over it .
Well
Tony might not be a lawyer , but it would have been a nice follow - up had he been asked to dispute what the Judge who handed down the sentence said :
In commuting the defendent 's thirty - three month incarceration , the President stated that the sentence imposed by this Court was " excessive " and that two years of supervised release and a $ 250,000 fine alone are a " harsh punishment " for an individual convicted on multiple counts of perjury , obstruction of justice , and making false statements to federal investigators ...
Although it is certainly the President 's prerogative to justify the exercise of his constitutional commutation power in whatever manner he chooses ( or even to decline to provide a reason for his actions altogether ) , the Court notes that the term of incarceration imposed in this case was determined after a careful consideration of each of the requisite statutory factors , see 18 U.S.C. & 3553 ( 2000 ) , and was consistent with the bottom end of the applicable sentencing range as calculated under the United States Sentencing Guidelines .
Rather than allowing Snow to fob off White House talking points to justify Bush 's actions on them , perhaps the press corps could demand a legal justification for the White House 's claim .
You know , follow their own code of ethics that demand :
... the principles of — truthfulness , accuracy , objectivity , impartiality , fairness and public accountability -
It would be a nice change of pace .
The Bush administration is once again in the process of committing a major policy blunder in the Middle East , one that is liable to have disastrous consequences and is not receiving the attention it should .
This time it concerns the Israeli–Palestinian relationship .
The Bush administration is actively supporting the Israeli government in its refusal to recognize a Palestinian unity government that includes Hamas , which the US State Department considers a terrorist organization .
This precludes any progress toward a peace settlement at a time when progress on the Palestinian problem could help avert a conflagration in the greater Middle East .
The United States and Israel seek to deal only with the president of the Palestinian Authority , Mahmoud Abbas , in the hope that new elections would deny Hamas the majority it now has in the Palestinian Legislative Council .
This is a hopeless strategy because Hamas has said it would boycott early elections , and even if their outcome would result in Hamas ’s exclusion from the government , no peace agreement would hold without Hamas ’s support .
In the meantime Saudi Arabia is pursuing a different path .
In a February summit in Mecca between Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal , the Saudi government worked out an agreement between Hamas and Fatah , which have been clashing violently , to form a national unity government .
According to the Mecca accord , Hamas has agreed “ to respect international resolutions and the agreements [ with Israel ] signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization , ” including the Oslo Accords .
According to press reports on March 15 , the new government , like the present one , will be headed by Ismail Haniya , the Hamas prime minister , but Hamas will get nine of the government ’s twenty - four ministries , as well as an additional minister without portfolio ; President Abbas and his Fatah party will control six ministries , and independent representatives — some said to be under the control of Hamas or Fatah — and other political factions will fill the nine remaining ministries .
The Saudi government views this accord as the prelude to the offer of a peace settlement with Israel , along the lines of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative , a settlement to be guaranteed by Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries , based on the 1967 borders and full recognition of Israel .
The offer was meant to be elaborated by Saudi King Abdullah at the Arab League meeting to be hosted by Saudi Arabia at the end of March .
But no progress is possible as long as the Bush administration and the Ehud Olmert government persist in their current position of refusing to recognize a unity government that includes Hamas .
The recent meeting between Condoleezza Rice , Abbas , and Olmert turned into an empty formality .
Many of the causes of the current impasse go back to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon ’s decision to withdraw from the Gaza Strip unilaterally , without negotiating with the then - Fatah - controlled Palestinian Authority .
This strengthened the position of Hamas .
In the run-up to the January 2006 Palestinian legislative elections , Sharon refused to lift a finger to help Fatah ’s prospects .
At the behest of …
First thing I notice , walking into the familiar old Great Room , is that the crowd has n't changed .
There 's one small difference that I can't put my finger on ... it'll come to me , I 'm sure .
More familiarity : mature fires are burning in the two great stone mantles at opposing ends of the room , each contributing warmth and a certain inevitable smoke .
I make my way to the bar — where else ?
As I weave through the tables , old faces and new glance up from lively conversations , some smiling to greet me or wink at me .
Oh , it 's good to be back again .
I 've never been happier to walk into this room .
Not so much because I 've been away , but because of where I 've been .
How could I have let it happen ?
I do n't know how I 'll explain to any of my old friends ... better not to dwell on it for now .
I arrive at the bar , settle onto one of the ancient teak stools .
Before I 've so much as glanced at the tap , a young , fashionably unkempt bartender I do n't recognize sets down a half - yard of cool pilsner and declares : " On the house !
Welcome back ! "
Before I can ask him his name he's off again , delivering a pair of frothing mugs to a pair of codgers laughing at some private joke near the far end of the bar from where I sit .
I study my pils .
It 's my regular fare , but I do n't recognize the bartender .
I must be getting old .
The thought occurs to me that the only difference in the tavern crowd , in the six months I 've been away , is that they seem to have aged backwards .
Depressing ?
Maybe not .
Life had its challenges when I was younger , too .
Except for recent events , and surely they 're anomalous , growing old has n't been as bad as I 've heard it would be .
The past half year , sure , it 's put years on my life ... but that 's quickly becoming so much bridgewater now that I 'm back in town .
Things already seem better .
I take my lager over to a table to enjoy it quietly .
I want to be lost for a while in the noisy company around me .
I choose an aged bench , an old favorite , its familiar knots worn smooth by countless drunken backsides , its gouges and furrows sealed with some unknown caulking the color of greasy smoke .
I sip my pilsner and wonder again how it could have happened to me .
Who would believe it ?
I resolve not to tell anyone .
Instead I might tell the comfortable half - truths that people are expecting from me : I 've been busy with personal affairs , all of which are now resolved satisfactorily , and now I 'm back among the living .
That 's all anyone really needs to know .
My lager 's gold deepens to sudden wheat as a shadow blots out the entire westward hearth from my vantage : an enormous blonde man , easily twice my size , is settling down directly across from me .
My worries leave me on the instant .
" Rauser !
What are the odds — how long has it been , friend ? "
I greet him with genuine cheer , and find I can't suppress a huge grin .
I had n't expected to see him here this afternoon .
" Too long , and then longer , " Rauser booms back at me .
He waves at the barkeep , pointing at the tap .
The funny thing about Rauser was that he always booms .
His voice can't do anything but boom .
I 've known him for most of my life , and he 's never been able to whisper .
That trait got us into a lot of trouble as kids .
But he also has the knack of talking his way out of trouble .
Rauser and I , we go waaaay back .
I 'd trust him with my life .
Rauser 's aged visibly since we last spoke , perhaps nine or ten months ago .
His broad , almost ageless face has finally begun to sport lines , and his temples are half an inch higher .
And he looks every bit as tired as I feel .
" What have you been up to , Raus old buddy ?
I heard you have n't been around here much lately .
Although — admittedly — I have n't been around muchly myself to look for you . "
I 'm genuinely curious .
Rauser was once as much a regular here as I myself had been , not a year ago .
Rauser eyes my half - drained glass with unconcealed longing , grunts , turns to locate the barkeep .
I push my glass over to him .
" Have it .
You look like you need a head start . "
" Thanks , bud ! "
He drains it in a gulp , wipes his mouth , and shouts over the crowd to the pot -boy near the east fire , who seems to be taking his time serving a group of five or six young women who look like tourists .
The pot -boy notices me and Rauser waving at him and bolts behind the bar .
Rauser looks me up and down appraisingly .
I 'm still grinning at how fast he demolished my beer .
" You back for real now ?
Or just visiting ? " " I 'm back , " I announce , and as I say it I feel the truth of it .
I really am back .
I 've been away from Story for far too long , and although I have a whopper of a tale , it 's still too real to tell .
Stories are best after they 've settled a bit , not when they 're still raw and confusing and do n't seem quite dead enough to handle yet , not without risking getting your hand bitten by a side story or a vignette that has n't played out yet , or simply has n't realized that it 's supposed to be over .
I 'm back for real , but my story will have to wait .
I need to rest and mull over it .
When it 's been mulled to sufficiency , I 'll seal its gouges and furrows with a little smoke to make it comfortable to tell , which of course has to happen before it 's comfortable to hear .
All good stories should make you a little uncomfortable , and great stories can wound a person and leave scars for life .
But if you 're not careful , and you do n't wait just a little before telling it , a fresh enough story can even do damage to itself .
So I want to hear someone else 's story , and Rauser looks like he has a pretty good one to tell me .
As we wait for our beer , I 'm suffused with an odd mixture of nostalgia and relief .
It has been a very long time since I 've felt a pang this intense that was n't guilt , or shame , or dread , and I suddenly feel nostalgic for the feeling of nostalgia , and relieved that I can once more feel relief .
How did I let it happen to me ?
I wonder ... The pot -boy finally makes his way to us with a pair of oversized steins .
We 've switched to a dark malt , rich and subtle as fine chocolate , and I take a me-sized swig while Rauser takes a Rauser - sized swig .
Our mugs thump to the table with different thump - pitches .
I 'd swear Rauser 's mug sounds empty .
This place always has the best beer .
Maybe that 's part of why the stories are always so good .
Here 's the story Rauser tells me .
It 's a little raw , but it 's how he tells it to me .
I 'll try to keep my side - commentary to a minimum , at least after his story gets underway .
I 'll also try to remain true to Rauser 's phrasing , which is as unique and personal as the man himself .
Whatever .
Here 's what he booms out :
" My old friend , best of friends ...
" He always starts that way .
I 'm not trying to disguise my name or anything .
It 's just how he starts his stories with me .
We actually are pretty close to best friends , though .
One or two heads turn , since it sounds like a story is starting up , but we pay them no attention .
"
You know I 've been gone a good while , and I 've got a tale to tell all right .
But I have n't spun it properly for a real Telling , not for an audience and all .
So I 'll just tell you , and I 'll let the story take its real shape as I read your reactions .
Got it ?
" I nod knowingly .
More beer , is what Rauser is saying .
No secrets between friends , and Rauser 's an old friend .
It 's the best kind of story introduction : just between you and me , for your ears only .
That 's always a call for more beer .
I wave to the pot-boy , catching his attention ; he nods from across the room and heads to the bar .
Rauser continues ... " I 've thought long and hard about how to tell this story , how to explain how I just disappeared for close to a year .
I have n't decided yet .
But you 're getting the true version .
And there 's a hard bit to swallow right in the beginning , so let 's get it out of the way .
" Rauser eyes me with sudden intensity .
I'm a little uncomfortable , even , and drop my eyes to my beer glass .
I hope he has n't murdered someone .
"
Here it is , whether you believe me or not : I had a spell put on me by an evil wizard , and I 've been laboring under that spell for the past ninemonth and some weeks .
That 's what happened to me .
It was a modern - day , evil wizard , and you and I both know they do n't exist .
But that 's the truth of it .
" He pauses , not proceeding with his story , waiting for me to react .
I try not to , but I think I may have winced involuntarily , just a little wince , when I heard him say " evil wizard " .
I take a deep breath and say nothing .
At least he has n't murdered anyone , unless that 's supposed to be his alibi .
But I think he saw me wince .
Since that 's my only reaction , he runs with it : " Fine , fine , now that I hear myself saying it , I know it sounds unconvincing as all that .
But hear me out , hear me out .
I 'm not talking about fireworks or so - called mystical rituals or any such nonsense .
You know me well enough for that .
What I 'm telling you is much more subtle .
I only know a few words that can adequately describe what happened to me .
So when I tell you I was entrapped by a spell cast by an evil wizard , old friend , that 's just me doing my best to explain something entirely outside my realm of experience .
And you and I do n't lack for experience .
" The pot -boy arrives with two full yards of dark brown lager .
Good boy .
He can tell we 're about to embark on a story , and gets out of our way quickly .
I give Rauser 's glass a solid clink with my own , wordlessly accepting his explanation and inviting him to tell me the whole story .
I regret my little wince from before ; it 's just that ... no matter , no matter .
I put it out of my mind as Rauser begins his story in earnest : " I 'll tell you this much : I 'll never eat another marshmallow again , not if I live to be a hundred .
" About nine months back , I landed a job with a local landowner .
He had an old mansion on the property , and he'd forever been fiddling with it , adding extensions here and there , and it had never really , well , coalesced I guess is the word for it .
It had n't settled down and grown character the way a mansion should .
It was just a mess , a big eyesore that he said was as uncomfortable to live in as to look at .
So he wanted us to build him a brand - new mansion on another part of his property .
That was the job .
" Normally you and I work with our own crews , hand - picked , but this landowner was in a hurry and had some of his own people in mind .
He talked me into joining on , and it was n't a hard sell , because I was looking for something big , and this job had real promise .
It did , and it still does .
I 'm still on it , in fact .
" This landowner already has it made ; he 's got more cash than a reasonable person could ever need , enough to build himself a brand - new mansion while he 's living out of his old one .
And he has other properties , and such .
You know the type .
Rich entrepreneur .
He was n't happy with any of his other mansions , though , and he wants this one to be fit to house a king .
He 's set on it .
" I do n't know if he 's planning on inviting a king , or being one himself , but his plans for this mansion are immense .
It 's more palace than mansion .
When it 's done , and I 've no doubt it 'll be one of the finest mansions most folks will ever lay eyes on , assuming they ever go out there .
It 's quite a haul from here ... " Rauser squints at his beer , momentarily unsure of himself .
He takes a huge gulp of it and continues , more confident .
That 's beer for you .
" You and I have done this kind of job plenty of times , and you know they take years .
But there were two catches that made this job especially tricky .
As if it were n't hard enough already !
" The first catch : this property we 're building on is a lowland , with swamps and standing water , and you can't drain it .
The water would just come right back .
Traditionally the way the planner solves this is by bringing in earth , mounds and mountains of it , and building it up high above the water line .
" It can take a long time to build a foundation like that , and you know as well as I do they do n't always work .
You need to let the hill settle before building on it .
But the purse strings are always drawn tight during those waits , and better than half the jobs wind up building on piles of fresh dirt .
Things go well for a while , but when the dirt gets enough weight on it , the whole foundation can collapse .
We 've seen it happen .
Oft as not the job will be over at that point — the landowner is out of coin , or someone on the crew is injured and they all leave superstitiously , or maybe the landowner blames the crew but can't find replacements who'll take the job .
And sometimes everyone 's lined up to keep working , but the thing is damaged beyond repair , and they grind away uselessly for a while before the effort just falls apart on its own .
" We 've seen all those things happen before .
Sure , we 've seen successes with the build - a- hill approach , even done a few ourselves , but conditions have to be just right .
You need proper time , proper planning , proper funding , fair weather , a strong crew , and a handy bit o' luck thrown in for a project like that to complete . "
" The other catch to this dream job was the time : it had to be done on an impossible schedule .
The landowner , a reasonable and respectable man in my judgment , had never undertaken this kind of job before , and did n't estimate the effort properly .
The complexity and expense of a job like this are proportional to the physical size of the structure , so building a mansion just half again bigger than your last one can easily quadruple the effort required .
It 's deceptive .
And it does n't matter how you try to explain it , because from a distance it looks the same as the other jobs they 've seen .
They do n't realize they 're not just making it bigger ; they 're making it fancier while they 're at it .
Every new mansion has to be better than the neighboring mansions in every imaginable way , and it can wind up being ten or even a hundred times the work to build the last one .
"
You can see now why I took the job .
Building a palace fit for a king , on a swamp fit for a crocodile , with a schedule that would n't work for a midwife , let alone for building a normal - sized mansion .
That 's the kind of job that gets your attention , because if you do it right , and then you pull it off , some nobleman really will buy the thing , and your crew along with it .
I 've seen folks like us retire after one job like that .
" Rauser pauses significantly for a deep draught of his lager .
The mention of early retirement , or any retirement at all , always deserves a respectful drink in our profession , and I salute him with my glass .
None of us would ever retire the way you 'd think of it , of course ; we 're master builders , and in so - called retirement we 'd likely continue puttering on our own homes and other projects forever .
But doing your own thing on your own time is a damn sight better than doing it all for someone else .
Well , that 's what I 've heard .
Ca n't say myself , and neither can Rauser , but retirement is still one of our favorite toasts .
" So now you know the job , or as much about it as matters , and you know why I took it , and why he picked me .
This landowner tracked me down at another site , where I was negotiating a new job .
I 'm surprised he did n't track you down too .
We could have used you .
Still could .
He was going for top talent and paying top price , so I felt he was leaving starting gate with the right attitude and initial decisions .
How many projects can we say that about ?
" I laughed long and hard at his proposed schedule , and he took it well enough .
He asked me how long I thought I needed , and when I told him , he did n't balk .
That clinched it for me .
This was going to be a dream job , after all : the kind where you build something that lasts for generations , the kind of job you can rest a career on .
" I told him I 'd take the job on one condition : I alone get to make the decision about how to handle the swamp .
I had an interesting idea in mind about how to build on the wetlands .
It 's not something we 've seen done on this scale before , but I was convinced it would work .
Even so , it took a bit of negotiation and some persuasion to get him to agree to my plan , because once you go this route you 're committed from day one .
" My idea was to build a big floating platform , then build the mansion on the platform .
I told him the platform would take three to five months , at which point it would n't be completely finished , but it would be strong and stable enough to let us start construction on the mansion .
Then we 'd continue to shore up the platform and refine it as needed while we built him his little palace .
" He was intrigued , just as you seem to be .
But I 'd been thinking about this approach and sketching out designs for , well , years if you want to know the truth .
But in the past year I 'd finally figured out the last technical obstacles .
" This platform was , and is , unlike anything you 've seen before .
You 'd never guess it was floating by looking at it .
It 's actually partly supported by land , but during the rainy season it floats fully , and during a drought the land contacts can support its full weight and then some .
Most of the floating platforms we 've seen , leastaways the ones I 've seen , maybe you know better than me , have been flimsy and skittish , built for cheap single - occupant homes .
They only do it when there 's no money for dirt .
They 're popular , sure , but I 've never heard tell of a floatable platform strong enough to park a palace , and immobilized enough so none of the occupants gets seasick walking to the cupboard for a midnight swig .
" We both take another swig , right on cue .
A master storyteller like Rauser tailors his story on the fly to keep the beer flowing , which in turn keeps the story going .
" The technical challenge , both in design and construction , was n't exactly risk - free , and both the landowner and I knew it .
But we also knew that a fivemonth is a full year sooner than the time it would take to build a strong hill .
He did n't seem to care if his mansion is elevated or not ; he'd been to the East and seen water - level palaces fit for entertaining nobles , albeit not floating ones , at least as far as he could tell me .
A hill would be nice , sure .
But this job is a home , not a fortification , and if my floating platform were viable , it would save him a fortune in both time and money .
More money for the palace !
The better the palace , the better the crew 's future career prospects ; everyone comes away happy .
" So we signed the contract on the spot , and I went straight to work .
He would provide the crew , although I was welcome to bring any of my own men as I could locate them .
Our mini -crew would start work on the platform , and after three months we'd be fully staffed and ready to start on the mansion proper , with all of us transitioned full - time to the mansion work within half a year of our contract date .
" Here , my friend , is where my story departs from being just another bland job description , floaty platform or no floaty platform , and enters the realm of the bizarre , in a way most ... unfortunate for all of us .
" Before I tell you what happened , just keep in mind the three Ms. " Rauser 's been preparing his story for a mass audience rather more than I 'd realized , if he 's bringing an M into it already .
Rauser busies himself waving down the barkeep , having finished his giant beer , but I 'm certain he 's doing it to give me time to think , and digest what he 's told me so far .
Problem is , I can't concentrate .
I 've been listening to his story silently so far , trying to avoid making any faces other than rapt attention , because I know already that any faces I make will be the wrong ones at the wrong times , and Rauser , master storyteller and friend to me that he is , will notice .
I do n't want him to stop the narrative ; the first telling can be make - or - break , and he may lose interest or change the focus of the story altogether if I push him off track inadvertently .
Raw stories are delicate to handle , even when apparently cooked with an M already , and I can tell this is Rauser 's first telling of this thing , whatever it is that happened to him .
I wo n't ruin his story by letting on that I know his entire story — at least so far — because it 's the same as my own .
The only appreciable difference is the platform ; his floats , tailored to the wetland upon which he 's building , and my platform , if that 's the right word for it , is suspended in midair with ropes , cabling , wind - power and a fair bit of fingers - crossed hope , all tailored for a castle in the sky .
Other than that irrelevant technical detail , Rauser could be telling my story , and it 's scaring me , because if it ends up the same way , then it 's not a happy one .
So I try to be stoic , almost holding my breath as his tale unfolds , told in his booming bass with big beer belches , Rauser - style .
The three Ms , by the way , are Metaphor , Misdirection , and Mashups .
All are ways of covering your tracks , of hiding the puppet wires , of fictionalizing a story that began as nonfiction ( or multiple stories , in the case of Mashups ) .
Each M is an ingredient that enhances the flavor of a story when baked in , without changing the story 's nature or intent .
A romance is still romantic , a cautionary tale still cautions , and a shaggy - dog joke , one would hope , is still funny .
The three Ms themselves are something of in - joke here in Story , because it 's tacitly understood that there are more than three , and they do n't all start with M. Whatever .
That 's writers for you .
Anyway , as soon as an M makes an appearance in a story , all bets are off .
Rauser could be telling me an old joke he heard , or a synthesis of real events that happened to others , or he could be making it all up for practice ; it 's impossible to guess .
Some storytellers have even been known to claim
Ms are present when in fact there are none , in a paradoxical application of the second M. But I have a hunch Rauser is telling me a story that 's nearly raw , in part because I 've known him so long , and in part because it jibes so closely with my own recent experiences .
Unless , of course , I 'm just making all this up for your enjoyment , which I just M - ight be .
The way these things are typically done , especially in the hands of a teller as practiced as Rauser , is each M is embodied by a character or story element that actually starts with M .
Where does that leave us ?
Marshmallow is the obvious candidate , with Mansion being a solid runner - up .
No matter .
In the end , Rauser is simply telling me that this is just a story , and that any elements of real pain in it are entirely secondary to the fact that he 's back among us , able once again to entertain and perhaps educate , and be entertained and educated himself .
That 's why we come here ; that 's all he 's really saying .
Rauser 's a beer ahead of me now .
I 'm not surprised ; he 's a big , thirsty man , and he 's been away even longer than I have .
I stop trying to pace him , and take a deep pull from my yard .
The lager is almost as sweet as mead .
I 've missed this place .
" I guess it 's time to tell you about the foreman .
Well , heck , I 'm not sure at this point who to tell you about .
After three months of toiling through the rainy season , my floating platform was large and stable enough to hold thirty mounted riders , which is all we could muster for a stability check .
It did n't budge , even though it was floating six inches above the anchor points from all the rain .
We knew it was good enough to start construction of the mansion .
We were still waiting on the final floor plan , though , and it was n't due for a month ... well , that 's a detail .
" I'm trying to avoid too much detail here , since the technical and schedule details are n't what I 'm about .
You can imagine how they went .
We had some delays , some setbacks , just like you 'd expect , but we still managed to stay on the original schedule , or close enough to it so nobody could complain .
Well — nobody rational , that is .
" About four months into the project , we started hearing ... talk .
Just bits of rumors , snippets here and there , about our crew and our project .
This landowner 's property is a good way from here , eight days ' journey with strong horses and friendly weather .
It was n't exactly a secret , but we also knew the landowner did n't want to attract attention to the mansion until it was ready to show , for the usual reasons : bandits , pranksters , and even the chance that someone else would come along and build nearby , ruining the obvious potential for selling the place as a remote summer villa or even a fancy inn , should it come to that .
" The talk we heard was about our progress .
The landlord rarely made appearances , what with it being the wet season and he needing to tend to his other affairs , abroad .
But we heard he was unhappy , or that his potential buyers were unhappy , or that a neighboring baronial type was unhappy , all manner of unhappy - talk .
The rumors were always different , and you know how they spread around , so nobody could place them .
There was just enough traffic in and out to provide a constant supply of rumor .
But we did n't pay much attention to any of it then , early on in the project , because we knew we were making great progress .
" Right around then , at least I think that 's when it was , I started noticing the marshmallows .
They were showing up in the provisions , little bags of them , and nobody thought anything of it at first .
We started roasting them on nights when it was dry enough to light a fire .
Sometimes we'd see little bowls of them appear on a workbench , or in a tool chest .
Before long they seemed to be everywhere , and we did n't think much of it at the time .
Maybe someone just liked marshmallows .
Maybe one of our food suppliers was unloading them at a bulk discount .
Nobody really cared that much , since any you did n't eat you could throw into the fire , or the swamp .
" Well , word came down from ... somewhere ...
I never quite have figured out where it originated , I suppose , but I have a good guess now .
In any event , we got word that we had to eat the marshmallows or there would be trouble of some unspecified sort .
"
It was never made clear exactly why we had to eat them , as opposed to just throwing them away and not ordering so many .
We heard that they were pushing back on the supplier , but talks were in progress ; heck , we heard so many conflicting things , I doubt any two men on our crew have the same idea in their heads today as to what really happened .
Maybe we heard that we could n't throw them in the marsh or it would attract crocodiles , or maybe we just speculated as much , one night while we were roasting them .
At the time , you know how it is , the project was really busy , we were building like crazy , and it seemed like a minor thing .
" You 've heard about boiling frogs , of course , and I tell you : even if it 's not true — never tried it myself — that wives tale about frog - boiling has the ring of truth because things like it happen all the time .
There was never a clear time or event you could point at , where the rumors and the marshmallows became recognized as a problem , because we thought the problem was us .
" You 're at a remote worksite like ours , you know how it is .
Guys tell each other stories to keep from going stir-crazy , and we crave news from the outside world , even if it 's just rumor .
Some of our foremen wound up meeting with visitors or even going offsite way more often than the crew did , and we heard most of our news through them .
And they were worried .
You could see it .
" I did n't see why they should be worried ; my floating platform was clearly going to work out just fine , and although one could fairly debate whether I 'd created a repeatable process , well , as a one - off it was just what we needed .
But I 'd hear , usually via the foremen , that the folks with the money were questioning the entire approach , and were even saying that we should have built a hill , never mind that building a hill , which is already inherently risky , takes well over a year .
" You 'd think we'd have spent more time questioning the foremen , but they assured us they were able to send accurate reports of our progress back upstream , and that as long as we could reel the schedule in just a little bit , it would reassure our patrons that we 're a competent crew worth funding . " ' How much ? ' we asked , and we were told that maybe pulling it in a month or so , and fully transitioning work from the platform to the mansion ( whose floor plans we 'd just received ) in five months instead of six would do the trick . "
" You know how much day - to - day detail goes into our jobs , and you know pulling in a six - month schedule by a month requires a minor miracle at best , or a major one if you 're unlucky .
But the picture would n't be complete without telling you about the maze .
" Another M. I 'd known one was coming .
Ca n't fool me , Rauser .
The maze is a fake , a plot device , an allegory .
Right ?
Right .
Then why did my gut just do a flip ?
Ca n't fool myself , either .
The maze — it 's in my story , too .
I 'm not sure I 'd have chosen the word " maze " , but then my story did n't exactly have marshm ... the word is sticking in my throat for some reason .
MMmmmaaaaarsshhhmmm ...
" This maze , old friend , was a real and oppressive thing .
It came upon us gradually , just like the marshmallows did , just like the rumors about our progress .
I can look back and see it growing .
It was a combination of things .
We were working out on this oddly - shaped platform , with its little docks and outcroppings and square holes to let a hillock of sandy mud jut through , all the sorts of oddments you 'd expect of a floating platform in a swamp made for housing a mansion .
" So from the start , navigating it was always a little tricky .
It helped if you had some seafaring experience , we found , and not because you needed your sea legs — the platform was immobilized from day one .
It 's because the ex-sailors on the crew knew how to dodge and weave through crates and equipment without losing their balance or slowing down .
But everyone on crew got the hang of it eventually .
" Getting from our camp to the platform was , I will freely admit , pretty awful .
We did n't have a lot of time to work on the ramps , so oft times it was just boards and homemade signs .
The platform was maybe a quarter mile from our little lean - to village where we all slept and ate , on higher ground , and where deliveries and most visitors stopped .
We had a lot of people ask to see the platform , but since it was n't visible unless you went out there , and there was mud everywhere , most folks declined .
I can't say I blame 'em .
Was n't my job to build the road .
That could come later .
" Well , one of the downsides of the platform , given our three - month initial schedule , was that it was only maybe twice as big as the mansion itself .
We did n't have room for all the crates , boxes , bags , lumber , piles of building material , paint , and all the other cruft that showed up ahead of schedule .
Initially , I think we decided , without giving it much thought , that we should try to move deliveries as close to the platform as possible , while we had the extra hands of the delivery crews .
" So we wound up with dozens of makeshift trails leading to the platform .
With all our comings and goings , one trail was n't going to suffice , and the trails were lined with equipment , trees , bushes , anything that had n't been trampled down by feet .
It became kind of maze - like , and there were more than a few dead - ends .
It finally got to where you needed a guide on your first trip out to the platform , and maybe your second or third too .
" And those damned marshmallow bags kept showing up on the trails , on the platform , everywhere .
It was getting out of hand .
We were tired of eating them , but there was always pressure when we tried to do anything other than eat them .
We seemed to be running out of trail space — sometimes it felt as if trees would spring up overnight , I 'd swear it .
And we were forbidden from discarding the marshmallows or even moving them off - trail .
We were told that we would offend our patrons if we did n't eat them , and we were told that everyone upstream was trying as hard as they could to shut off the supply , but evidently there was a miscommunication .
We never did see where the marshmallows were coming from , but they kept showing up , each day more than the day before .
And what with the rumors about our lack of progress , and the vague blame cloud surrounding my decision to build a floating platform rather than a mountain of dirt , we were in no position to push back .
" I 'm telling you — this whole situation just crept up on us , and none of it seemed so unusual at the time that anyone would stop to question it all .
Sure , we 'd talk about the individual elements : our progress , or the rumors , or the increasing difficulty of getting to and from the platform , some of which was our fault , although our increasing schedule pressure gave us correspondingly less time to build better trails .
And of course everyone was tired of marshmallows , to the point where people started hinting that some folks on the crew were n't doing their share of marshmallow - swallowing ; some of us were eating huge bags of them every hour ; why could n't the rest keep up ?
Rauser pauses , takes a deep breath .
He 's been talking faster , which is a bit worrisome if you know anything about storytelling .
It can get away from you , can rip into the crowd before you can recover and beat it back into submission .
Careful , Rauser ...
" All right , you get the idea , I think .
Permit me to skip ahead a few months and describe my condition after eight months on this job .
" I had n't taken a vacation in months , not even a day - hike away from camp .
I 'd stopped exercising .
I 'd ceased whittling and reading and all the other little diversions I bring to remote jobs like this one .
I 'd stopped eating anything but marshmallows , because it was the only way to keep the maze clear .
I slept on the platform and rarely visited the camp .
I would work from before dawn , deep into the night , with only occasional breaks to stuff down a marshmallow as big as a picnic table that had gotten itself wedged in some important leg of the maze .
The maze itself was navigable only by the crew and foremen , and nobody ever came to see the mansion anymore .
This was just as well , since our hygiene had fallen somewhat into disrepair as well .
" I was exhausted all the time , and worried all the time , and the nature of our situation was such that the only solution I could think of was to work harder . "
The mansion was progressing steadily , and was still on the original schedule I 'd envisioned with the landowner seven or eight months back .
Not that I had access to the contract or , for that matter , the landowner , so my recollection was a bit hazy .
But every few weeks we 'd receive news from one foreman or another , all of whom by the way were looking as depressed , worried and overworked as I was , that the schedule had reverse - slipped again , and that we had apparently promised yet another key delivery well in advance of when the crew thought it was due .
Every time this happened , we redoubled our efforts .
" You know the math on this approach .
You cap out quickly .
We 've done it before , but the circumstances were different .
In those rare times in our careers where we 've sustained 100 + hour weeks for any length of time , it was a fixed schedule — a building for an upcoming wedding , maybe , or a holiday in need of an orphanage .
We always knew what we were building , and we knew we were good at it .
We 'd work the extra hours to compensate for inevitable schedule slips , and afterwards we'd have a huge celebration .
" This , friend , was different .
The mansion plans never really changed , but our progress was being measured daily , and we were made to commit to tasks , in front of the rest of the crew , and then held against those commitments regardless of what happened in the interim — a tree falling on the platform , a crocodile eating a crew member , a lumber delivery never arriving .
It did n't matter .
We were told to dodge , weave , cut corners , and do whatever it took to make up the slack , because every week we were in worse ( yet always vague ) trouble , and nearly every week the schedule was pulled in some more .
"
You and I , we 're strong guys ; we 've been through the fire and the gauntlet on countless projects together .
I do n't know how to tell you , but this was not normal .
I was feeling guilty all the time , but I could n't walk away because of the platform ; it had n't seen the dry season yet , and I did n't want it suddenly snapping in two and killing half the crew .
I had to stay , but it was killing me .
It was killing all of us .
Except for the crocodile that ate that one guy , but I think some of the other crew members were actually envious of him ; that 's how bad it had gotten .
"
We loved the mansion , and I had high hopes for the smile on the landowner 's face when he next came to see it .
We 'd had to triage most of the niceties , saving them for later , but it was ( and is ) still going to be a functional giant mansion on a swamp in what has to be world record time .
" By month nine I was a disaster .
I slept an hour or two per night .
I took risks with construction that should have taken my hand off , even without the sleep deprivation .
We 'd been ordered to stop worrying about building codes or safety ; all that mattered was the mansion , so much so that it could have been painted on cardboard and still met our new short - term requirements .
Everyone felt so ashamed that we could barely speak to one other .
Any time we might otherwise have spent on planning , or questioning the situation , or even sleeping , we spent trying to force passages through the now - clogged maze by swallowing more than our own weight in marshmallows each hour , which we were able to accomplish through some magic I still fail to comprehend .
" Rauser has stopped quite suddenly , and he is n't taking a drink this time .
He seems to have just noticed that I am not the only one listening to his story , which has finally acquired a grim life of its own , holding our attention effortlessly .
We all gape at him .
He looks around at the listeners , perhaps twenty in all , a few from every table nearby .
Outside our circle , the tavern noise continues merrily , unabated .
Rauser 's tone changes from a boom to something almost like a whisper .
A booming whisper , I guess .
It would be comical if he were n't so serious , and if his story had n't turned us all into boiled frogs in just a few short minutes .
" Have you ever noticed that all our folklore about wolves has certain themes and patterns to it ?
I 've never met a wolf , but I give them fair credit for being wily creatures .
I 'm a big man , not one to fear a big dog 's bite , but I would give a wolf a wide berth , because they 're reputed to be so crafty .
And crafty , friends , I am not .
A craftsman , yes , but I realize now that I am more sheep than wolf .
" The landowner in my tale is a good , affable fellow ; I could see it within minutes of meeting him , and I stand by him today still .
He 's a man with a clear vision and a good heart , and he hired crew members who , for all our talents , know nothing of wolves or wizards .
"
The problem with setting up an untended , untrained flock of sheep is that there are wolves aplenty , and as sheep are not adequately prepared to recognize or deal with wolves , they will all eventually be eaten .
This seems obvious to us .
Nearly as obvious is that this idea applies equally to government , with the minor change that the wolves are savvy politicians and the sheep are incompetent ones .
Eventually the sheep are all eaten , so our assumption is generally that the government is filled entirely with wolves — an assumption that has proven to be essentially axiomatic , across time and nation .
" What 's far less obvious is that the idea applies outside flocks and governments , with the same consequences .
If you set up any organization of saintly do - gooders , with no politics anywhere in sight , then the presence of a single master politician can go unrecognized for long enough for every single sheep to be eaten and replaced with a wolf .
At some point the shepherd looks down and perceives that he now has a flock of wolves , and he wonders how it happened .
But a shepherd rarely witnesses the process while it's in motion , because the wolves are so sneaky .
" I was being eaten alive on my mansion project , and yet I was utterly oblivious to anything but the need to survive , which due to various odd circumstances required working without sleep and eating marshmallows without respite , apparently until either I was dead or forever happened , whichever came first .
" And before you fetch the blunderbuss from the mantle and go out a-hunting wolves , remember that they need to eat .
That does n't make them evil .
And killing all the wolves may simply saddle you with a different predator .
Although at this point I can't say I 'd stop you , either .
" But you have to be careful .
If you dispose of an un-subtle wolf , it will be replaced with a subtle one , and this process will repeat until you no longer know your wolves from your sheep until your flock is dying .
" That , I think , is how organizations die .
Wolves , wizards , behind - the - throne court counselors , whatever you want to call them or whatever guise they take , they specialize in being invisible to sheep .
But wolves need to eat , and when the organization 's last sheep is gone , the entity has undergone a complete transformation that will either kill it or change its focus to devouring neighboring flocks . "
" At least that 's what I think , but perhaps my recent experience has biased me unduly .
" Rauser has paused , for one final time I think , and this time he does take a drink .
He 's past the worst of it .
I can see from the shocked and worried faces around me that his story is going to leave some marks , maybe even a scar or two .
That 's what you get , Rauser , handling a raw story like that in public .
Remember your three Ms. " The end of the story is simple enough .
Our wolf finally became bold enough and ravenous enough to destroy two of our sheep , rending them and devouring them as I stood and watched .
I 'm a big man , so the wolf has n't gone for me yet .
But I 'm also a dumb man , at least dumb to the ways of wolves and wizards , so it managed to convince me I was simply struggling for survival by virtue of my own incompetence .
Hell , for a few minutes I thought those sheep were just marshmallows with ketchup .
Anything to change the flavor .
" The wolf did n't huff , or puff , or blow my house down .
It was the wolf from Red Riding Hood , the fabled wolf in sheep 's clothing , and its craft was far beyond mine , since I have none .
" Once I realized they were n't ketchup marshmallows , but were in fact two members of my crew , the spell was broken .
I had no idea what to do , and still have none , but at least I 'm catching up on my sleep .
" Sheep can kick surprisingly hard , as many a wild wolf has found .
They simply lack the will to do it .
The wolf charms the sheep , lulls it with fear and promise of escape , with whatever whispers it needs to keep the sheep from fighting or fleeing .
A flock of sheep can fend off a pack of wolves with few casualties , but it rarely happens , because the wolves have learned to avoid direct confrontation .
They do their work invisibly .
" I do n't know what I 'll do next , but I suspect it will involve teaching some sheep a few basic fighting maneuvers , and also a fair amount of long - overdue repair to our floating platform and our in - progress mansion .
"
The only thing I know for certain is that I have n't had a beer in nine months , and it was high time to set my priorities straight !
" Rauser drains his mug to applause .
It was a pretty decent story , although he really needs to change it to third - person , set it a few hundred years ago , throw in a few anachronisms , and dial down the soapboxing at the end .
I 'm sure he 'll figure it out .
I can never tell my own story now , of course .
If you take out the mundane detail thrown in for color , it 's essentially the same story .
I 'll have to catch Rauser after his newfound fans dissipate and he 's sobered up a bit .
I need to ask him ... well , no , it just does n't seem possible that his wolf is the same as my wolf .
Our job sites are hundreds of miles apart , weeks of travel separating us .
Plus there was one critical detail — oh , how it turns my stomach .
I can't think about it .
But I know why his maze was n't the same as my maze , why their wolf is n't the same as our wolf .
It 's another reason I can't tell my story , unless I make prodigious use of the three Ms . You see , the same thing — well , almost the same — happened to me .
The only important difference was ... well ...
Our maze was full of dog chow .
I do n't know what the hell Rauser 's complaining about .
Sigh .
It 's good to be back .

An Adventure in Opening the Ultimate Source
Open . Source .
Religion .
They 're timeless spiritual terms , but somehow , as a three - word phrase , it does n't trip off the tongue as easily as those prayers we 've known since childhood .
But , for six weeks , 40 brave volunteers from across the U.S. met in a special online forum " Open Source Religion , " to talk about their deepest beliefs ; along the way , their respectful curiosity wound up defying the old warning about never discussing religion with strangers .
This was reported in three phases .
For part one , two or three — go here and scroll down to the appropriate section .
What , exactly , is open source religion ?
It 's the cutting edge of individual spirituality that 's thriving outside the walls of organized religion .
It 's a historic shift in power and authority from religious leadership to the consumer - oriented adherents of religious movements .
The volunteers ranged from atheists to evangelicals , Methodists to Muslims , young students to aging scholars .
As their emails crisscrossed the continent , the forum members moved from exploring their own spiritual yearnings to talking honestly about their anxieties over religious conflict in the world .
" As the emails started coming from all these different participants , it was so exciting to see all the different viewpoints .
I had never been involved in anything like this forum and I really appreciated it , " Gail Katz , a vice president of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Metropolitan Detroit , said as the online forum wrapped up .
Katz now is so convinced of the value of this kind of online discussion that she plans to extend a similar opportunity to women in Michigan .
In July , Katz and a number of her Christian , Muslim and Jewish friends from across southeast Michigan are hosting a four - hour informational meeting for women who want to form international email networks of religious women promoting peace .
" My Jewish faith is very important to me , but what gives me the most spiritual energy these days is connecting people across religious and cultural boundaries , " Katz said .
That 's the nearly universal motive that attracted the participants –who took pains to point out that they 're hardly a random cross section of the U.S. population .
But what emerged from the discussions is strong evidence that there 's real energy behind open source religion :
People are eager to express their most sacred insights within emerging grassroots crowds that are forming around the world .
There 's solid sociological data behind this observation .
It comes from multiple waves of World Values Surveys , analyzed by University of Michigan sociologist Wayne E. Baker , who also joined our forum .
Baker wrote about this in his 2006 book , " America 's Crisis of Values : Reality and Perception . "
As Baker sorted out the data , he showed that religious values are very strong and widespread across America .
Americans rank with traditionalist countries around the world , places like Pakistan , in the strength of our religious values .
But Americans also are almost off the chart in another powerful value – our desire for individual self - expression .
( We rank with Scandinavia on that scale . )
So , faith matters deeply to us – but the reality of open source religion is that we , as Americans , expect to be able to crack open the doors of religion and chart our own individual meaningful journeys through the resources and traditions we find there .
What we discover is sometimes spiritually surprising .
That 's the creative inspiration that led an agnostic grad student from New York City to suddenly spot spiritual parallels between his own religious training , years before , and a graduation ceremony he was attending recently .
" The calling of names , one by one , so people can be applauded by friends and family , receive a certificate and walk off the stage again .
Oh my gosh !
It was my Bar Mitzvah all over again , I realized , " wrote New Yorker David Cohn .
Dozens of participants reported that , as they began to think about open source religion over the past six weeks , they began to spot a host of spiritual possibilities right in front of them .
That 's what led Mel Bricker , a retired United Methodist minister in San Francisco , to look up one day at the faces of his fellow subway passengers and discover , " There were moments of delight and joy in their eyes . "
That insight was more inspirational to him , he reported , than an art exhibit he'd just attended , expecting to file a report from the museum for the forum .
Florida participant Cait Ramshaw said she picked up more helpful spiritual lessons from a one - day visit to Disney World , where she took notes for the open source religion team , than she ever expected when she rolled into the parking lot that morning .
It 's all there in dozens of emails accumulated by the team since mid-April .
Team members did point out real dangers in throwing open the doors of religious tradition .
For instance , more than a few people asked :
If our Ultimate Source is open to everyone 's interpretation , then how can we trust that the timeless tradition wo n't change ?
We never answered that question , but did discover there 's value simply in the asking .
Technology now lets us tell everyone everything at once , but we still value a network that existed before the Web : the grapevine .
When you pass along gossip to a friend or colleague , you ’re doing more than just relaying news .
You ’re defining a social circle .
You ’re reassuring the listeners that they ’re in the loop — and subtly obliging them to remember that you are , too .
The golden rule of this “ information order , ” as Dr. Ryan calls it , is to tell unto others as you would have them tell unto you .
You should n’t leave your trusted colleagues at the office in the dark about a coming shake - up , but you should n’t be an electronic font of trivia , either .
You filter the news for them and expect them to do the same for you .
You tell them what they need to know in the way they expect to hear it .
“ Even though we all claim to hate gossip and being in or out of the loop , there ’s an emotional benefit to grapevines , ” Dr. Ryan says .
“ I think of it as informational grooming , like primates picking bugs off each other .
We do n’t want to get information all at once .
Some you want to get as an insider : ‘ I talked to Bob yesterday and he wanted me to tell you ...’
Telling everyone violates our sense that we live in a rich array of social relationships . ”
Technology has n’t eliminated the desire for rules about who tells what , when and how .
You do n’t want your wife or girlfriend to tell you she ’s pregnant by sending an e-mail message .
A close friend could be miffed if he found about your hot date on Friday not from you , but from a casual acquaintance who had already seen pictures of it on your Facebook page .
A host may think it ’s a friendly gesture to e-mail invitations to a party with all the recipients ’ names in the address line , but if the names are n’t in alphabetical order and yours is near the end , the message may not seem so friendly .
You could have the same out - of - the - loop feeling as a manager who learns big news about his department in the same e-mail message sent to everyone else in the company .
The following piece was written by Sarmad Ali , one of my very good friends from Columbia .
When I first met him , I knew I had to be friends with him , as I knew that he must have surely felt very much out of his element upon first arriving .
He ’s spent more than one holiday with my family both in California and Connecticut and we are always welcome to have him and to serve as his surrogate family in the US .
I have always told Sarmad that I am confident that one day , he and I will walk in Baghdad , peacefully , and his family can return the favor .
Still , he did n’t tell me that his father had gone missing in Baghdad until very recently .
While he has had all kinds of opportunities ( we walked together in Washington DC , touring national monuments in December 2004 ) , he ’s no doubt experienced some extremely tragic difficulties that I can’t even begin to fathom .
If you want to contact him directly , his email is at the bottom .
My thoughts , as usual , are with him and his family .

Missing in Baghdad : My Father
What happens when a call from Iraq
upends a reporter ’s life in New York
By SARMAD ALI
February 17 , 2007 ; Page A1
New York
About 5 o’clock on a mid-December morning , I was awakened by a call from my brother in Iraq .
“ Dad is missing , ” he said .
He was upset and some of his anger spilled out at me : “ You should be here , ” he shouted .
“ You do n’t seem to care . ”
My father had left home in Baghdad that morning to go to the auto - repair shop across town where he works .
Fifteen minutes after he left , car bombs exploded on his route to work and he has n’t been seen since .
His disappearance set off a desperate search by my family through the netherworld of war - torn Baghdad .
It also put me in the agonizing position of trying to help my family with the violent dislocations of civil war — over the phone , from thousands of miles away .
I ’m the oldest son and have been studying and working in New York for more than two years .
Since my father vanished , my three grown siblings and my mother have looked to me as the head of the family .
Every time I hear about a bomb going off , I brace myself for the worst possible news .
Last February , my entire family went missing for two weeks , without a word .
When my cellphone rings and an Iraqi number shows up on the display , I say a silent prayer before answering .
My life has always been marked by Saddam Hussein ’s wars .
Born to Sunni parents — my mother a homemaker , my father a mechanic — I grew up in a brick house in a poor Baghdad neighborhood where Sunnis and Shias lived together .
War with neighboring Iran dominated my early childhood .
Many nights , Iranian jet fighters roared overhead .
Most afternoons , we would watch “ Sowar min Al - Marakah ” ( “ Pictures from the Battle ” ) , a propaganda show featuring battlefield footage and the mangled corpses of Iranian soldiers .
My parents once gave me medication to fight a recurring nightmare of being squashed under an Iranian tank .
I was in primary school in 1991 when Operation Desert Storm kicked off after Saddam Hussein ’s invasion of Kuwait .
Once , a U.S. missile hit a spice factory near our home .
We smelled the spices , thought it was a chemical attack and covered our mouths with wet towels .
During most of my teens , we lived under U.N. sanctions on government - issued rations of staple foods .
There were happy times , too .
Some of my fondest childhood memories are of the celebrations surrounding the Muslim religious holiday of Eid .
During the festival , my father used to take me , my sisters and my brother to the park for amusement rides , to eat kebab and to walk at night by the Tigris River .
I always wanted to be a journalist .
But under Saddam , studying journalism was pointless , since all newspapers were run and rigorously monitored by the government .
In middle school , I started teaching myself English , practicing with translation texts and old American newsmagazines left in our basement by a relative .
I used to spend hours memorizing vocabulary lists and looking up new words in an outdated dictionary .
I dreamed of going to school in a Western country , of traveling the world and writing about it .
By 2003 , at the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , we were already used to war .
My family evacuated to the countryside , with the exception of my father , who said that if he had to die , he would rather die at home .
We returned several weeks later , after Saddam was toppled .
My father welcomed us back , but he appeared broken .
A secular Sunni and fervent patriot , he had been against the American invasion and never thought it would happen .
Now , he had become pessimistic about the future of his country :
The looting in the aftermath of the invasion disgusted him .
“ They stole everything from the government buildings around us , ” he said , as we walked in the door .
“ TVs , computers , and even water pipes . ”
But life continued .
My father went back to work ; my younger sister and brother went to high school , and my older sister , who had graduated with a degree in English , helped my mother around the house .
I found a job as a journalist for a new local English - language paper .
I reported stories on bombings , reconstruction projects and other news from all over Iraq .
The violence increased .
I had been on the job less than one year when the editor , an Iraqi - American , left the country , afraid that his life was in danger .
Along with three other journalists , I kept the publication alive on the Web , posting news items from an Internet cafe in downtown Baghdad .
Before he left , the editor got me in touch with Columbia University in the U.S. , which shortly afterward offered me a scholarship to study journalism .
My parents said I should accept .
I did , and four months later I took off .
The morning I left , my brother insisted on carrying my big suitcase to the cab .
My mother splashed a pitcher of water behind me , an Iraqi tradition wishing a traveler a safe return home .
With $ 300 in my pocket , I took a 15 - hour cab ride to Jordan , and a plane to New York from there .
By August 2004 , I settled in New York , enjoying the life of a newcomer in his 20s .
I started to take classes and learned new things , from buckling my seat belt in a plane to working out in a gym ; from using a washing machine to eating sushi and tandoori dishes .
Later , I landed an internship , and then a reporting job with this newspaper .
[ During one conversation with his mother , Mr Ali asked her for some of his favorite Iraqi recipes : lentil soup , tomato sauce with beans and Iraqi - style biryani .
He scribbled them down on envelopes and keeps them next to his bed ]
During one conversation with his mother , Mr Ali asked her for some of his favorite Iraqi recipes : lentil soup , tomato sauce with beans and Iraqi - style biryani .
He scribbled them down on envelopes and keeps them next to his bed .
But as I was getting used to my comfortable new life , I was also regularly pulled back into Iraq , where things were getting worse .
A few months after my arrival in New York , I was chatting with a friend in Baghdad on my cellphone when he told me that an acquaintance had died in a roadside bomb attack .
I became afraid of getting calls from Iraq , sometimes not answering them .
I considered changing my phone number so no one could call me with bad news — but I could still call people back home when I felt like it .
Other times , I became obsessed with fear and would call to check on my family and friends , burning through a 400 - minute calling card in a weekend .
When Al - Askari ’s famous gold - domed Shiite mosque was bombed last February , violence erupted throughout Iraq .
Suddenly I could n’t get in touch with anyone back home .
I did n’t know whether my family members were dead or alive , whether they were taken by gunmen for ethnic reasons or if it was just that their phone line was down .
I stopped eating , stopped going to work .
I tried calling at three different times every day , to no avail .
They surfaced two weeks later , safe and sound , after having fled to the countryside to stay with distant relatives , in an effort to escape violence or retaliation against Sunnis .
During an instant - message conversation with a friend in Iraq , the war dealt me its first massive blow : Haider Al - Maliki , a friend from university in Baghdad who had come to visit me in New York the year before , was found dead , his body riddled with 13 bullets .
He was stopped by unknown gunmen while in a cab in the southern city of Amarah and shot on the spot .
Other friends began going to their jobs at the government and in the Green Zone in disguise , trying to avoid Haider ’s fate .
One friend poses as a student , while another takes a roundabout route to work for fear of being followed .
Meanwhile , my sister , seeing that ethnic violence was increasing near our neighborhood , asked me if the family should buy a gun .
“ Ask the neighbors what they are doing , ” I told her , not knowing what to do .
When we talked a week later , my family had opted against it .
My father kept going to work every day , despite the rising violence .
It was one way of staying sane .
Then , in December , he went missing , and I got my brother ’s frantic call .
I told my brother to calm down and said that I was here to help — that I left the country to help the family .
“ You are there , with air conditioning , entertaining yourself , while we are here in hell , ” he retorted .
I tried to ignore the comments — I had heard them from him before — and told him to focus on the matter at hand .
He did .
After dad left , he said , there was a huge bombing near the central station where he was supposed to transfer to another bus .
Dad never showed up at work and never came back home .
I told him to go to the area of the bombing — a busy marketplace in central Baghdad — to see where the wounded were taken .
I also called three of my old friends in Baghdad to ask them to accompany him .
My brother had already asked some of our cousins to visit police stations to see if my father had been taken into custody .
A few hours later , we talked again .
By that time , my brother had visited a local hospital , where most victims were taken .
He said that my father was n’t on the hospital ’s official list of the dead , so he walked around to see if he could recognize him among the wounded .
He described a scene of chaos and carnage : Blood was everywhere , people were weeping in the halls , hospital staff were running back and forth — but my father was nowhere to be found .
Two days after the bombing , I called my friend Ala and asked him to go to the hospital morgue to see if my father might be among the unidentified dead , victims who were n’t carrying IDs or were burned beyond recognition .
Ala went and checked three charred bodies , but concluded they were not my father .
One was too fat , he said .
Another had hair , while my father is bald .
And the last one was too young and short to be my father .
My cousin went to a nearby police station , a mini- fortress surrounded by barbed wire and sandbags , to see if my father was mistakenly being held .
He told the lieutenant that he was looking for his uncle and gave him the name .
He was n’t there .
A week passed and my father still had n’t been found .
On the phone , my mother sounded faint and sick but kept saying she was all right .
She told me to take care of myself and that my father would come back .
She insisted that my father was fine .
Her proof :
He was not at the morgue .
My older sister could n’t keep up appearances .
She stopped eating , stopped taking showers and descended into a depression , my younger sister said .
She had n’t been well for more than a year , ever since several cars exploded near her on a market square .
Back then , the sight of a child ’s charred body had sent her into shock .
For days , all she could do was hug her knees and murmur over and over : “ Poor girl , they killed her , animals . ”
She recalled running through streets awash with blood and sewage , packed with civilians pushing flat wooden carts on which they piled the wounded and the dead .
Her condition improved only after she got antidepressants .
But after my father went missing , she spiraled back into a severe depression .
Medical assistance proved elusive this time , with violence deterring nurses from visiting .
On my way to the gym one recent day , I got a call from my brother with more bad news .
A mortar shell hit near my house and damaged the already - fragile bedroom walls .
“ Do you know that your mother and sisters are sleeping in the hallway shivering in this cold winter ? ” my brother said .
I told him I would send money .
Exasperated , he said that even with money they would n’t be able to fix the room and that they would sleep in my old bedroom from now on .
I feel responsible for my family , but at the same time helpless .
I am not a U.S. citizen , or a permanent resident .
My guest status here prevents me from being able to bring my family to join me .
I ask them to stay strong and take care and stay indoors .
I try to give them hope , although I know it could be a false hope .
Sometimes I stop calling them for a few weeks to avoid listening to all this .
I ’ve considered going back many times , mostly because I miss my family and I have n’t seen them for more than two years .
But that is risky — both because of the growing violence and because it ’s not certain that I could leave the U.S. and return .
My mother says I should stay here .
“ Do n’t even think of coming back , ” she told me on the phone a few weeks ago .
“ People are leaving , not coming . ”
These days , my mother and sisters do n’t go outside the house at all .
None of them have traveled before .
They do n’t have passports .
And they do n’t have the money it takes to buy tickets , taxi rides , hotel rooms .
They say there are no guarantees of finding a way to make a living in neighboring countries like Jordan .
I seek consolation in small things that remind me of home .
I keep three envelopes with my mother ’s recipes scribbled on them — lentil soup , tomato sauce with beans and Iraqi - style biryani — next to my bed .
When bad things happen back home , I cook them .
My laptop is stocked with songs about Baghdad .
I search the Internet for pictures of Iraq before the U.S. invasion .
Pictures of the Tigris River .
Of bustling Baghdad streets .
Of the past that is no longer .
Occasionally , I talk to the few Iraqis I know in the U.S. — a friend in Michigan , another in Massachusetts .
A small Iraqi - flag key chain hangs on a nail sticking out of my wall .
Bombings in the news send me scurrying to my computer for information about the exact time and location of the explosions .
I lay curled under my green comforter , going over in my mind where my family members and friends might have been at the time .
New friends keep me company .
While civil war raged in Iraq , I attended parties celebrating Thanksgiving , Christmas and New Year’s .
At Christmas break , I went to the home of a friend ’s aunt in Connecticut ; I shopped for gifts — books , a T - shirt , a scarf , a tie — and we ate a big dinner .
I do n’t tell my friends in America too much about what is happening with my family in Iraq .
I try to avoid talking about the war because it ’s so far removed from the word of restaurants , coffee shops , and polite conversations .
I worry people wo n’t understand or do n’t want to be bothered .
During a recent dinner in New York ’s Chinatown , a friend asked , “ How ’s your family ? ”
When I told her about my father , she was shocked .
She offered condolences and said I should n’t hesitate to ask her for help .
I felt grateful , but a little awkward because I knew that neither she nor anyone else who means well can really change things for my family .
Sometimes , my family becomes hopeless and says my father must be dead — otherwise he would have returned by now .
Other days , they are more optimistic , saying that he may have been taken by kidnappers and he will be released .
The last time we talked , my younger sister pleaded with me to help her find a way out of Baghdad .
She said she would cook and clean for me , if I could just figure out a way to get her out of there .
It made my heart sink .
Trying to check on the fate of my father , I called my brother on his cellphone — the only phone in my family ’s possession — late last month .
That day , bombs had gone off on a Shiite market where he likes to shop for DVDs and CDs .
Press reports said there were more than 80 dead .
He did not pick up his phone .
Not the next day either .
I recently reached a friend in Iraq , who said he had seen my brother .
But I ’m still waiting for him to call back .

WebmasterWorld thread that I have been tracking for a few days now has been getting a lot of attention over the weekend .
In short , there are rumors that Google will be shutting down AdSense arbitrageurs .
Arbitrage and AdSense has been an issue basically since the day Google launched AdSense .
Arbitrageurs would use Google AdWords and other means to send traffic to their site , and monetize that traffic with Google AdSense .
So if they paid $ 0.20 per click on AdWords and made $ 0.25 per click with AdSense , they made $ 0.05 .
Simple concept .
We discussed this way back on December 1 , 2004 with In with Adwords , Out with AdSense .
Chris Boggs then took two looks at it with Publishers and Arbitrage : Sucking the Life Out of Search Results ? and Revisiting the Subject of AdSense Arbitrage .
I also wrote about it again at MFAs ( Made for AdSense Sites ) Targeted by Google ?
Well , it seems from the WebmasterWorld thread that those MFAs and AdSense arbitrageurs are being shut down .
They told me my account will be disabled at 1st June , and also added that I 'll receive payment for all outstanding earnings in accordance with the standard AdSense payment schedule .
Starting June 1 , this individual 's account as well as many many others will be terminated .
They will however receive all outstanding earnings that are due to them .
Many more publishers received this email from Google on Friday .
I to got the " friendly account disablement " email today , May 18 .
It came out of the blue .
It says my business model is not a good fit for AdSense and that the account goes down on June 1 .
Payment will be made normally though .
I am a UPS club + size publisher .
I will be the first to admit that I have been running substantial arbitrage and MFA sites .
They have just grown exponentially lately due to all the efficient AdWords tools .
Yet , MFA and arbritage is not a breach of TOS in and of itself right ?
I admit that they are not the greatest user experience out there .
Yet I do believe they do comply with the specifics of the TOS , there are no blatant breaches .
I run dozens of sites / domains with AdSense and I have been careful to abide with the specifics in the letters of the TOS .
Some of these publishers are earning $ 70,000 per month or more .
And they also will be terminated .
Got the same email here .
I just reached my 70 k - month .
I am confident , these AdSense publishers will adapt .
There has been no official word from Google on this .
AdSenseAdvisor has not made any appearance in the forum to confirm or deny these emails .
Forum discussion at WebmasterWorld .
While the copyright fight rages between big record companies and their customers , some smaller , independent labels are moving in with innovation instead of litigation .
First Word Records , a U.K. label based in Leeds , has one new idea – vinyl records that include downloadable MP3s .
First Word 's primary customers are DJs , an often challenging market for record labels .
DJs embrace new technology or repurpose old ( think scratching ) , but at the same time scour old stores and markets for rare , used vinyl .
First Word is attempting to address both these needs with DigiWax .
The records are beautifully packaged , double - weight vinyl discs that come with a unique code .
With the code , buyers can download an unprotected , 320 Kbps MP3 version of the music , to use however they like .
First Word is not the only label offering an LP - plus - MP3 combination .
Saddle Creek , which puts out Bright Eyes records , also includes a download code with some of its LPs .
The double - headed approach makes sense for several reasons .
DJs and audiophiles will always want the top end of quality , so they will buy physical media , but for convenience you can't beat a digital file .
First Word cofounder Andy H is a DJ and knows the difficulties and dangers of traveling with rare discs .
" The sheer weight and size of vinyl meant that I had to be very selective of what I took abroad to DJ , " he says .
By contrast , digital files weigh nothing , and if you have a backup , they are impossible to lose .
Publishing MP3s without the technology for digital - rights management was a deliberate choice .
First Word cofounder Aly Gillani explains the DRM - free approach in terms that echo those of consumer advocate .
" Once a customer has paid for the track they should be free to play it in any player , " he says .
" Making a legal , paid - for version of the file less useful than a copied or pirated one does n't make sense . "
Perhaps even more importantly , DRM also makes tracks unplayable in software used by many DJs , such as Serato .
First Word also sells its music on iTunes , Napster , Clickgroove and DJ Download .
The company sees DigiWax as an extension of this choice .
" This is just a little something extra for the true vinyl fans and collectors , " says Andy H .
So , will vinyl ever go away ?
Probably not , if you ask First Word .
" The sound of vinyl is still warm , rich , and – if mastered properly – sounds amazing in a club , " says Andy H " Even the crackles before the record starts sound good . "

The company says its product has been " well received "
The controversial condom has caused outrage in the state of Madhya Pradesh , because a government - owned company is involved in marketing it .
The pack of three condoms , branded as Crezendo , contains a battery - operated ring - like device .
Critics say it is in fact a vibrator , and should therefore be banned .
Sex toys and pornography are illegal in India .
' Ultimate pleasure '
The condom was given a low - key launch across the country three months ago .
At that time many critics failed to notice that it had government backing .
A promotional message from the company , Hindustan Latex Limited , describes Crezendo as a product that " provides ultimate pleasure by producing strong vibrations " .
Condoms and sex are still taboo in India
That has caused an outcry among many in conservative India , including the Madhya Pradesh minister for road and energy , Kailash Vijayvargiya , who argues that it is nothing more than a sex toy .
" Sex toys are banned in India and the vibrating device is nothing but a sex toy being sold as condoms .
" The government 's job is to promote family planning and population control measures rather than market products for sexual pleasure , " he told BBC News .
The Hindustan Latex company says that the new condom was launched to promote the use of condoms in order to prevent the spread of Aids .
' Personal choice '
" The product was launched with the primary objective of addressing a fall in condom usage ...
A major reason cited by users was the lack of pleasure when using condoms .
" So we added the vibrating ring as a pleasure enhancer .
It helps to hold the condom in position besides producing a vibrating effect , " company spokesman S Jayaraj told BBC News .
Condoms are becoming more available in India
The company says the condom pack , priced at 125 rupees ( $ 3 , £ 1.50 ) has been " well received " .
It has strongly rejected allegations that its product is a sex toy , but has offered to withdraw the product from Madhya Pradesh if the state government asks for it .
Hindu hardliners have held protests asking the government to ban its sale , though most people on the streets of the state refused to be drawn on the matter .
But those who were willing to discuss such a sensitive issue seemed broadly supportive .
" It is wrong to protest against the move .
It is a matter of personal choice , " Kunal Singh , a resident in the Madhya Pradesh capital , Bhopal , said .
Medical store owner Ravi Bhannani said : " Customers want something new and this pack offers something new . "
The Alien Abduction Lamp™ was designed by Lasse Klein and is sadly all sold out now .
But demand is still strong , and I have n't given up on a second run .

This is the list of the 8 levels of scientology that one can attain after becoming free of unwanted influences of life ( a clear ) .
There are only eight published levels though there are a further seven levels that may or may not exist .
These levels ( called Operating Thetan Levels ) are a closely guarded secret of the Scientologists but they have appeared on the internet for a number of years .
So , if you have the money ( and the inclination ) this is what Scientology has to offer you .

8 OT I
OT I comes after completing OT eligibility and OT preps ( qv ) , this consists of walking about and counting people until one has a “ win ” , and similar god - like procedures .
EP ( End Phenomena ) is to extrovert a being , and bring about an awareness of himself in relation to others and the physical universe .
Also called OT ( Operating Thetan ) orientation .
OT I has had various incarnations over the years
“ This Solo - audited level is the first step a Clear takes toward full OT abilities , and that first step is a fresh causative OT viewpoint of the MEST universe and other beings . ”
[ Transcript ]
7 OT II
Advertisement
OT II consists of hundreds of boring “ implants ” written in Hubbard ’s hand like “ to be or not to be ” , followed by “ spotting the light ” that accompanied the “ implants . ”
EP ( End Phenomena ; the final result of processing “ therapy ” ) is rehabilitation of intention and ability to project intention .
With an EP like that , it ca n’t fail !
“ A series of processes directed at whole track implant materials ( GPMs ) dealing with dichotomies and binary thinking .
Available at Advanced Organizations and higher . ” – Jonathon Barbera .
“ By confronting hidden areas of one ’s existence on the whole track , vast amounts of energy and attention are released .
Those on this Solo - audited level experience a resurgence of self - determinism and native ability .
OT II unlocks the aberrative factors on the whole track that have allowed the thetan to lose his innate freedom and ability and one achieves the ability to confront the whole track . ”
6 OT III : The Wall of Fire
OT III , also called “ The Wall of Fire ” .
Deals with Incident 2 , Xenu , the evil galactic overlord , and the H bombs on Hawaii 76 million years ago .
Hubbard said that anyone who was exposed to this level casually would “ freewheel ” through it , become a chronic insomniac , then get sick and die .
“ Locating and auditing of body thetans on Incident I ( first incident in MEST universe ) and Incident II ( incident which caused the degradation of these beings into body thetans and clusters as caused by Xenu approximately seventy - five million years ago ) .
Emphasis on this level is ridding the pre-OT of body thetans which are conscious enough to respond to the auditing .
Available at Advanced Organizations and higher .
Partially replaced by New OT V. ” – Jonathon Barbera
“ This Solo - audited level goes through what is called the “ Wall of Fire ” that surrounds a previously impenetrable whole track mystery .
What prevents a being from being himself ?
This level answers that question .
Once complete , a being is free of the whole track overwhelm that has trapped him .
Here he confronts and eradicates the fourth dynamic engram that has plagued this universe for millennia . ”
The Clear learns about the catastrophic event that placed body thetans on Earth and deprived them of their operating abilities .
The Clear is trained to audit the thetans inhabiting his or her own body regarding this incident .
[ Partial Transcript ]
5 OT IV : OT Drug Rundown
OT IV ; the Operating Thetan drug rundown .
New OT IV gets rid of the effects of taking drugs in past lifetimes for a few thousand dollars .
You should really see this land in FLA ; it is near Clearwater …
“ Mocking - up and unmocking implants from Clearing Course in order to prevent future implanting plus the handling and rehabilitation of past auditing .
Product was supposed to be an OT Exterior .
Replaced by New OT IV : handles the effects of drugs , medicine , and alcohol by addressing BTs stuck to / in drugs , medicine , and alcohol incidents .
Audited by Class VIII auditors at Advanced Organizations and higher . ” – Jonathon Barbera .
“ This level handles the hidden problems and stops in a being ’s universe caused by the effects of drugs and poisons on the whole track .
This is the final polish that rids one of any last vestige of the effects of drugs on the spirit .
Ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag. Approximately 12 1/2 to 25 hours . ”
The Clear audits his or her body thetans for drug - related problems .
4 OT V : New Era Dianetics for OTs
OT V ; getting rid of the Body Thetans !
EP ( End Phenomena ) is cause over life .
Should be cause over your debt ; you ’ll need it .
New OT 5 starts what is call New Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans , NED for OTs or NOTS , reputed to be for removing BTs ( Body Thetans ; evil spirit infestations ) that did n’t respond on OT3 .
Physical universe familiarization , for only a few ‘ thou , was a part of old OT V .
“ A series of drills directed at the Pre - OT ’s handling of , and relationship to , MEST .
Drills were to be done exterior .
Replaced by New OT V : A series of steps directed at clearing the Pre - OTs body of body thetans with some attention on body thetans which are causing particular conditions ( including health conditions , rock slams caused by the evil intentions of body thetans , PTSness caused by suppressive body thetans , etc. ) Audited by Class IX auditors at Advanced Organizations and higher .
55 HCOBs . ” – Jonathon Barbera .
“ The Second Wall of Fire consists of 26 separate rundowns and has been described as dealing with “ living lightning , the very stuff of life itself . ”
This level addresses the last aspects of one ’s case that can prevent him from achieving total freedom on all dynamics .
An audited level ministered at Advanced Organizations or Flag . Approximately 50 hours . ”
The Clear learns that thetans inhabit everything in the MEST universe .
Through auditing , the Clear contacts and identifies as many thetans as possible for further action .
3 OT VI : Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs ( Solo NOTs ) Auditing Course
OT 6 teaches the Pre-OT , to do NOTs , New Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans , solo .
OT VI is very expensive ; it is easy to run up a $ 40,000 bill to get ready for the next step , OT VII .
OT ability drills for a few ‘ thou more constituted old OT VI .
“ Drills dealing with exteriorization , emotions , and sensations .
The drills were supposed to be done exterior .
Replaced by New OT VI : A course which trains the Pre-OT on how to solo audit Solo NOTs .
Available at FSO ( Flag ) .
14 HCOBs . ” – Jonathon Barbera .
“ The training one receives before starting to solo audit on New OT VII is so powerful that it actually constitutes an entire OT level .
On Solo NOTs one is dealing with complexities intended to crush one ’s true power and abilities as a thetan .
Solo NOTs auditors acquire a wide range of auditing skills to handle the vast phenomena that can occur on OT VIII .
Approximately 3 - 4 weeks with the new Solo Auditor Course done . ”
The Clear receives further training to audit the body thetans identified during OT V .
2 OT VII : Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs Auditing
On OT VII one does NOTS , New Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans , solo .
New OT VII is cheaper than New OT V , as only the six month C / S’ing and the final certainly check are paid for and the main work is left to the mark himself .
Old OT VII was projection of intention and polish up for a few more ‘ thou …and you thought shouting was all you needed to project your intention .
“ A series of processes , drills , and training steps directed at intention .
Replaced by New OT VII : the purpose of this level is the further ridding of body thetans .
Done at FSO ( Flag ) and at home for two to three years .
Product is an OT . ” – Jonathon Barbera .
“ On New OT VII one solo audits at home daily .
This is a lengthy level , requiring a considerable amount of time to complete .
It is the final pre-OT level , and culminates in attainment of the state of CAUSE OVER LIFE . ”
The Clear audits all previously identified thetans until they “ blow , ” or detach from the Clear .
As noted in the official description , the OT VII level can take many years to complete .
1 OT VIII : Truth Revealed
OT VIII is the top of the current Grade Chart – OT IX wo n’t be released until all the present Orgs are the size of the old Saint Hill Organization in East Grinstead , England , in the ’60s – not until hell freezes over , in other words .
The Bridge , or Gradation Chart of Human Awareness and Abilities , tops out at OT 15 , in some versions , although information is sketchy for the last few .
OT 8 is a big expensive mystery , only delivered on the newspeak - named Scientology cruiseliner “ Freewinds ” out on the Caribbean .
People who have completed this level have said that it is a review of all of the person ’s auditing and a verification / nullification of discoveries the person has made about himself , that it is Route 1 and 2 from the Creation of Human ability book , that it involves looking into your past auditing folders in order to spot any moments where you were being somebody else , e.g. past life identities , which you have discovered on Int Rundown or NED and any body thetans you have unleashed on OT III , OT IV , OT V , OT VI , OT VII and on Lists L10 , L11 and L12 , then a meter check to see if these identities are right or wrong items .
At the end of this new process ( New OT VIII ) , you will have recovered all of your own time track , supposedly .
Two slightly different sets of the complete process have been posted to alt.religion .
scientology , allegedly from people who have finished the level on the Freewinds .
These procedures do indeed involved the 8th dynamic ( god ) , as well as other steps , including material from A History of Man .
“ This Solo - audited level addresses the primary cause of amnesia on the whole track and lets one see the truth of his own existence .
This is the first actual OT level and brings about a resurgence of power and native abilities for the being himself .
This may be done at the Flag Ship Service Organization only . ”
Graduation from this level requires a $ 100,000 payment .
+ Unreleased OTs
OT IX , ( Orders of Magnitude ) .
Prerequisites imply more implant material on this level .
The word “ orders ” may merely suggest levels or may possibly indicate commands for the OT to perform as a Scientologist .
– Jonathon Barbera .
OT X , ( Character ) .
Rumors have suggested that this level produces whole track recall .
– Jonathon Barbera .
OT XI , ( Operating ) .
Probably further rehabilitation of the OT ’s abilities .
– Jonathon Barbera .
OT XII , ( Future ) .
Probably is directed at the OT ’s handling or prediction of the future .
– Jonathon Barbera .
OT XIII , Title not given .
Probably incomplete or nonexistent .
– Jonathon Barbera .
OT XIV , Title not given .
Probably incomplete or nonexistent .
– Jonathon Barbera .
OT XV , Title not given .
Probably incomplete or nonexistent .
If it did exist , this level ’s product would be Total Freedom .
– Jonathon Barbera .
Note : it has been suggested that the old OT levels have been bumped up to fill these slots 9 to 15 , so if and when these levels are released to the public ( supposedly only after all current orgs are the size of the booming early Saint Hill ) , the current OT VIIIs may be in for a shock re-doing all their old levels over again , if they are old - timers .

CNBC and other stock market tabloids are notorious for making simplistic linkages between the stock market and gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
They tell us that any event that stimulates GDP growth inevitably drives stock prices up , and any event that hurts GDP growth pushes stocks down .
Since the largest share of GDP is consumption , consumer demand becomes the all - important figure driving growth .
When the consumer gets too excited , the Fed must step in to cool them down with interest - rate hikes .
When the consumer is n't spending , Fed interest - rate cuts stimulate demand .
The tragedy currently occurring in Zimbabwe completely contradicts this sort of logic .
Zimbabwe is in the middle of an economic disintegration , with GDP declining for the seventh consecutive year , half what it was in 2000 .
Ever since President Mugabe 's disastrous land - reform campaign ( an entire article in itself ) , the country 's farming , tourism , and gold sectors have collapsed .
Unemployment is said to be near 80 % .
Yet something odd is happening .
The Zimbabwe Stock Exchange ( the ZSE ) is the best performing stock exchange in the world , the key Zimbabwe Industrials Index up some 595 % since the beginning of the year and 12,000 % over twelve months .
This jump in share prices is far in excess of increases in consumer prices .
While the country is crumbling , the Zimbabwean share speculator is keeping up much better than the typical Zimbabwean on the street .
CNBC logic fails to explain the coincidence of a rising ZSE and collapsing GDP because it entirely ignores the monetary side of the economy .
At this point Austrian economics makes its contribution to our story .
According to Austrian Business Cycle Theory ( ABCT ) , the peak - trough - peak pattern that economies demonstrate is not their natural state , but one created by excess growth in money supply and credit .
New money is not simply parachuted to everyone equally and at the same time — it is sluiced into the economy at certain initial " entry points . "
From these entry points , a number of initial goods are bought by recipients of new money causing a rise in price for these initial goods relative to other goods .
Because entrepreneurs react to this observed but unjustified change in the structure of prices by investing their capital , misallocation occurs .
As money - supply growth continues and prices become more contorted , more and more ventures are undertaken that would not be undertaken in a regime without money - supply growth .
When , for whatever the reason , money supply finally contracts , the artificial strength in prices that encouraged unprofitable ventures is removed , prices collapse , and large numbers of ventures go bankrupt .
Thus we have the recession part of the business cycle , the simultaneous failure of many firms at the same time .
If , as the Austrian theory states , money enters the economy at certain points , it is likely that a nation 's stock market will become a prime beneficiary of any monetary expansion .
Fresh money enters the economy first through banks and other financial entities who may invest it in shares , or lend it to others who buy shares .
Thus stock prices rise relative to prices of things like food and clothes and will outperform as long as this monetary process is allowed to continue .
This is what we are seeing in Zimbabwe .
With the country suffering from Mugabe 's catastrophic policies , increasingly the only means for the government to fund itself has been money - supply growth .
This has only exacerbated the economy 's problems .
The flood of new money that authorities have created has caused the existing value of money in circulation to plummet , i.e. , the prices of all sorts of goods to explode , some rising more than others .
As prices become more misaligned , basic decision - making abilities of normal Zimbabweans are impaired and the day - to - day functioning of the economy deteriorates .
Perversely , all of this has forced the government to issue even more currency to make up for budget shortfalls and to buy support .
At last measure , the country 's consumer price index was rising ( i.e. , the purchasing power of currency declining ) , at a rate of 1,729 % a year .
The ZSE is growing some three times faster than consumer prices .
This relative outperformance versus general prices is a result of stocks being a chief entry point for the flood of newly created money .
Keep Zimbabwean dollars in your pocket , and they 've already lost a chunk of their value by the next day .
Putting money in the bank , where rates are pithy , is not much better .
Investing in government bonds is the equivalent of financial suicide .
Converting wealth into foreign currency is difficult ; hard currency is scarce , and strict rules limit exchangeability .
As for capital improvements , there is little incentive on the part of companies to invest in their already - losing enterprises since economic prospects look so bleak .
Very few havens exist for people to hide their wealth from the evils created by Mugabe 's policies .
Like compressed air looking for an exit , money is pouring into shares of ZSE - listed firms like banker Old Mutual , hotel group Meikles Africa , and mobile phone firm Econet Wireless .
It is the only place to go .
Thus the 12,000 % year over year increase in the Zimbabwe Industrials .
Our Zimbabwe example , though extreme , demonstrates how changes in stock prices can be driven by monetary conditions , and not changes in GDP .
New money gets spent or invested .
In Zimbabwe 's case , because there are no alternatives , it is stocks that are benefiting .
This sort of thinking can be applied to the stock markets in the Western world too .
Though western central banks have not been printing nearly as fast as their Zimbabwe counterpart , they do have a long history of increasing the money supply .
It forces one to ask how much of the growth in Western stock markets over the preceding twenty - five years has been created by a vastly increasing money supply , and how much is due to actual wealth creation .
Perhaps stock prices have increased faster than goods prices for the last twenty - five years because , as in Zimbabwe , Western stock markets have become one of the principal entry points for newly printed currency .
JAMES B. COMEY , the straight - as - an - arrow former No. 2 official at the Justice Department , yesterday offered the Senate Judiciary Committee an account of Bush administration lawlessness so shocking it would have been unbelievable coming from a less reputable source .
The episode involved a 2004 nighttime visit to the hospital room of then - Attorney General John D. Ashcroft by Alberto Gonzales , then the White House counsel , and Andrew H. Card Jr. , then the White House chief of staff .
Only the broadest outlines of this visit were previously known : that Mr. Comey , who was acting as attorney general during Mr. Ashcroft 's illness , had refused to recertify the legality of the administration 's warrantless wiretapping program ; that Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Card had tried to do an end - run around Mr. Comey ; that Mr. Ashcroft had rebuffed them .
Mr. Comey 's vivid depiction , worthy of a Hollywood script , showed the lengths to which the administration and the man who is now attorney general were willing to go to pursue the surveillance program .
First , they tried to coerce a man in intensive care -- a man so sick he had transferred the reins of power to Mr. Comey -- to grant them legal approval .
Having failed , they were willing to defy the conclusions of the nation 's chief law enforcement officer and pursue the surveillance without Justice 's authorization .
Only in the face of the prospect of mass resignations -- Mr. Comey , FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and most likely Mr. Ashcroft himself -- did the president back down .
Today 's
Post article makes clear that this disclosure places
Cheney more at the center of this scandal than had been known .
For the first time , Cheney is shown to have been personally involved in attempting to override the Department of Justice 's own ruling that Domestic Spying was illegal ; and it indicates that the urgency of the White House 's attempt to bully Ashcroft into authorizing the spying was directly linked .
It 's now very clear : the White House knew they were breaking the law .
The Vice President knew he was breaking the law .
They wanted to use Ashcroft to provide political cover for their knowingly breaking the law .
They were so desperate to use Ashcroft as political coverage for their knowingly breaking the law , that they attempted to storm into his hospital room and force him to sign something he might not have even been coherent enough to know he was signing !
And , as all Bush Administration scandals do , it gets even worse .
Also from today 's Post article :
Comey said that Cheney 's office later blocked the promotion of a senior Justice Department lawyer , Patrick Philbin , because of his role in raising concerns about the surveillance .
In other words , a career professional whose professional opinion did n't accord with the White House 's desire to break the law was punished for wanting the White House to do so .
Alberto Gonzales , Andrew Card , and Dick Cheney are criminals .
They know it .
We know it .
It 's time for Congress to act like they know it !
Soldiers use the sites to keep in touch with loved ones
A memo from General BB Bell , US Forces Korea commander , says use of YouTube , MySpace and 11 other popular sites via US military portals will be blocked .
The US says the use is taking up too much bandwidth and slows down the military 's computer system .
But a US Strategic Command spokesman said a " secondary benefit " was to help operational security .
Personal computers
BBC defence and security correspondent Rob Watson says the decision could stop thousands of soldiers from communicating with friends and loved ones .
For many US soldiers serving overseas , YouTube and other similar websites are a popular way of keeping in touch , he says .
The cyberspace battle space was not one that we were particularly operating well in
Lt Col Christopher Garver , US Army
US takes Iraq war to YouTube
The spokesman for US Strategic Command and Joint Task Force - Global Network Operations said : " As these sites have become more and more popular , they 've had an impact on bandwidth resources and network availability and we 're having to restrict use of some of them . "
He denied that the military was unhappy with the nature of content being posted .
" We 're not stopping anybody looking at anything .
It 's not the nature of the stuff being posted . "
However , he added : " Wherever you have sites this popular , you have the potential for malicious activity .
A secondary benefit of restricting use of these sites is for operational security . "
The block on accessing such websites will not affect those soldiers with their own personal computers .
Those , though , are few and far between in places like Iraq and Afghanistan , our correspondent says .
The Pentagon only recently started posting its own videos on YouTube , showing soldiers in action in Iraq in a move designed to reach out to a younger audience and to show the successes of the US military .
In two months , the Multi-National Force - Iraq channel has climbed to 16th in YouTube 's most subscribed - to listing and has , the military says , just passed the one million video - views mark .
The BBC's Laura Smith - Spark in Washington says the channel is also a belated attempt to counter the influence of Islamist extremist groups , that have used the internet to post footage of hostages or attacks on US forces .
At first Dinesh D’Souza considered him “ a dark - eyed fanatic , a gun-toting extremist , a monster who laughs at the deaths of 3,000 innocent civilians . ”
But once he learned how Osama bin Laden was viewed in the Muslim world , D’Souza changed his mind .
Now he finds bin Laden to be “ a quiet , well - mannered , thoughtful , eloquent and deeply religious person . ”
Despite being considered a friend of the Palestinians , he “ has not launched a single attack against Israel . ”
We denounce him as a terrorist , but he uses “ a different compass to assess America than Americans use to assess him . ”
Bin Laden killed only 3,000 of us , with “ every victim counted , every death mourned , every victim ’s family generously compensated . ”
But look what we did in return : many thousands of Muslims dead in Afghanistan and Iraq , “ and few Americans seem distressed over these numbers . ”
I never thought a book by D’Souza , the aging enfant terrible of American conservatism , would , like the Stalinist apologetics of the popular front period , contain such a soft spot for radical evil .
But in “ The Enemy at Home , ” D’Souza ’s cultural relativism hardly stops with bin Laden .
He finds Ayatollah Khomeini still to be “ highly regarded for his modest demeanor , frugal lifestyle and soft - spoken manner . ”
Islamic punishment tends to be harsh — flogging adulterers and that sort of thing — but this , D’Souza says “ with only a hint of irony , ” simply puts Muslims “ in the Old Testament tradition . ”
Polygamy exists under Islamic law , but the sexual freedom produced by feminism in this country is , at least for men , “ even better than polygamy . ”
And the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s statement that the West has a taboo against questioning the existence of the Holocaust , while “ pooh - poohed by Western commentators , ” was “ undoubtedly accurate . ”
Unlike President Bush , who once said he could not understand how anyone could hate America , D’Souza knows why Islamic radicals attack us .
“ Painful though it may be to admit , ” he admits , “ some of what the critics or even enemies say about America and the West ... may be true . ”
Susan Sontag never said we brought Sept. 11 on ourselves .
Dinesh D’Souza does say it .
Dreadful things happened to America on that day , but , truth be told , D’Souza is not all that upset by them .
America is fighting two wars simultaneously , he argues , a war against terror abroad and a culture war at home .
We should be using the former , less important , one to fight the latter , really crucial , one .
The way to do so is to encourage a split between “ radical ” Muslims like bin Laden , who engage in jihad , and “ traditional ” Muslims who are conservative in their political views and deeply devout in their religious practices ; understanding the radical Muslims , even being sympathetic to some of their complaints , is the best way to win the support of the traditionalists .
We should stand with conservative Muslims in protest against the publication of the Danish cartoons that depicted the Prophet Muhammad rather than rallying to the liberal ideal of free speech .
We should drop our alliance with decadent Europe and “ should openly ally ” with “ governments that reflect Muslim interests , not ... Israeli interests . ”
And , most important of all , conservative religious believers in America should join forces with conservative religious believers in the Islamic world to combat their common enemy : the cultural left .

The “ domestic insurgents ” who , in D’Souza ’s view , constitute the cultural left want “ America to be a shining beacon of global depravity , a kind of Gomorrah on a Hill . ”
“ I intend to name the enemy at home , ” D’Souza proclaims , and so he does .
Twenty recent members of Congress , including Hillary Rodham Clinton and Ted Kennedy , are on one of his lists , and 17 intellectuals ( one dead , one British ) are on another , with similar numbers of Hollywood figures , activists , foreign policy experts , cultural leaders and organizations .
Some of those he identifies — Noam Chomsky , Ramsey Clark , Ward Churchill — might not be surprised to find themselves here .
Others — the sociologist Paul Starr , the historian Sean Wilentz , the clergyman Jim Wallis , the philosopher Martha Nussbaum — are less obvious candidates for inclusion .
( One person , Thomas Frank , is mentioned on two different lists . )
All these people might charge D’Souza with “ McCarthyism ” for supposedly exposing them , but he accepts the challenge .
McCarthy , after all , was “ largely right . ”

これは，4月25日の 「 RSA Conference 2007 」で話そうと思っていた内容なのですが，私が出るセッションは，ラックの新井悠さん，JPCERTの伊藤友里恵さん，マイクロソフトの奥天陽司さんというセキュリティ界の論客が揃ったパネル・ディスカッションなので（モデレータは日経パソコン副編集長の勝村幸博），私だけが長い時間発表するのは無理そうです（笑）。そこで，今回のインタビューで全部お話ししておこうと思っています。
私は常々，人々がなぜ 「自爆型情報漏えいソフト」をインストールしているのか，不思議でなりませんでした。そこで，Winnyを使っているユーザーがなぜ「Antinny」のようなウイルスに感染するのか。またウイルスがどのようにWinnyネットワークに分布しているのか，調べてみたのです。
高度化するファイル偽装の手法
ユーザーがなぜウイルスに感染するのか。その要因を図1のようにまとめてみました。
ユーザーの多くは，動画ファイルなどに偽装された実行ファイル（exeファイル）をクリックしてしまうことで，Antinnyなどに感染してしまうわけですが，その偽装の手口はますます高度化しています。
例えば最近，ファイルを偽装する手法として，Unicodeの「RLO（Right to Left Override）」という制御文字を悪用する手法が広まっています。ご存じですか？
Unicodeには，アラビア語のように右から左に文字を読む言語に対応するために，文字の流れる順番を，英語圏の「左から右」ではなく「右から左」に変える「RLO」という制御文字が備わっています。Windowsはファイル名にUnicodeを使っていますから，RLOは当然使用できます。
RLOを使うと，図2～図4のように，ファイル名の文字が流れる順序をひっくり返してしまえます。つまり，ファイル名の最後に「.exe」という文字が表示されていなくても，本当の拡張子が「.exe」であるファイルを作れるのです。
私（記者）も，2006年12月に「はてなブックマーク」で話題になった「それUnicodeで」というWebの文章を読んで，RLOのことを知ったばかりでした。
私 も2006 年12 月 の「 Internet Week 2006 」 でRLOの実演をしたのですが，多くの方に驚かれました。Internet Weekのような技術者が多く集まるイベントでも話題を呼んでいたので，まだまだRLOのことが知られていないと感じました。
RLOを使って拡張子を偽装したウイルスが，Winnyネットワークに広がっているのですか？
既に広まっています。アイコン偽装に拡張子偽装，RLO。偽装の手法もこれだけ高度化すると「一般ユーザーなら，誰でも感染してしまう」と思わざるを得ません（図5）。しかも，Winnyユーザーの多くはキーワードを使って多くのファイルを一括ダウンロードして，手当たり次第にファイルの中身を確認している。非常に危険な状態だと思います。

I have a 2 - year - old daughter , so my reading time has been considerably reduced in the past several months .
A few weeks ago , however , after my daughter went to bed , I picked up J. M. Coetzee ’s “ Disgrace , ” which I had been opening and closing and flipping through for nearly a year .
Once I made my way into the first chapter , I simply could n’t put it down .
So many powerful questions are raised in this stunning and devastating tale of complicated relationships in post - apartheid South Africa .
It made me want to read all of Coetzee ’s work , which I hope one day to have time for .
In the meantime , I am reading more contemporary poetry , especially the work of Nikki Giovanni , one of my favorites .
The poems in her recent collection “ Acolytes ” range from odes to the singer Nina Simone and the poet June Jordan to a meditation on the best midnight snack ( something a sleep - deprived mother can truly appreciate ) .
The fire , eloquence and lyricism in these poems show why Giovanni was able to turn tears into cheers at an April 17 convocation following the Virginia Tech massacre .
In what seems like a direct address to writer - readers , in one poem she outlines a possible mantra :
We seek and hide
We break and mend
We teach and learn

“ The Last of Her Kind , ” by Sigrid Nunez .
Nunez , one of the most dizzyingly accomplished of our writers , delivers that rarely spotted animal , a literary drama about families that is also a page - turner .
Few writers can tread the oft - explored terrain of class and race with the sophistication , grace and wit of this author .
“ The Last of Her Kind ” explores the difficult friendship between two Barnard students in the 1960s ; it also contains some of the most moving and devastating prison scenes to ever appear in American literature .
“ Hotel De Dream , ” by Edmund White ( coming this fall ) .
This brilliant portrait of an artist as a dying young man fictionalizes the last days of Stephen Crane and also contains a novel Crane never quite got around to — the chronicle of a disastrous love affair between a wealthy banker and a “ painted boy ” in turn - of - the - century New York .
With a sure hand White ranges over the twin tragedies of love and death , while gleefully roasting literary luminaries like Henry James and Joseph Conrad .
“ The Nimrod Flipout , ” by Etgar Keret .
The kind of work that makes you gently worry for the author ’s mental health .
This collection of stories manages to crawl back on my nightstand no matter how many times I try to return it to the stacks .
Subjects include a girlfriend with some glandular difficulties — she turns into a fat , short , hairy man at night — and parents who shrink as their son grows .
Keret lives in Israel , a country with its share of grief and uncertainty , but his tales are oddly buoyant , not to mention supremely addictive .
A Toronto high school teacher who had been running a Linux lab for five years was forced to close it down last week by the school ’s administration following the implementation of a Microsoft - based , school board - wide computing initiative .
Ed Montgomery , a computer science teacher at Monarch Park Collegiate , said in an e-mail to ITBusiness.ca that he was given a note in May , telling him that the Linux lab would be dismantled and replaced with a Microsoft - based Classroom Migration Technology Initiative ( CTMI ) lab .
On June 21 , according to Montgomery , Terry Wister , the head of school wide services for Monarch Park , removed all of the Linux computers from the lab room under the direction of the school ’s principal , Rob MacKinnon , while Montgomery was out at lunch .
When Montgomery came back from lunch , he said all of the machines in the lab were running Windows .
Montgomery had received a note from Terry Wister a month earlier .
“ I strongly disagree with that decision , ” said Montgomery in a telephone interview with ITBusiness .
ca Thursday .
“ It worked extremely well without any difficulties .
It ’s necessary for students these days to learn about Linux .
It ’s harmful to their present and future educational opportunities and employment opportunities . ”
Montgomery used the lab to teach his computer science and computer engineering classes as well as business and ESL classes .
The lab computers ran a combination of Red Hat 7 and Mandrake 10.0 .
A Microsoft spokesperson said the school board should comment on its decision to change the lab and that the decision had nothing to do with Microsoft .
Four years ago , the Toronto District School Board ( TDSB ) , which was created in 1998 with the amalgamation of seven individual boards of education , began the CTMI project to integrate all of the disparate systems across the Board ’s over 550 elementary and secondary schools .
To date , the Board has completed 438 schools , including Monarch Park CI , with another 133 to go .
Montgomery , along with MacKinnon , met with the Board last September to begin the process of rolling out the CTMI lab at Monarch Park .
At that time , MacKinnon supported the lab staying open despite other schools being told that the CTMI lab would not support Linux systems , according to Montgomery .
MacKinnon could not be reached for comment at press time .
Montgomery sent a letter to The Canadian Association for Open Source ( CLUE ) last week asking for help .
Russell McOrmond , an Internet consultant who is also a policy coordinator at CLUE , received the letter .
“ It turned out to be the personal opinion of the principal , ” said McOrmond , who posted an e-mail interview he did with Montgomery on his blog .
Since his lab was dismantled , Montgomery has set up his own blog to discuss the issue further .
McOrmond late last week wrote a letter to the Ontario Minister of Education , superintendents at Ottawa Carleton and Toronto District School Boards and MacKinnon .
So far , he ’s received a reply from Laura McAlister , superintendent , Ottawa Carleton District School Board ( OCDSB ) .
In her letter , obtained by ITBusiness.ca , she stated that the Board does not have an “ exclusivity clause ” with any software manufacturer and it supports Mac and Windows OS environments .
McAlister went on to write that the OCDSB has Linux installed in a few of its schools and there is “ considerable interest ” in expanding the use of open - source application in its schools .
A Ministry spokesperson said it is up to the Board to make decisions and that it was n’t familiar with this particular case .
Jill Worthy , superintendent for Ward 15 , Toronto - Danforth , said the decision to close the lab was not a board decision .
“ The principal , in consultation with the department , made the decision to close the lab , ” she said .
“ It ’s a school decision based on the resources available . ”
Worthy said the decision was based on the fact that the lab was underused , with only six students each semester taking the course .
The Ministry of Education expects the board to have a certain number of students — around 20 to 30 — to take each course that a school offers .
“ If that number goes below a certain number , we ca n’t run the course or we ca n’t build a case to sustain it , ” she said .
But Montgomery said there are a number of other classes that are smaller than his and , as such , class size should n’t be an issue .
“ Class sizes are always in flux , ” Montgomery wrote .
“ Any numbers given are a snapshot at a particular point in time . ”
Worthy , however , said that the Linux lab was more Montgomery ’s project than what the students wanted .
“ The evidence in terms of the number of students wanting to take courses with him through the lab does n’t substantiate that , ” she said .
In terms of Board policy , Worthy said there ’s nothing that states there ca n’t be a Linux lab or an alternate lab running in Toronto schools .
In fact , Montgomery said MacKinnon told him that there are other Linux labs in Toronto schools but he added he does n’t know where they are or how long they ’ve been running .
Class size and policy aside , Worthy said the Board does n’t have the adequate number of staff to support multiple operating systems .
“ We have extremely limited resources on our help desk as it is and for them to be trained and maintain multiple platforms would be very challenging , ” she said .
But Montgomery , who supported the Linux lab himself , said the only time his class used the network was for browsing the Web and there was n’t a problem with accessing the servers .
For now Montgomery said he has n’t been given any further information from the school ’s administration about what will happen in the fall .
“ It ’s up in the air . ”

More than half of Americans 50 and older now oppose war in Iraq
• When war began four years ago , 15 percent of those older than 50 opposed it
• Number of Americans who say they strongly oppose war has doubled
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
As the war in Iraq steadily plummets in popularity , opposition has grown mostly among Americans older than 50 and Democrats , survey results released Monday show .
When President Bush announced March 19 , 2003 , that U.S. - led forces had begun military attacks , 15 percent of Americans 50 and older strongly opposed the invasion , compared to 18 percent younger than 50 .
Four years later , the fighting is opposed by 52 percent of Americans 50 and older , and by 42 percent younger than 50 .
The CNN poll of 1,027 adults was conducted by Opinion Research Corp. March 9 - 11 .
It shows that support for the war has dropped 40 percentage points since 2003 , while the number of Americans who say they strongly oppose the war has doubled .
Just after the war began , 72 percent of Americans said they favored the war ; today only 32 percent do .
More than six in 10 people oppose the war , and nearly half say they strongly oppose it .
Four years ago only one in five said they were strongly against the war .
These are poll results for those who identify with political parties , comparing sentiments in 2003 and today :
Twenty - eight percent of Democrats then , compared to 69 percent now .
Twenty - one percent of Independents in 2003 ; 47 percent now .
Three percent of Republicans then ; 15 percent now .
The sampling error for the poll was plus or minus 3 percentage points for all but two questions .
It was plus or minus 5 percentage points for the question about age groups , and plus or minus 6 percentage points for the question on political parties .
A poll released Sunday showed that Americans are starkly less confident and proud of their country 's involvement in Iraq .
( Full story )
However , the poll also indicated that Americans are no more worried about the conflict than they were when it began in March 2003 .
According to the results , 35 percent of Americans are confident about the war .
When the war began , 83 percent of Americans expressed confidence in the campaign .
Similarly , 30 percent of those polled this month said they were proud of the war , as opposed to 65 percent who expressed that sentiment in 2003 .
The poll also showed that 33 percent of Americans are afraid of the war and 55 percent are worried by it .
Those percentages are roughly the same as they were four years ago .
CNN 's Keating Holland contributed to this report .
About a month ago , I wrote an implementation of RFC 4627 , the JSON RFC , for Erlang .
I also implemented JSON - RPC over HTTP , in the form of mod_jsonrpc , a plugin for Erlang ’s built - in inets httpd .
This makes accessing Erlang services from in - browser Javascript very comfortable and easy indeed .
Downloading the code :
* you can browse the code here on github
* a tarball is available here ( note : this is dynamically generated from the HEAD revision in the git repository )
* the git repository holding the code can be retrieved with the command
git clone git://github.com/tonyg/erlang-rfc4627.git
Documentation is available , including notes on how to write a service and how to access it from javascript , and the curious may wish to see the code for an example Erlang JSON - RPC service and its corresponding javascript client .
The JSON codec uses a data type mapping suggested by Joe Armstrong , where strings map to binaries and arrays map to lists .
Coincidentally , on the very same day I started writing my JSON codec , Eric Merritt released his new JSON codec , Ktuo .
If I ’d seen that , I probably would n’t have started writing my own .
At the time , the only other implementation I knew of was the json.erl included with yaws , which uses an awkward ( to me ) encoding and was , at the time I was using it , a bit buggy ( decoding “ [ ] ” returned an incorrect value – it seems to have been fixed somewhere between yaws 1.64 and 1.68 ) .
To an extent , Eric ’s rationale for a new JSON codec applies to mine , too , and my other excuse is that the data type mapping where strings become Erlang binaries is much more useful to my application .

Shuttle hail damage may help set space records
The damage from a late February hail storm that is playing havoc with NASA 's shuttle mission plans this year may affect some records in the making by a pair of U.S. astronauts , space agency officials said Tuesday .
The current record for the longest American spaceflight is 196 days , set in 2001 and 2002 by astronauts Dan Bursch and Carl Walz on a mission to the international space station .
That record will fall soon to American Mike Lopez - Alegria , the station 's current commander .
Lopez - Alegria is scheduled to return to Earth aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule on April 20 , after 214 days in space .
His new record , though , could be short lived .
Astronaut Sunita Williams , who lifted off for the station on Dec. 9 aboard the shuttle Discovery , will have flown just as many days by mid-July , when she was scheduled to return to Earth aboard the shuttle Endeavour .
Until the hail storm at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida damaged the fuel tank of the shuttle Atlantis , Endeavour was headed toward a June 28 launching on an 11 to 14 - day mission .
Repairs under way to the fuel tank of Atlantis have delayed that mission , which before the hail storm was headed toward a March 15 launching .
Atlantis will not be ready to fly until mid-May , or mid June , depending on whether the fuel tank can be repaired or must be replaced .
Shuttle managers intend to decide between the two options early next month , and what NASA does with Atlantis will affect plans to launch Endeavour .
However , on Tuesday space agency officials said they are assessing a remote possiblity of bringing Williams back to Earth aboard Atlantis .
" That is something we are looking at as we learn more about what will go on with the shuttle schedule , " NASA 's Kirk Shireman , the space station program manager told a Johnson Space Center news briefing .
" That is an option to get her home , but programmatically we would prefer not to do that .
So , I would say it 's unlikely at this point , but not out of the realm of possibility . "
Atlantis and Endeavour will deliver new components to the space station that cannot be launched out of sequence .
So , a delay of Atlantis until mid-June means an unspecified delay for Endeavour .
If Endeavour remains Williams ' transportation back to Earth , she could top Lopez - Alegria 's 214 day mark .
The world 's record of 188 days for the longest spacefight by a woman was set by U.S. astronaut Shannon Lucid during a 1996 mission to Russia 's former Mir space station .
The world 's record for the longest spaceflight by man or woman is 438 days , set by Russian Valery Polyakov aboard Mir in 1994 - 95 .
Williams , who marked her 108th day in space on Tuesday ,
has been kept up to date on the developments since the Feb. 26 hail storm and is taking the uncertainty over her return to Earth in stride , said Shireman and NASA 's Ginger Kerrick , the station 's lead flight director .
" She 's been , well fine , " said Kerrick , who has spoken with Williams over a private communications channel about the situation .
" She 's always been -- whatever the program needs , I 'm ready to do it . "
Most of all , Williams seems to miss her dog , Gorby , whose pictures adorn her living quarters on the station , Williams said .
Meanwhile , Dr. Dave Alexander , the lead NASA flight surgeon for the station 's current crew , said Tuesday that both Lopez - Alegria and Williams are in good health .
Both astronauts workout about two hours a day with exercise equipment to help stay fit .
" We have a healthy crew on orbit , " said Alexander .
" They are fantastic to work with , and they have met or exceeded all of our expectations with their periodic fitness evaluations and health surveys . "
When he lands on April 20 , Lopez Alegria will begin a physical rehabilitation program designed to help him recover strength in bones and muscles that have been weakened by months of weightlessness .
He will spend the first three weeks of the 30 - 45 day rehab program at Star City , Russia , the cosmonaut training center .
He will reunite with his family at Star City after the landing .
There is no specific limit on how long an NASA astronaut can spend in space , and experts are weighing several factors in Williams ' case , according to Alexander .
" We look at the entire environment they are in .
That takes into account their physical fitness , their mental well being as well as the radiation they have accumulated , " Alexander said .
" So , It 's a dynamic process .
Right now , the predictions are that Williams can stay for an extended period of time . "

He has just arrived in London on the red - eye from Los Angeles and has two hours before he has to catch a train to Cardiff - in pursuit of a special sort of criminal .
" I can't tell you much about the perpetrator until I get to Wales and sue his ass , " he says , fixing me with a look that could stop the Vatican bells .
" Let 's just say that there are in excess of 20 victims - boys and girls - and that the alleged abuse dates back to the late 1970s . "
Wall is a former Benedictine monk turned international clerical sleuth , and this is his 200th case since joining the LA law firm of Manly , McGuire & Stewart .
His job is to hunt down Roman Catholic priests retired by the Vatican in the wake of the sexual abuse scandals that erupted in Boston and other north - American dioceses in 2002 .
Many of those priests have effectively gone to ground .
Wall 's job is to find them , verify their identities , and then serve them with affidavits setting out their alleged involvement in abuse , as the first stage in bringing suits for damages on behalf of their victims in the US courts .
It 's a tricky job , one that requires a close familiarity with clergymen - and the cunning of Philip Marlowe .
" You want to build up some sort of rapport with the perp [ perpetrator ] before you serve them , but it can be a little scary because you do n't know if they 'll have a Smith & Wesson or holy water , " he says .
" I guess you could call what I do clerical reconnaissance .
The point is , I have to be absolutely certain we have the right guy .
If we sue the wrong priest , I 'm done . "
Dressed in a loose - fitting shirt and jacket , Wall , who stands 6ft tall and weighs 18 ∫ stone , looks like an overfed American tourist .
In fact , he 's an ex-high school American football star , and before he became involved in trying to stamp out sex abuse in the church , his only ambition was to be a good priest , to teach theology and coach college football .
That plan began to unravel in 1992 when , within weeks of taking his vows for the priesthood , Wall was invited to join the church 's " sexual abuse response team " .
" My job was to firefight cases of sexual abuse - basically , take the place of the perp and calm the waters , " he says .
" Our definition of success was that no one ever found out about it . "
Over the next five years ,
Wall found himself being shuttled from parish to parish to replace other , similarly failing priests - including one who had abused more than 30 altar boys .
" Everywhere I turned , I was running into perpetrators , " he says .
" In one month alone , we had seven cases against monks go public . "
By 1998 , Wall had had enough and resigned from the priesthood .
Later , he went on to give expert testimony in other sexual - abuse cases .
For this , he was accused by his former monastic employers of being " headstrong " - a charge he readily admits - and forging church documents , which he strongly denies .
Now Wall , along with two other former priests turned whistleblowers , has written a book called Sex , Priests and Secret Codes : the Catholic church 's 2,000 - year paper trail of sexual abuse .
The book , he says , contains previously unpublished documents detailing the Vatican 's longstanding awareness of the problem of sexual abuse .
Its conclusion is that the recent scandals in the US , Ireland and Britain are nothing new , but simply the latest chapter in a story that stretches right back to the founding of the church .
And the authors say they have found evidence of deliberate cover - up by the church .
Exhibit A is a hitherto secret document called Crimen Sollicationis - Latin for " the crime of solicitation " - issued in 1962 by the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith ( CDF ) , an office attached to the Vatican .
Described as a " blueprint for deception and concealment " by lawyers investigating the worldwide sex - abuse scandals , Crimen Sollicationis contains strict instructions for dealing with what the Vatican calls the " worst crimes " - such as allegations of paedophilia and bestiality .
Rather than report these offences to the civil authorities , the CDF instructs bishops to investigate them " in the most secretive way " or face the " penalty of excommunication " .
Then , in 2001 , the CDF followed this document up with a second directive , which ordered bishops to send their reports directly to Rome , where they would be kept safely under lock and key along with other so - called Pontifical Secrets .
Wall and his co-authors argue that it is this and not the Da Vinci Code that is the " real conspiracy " at the heart of modern Catholicism .
They say it is no coincidence that the person responsible for the promulgation of the second document was none other than the head of the CDF , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger , now Pope Benedict XVI .
According to Wall and his co-authors , if early church documents are a guide , then the sexual abuse of minors by the clergy has been an " open wound on the body of Christ " for centuries .
They say that , as early as AD309 , the Council of Elvira , a gathering of bishops and priests from all over the Iberian peninsula who met to discuss theological issues and set canon law , signalled its concerns over paedophilia by ruling that any bishop , priest or deacon caught offending should be denied holy communion even at the time of death .
By the eighth century , The Penitential of Bede , a medieval handbook of penances usually ascribed to the Anglo - Saxon theologian and early English historian Bede , had refined the punishments according to rank .
Thus laymen caught sodomising children were to be excommunicated and made to fast for three years , while deacons and priests were similarly excommunicated but made to fast for seven and 10 years respectively ( bishops were given 12 years of penance ) .
But the clearest evidence that the early church had the same problem with paedophilia as today comes from the Book of Gomorrah , an 11th - century tract written by St Peter Damian which , while condemning all forms of " immoral " sexual behaviour , holds priests who defile boys in special contempt .
Such clerical offenders should not only be publicly flogged but also , writes St Peter , their tonsures should be " shorn " and their faces " foully besmeared with spit " .
Next , he recommends six months of imprisonment and fasting , followed by a further six months of prayer in solitary confinement .
Even after their release , St Peter writes , offenders should never again be allowed to " associate with youths in private conversation or in counselling them " .
It was not the only time that church insiders would make such a recommendation - one that contrasts starkly with the more recent practice of transferring priests to neighbouring parishes where they have been free to reabuse .
In 1954 , Father Gerald Fitzgerald , the founder of the Servants of the Paraclete , an order specialising in the counselling and care of priests with psychiatric problems , recommended that any priest who , as he put it , " tampered with the virtue of the young " should be reduced to lay status .
Needless to say , his recommendation to bishops was ignored and , by the late 1960s , the Paracletes were providing psychotherapeutic services to so many priests with paedophiliac tendencies that they coined a shorthand term for the offence : " code 3 " .
For Wall and his colleagues , the clearest example of the breach of St Peter Damian 's injunction to keep priests out of the way of temptation came at the trial in 1998 of Father Oliver O'Grady , a prolific abuser who had been moved from one northern California parish to another in an attempt to avoid scandal .
O'Grady eventually admitted abusing 23 children between the ages of four months and 12 years and served seven years in a Californian state penitentiary .
Despite repeated instances of sexual abuse , says Wall , the church has been reluctant to take responsibility and root out the problem .
" All the church cares about is keeping the scandal under control , so they can continue to raise money and grow the institution , " says Wall .
" If they truly had the interests of children at heart , they would never put that priest back into a ministry that could cause him to reoffend . "
Meanwhile , the scandals continue to mount : in 2004 , 1,092 new allegations were lodged against priests , and in California alone , there are currently 750 cases pending in the courts .
Moreover , despite the US Bishops National Review Board 's own estimates that there are some 5,000 abusive priests in the US , to date only 150 have been successfully prosecuted - a reflection , in large part , says Wall , of a lack of cooperation from the church .
In California , for example , the archdiocese has sought to block the disclosure of confidential counselling records on two priests saying it violates their First Amendment right on religious protection ; in other sensitive cases , the Vatican has simply refused to accept the jurisdiction of the US courts .
Although Wall no longer has any faith in Roman Catholic institutions , he and his coauthors do not believe the church is beyond redemption .
They dedicate their book to " all the people of God " .
Today ,
Wall is happily married to a therapist in California ; together , they have a five - year - old daughter , Erin .
" I believe we will be tested by how we treat the widow , the orphan and the alien , " says Wall .
" In other words , if you have to choose between protecting the institution or protecting children , Christ would have chosen the children . "
And with that , Wall , having long since made his choice , rises to his feet and , gripping my hand in his huge fist , announces he has a train to catch .
A week later , I email him in Los Angeles to ask whether his mission to Wales was successful .
As you would expect from someone whose job it is to keep the Vatican guessing , Wall 's reply is somewhat cryptic .
" The first part of the trip was enjoyable and the priest study was not , " he replies .
I email him back : " So you did n't find the alleged perpetrator ? "
" Not yet , " he replies , " but I will "
Seventy congressman have sent a letter to Bush stating flatly that they will no longer vote for more funding for the Iraq occupation , and that from now on the only Iraq funding bill they will vote for is for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
This ratchets up the pressure a little , huh ?
Kudos to all of the Representatives who signed onto this letter .

Have fun
The simplest way to use wbox is to call it with just one argument , an url :
As you can see wbox in this mode of operation resembles the ping utility .
For every performed HTTP request it shows the sequence number of the request ( ) , the HTTP reply code and reason string ( ) , the number of bytes received from the server ( ) , and the time the request took to complete in milliseconds ( ) .
There are two details to note .
By default wbox will continue to perform requests forever , until you do n't press Ctrl+C .
After the url argument you can pass a number of options to wbox to alter its behaviour , one of this is an integer number specifying how many requests to perform .
This time wbox terminated after the first request was received .
Usually web applications do n't spend the same time in the generation of every part of the page .
With wbox it's possible to obtain time information for different parts of the document using theoption .
We may like to see what kind of HTTP reply google is emitting on 404 errors , the optiontells wbox to dump the HTTP reply header .
We may like to use wbox inside a shell script in order to collect different headers , so the optiontells wbox to do n't show status lines .
It 's also possible to dump the whole reply using theoption .
You can useandat the same time in order to get a dump of the reply with time annotations , butusing this feature the time used in order to produce the actual output on screen will alter the results , so youredirect the output into a file .
The right command line to use is the following :
Then open the file with an editor to see the HTTP reply splitted in chunks of data separated by time annotations .
Instead to make a single request it 's possible to make multiple concurrent requests using theoption .
Wbox will spawn the required number of processes , and every process will perform a query every second .
Every client will print a status line , so you can get an idea about delays under load .
Note that 's much better to perform this tests on localhost or over LAN in order to filter bandwidth limits that may otherwise alter the numbers .
By default wbox will perform a request per second , you can change this using the option ( for every process ) .
Set it to zero in order to perform continuous requests without delay between them usingMany web applications perform different tasks for the same url if some cookie is set to the right value .
One obvious example is a login cookie .
Wbox is able to perform requests containing cookies using the optionlike in the following example .
It is possible to use theoption multiple times to set more than a cookie .
Another parameter that sometimes may change the target site behaviour is the Referer header .
It is possbile to set it using theoption .
Sometimes after you configured a new virtual domain in your web server it 's handly to check if everything is working as it should before DNS propagation and without the need to alter by hand your / etc / hosts .
You can use thewbox option in order to do this .
Using theoption wbox will include the right headers to accept the gzip / deflate data encoding .
If the web server supports compression it will reply with compressed data , and wbox will show this fact in the reply status lines .
It is sometimes interesting to check the time required to complete the request with and without the HTTP compression just including / excluding theoption from the command line .
Wbox implements a minimal configuration - less HTTP server .
It is useful as a quick way to share files in a LAN or via Internet , so it implements directory listing by default .
In order to start this mode just use the following command line ( assuming documents you want to share are in ) : Than play with it conneting to http://127.0.0.1:8081 since
Wbox for default uses theTCP port .
You can change this default using theoption .
The default in wbox server mode is to handle up to 20 concurrent clients .
It is possible to tune this parameter using .
When a clinet connects but there are already the maximum number of clients connected the connection is closed before to spawn a child .
This allows for an easy DOS attack so the behaviour should be changed in two ways : a timeout should be implemented in order to avoid that a client can hang forever , also on a new connection that can't be server because too many clients are already connected a random old connection should be killed .
Orwell rolls in his grave : Britain 's endemic surveillance cameras talk back Will Byrne
Published : Wednesday May 30 , 2007 Print This Email This Observed by over 4.2 million closed circuit  or CCTV  cameras across the country , Britain is already the most surveilled industrialized state in the Western world .
It was recently estimated that the average Briton is captured by electronic eyes more than 300 times on a typical workday .
Yet the countrys surveillance network , which boasts one camera for every fourteen citizens , is no longer merely facilitating observance :
It has now begun talking back .
In a scene eerily reminiscent of Orwell 's dystopian vision of 1984 , loudspeakers in one small - town center in northern Britain scold anyone they catch engaged in anti- social behaviour ,  including littering , drunkenness , or fighting .
Observing a bank of monitors in the council control centre ,  Middlesbrough town officials use the technology to broadcast warnings to deviants in real - time .
The crime - fighting strategy behind the speaker cam draws upon the humiliation of being rebuked in public .
A representative explained its function to the BBC in April as being to embarrass misbehavers into following the rules .
Reports of wrongful chiding have been plentiful .
In one case , a young mother named Marie Brewster was falsely reprimanded for littering .
She recounted her experience for The Guardian .
 We were in the town centre and I 'd got some chips at McDonald 's for my daughter Ellie , but they were hot so I tipped them into a box and crumpled the packet up .
I put it on the bottom of Ellie 's pram to take home but then heard this voice say :  Please place the rubbish in the bin provided .
She filed her complaint when she saw footage of the event in a televised news piece advocating the effectiveness of the new innovation in combating crime .
The British government , it would seem , harbors little doubt about the systems efficacy .
On the same day that authorities in Middlesbrough issued an official apology to ­Ms.
Brewster , the Home Office , the UKs governmental branch on security and crime , announced its intent to distribute $ 1 million for the outfitting of such talking cameras in 20 other city centers .
In one of the selected towns , local officials have opened up a contest for schoolchildren in which youths will compete to provide the recorded warnings to be broadcast in cases of infraction .
The speaker cam may be only the first in a row of new surveillance techniques to emerge in the British public sphere .
A range of novel pre-emptive security technologies is being considered for addition to the CCTV arsenal throughout the country .
In London , police and officials are discussing the widespread installation on pre-existing cameras of highly sensitive microphones that can detect aggressive tones based on the decibel , pitch , and speed of words spoken .
More than 300 of these listening devices are already being piloted in offices and public spaces .
Citing a leaked memo from a January meeting of the Home Office , the London based daily The Sun recently revealed that the government was also considering the installation of X - ray cameras in lampposts on public streets .
 Detection of weapons and explosives will become easier  the memo read , but added bluntly ,  Privacy is an issue because the machines see through clothing .
The British technology review Electronic Design reported in late April that the Home Office is interested in utilizing new lip - reading technologies which , triggered by key words and sentences ,  could act to automatically alert authorities to criminal or terrorist intent .
Research on the technology , part of a three year venture undertaken by a computer vision scientist , is already being funded by a $ 780,000 grant from the British government .
On Monday , police in the county of Merseyside unveiled Britains most dramatic surveillance contrivance to date : a CCTV camera that flies .
Propelled by helicopter - style rotors and directed either by remote control or pre-programmed flight plans , the nearly silent two - foot drone can be outfitted with thermal - powered cameras and loudspeakers .
Assistant Chief Constable Simon Byrne explained the primary purpose of the device as to support our anti-social taskforce in gathering all - important evidence to put offenders before the courts .
As the observation of behavior takes on bizarre new forms , and data collection on the public continues to lose transparency , red flags have begun waving among privacy groups .
Many have expressed wariness over the potential for undemocratic abuses of personal information , a concern that has also been raised with regard to the UKs police - controlled DNA databank , which now contains over 3.5 million profiles .
A study published by human rights watchdog Privacy International in November placed Britain among the five worst countries in the industrialized world at protecting individual privacy , ranking alongside China and Russia as exercising endemic surveillance .
In an interview with RAW STORY , Privacy Internationals Gus Hosein explained that the grounds for the grim assessment were by no means limited to Britains expansive fleet of cameras .
He noted that , among western democracies , the UK is the only country in which judicial authorization is not required for third - party interception of communication , making governmental or corporate observance of an individuals data all but impossible to regulate .
And despite giving rise to a corporate and law enforcement procedure that is singular to Britain among its democratic peers , Hosein stated that the issue has received no coverage in the press .
Last year , he added , police accessed traffic data of communications  information on who emails whom , who calls whom , or an individuals location at the time of mobile phone use  439,000 times , all without a warrant .
Since his group released its stunning conclusions on privacy in the UK , Hosein said , things have only gotten worse .
He described Britains new identity card scheme , an unprecedented endeavor in which all citizens and residents will be fingerprinted to allow for immediate identification , as the countrys most invasive yet . 
He also drew attention to Tony Blairs call on Sunday to grant broader police powers nationwide , allowing officers to stop and question any individual without requiring suspicion of a crime .
Under the proposed changes , which Blair plans to push into law over the next few weeks , individuals who refuse to answer police inquiries  which would cover anything from identity to destination  would run the risk of arrest or a fine .
Such policy has never been implemented in Britain outside of wartime .
Hosein closed by saying that , with respect to privacy in the democratic world , whatever bad policy is out there , Britain does it worse . 
The British political arena houses its share of critics as well , the most prominent being the government 's information commissioner , Richard Thomas , who warned a year ago that Britain might sleepwalk into a surveillance society .
He has more recently stated that the country is committing a slow social suicide with its CCTV proliferation .
Early this month , Thomas went before members of Parliament to voice his concerns over governmental and corporate intrusion into the lives of citizens and to push for increased safeguards , such as routine privacy impact assessments and greater regulation of the companies that supply surveillance technology .
 No one wants their electronic footprint to expose every aspect of their daily life ,  he said .
The UK , which has no written constitution , first enacted ground rules with respect to governmental security procedure in 1994 and passed its first comprehensive Human Rights Act in 1998 .
But some legal experts say that , in the actual process of pursuing and realizing security policy , the new regulations carry little weight .
In an interview with RAW STORY , Bill Bowring , a senior professor of law at the University of London and a member of the human rights group Council of Liberty , suggested that the statutes are often circumvented or ignored altogether .
 The present surveillance situation certainly transgresses both the Human Rights Act and the European Convention for Human Rights ,  he said .
Bowring , troubled by what he called  the government 's constant scare - mongering  in its furthering of draconian security measures , stressed the need for a written constitution with entrenched provisions on human rights and civil liberties .
Others see the issue quite differently .
Home Secretary John Reid , perhaps the most ardent public proponent of surveillance in Britain , has often cast opposition to CCTV expansion as misguided priggishness about personal privacy , arguing that such a system is the only way to ensure individual security and comfort in a society beleaguered by violent crime .
In a statement to the BBC about the speaker cam initiative , he predicted that there would be those in the minority who will be more concerned about what they claim are civil liberties intrusions .
But many detractors  positions have nothing to do with questions of ethical or democratic transgression .
Some of the more vocal opponents of the CCTV arsenal have set aside concerns about civil liberties to argue that the eye in the sky approach simply is nt working against crime .
One of them is Martin Gill , a criminology professor at the University of Leicester , whose 2005 study of 13 CCTV community initiatives found that in a majority of the neighborhoods , criminal activity actually increased .
The Home Offices own comparative studies have found lighting in public areas to be a more effective tool in lowering crime levels than surveillance cameras .
Many opponents have pointed to London , where the CCTVs greatest concentration of cameras was ineffective in halting the terrorist bombings in July of 2005 , and where a sharp rise in the past six months has put the citys murder rate at one of its most critical levels ever .
For other CCTV critics , it is not a loss of liberties or even of lives that they bemoan , but rather the huge price tag .
In the last ten years , the Home Office has spent more than three quarters of its crime prevention budget on technology of record ,  and $ 500 million has been spent since 1994 on the CCTV system alone .
Still , most Britons have shown little concern about the broadening surveillance of their lives .
In the case of the CCTV surveillance apparatus , in fact , they have been overwhelmingly supportive .
In a recent survey carried out by The Guardian , a miniscule 2 percent of UK citizens reported that they object to the CCTV system in principle  45 percent even consented to the installation of cameras in public toilets .

Geez .
Let 's save this kind of thing for open letters , guys .
Sitting next to him , Abdallah Suleiman Omary , an engineer with a stubbly beard and reading glasses , draws a map of the al - Ghazaliya area of Baghdad , where he was living until recently , in an attempt to explain the impact of the recent US " surge " in troop numbers on areas where Sunni resistance is strongest .
" They have now built a concrete wall blocking all but one road into the district from the Baghdad expressway , " he says .
" To get to my house , you have to pass a bridge with a checkpoint , an American base , a gated entrance and a further four checkpoints in one kilometre .
Yesterday , they banned all cars in the area because of the fear of car bombs .
" But , " he adds , " we are still able to launch attacks .
Weapons are brought in by hand .
Fighters watch the soldiers until they leave the checkpoints to buy something - then they follow them and kill them . "
Both men are leaders of the Iraqi resistance - or insurgency , as it is usually known in Britain and the US .
Zubeidy is the political spokesman of Ansar al - Sunna , an Islamist armed group with a ferocious reputation in Iraq , and Omary is head of the political department of the 1920 Revolution Brigades , a more nationalist organisation whose name commemorates an uprising against British rule after the first world war .
For four years , the resistance has stayed in the shadows , without a public face and apparently leaderless , while delivering an ever more violent and devastating campaign that has brought the world 's most powerful army to the brink of defeat and changed the balance of global power .
As al - Qaida - style suicide atrocities against civilians and Sunni -Shia sectarian death - squad killings have escalated in the past couple of years , they have tended to shift attention away from the guerrilla war against the US and British occupation forces and their client Iraqi army and police .
But it is that growing war of attrition - there are now more than 5,000 attacks a month against US forces across Iraq and the past three months have been the bloodiest for US forces since the 2003 invasion ( 331 deaths and 2,029 wounded ) - that has pushed the demand for withdrawal from Iraq to the top of the political agenda in Washington .
Until now , the resistance groups have operated entirely underground and their leaders have communicated with the outside world mainly through internet postings , if at all .
( Omary 's group specialises in hi-tech communication and produces photos and videos , some of them reproduced here , which are strongly reminiscent of IRA propaganda of the 1980s . )
Now they have decided to speak to the western press for the first time as they prepare to launch a public face and a common political programme in anticipation of eventual American and British withdrawal from Iraq .
Seven of the most important Sunni-led armed organisations - excluding al - Qaida and the Ba'athists - have agreed to form a united front and have drawn up a series of demands to form the basis of future negotiations with the occupation forces .
Our meeting takes place in Damascus , arranged through a series of intermediaries .
As well as Zubeidy and Omary , one of the political leaders of Iraqi Hamas - a trader from Fallujah who uses the nom de guerre Abu Ahmad - also takes part in a conversation that lasts for nine hours .
All three have come recently from Iraq and are wary and uncertain of how open to be in this interview as they edge towards a public profile for the Iraqi resistance .
These are the kinds of insurgent leaders who - according to Dan Goure , vice - president of the Virginia - based Lexington Institute and a Pentagon consultant - the US military intelligence is increasingly targeting in the hope of taking out the leadership of what the resistance leaders themselves estimate as a 50,000 - strong movement .
At least 1.2 million Iraqis have sought refuge in Syria since the US invasion - the equivalent of about 5 million refugees in Britain - and Syria is regularly accused by the US of supporting or turning a blind eye to insurgent groups operating across the border .
Zubeidy insists that they have no direct contact with the Syrian regime - and they certainly do n't advertise their presence in Damascus .
" Our organisations depend on stores of weapons left by Saddam Hussein , or we buy them from the Iraqi army through merchants , " says Zubeidy .
" We try to avoid links with the Syrians .
Either they can sell us out at any time if there is heavy pressure on them , or we risk being completely controlled by them . "
Indeed , all the groups say they have no support from any regime , although they do claim that there has been indirect contact with France about creating the conditions for a public office .
And , a couple of years back , Zubeidy says , Iran offered the Islamic resistance groups weapons , money and also help with stopping attacks from the Shia militia , but while he believes al - Qaida accepted , the others did not .
" We do not trust Iran .
We need help from Arab and other governments .
But although Turkey and Saudi Arabia have encouraged the resistance to unite , they are afraid of us " .
" We are the only resistance movement in modern history that has received no help or support from any other country , " Omary declares .
" The reason is that we are fighting America . "
The 1920 Revolution Brigades spokesman is an articulate and sophisticated operator , who - if he survives the counterinsurgency and sectarian onslaught - clearly has the potential to become an influential voice in a future Iraq .
" Our position is that there are two kinds of people in Iraq : not Sunni and Shia , Kurdish and Arab , Muslim and Christian , but those who are with the occupation and those who are against it . "
Anyone who takes part in the institutions set up by the occupation , such as the government and parliament , army or police , are regarded as collaborators .
" Our organisation began its operations in the first days after the invasion and wherever you find the occupation , you will find us : from Mosul , Baghdad and Samarra to Basra , Hillah and Kirkuk , " continues Omary .
" Our group has also carried out attacks on British forces in Basra . "
They are not a Sunni sectarian organisation , he insists : " The military leader of the Brigades is a Kurd .
Iraq is for all Iraqis and we only distinguish between those who cooperate with the occupation and those who do not .
If my brother cooperates with the occupation , I will kill him - but the innocent must not be touched . "
What makes Iraqis join the resistance ?
" Many people come to the resistance because of their Islamic background , some because of what has happened to their relatives at the hands of the occupation armies , " says Zubeidy .
" American forces have committed very big crimes against the Iraqi people .
All Iraqis hate the foreign forces and wo n't forget what they have done .
Generally , British forces have acted as a helper to the US and the British government shares the blame for everything that happened to Iraq .
But their actions are seen as having been less cruel than the Americans . "
At the heart of the new insurgent alliance is a rejection of the murderous sectarianism that has come to grip Iraq - and the role of al - Qaida in particular .
Most striking is the case of Zubeidy , whose hardline salafist ( purist Islamic ) group Ansar al - Sunna recently split in half over the issue ( his faction is now called the Legitimate Committee of Ansar al - Sunna - Goure says such splits are endemic in the resistance movement ) .
" We wanted to unite with other resistance forces , but the other group is moving closer to al - Qaida and refused .
Al - Qaida has brought benefits and problems , " Zubeidy says .
" They attack the US occupiers .
But every day the problems they bring become greater than the benefits .
" Resistance is n't just about killing Americans without any aims or goals , " he continues .
" Our people have come to hate al - Qaida , which gives the impression to the outside world that the resistance in Iraq are terrorists .
Suicide bombing is not the best way to fight because it kills innocent civilians .
We are against indiscriminate killing - fighting should be concentrated only on the enemy .
They [ al - Qaida ] believe that all Shia are kuffar [ unbelievers ] - and most of the Sunnis as well . "
They estimate that al - Qaida now carries out between a fifth and a third of all attacks in Iraq .
But they say that it is necessary for the Sunni - based groups to ally with the Shia .
" Even though that is not easy , " says Zubeidy .
" A great gap has opened up between Sunni and Shia under the occupation and al - Qaida has contributed to that - as have the US and Iran .
Most of al - Qaida 's members are Iraqis but its leaders are mostly foreigners .
The Americans magnify their role , even though they are responsible for a minority of resistance operations - remember that the Americans brought al - Qaida to Iraq . "
Sectarian division has been inflamed , Omary adds , as part of the " old British imperial tactic of divide and rule " .
Who benefits , asks Abu Ahmad , when there are bombs in markets ?
" It is only the occupying forces and Iran . "
All the Sunni-led resistance groups are acutely aware of the threat posed by sectarian division to the future of Iraq and emphasise their strong links to those Shia with fewer links to Iran ( what they call Arab " national " Shia ) , but reject any suggestion of making common cause with the Shia militia and political parties - including the anti-American Mahdi Army , which is thought to be behind many of the current armed attacks on British forces in Basra - because of their participation in the occupation 's political institutions and their role in ethnic cleansing and sectarian killings .
The man who came to Zubeidy 's house last year and killed his brother - in - law after demanding a million - dollar ransom claimed to be from the Mahdi Army .
To emphasise their own distance from the kind of atrocities that have become associated in the western imagination with the Iraqi insurgency , Omary mentions the case of Wassef Hassoun , a Muslim Lebanese - American US marine captured by the 1920 Revolution Brigades and released after he swore an oath on the Koran that he would not continue to fight with US forces .
" Our people took him from the marine base outside Falluja - they got into the base in a rubbish lorry and took him out with them .
They let him go after he pledged not to go back to his unit .
We did something similar with an Egyptian lorry driver working for a transport company under contract to the Americans . "
Hassoun was later charged with desertion after he failed to return from leave after his release .
He is still missing .
During breaks in the conversation , Zubeidy stops to pray , Abu Ahmad fingers his worry beads and Omary shows me a video clip on his mobile phone of the body of a neighbour 's 12 - year - old child , Mustafa , with a huge wound in his chest , laid out for mourning in the family home .
" He was shot last month by an Iraqi soldier 200 metres from an American base , apparently for fun .
The same night , resistance fighters went to the Iraqi soldiers ' billet and killed all of them in the house , half a dozen of them , by cutting their throats . "
While all seven of the armed groups joining the new front reject attacks on civilians , they have no qualms about brutal violence against Iraqi police and soldiers , or US and British troops .
But are n't there other , more peaceful ways to try to achieve their aims ?
" Peaceful resistance will not end the occupation , " states Abu Ahmad .
" The US has made clear that it intends to stay in Iraq for many decades .
Now it is a common view in the resistance that they will start to withdraw within a year . "
Right or wrong , that is one of the factors that has led to the decision to form the new front , which is planned to be called the Political Office for the Iraqi Resistance .
As well as Iraqi Hamas , the 1920 Revolution Brigades and the new Ansar al - Sunna , it is to include the powerful Jaish ( army ) al - Islami , Jaish al - Mujahideen , Jama ' and Jaish al - Rashideen .
The plan is to hold a congress of the seven groups to announce the front 's formation and then move towards the establishment of some form of public presence outside Iraq , though it is hard to see any state being prepared to risk the wrath of the US by hosting such an outfit .
" It would need UN protection , " Zubeidy suggests .
They have already agreed that at the heart of the programme will be a commitment to liberate Iraq from all foreign troops ; recognise only those who reject the occupation and its institutions as able to represent Iraq ; demand compensation from foreign forces for the devastation they have inflicted on the country ; declare all decisions taken by the occupying states and its client government null and void ; and reject any change in population distribution .
The aim is for the front to join other independent anti-occupation forces from across the country to negotiate with the Americans for their withdrawal .
A temporary technocratic government would then manage the country during a transition period until free elections could be held for a new independent government .
Even Saddam 's revamped Ba'ath party - which now plays what is regarded as a reduced role in the resistance - is an enthusiast for fully competitive elections .
But what if the US does n't start to withdraw from Iraq next year , as the resistance groups expect , or merely withdraws to the huge military bases it has built around Iraq to intervene as and when it sees fit ?
" As long as foreign forces remain in Iraq , " Omary replies , " the Iraqi government will not be independent .
And armed resistance will continue . "
· Names have been changed .
You have to go to the history section of the bookstore to find Michael Lerner 's new book recounting New York during Prohibition , " Dry Manhattan . "
It would be more usefully displayed in Current Affairs .
Mr. Lerner has given us not a mere academic exhumation of a bygone New York , but an uncannily accurate description of New York last week and the city 's fight against drugs .
Prohibition was , of course , a dismal failure .
It did n't stop people from drinking , and , in fact , made many , attracted by the glamour of the illicit , drink more .
But worst of all , it created an ongoing war between police forces and humble working people , bringing out the worst in everybody .
Public respect for the law plummeted .
Mr. Lerner writes , " officers increasingly accused of using excessive force , planting evidence , and conducting illegal searches and seizures . "
I could have opened this oped with that sentence and pulled the journalist 's rhetorical trick of writing , " Does that sound like something out of today 's headlines ?
Well , in fact , it is a description of 1921 in Michael Lerner 's new book "
And even honest agents and officers were " chased , bombarded with bowling pins , assaulted by women and children , and knocked unconscious " out of hostility to a frivolous and unfair policy .
Nowadays officers attempting drug arrests encounter weapons more menacing than bowling pins , but the principle is the same .
Because the risk involved in trafficking liquor meant tempting money for those doing it , for too many poor people bootlegging became an alternative to legal work .
Today , way too many inner city young people seek the easy score available from " working the corners " selling drugs .
It is not that there are no jobs available for them  check work by the Urban Institute , for example .
The problem is the temptation of a trade where high risk spells big bucks  and even if the underlings do n't make much , they aspire to rise in the outfit and make more .
Finally , immigrants and blacks were hounded much more than native whites .
They did n't like it .
Fast forward to today , with the common resentment that the white middle manager caught with powdered cocaine in the glove compartment gets a slap on the hand while the black kid with some vials of crack goes to jail .
Never mind that this sentencing disparity was at first supported by black lawmakers expecting it to get crack out of inner city neighborhoods .
The man on the street is not a historian , and the modern reality of the disparity enables a false sentiment that America is dedicated to getting as many people of color as possible behind bars .
We look back at Prohibition chuckling that people had to endure what they did for the prissy , puerile notion that no one should be able to have a drink .
Yes , alcohol can be addictive .
In excess , it harms health .
It often ruins lives .
Nevertheless , today , we assume that the response to those things hardly is to call for a dry America .
But when it comes to the war on drugs , most of America almost is robotically accepting of the idea that even talking about ending it is " politically unfeasible . "
In fact , this passive position on the war on drugs represents a catastrophic failure of imagination , compassion , and plain common sense on the part of this great nation .
It will look as grievously ridiculous in the history books as Prohibition does now .
We shake our heads that throughout the 1920s drunkenness actually increased .
Meanwhile the war on drugs makes no difference in the usage of them , and we let that pass .
We know that gangsters profited from liquor 's illegality , such that the repeal of Prohibition was as positive a development as flouridation was of our water supply .
But regarding today's " gangstas " selling drugs , eliminating the futile policy that makes selling the drugs lucrative is considered something irrelevant to serious discussion .
It would appear that to a great many , the specter of a coke addict is more horrific than that of an alcoholic , and that therefore , good heavens , my dears , we simply cah n't , cah n't permit such substances to circulate .
Imagine that said in the voice of Margaret Dumont from the Marx Brothers movies .
However , for one thing , it would appear that nothing we could do will ever stop those substances from circulating anyway .
And more to the point , it is unclear whether the differences between an addiction to drugs and to drink are so stark that the war on drugs is a worthier project than Prohibition was .
Think of Nicholas Cage 's alcoholic character in " Leaving Las Vegas " and Jamie Foxx 's heroin - addicted role as Ray Charles in " Ray . "
Why , precisely , does the latter justify a policy that tears at the fabric of American society just as Prohibition did , and shows no more signs of success  even after having existed for decades longer ?
What might we learn from other countries ' drug policies ?
Might we stress rehabilitation over interdiction ?
Questions like that should be at the center of political discourse in America .
That instead they are considered radical musings from the edge is , given current realities , pathetic .
Barack Obama has charisma by the bucketload , but will charisma save cities like Detroit ?
Last year in 2006 when Obama was the keynote speaker at the annual Detroit NAACP Fundraising Dinner , my wife and I were in the audience .
For those who have n’t been to one of these functions , believe me when I say that it is billed as the world ’s largest sit - down dinner for a reason .
Imagine attending a formal dinner in a facility the size of your average football superdome , and you ’re starting to get the idea .
And just like the time several years ago when Vice President Al Gore came to be the keynote speaker ( we were there for that one too ) , there was all kinds of excitement simply because it was Gore and he was actually coming to talk to us .
And this year – next month in April , in fact – when former President Bill Clinton comes to deliver the keynote address , there will be the same joyful feeling vibrating through the massive crowd .
Clinton has always had a strong rapport with black audiences , mostly because he does n’t speak to us like he ’s overly aware that we ’re black and he ’s not , but rather like one human being talking to some other human beings .
You do n’t get the sense – and trust me this is a rare feeling for blacks – that this is a guy who probably talks one way when he ’s with his white buddies but then dips into his ‘ negro - friendly ’ repertoire whenever we ’re in the room .
You get the feeling – and who knows if it ’s accurate – that Bill is Bill with whoever he ’s talking to .
Consequently he comes across as relaxed , and relaxed is good .
So where were we ?
Oh , right .
Little early in the article to be veering off point , so here ’s the thing ; from what I ’ve seen and heard of Sen.
Barack Obama , the man obviously has tremendous potential , although I ’m not the only one to be a little concerned about his lack of experience when it comes to running the most powerful nation on the face of the earth .
But beyond the experience issue , what I need to hear more about is some detail about his ideas and plans for retooling cities like Detroit .
For the record , I strongly applaud Obama ’s early opposition to the war , and I agree this gives him a level of credibility that Hillary and others who initially voted in favor of that mess simply can’t lay claim to .
And as for that ignorant non-issue that he ca n’t be considered a true African American who understands the African American experience because he is the son of a black African father and white American mother from Kansas , all I can say is that if an African father and an American mother do n’t equal African American then I do n’t know what does .
Enough already .
But here ’s what I am concerned about ; once Obama becomes president and finds a way to bring all the soldiers home , what ’s he going to do about Detroit ?
No , it ’s not the only American city that matters , or that needs help , but I ca n’t think of a more potent example that more adequately demonstrates how rust - belt economies are being allowed to rust away .
Detroit currently leads the nation in home foreclosures , and last I heard it was damned close to leading the nation in joblessness too .
The tax base is eroding beneath our feet because the tax - paying populace is heading for the hills .
On and on it goes .
And to be sure there are some wonderful signs of rebirth happening in this city too .
new businesses .
New clubs .
Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick ’s State of the City 2007 speech was the best he ’s ever given and has even former detractors daring to hope that just maybe he knows a way out of this .
But even Kilpatrick acknowledges he can’t do this alone .
And although he admonished us not to expect anyone to come and save us – good advice – we still have a right to expect our government to care whether or not we live or die .
Granted , President Bush showed we could n’t expect much concern from him , but this is all the more reason why those who are so anxious to anoint Obama as the second coming of a kid from Hope should first hold his feet to the fire on what he ’s got in mind to repair this fractured house he plans to inherit .
He ’s got the look , he ’s got the voice , and he ’s got the smarts .
As writer David Ehrenstein said in a very provocatine March 19 , 2007 Los Angeles Times editorial entitled “ Obama the Magic Negro ” , “ Obama ’s fame right now has little to do with his political record or what he ’s written in his two ( count ’em ) books , or even what he ’s actually said in those stem - winders .
It ’s the way he ’s said it that counts the most .
It ’s his manner , which , as presidential hopeful Sen .
Joe Biden ham - fistedly reminded us , is ‘ articulate . ’
His tone is always genial , his voice warm and unthreatening , and he has n’t called his opponents names . ”
Now he needs to show us he ’s more than a comforting voice , that he has the tools we need , and that he knows how to use those tools to put this house back together again .

The human face is the most recognizable part of any person .
It ’s also the most unique part of the human body .
Although we may look different , the human face typically functions the same for each person .
Learn the science behind it through these facts about the human face .
Quick Facts Essential Facts Interesting Facts
The human face has 43 muscles involved in expressing facial emotions .
Humans can make an estimated 10,000 facial expressions .
Micro-expressions appear on the face for only 1/25th of a second .
Only 12 muscles are active when smiling .
A frown only uses 11 muscles .
The human face as we know it is the product of millions of years of evolution .
Humanity ’s ancestors had bigger teeth and stronger jaws dueto their plant - based diets .
Humanity ’s ancestors shared the brow ridges of other ape species .
Changes in our ancestors ’ diets caused them to develop softer features .
Brow ridges disappeared as our ancestors grew less aggressive and cooperated more with each other .
The evolution of smooth and flat foreheads expanded our ability to express ourselves .
The large , internal spaces of our noses evolved in response to cold environments in the past .
The human face is still evolving .
Scientists predict that towards the near future , the human face will keep its juvenile features in adulthood .
Scientists also predict humans will have smaller faces but larger heads in the far future .
The face makes the human species the most expressive of any species on Earth .
The muscles in the human jaw are the strongest in the whole body .
The jawbone is the only movable bone in the face .
The ears and the nose are n’t made from bone but from cartilage .
Red lips are thanks to a large number of blood vessels present and so close to the skin .

Paredolia makes a person spot faces in everyday things .
Paredolia refers to a person ’s innate tendency to see patterns such as faces in everyday objects .
Those with paredolia often see human characteristics in miscellaneous things such as headlights , electric sockets , or houses .
Genuine facial expressions are symmetrical .
No matter what feeling , genuine emotion shows evenly on both sides of the human face .
Faking an emotional display will always cause some discrepancies on one or the other side of the face .

There is such a thing as a dominant nostril .
Much like how people are right or left - handed , they also favor one nostril over the other .
And much like with hands , more air goes through your dominant nostril than in the other .
Unlike with hands though , the dominant nostril changes every few hours .
Scientists still debate what purpose this serves , but most think it helps the brain analyze and manage different scents .
The eyes can show if a person ’s smile is genuine or not .
A genuine smile wo n’t only cause a person ’s lips to turn upwards at the end .
It also causes the eyelids to narrow , forming crow ’s feet at the eyes ’ corners .
And while it ’s not that hard to fake a smile with the mouth , that ’s not the case for the eyes .
In fact , it ’s almost impossible for a person to make their eye muscles match a fake smile .
Shorter facial muscles cause dimples .
Dimples are caused by an irregular zygomaticus major .
When you smile , the skin gets stretched tight and shows the gaps where muscle should be .
That ’s all a dimple really is : spaces left empty by shorter muscles .
The face shrinks as we grow older .
This includes what people call losing their baby fat .
Babies and children have special layers of fatty tissue in their faces .
Those help them suck better on their mother ’s breast , but as they grow older the fatty tissue becomes redundant .
As a result , the fatty tissue slowly goes away over time , but it does n’t stop with only baby fat .
The face continues to lose fatty tissue over a person ’s whole lifetime .
This makes facial bones show more , which is one reason why older people have such bony features .
The tongue is the only muscle in the body attached to one end .
The tongue is held place by the muscles around the base of the mouth .
It is the only muscle in the body attached to one end .
The Resting Bitch Face phenomenon is real .
Some people ’s facial structure makes their relaxed expression look angry , even when they are n’t .
Psychologists studying it in the 2010s confirmed it as fact .
It ’s not limited only to women though , so the term is kind of sexist .
One prominent male example of the Resting Bitch Face phenomenon was King Louis XIV of France .

Most people have more eyelashes above the eye than below .
Typically , humans have twice the amount of eyelashes on their upper eyelid than the lower eyelid , with 200 above and 100 below .
Each day , you lose at least 5 eyelashes , which takes at least 4 weeks to grow back .
The line connecting the upper lip and the nose is the philtrum .
Much like the appendix , the philtrum is completely useless and serves no purpose at all .
Some people find it attractive though , as do some cultures , like the ancient Greeks .
Medical professionals also see the lack of a philtrum as a potential sign of fetal alcohol syndrome .
Your lips do n’t have sweat glands .
That ’s why our lips get dry , while the rest of our skin normally does n’t .
The lips are also a unique part of the human face in that it does n’t have hair , which provides oil that helps keep our skin moist .
The skin on your lips is thinner than anywhere else on your face .
Most of the skin on your face is around 16 cell layers thick .
However , your lips , which only have 5 layers of cells at the most .
This is another reason why the lips are so red .
The lips have more compact blood vessels compared to the rest of your face , with less skin to cover it .
Lip prints are unique .
Your lip prints are like fingerprints , with each pattern of grooves and markings unique for everyone .
However , there are cases of exact matches for identical twins .
There is a part of the brain that controls the ability to recognize faces .
The fusiform face area is found below the brain , towards the back .
Once this part is damaged , it makes people forget the appearance of even their closest relatives .

Four of the body ’s sense organs are in the face .
These main sensory organs in the human face are the eyes , the nose , the ears , and the tongue .
All of them are well - protected : the eyes are surrounded by bone through the eye sockets .
The nose and the ears are only the outer parts of your olfactory and auditory systems .
And finally , the tongue is inside the mouth , safe behind plenty of bone , muscle , and skin .
The nose serves many purposes .
The nose serves many functions aside from smelling .
The nose protects the breathing passages that go through your skull , down to the throat and then the lungs .
The nose also serves to filter and warm the air coming through .
Nose hairs and mucus catch not only dust and other particles in the air , but they also catch and trap harmful microorganisms .
These foreign substances are then ejected from your body when you sneeze , blow your nose , or when the nose hairs fall off .
The blood vessels lining the nose warm the air going through it .
This keeps the air from drying out or sapping the warmth inside your body .
The ears are n’t actually a sense organ .
Most of the auditory system is actually deep inside your skull , the better to protect the delicate auditory nerves .
The ear provides protection against an external force , while the shape helps catch and focus sound into the ear canal .
People who suffer prosopagnosia can't see faces .
You may be bad with faces , but it ca n’t be as bad as prosopagnosia .
Also known as face blindness , prosopagnosia is a neurological disorder that manifests in the inability to recognize faces .
Depending on its severity , some people with prosopagnosia may only have difficulty recognizing familiar faces .
For others , they may have difficulty distinguishing unknown faces , while some ca n’t even tell apart a face from an object .
In severe cases , the person may not even recognize their own face .
Facial hair grows faster than any other kind of hair on the human body .
Left untrimmed , a person ’s facial hair can grow to over 30 ft by the time they die .
In practice , the longest any person ’s facial has grown is 17.5 feet .
That record belongs to Hans Langseth from Norway , who died in 1927 .
Your face ’s dimensions match or align with other parts of your body .
For instance , your face is about the same size as your hand .
Your eyebrows are also on the same imaginary line as the tops of your ears .
And in the opposite direction , the bottom of your nose is on another imaginary line as the bottom of your ears .
Bush Administration intends to veto hate crimes bill :
The Administration favors strong criminal penalties for violent crime , including crime based on personal characteristics , such as race , color , religion , or national origin .
However , the Administration believes that H.R. 1592 is unnecessary and constitutionally questionable .
If H.R. 1592 were presented to the President , his senior advisors would recommend that he veto the bill .
State and local criminal laws already provide criminal penalties for the violence addressed by the new Federal crime defined in section 7 of H.R. 1592 , and many of these laws carry stricter penalties ( including mandatory minimums and the death penalty ) than the proposed language in H.R. 1592 .
State and local law enforcement agencies and courts have the capability to enforce those penalties and are doing so effectively .
There has been no persuasive demonstration of any need to federalize such a potentially large range of violent crime enforcement , and doing so is inconsistent with the proper allocation of criminal enforcement responsibilities between the different levels of government .
In addition , almost every State in the country can actively prosecute hate crimes under the Stateâ€™s own hate crimes law .
H.R. 1592 prohibits willfully causing or attempting to cause bodily injury to any person based upon the victimâ€™s race , color , religion , or national origin , gender , sexual orientation , gender identity , or disability .
The Administration notes that the bill would leave other classes ( such as the elderly , members of the military , police officers , and victims of prior crimes ) without similar special status .
The Administration believes that all violent crimes are unacceptable , regardless of the victims , and should be punished firmly .
Moreover , the billâ€™s proposed section 249 ( a ) ( 1 ) of title 18 of the U.S. Code raises constitutional concerns .
Federalization of criminal law concerning the violence prohibited by the bill would be constitutional only if done in the implementation of a power granted to the Federal government , such as the power to protect Federal personnel , to regulate interstate commerce , or to enforce equal protection of the laws .
Section 249 ( a ) ( 1 ) is not by its terms limited to the exercise of such a power , and it is not at all clear that sufficient factual or legal grounds exist to uphold this provision of H.R. 1592 .
I ’m not going to accuse Bush of doing this for political reasons , because his record on hate crimes legislation is clear all the way back to his days as Governor of Texas .
I do take issue with this statement ’s description of the bill ’s Constitutionality , as he has n’t exactly followed other provisions of that document ( i.e. where is No Child Left Behind a power granted to the Feds ? ) .
Seems pretty convenient to invoke it now .
But what really strikes me is the thought that if this was being driven by a Republican congress , Bush would n’t hesitate to sign it .
He signed and championed NCLB .
He signed McCain - Feingold , even though he believed it was unconstitutional .
He even threatened to veto the Transportation bill if it reached above a certain cost , and signed it anyway when it blew straight through that cost .
I have to think if it were his own party asking for this , he ’d stamp it and send it right through .
Not that I ’m complaining , of course .
The best thing that George W. Bush can do is try to veto every bit of pork - filled bad legislation the Democrats throw at him .
He should have been vetoing every bit of pork - filled bad legislation the Republicans threw at him for six years .
I wo n’t complain if he starts now , but for him to act as if it ’s a constitutional matter does n’t fool me .

Abstract
We present the " empathic painting " - an interactive painterly rendering whose appearance adapts in real time to reflect the perceived emotional state of the viewer .
The empathic painting is an experiment into the feasibility of using high level control parameters ( namely , emotional state ) to replace the plethora of low - level constraints users must typically set to affect the output of artistic rendering algorithms .
We describe a suite of Computer Vision algorithms capable of recognising users ' facial expressions through the detection of facial action units derived from the FACS scheme .
Action units are mapped to vectors within a continuous 2D space representing emotional state , from which we in turn derive a continuous mapping to the style parameters of a simple but fast segmentation - based painterly rendering algorithm .
The result is a digital canvas capable of smoothly varying its painterly style at approximately 4 frames per second , providing a novel user interactive experience using only commodity hardware .

Astronomers use gravity lensing to spot homely planets .
How to spot a planet : watch for wiggles in the light coming from a far distant star as it curves around another sun .

Astronomers say they have found the most Earth - like planet yet outside our Solar System .
At just 5.5 times the mass of Earth it is one of the smallest extrasolar planets ever found , and orbits its star at a distance comparable to that of habitable worlds .
Similarly sized extrasolar planets have been found before .
But the method used to detect them meant we could see smallish planets only when they were very close to their suns , and such bodies are battered by scorching radiation .
Planet OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390
Lb looks much more like home .
It lies about 390 million kilometres from its star : if it were inside our Solar System , the planet would sit between Mars and Jupiter .
“ The search for a second Earth is the driving force behind our research . ” Daniel Kubas
at the European Southern Observatory in Santiago de Chile , Chile .
It takes ten years for the planet to orbit its parent star , a common - or - garden red dwarf that lies about 28,000 light years from Earth , close to the centre of our Galaxy .
But sadly this Earth - like body probably is n't crawling with life .
Its dwarf star is so dim that the surface temperature of this planet is thought to be about - 220 °C .
" The search for a second Earth is the driving force behind our research , " says Daniel Kubas at the European Southern Observatory in Santiago de Chile , Chile , part of the team that made the discovery .
They are optimistic that the clever method they used to spot the planet could soon uncover an alien twin to our own world .
Wobbly stars
Gravitational microlensing can find small alien worlds in places other techniques cannot reach .
Click here to see enlarged image .
More than 170 planets have been discovered outside our Solar System .
Astronomers usually detect them by watching how they make their parent star wiggle , a technique known as the Doppler method .
This is ideal if you are looking for massive planets orbiting very close to their star , which induce a lot of wobble .
But there is no way this can be used to find small , blue - green planets approximately 150 million kilometres from a yellow sun .
It is simply not sensitive enough , says Didier Queloz , an astronomer from Geneva Observatory in Switzerland who was part of the team that found the first extrasolar planet , just 11 years ago1 .
The new sighting relies on an effect called gravitational lensing , where a massive object such as a star warps space so that it behaves like a lens .
This means that it bends and slightly magnifies light from a more distant star before it reaches our telescopes .
Adding a planet to the mix modifies the lensing effect by a tiny amount , just enough to work out its mass and orbit .
" Microlensing is the fastest way to find small , cool planets , down to the mass of the Earth , " says Keith Horne , one of the planet 's discoverers and an astronomer from the University of St Andrews , UK .
Spot the difference
The planet was found by a consortium of 73 astronomers from 12 different countries .
Its star was first spotted by scientists working on the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment ( OGLE ) , before the planet itself was noticed by astronomer Pascal Fouqué .
OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390Lb is only the third planet found using the microlensing technique so far , but astronomers expect to spot many more .
" The other two microlensing planets have masses of a few times that of Jupiter , but the discovery of a five - Earth - mass planet is a strong hint that these objects are very common , " says Jean - Philippe Beaulieu of the Astrophysics Institute of Paris .
Beaulieu is lead author of the paper describing the find in this week 's Nature2 .

The row over teaching the theory of intelligent design in science lessons was reignited today by the Church of England 's new head of education .
The Rev Jan Ainsworth , who is responsible for more than 4,600 CofE schools , said intelligent design could form part of discussions in science lessons under the heading of history of science .
Intelligent design - the argument that living species are too complex to have evolved through Darwinian natural selection and must have a " designer " - is dismissed by the vast majority of scientists .
Ms Ainsworth told the Times Educational Supplement : " While it is not something I would subscribe to , it is a recognition that there are different ways of looking at the evidence .
" You would get howls of protest from the scientific community , which would say there is absolutely no place for it in the curriculum .
But you could do it in history of science , " she added , pointing out that religious education lessons in CofE schools include discussions of different beliefs .
The church today hastened to play down the significance of her comments .
The long - running battle between creationists and Darwinists over teaching evolution in schools in the US - dating to the 1925 " Monkey Trial " in Tennessee - has spilled over into the UK in recent years .
Earlier this year the government instructed schools in England not to use teaching materials promoting creationism and intelligent design circulated by the privately - funded group Truth in Science .
Ms Ainsworth 's comments follow a long - running row over claims that some of Tony Blair 's flagship city academies teach creationism in science lessons .
The prime minister has dismissed concerns over the issue .
A spokesman for the Church of England said Ms Ainsworth was " simply representing the fact that some schools currently discuss intelligent design within the context of lessons exploring how our understanding of science has developed historically " .
He continued : " Ms Ainsworth was not suggesting that intelligent design should be taught as a scientifically - based theory , but merely stating that some schools do include the topic on their history of science curriculum , and that she does not propose to prevent them from doing so .
" She believes that schools should take a lead from the national curriculum , and use discretion in enhancing this with discussions about the theory of intelligent design where appropriate , " he added .
The Christian thinktank Ekklesia criticised Ms Ainsworth for flirting with intelligent design which was " creationism masquerading as science " and " appallingly bad theology " .
Creationism includes a belief that all forms of life have always existed in their present form , and that the world was formed in 4004 BC , rather than 4,600 million years ago as scientists believe .
Intelligent design is less explicit about God creating life and does accept the greater age of the Earth .
In the US there have been robust battles over the teaching of evolution and creationism in schools .
This year the Kansas school board banned creationist teaching in science lessons .
In 2005 intelligent design was roundly condemned in a court judgment as a purely religious theory , which should not be taught in American schools under the constitutional separation of church and state .
The case was brought over the teaching of intelligent design in schools in Dover , Pennsylvania .
Last year , the world 's leading scientific institutions issued a joint statement calling on schools to stop denying the facts of evolution .
The national science academies of 67 countries warned that scientific evidence about the origins of life was being " concealed , denied , or confused " .
When Olivia Lara - Gresty saw the metal detectors at the entrance of Middle School 54 on the Upper West Side , she turned around and ran home to ditch her contraband before joining her sixth - grade class .
The cellphone police had arrived .
Not everyone was so savvy .
The Police Department was there to carry out a random sweep for prohibited items , requiring all 900 - plus students at the school to walk through metal detectors before entering .
Their total haul included 404 cellphones , 69 iPods , 23 other electronic devices , two knives and one imitation gun .
“ People were crying , ” said Samantha Haber , 14 , an eighth grader .
Officially , the X - ray scans are meant to catch dangerous items .
But since the unannounced sweeps began in April 2006 , they have mostly detected cellphones , infuriating parents who see them as lifelines and have loudly opposed the checks .
Pressed about how he could ride his bike while refusing to see a grieving mom of a dead soldier who 's camped outside his ranch , he added : " So I 'm mindful of what goes on around me .
On the other hand , I 'm also mindful that I 've got a life to live and will do so . "
Ah , the insensitivity of reporters who ask the President Bushes how they can expect to deal with Middle East fighting while they 're off fishing .
The first President Bush told us that he kept a telephone in his golf cart and his cigarette boat so he could easily stay on top of Saddam 's invasion of Kuwait .
But at least he seemed worried that he was sending the wrong signal , as his boating and golfing was juxtaposed on the news with footage of the frightened families of troops leaving for the Middle East .
" I just do n't like taking questions on serious matters on my vacation , " the usually good - natured Bush senior barked at reporters on the golf course .
" So I hope you 'll understand if I , when I 'm recreating , will recreate . "
His hot - tempered oldest son , who was golfing with his father that day , was even more irritated .
" Hey ! Hey ! " W. snapped at reporters asking questions on the first tee .
" Ca n't you wait until we finish hitting , at least ? "
Junior always had his priorities straight .
As W.'s neighbors get in scraps with the antiwar forces coalescing around the ranch ; as the Pentagon tries to rustle up updated armor for our soldiers , who are still sitting ducks in the third year of the war ; as the Iraqi police we train keep getting blown up by terrorists , who come right back every time U.S. troops beat them up ; as Shiites working on the Iraqi constitution conspire with Iran about turning Iraq into an Islamic state that represses women ; and as Iraq hurtles toward a possible civil war , W. seems far more oblivious than his father was with his Persian Gulf crisis .

It 's not having the thought that gets us into trouble .
It 's dwelling on it and considering it .
Hessian culture minister calls for creationism to be discussed in German schools
By Stefan Steinberg
17 July 2007
In an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ( FAZ ) at the end of June , the Hessian culture minister , Karin Wolff , a member of the conservative Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , called for the integration of the biblical version of creation into “ modern biology instruction . ”
According to Wolff , sciences such as biology had to recognise their limitations and a debate over the biblical account of creation in biology lessons offered the chance for a “ new coming together of natural science and religion . ”
Wolff ’s comments came as a response to a report by the culture committee of the Council of Europe , “ The dangers of creationism in education , ” which pointed to a deliberate campaign by religious and right - wing political forces to encourage the teaching of creationism in European schools .
The Council ’s resolution warned that creationist theories aimed to replace “ democracy with a theocracy , ” and called upon European nations to restrict discussion over creationism to the teaching of religious studies .
The report was rejected by a majority of the European Council , dominated by conservative parties .
In a recent article on the controversy , the Neue Zürcher Zeitung also criticised the resolution drawn up by the European culture committee for being too uncritical of science and referred in defence of its argument to Germany ’s most prominent philosopher , Jürgen Habermas , who published a collection of essays two years ago calling for a dialogue between religion and science — Between Naturalism and Religion .
For her part , Karin Wolff maintained , however , that there was “ an amazing agreement ” between the biblical presentation of the creation of the world in seven days and scientific evidence .
The creation of humanity by God in line with biblical teaching was not an explanation that “ stood in contradiction to scientific knowledge , ” Wolff maintained .
While the campaign by fundamentalist religious and evangelical groups to integrate biblical teachings about the origins of the universe ( “ Creationism ” ) into school curricula has long been a source of controversial debate in the US ( where such theories are often referred to by the euphemism “ Intelligent Design ” ) , Wolff ’s proposal represents the first public initiative by a leading German politician to instigate a similar process in Germany .
The Hessian culture minister is well known for her religious convictions .
In an interview with the press ( Deutsche Presse - Agentur ) at the beginning of last October , she already called upon schools to investigate those realms where it was possible to detect similarities between creationism and natural science .
According to a comment by the local teacher ’s union ( GEW ) , Wolff distanced herself from the type of creationism put forward by right wing extremists ( in a contribution for the evangelical magazine Spektrum ) , “ but argued in a very similar manner to their representatives . ”
In 2006 Spektrum declared Wolff to be its “ Christian of the Year . ”
Wolff ’s initiative for the introduction of religious themes into the scientific curricula of schools was immediately criticised by a number of political and scientific figures .
The federation of German biologists and several distinguished professors issued vigorous protests .
Ulrich Kutschera , professor for evolution studies in Kassel , declared “ We have on the one side scientific facts , on the other , a 2,000 - year - old Christian myth .
It is unacceptable to question the factual basis of evolution . ”
At the same time Wolff has received the backing of prominent church men and politicians — in particular the Hessian prime minister , Roland Koch .
According to Koch , the school curriculum stipulates that religious and philosophical questions should supplement scientific teachings : “ After all one has to warn young people to protect themselves against believing they know everything . ”
The Bishop of Augsburg , Walter Mixa , welcomed Wolff ’s proposal , but the most explicit support for Wolff came from CDU deputy Brigitte Koelsch , who also declared that Wolff ’s proposal was compatible with school curricula and that scientific instruction had to take into account the cultural foundations of Germany , which are “ clearly Christian - Jewish ” in origin .
The political backing for Wolff in Hesse comes as no surprise when one considers that creationism is already on the curricula of at least two schools in the state .
According to reports in the Arte and ARD television channels , two schools in the city of Gießen have already supplemented a scientific account of evolution in biology lessons with biblical teaching .
Biology at the private school , August Hermann Francke , in Gießen is taught by a teacher who defends creationism and rejects Darwin ’s scientific account of evolution in favour of a literal reading of the Bible , whereby the history of mankind is just 6,000 years old .
The same teachings are promulgated at the state - run Liebig school in the town .
Although the Hessian constitution forbids such indoctrination , the state government has done nothing to prevent the teaching of evangelical fundamentalism at these schools .
While the latest comments by Wolff are no doubt part of an effort to mobilise backward social layers in the run-up to state elections due to held in January next year , her remarks should properly be seen in the broader context of a persistent campaign by Germany ’s conservative parties for a so - called “ defining culture ” — a campaign with pronounced nationalist and even racist overtones .
In February 1999 the CDU in Hesse campaigned in local elections on an openly racist platform .
At that time its leading candidate , Roland Koch , initiated a campaign against the introduction of a new citizenship law by the federal government .
Under the terms of the new law , immigrants who fulfilled a number of conditions were entitled to dual citizenship .
Koch launched a campaign against this law in the middle of state elections in order to mobilise the most reactionary forces .
Koch makes no secret of his orientation towards such nationalist forces and maintains his own relations with extreme right - wing organisations .
In 2002 he was guest speaker at the Weikersheim study centre , which was set up by the former minister president of Baden - Württemberg , Hans Filbinger .
Filbinger was forced to resign from his official posts after it became known that as a naval judge under the Hitler regime , he issued death sentences on behalf of the Nazis against people accused of minor offences .
One year after the racist campaign by the CDU in Hesse , the national leadership of the party introduced a new paper outlining the CDU ’s new restrictive immigration policy .
The policy statement explicitly defined German and European culture on the basis of “ Christian - Western cultural values . ”
As a concession to Germany ’s recent historical past , the statement did insert the word “ Judaism ” after mentioning Christianity , but that does not alter the fact that the emphasis on “ Christian - Western culture ” has always been the trademark of the extreme right in Germany .
Discussions in right - wing circles over a “ defining German culture ” intensified following the terror attacks of 2001 .
For many in the CDU , its sister party the Christian Social Union and sections of the media , Germany ’s so - called “ Christian - Western cultural values ” were to be increasingly defined in opposition to the Islamic community in Germany .
In October 2003 Karin Wolff made her own intervention into this debate by appealing on German television for a ban on Islamic scarves in German schools .
Her appeal was a deliberate attempt to incite right - wing forces and whip up a pogrom - type atmosphere against Muslims in Germany .
The Hessian CDU returned to this issue once again this year when the state ’s minister of social affairs , Silke Lautenschläger ( CDU ) , criticized the controversial decision of a Frankfurt judge ( link to article ) because the latter had not based her ruling on “ Christian ” values .
“ Integration requires a clear point of view .
Here there should be no pardon , ” Lautenschläger stressed .
“ Our social foundation is the Christian idea of man and the concept of human dignity embodied in the constitution . ”
In 2003 Wolff claimed that her appeal for a ban on Islamic headscarves and discrimination against members of a particular religious group was based on the German post - war Basic Law and the Hessian constitution .
While the latter does refer to “ Christian and humanistic traditions , ” the German post - war constitution makes no mention of Christianity or any other religion .
While the national leadership of the CDU has refrained from commenting on the latest proposal by Karin Wolff for the teaching of creationism in German schools , Chancellor Angela Merkel , who studied physics and is a Protestant , made no secret of her own advocacy of Christian values .
In the past she has made clear , for example , that she favours the insertion of a reference to God into a constitution for Europe .

Advantages of Uniplate
Compatability - the above code will work only in GHC , but if we modify the instance declaration to remove deriving ( Data , Typeable ) and replace it with an explicit instance ( generated by Derive , if you wish ) , then the Uniplate code will work perfectly happy in Hugs .
The Uniplate library also provides substantial Haskell 98 compatibility .
Built in compiler support in GHC to the same level as SYB - piggy - backing off the SYB support .
Usually produces shorter code - especially for queries .
A range of traversals not in SYB ( although SYB could add them - and I believe should )
Higher performance - about 30 % faster in the above examples , up to 80 % faster if you are will to write different instances .
What Uniplate is NOT
strictly more powerful
Conclusion
I 've just released my Uniplate library , which hopes to remove the boilerplate from Haskell programs .
I try to keep my PhD research as practically orientated as I can , but often research things start off as proof of concept and get refined into something more practically usable over time .
Uniplate is different - its the one part of my PhD that should be useful to almost everyone , and is useful and polished right now .
I 've been working on Uniplate ( or Play , as it was originally called ) for about two years now .
Uniplate did not start off as a project to remove boilerplate , but in my work on Catch I found various patterns kept cropping up .
I started to think about abstracting them out - first in a very chaotic manner - then as time progressed I refined the ideas until they hung together much more convincingly .
I 've used Uniplate in Catch ( well over 100 times ! ) , in Yhc .
Core ( support is built into the library ) , and most recently in Hoogle .
In addition , a few other people have picked up Uniplate ( Eric Mertens and Matt Naylor ) , and with very little time were quite fluent in the use of the library .
previously posted a bit about how you could use Scrap Your Boilerplate ( SYB ) to remove boilerplate from Haskell .
I 'm now going to recap that post , but giving the examples using Uniplate as well .
Hopefully this will start to encourage people to make use of Uniplate - the results can be very effective .
Recently Matt ported one of his projects , and some functions went from 20 lines of complicated code to 3 lines of simple code - revealing some bugs in the original definition in the process !
Before showing some operations , I 'm going to first introduce a data structure on which we can imagine operations are performed .
Here is a data type that looks like an imperative programming language :
We define the data type as normal , adding deriving for Data and Typeable - the two key SYB types .
We also add an import of Data .
Generics and a flag , just to get the GHC machinery working for the derivings .
Finally , we add an import of Data .
Generics .
PlateData - which says that we want to automatically derive the necessary Uniplate instances , and use the Uniplate operations .
So lets imagine you have to get a list of all literals .
In SYB this is easy : Wow , easy !
But we can make it even easier with Uniplate : Both functions will operate on anything which has a Data instance , so you can run it on an Expr , Stmt , [ Stmt ] , [ Either Stmt Expr ] - the choice is yours .
The Uniplate functionsimply gives you a list of all thetypes in x , from which you can pick the Lit 's using a nice list comprehension .
Now lets negate all the literals , in SYB we have : Again , its pretty easy .
We can also do something very similar in Uniplate :
The only difference is a There are a number of advantages :
The SYB library has gone much further than queries and transformations - they provide what amounts to runtime reflection and an incredible level of power .
They also offer type generic programming , extensible functions and much more besides .
Uniplate does not attempt to offer anything beyond standard traversals .
It is also important to point out that SYB isthan Uniplate .
You can implement Uniplate on top of SYB , but can not implement SYB on top of Uniplate .
I would still encourage everyone to read up on SYB - it can be complex to pull of some of the more advanced tricks , but the power can take Haskell to whole new levels .
I hope that people will take a look at Uniplate , and see if it can meet their needs - in any project where a data type is defined and operated over it can probably be of benefit .
The code reductions that can be made with Uniplate ( or SYB ) are substantial , and can hopefully promote the concise declarative style which Haskell was designed for .
IBM recently hosted a System z Summit for customers and industry types , and at this summit the company did something exceedingly rare in the secretive world of mainframe marketing : they gave sales numbers for System z .
It turns out that the venerable mainframe , typically thought dead by even the most technically savvy PC users , still rakes in a ton of money for the company that invented the modern instruction set architecture ( ISA ) with the System z's predecessor , the System / 360 .
IT Jungle 's Timothy Prickett Morgan was on hand at the summit to talk to IBM 's vice president of worldwide sales for System z , and he produced a great article with lots of good data and slides .
I 'll talk about a few of the highlights here , but I encourage you to read the whole thing .
IBM told Morgan that there are only 10,000 System z sites in the world but that those 10,000 sites generate billions of dollars in hardware sales .
Those sales have increased recently , according to IBM , and are now at a high that the company has n't seen since 1998 .
When you add in the additional billions in sales of software ( 65 percent of System z revenue is from software ) , storage , and peripherals , then you 're talking about massive revenues from a miniscule installed base .
With high profit margins and huge revenues , it 's easy to see what the appeal of the mainframe is to IBM .
But what 's its appeal to the businesses that invest in it ?
I follow PC hardware much more than I do mainframe hardware , but it appears that the ongoing draw of the mainframe rests on a combination of legacy support and RAS features , with performance factoring into the picture in a way that might at first seem peculiar but is actually identical to how performance works in the PC space .
A long legacy
When IBM launched the Australopithecus of the z series line , the 1960s - era System / 360 , the company did more than just unveil what would become the quintessential mainframe computer system .
The System / 360 also singlehandedly introduced to the world the idea of legacy code , and with it , the era of modern computer architecture .
By the then novel method of inserting a layer of abstraction — the instruction set architecture ( ISA ) — between the programmer and the machine 's microarchitecture , IBM enabled programmers to write code for one machine that could not only be used across the entire line , but could also be used with little or no modification on later versions of the system .
Though Intel 's later x86 ISA went on to become the most commercially successful ISA of all time , we have IBM to thank for the concept of backwards compatibility .
So legacy support is built into the System z's DNA , and this mainframe 's ability to run decades - old ( but still mission - critical ) programs at blistering speeds is what makes it such a cash cow for IBM .
Indeed , when a company has profit margins on a product that are rumored to be as high as 85 percent ( according to Morgan in the IT Jungle article ) , this is a clear sign that there 's a substantial amount of vendor lock - in at work .
The performance question
Much to the chagrin of HP and other high - end vendors who'd love to replace mainframe hardware with clusters based on newer , high - performance products ( e.g. , Itanium ) , IBM 's System z does n't have to offer market - leading performance on " Linux " generically defined .
Indeed , as HP points out in its anti-IBM mainframe marketing site , IBM does n't publish standard Linux benchmarks for its mainframe line .
That 's because they do n't have to .
In the world of the System z , and indeed in the much wider world of commodity x86 , performance factors into the sales and growth picture a way that so many programmers and enthusiasts still do n't seem to really grasp .
IBM gets paid to deliver generational performance increases on System z code ( typically one of the z series - specific OSes plus the application stack ) , just like Intel and AMD make their money in the processor market by delivering not " performance " ( or even " Linux performance " ) generically defined , but x86 performance .
So despite the popularity of high - level languages ( HLLs ) like C/C++ , Java , FORTRAN , and so on , and despite the remarkable success of binary translation ( BT ) in delivering stellar performance on translated code , ISA still matters ... a lot .
To see how much ISA - related legacy software issues matter , take a look at the System z's processor hardware .
The System z's main general purpose CPU is an unglamorous , relatively low - clockspeed , in - order processor whose main selling points appear to be RAS functionality , legacy support , and high - bandwidth connections to other devices in the multichip module and wider system .
This general - purpose processor is ganged together with any number of more specialized processors , so that System z's hardware provides enough performance for code in the System z ecosystem to extinguish any desire that a System z shop might have to incur the huge costs associated with switching to an entirely different software ecosystem .
In other words , it seems that what keeps the venerable IBM mainframe going is that its total cost of ownership ( TCO ) is low enough and its performance high enough that the up - front cost of switching to a completely different hardware / software system is not amortized by the lower TCO ( and higher performance ) of a competitor over a long enough time horizon .
Or , in plain English , this means that nobody risks getting fired for just upgrading the old System z , as opposed to pulling the trigger on a migration away from the mainframe entirely .
Indeed , one gets the sense that , instead of eyeing Itanium clusters wistfully , IBM mainframe customers are relatively satisfied .
And why would n't they be ?
IBM aggressively develops the z series to the tune of $ 1.2 billion / year in R&D , and the company 's broader support and consulting services are so successful that hardware sales now account for the minority of IBM 's global revenue .
This kind of services and software commitment , when combined with the ongoing success of the mainframe 's installed base , is enough to put a spring in any IT manager 's step .
As far as the creeping x86 , Itanium , and RISC competition is concerned , it 's very likely that one day the TCO + performance balance will tip decisively in favor of a System z alternative .
As I said above , the z series ' hardware is pretty slow compared to its competitors a bit further down the food chain , and at some point the performance disparity will grow to the size where the ISA / legacy barrier will no longer hold .
When that day comes , IBM can just move the entire product line over to POWER6 and its successor .
ISA transitions still hurt , but because IBM owns the whole z series stack they can do what Apple did and absorb most of the cost of the transition for their customers by throwing technology at the problem .
So while HP wants to sell businesses on Itanium by using the ancient adage , " you ca n't teach an old dog [ i.e. , the IBM mainframe ] new tricks , " it seems that many shops are heeding a much newer adage that dates back to the PC clone wars of the 1980s : " Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM . "

that 's the problem with them fancy languages .
they 're so seldom - ly used that their back - enda are like swiss cheese .
what would make erlang more adept at holding up to it 's promises than lisp ?
why could n't these processes run in more mainstream ( / debugged / tested / reliable ) languages / runtime ?
Dec 12 , 2006 momerath42 link
We chose common lisp primarily for its rapid - prototyping capabilities .
In CL , it is very easy to define ' mini - languages ' , which is what I 've done for missions , objectives , senses , reflexes , state - machines , business - models and more .
All the code written in these special languages will remain untouched , and be auto - translated ( by CL code ) into erlang .
As I develop new missions , reflexes , etc , I will continue to use the mini-languages ; the processes they describe will simply be running on a distributed , fault - tolerant , erlang - based platform instead of the simplistic single - threaded one they have been running on .
We had hoped for the simplistic system to continue to serve for a while yet , so that we could focus on player - visible features , but we always knew it would need to be made more scalable at some point .
If you know of a ' more mainstream ( / debugged / tested / reliable ) ' language / runtime than erlang that provides :
1 ) * very * light - weight processes
2 ) distributed , message - passing concurrency ;
3 ) unification / pattern - matching
4 ) a soft - real - time , distributed , disk and / or ram - based relational / object database usable with or without transactions ( just a few of mnesia 's features ) ,
5 ) facilities for zero - downtime code - upgrades , and other high - availability features
6 ) a powerful enough set of semantics ( eg. closures ) to make auto - translation from lisp less painful than a complete rewrite
please tell .
In short , Lisp did live up to its promise , and we are only expecting Erlang to excel in the particular areas it was designed to ( and which a number of other companies use it for : I 'd hardly call the ' back - enda ' of sbcl or cmucl ' swiss cheese ' .
We do n't know the cause of the problem we 're encountering with deliverator on sbcl / cmu , or we'd have fixed it or gotten the sbcl devs to ( depending on where the problem is ) , rather than assigning blame and switching platforms .
The problem , in a nutshell , is that * something * is n't getting garbage collected despite the fact that we can't seem to find it from the root objects ( which is how the garbage collector is supposed to find out what 's garbage too , hence the confusion ) .

As I undestand it , the definition of what and how things should happen with the bots is created in lisp due to the simplicity of developing in that language and its functionality in creating artificial intelligence ( or simulating it , if you prefer ) .
lisp has been the premier language for AI .
lisp then will compile down and instruct Erlang , which will handle the bot behaviors autonomously from that point on .
Erlang is not as simple to work with as lisp for developing AI , but it is designed to run non-stop and with VERY minimal use of processor time .
It 's a hardy performer that should n't have the memory leak problems of lisp , and is scalable .
If lisp should go down ( which would probably be far less likely since Erlang would be managing a lot of the work ) , Erlang would still manage the day - to - day lives of the bots already in existence until lisp could be brought back up .

Some companies are adopting policies that require employees to speak only English on the job , spurring a backlash of lawsuits alleging that such rules can discriminate against immigrants .
The English - only policies are coming as the number of immigrants in the USA soars : Nearly 11 million residents are not fluent in English , according to U.S. Census data , up from 6.6 million in 1990 .
Nearly 34 million residents are foreign - born , according to 2003 U.S. Census data .
That 's up from 24.6 million in 1996 .
" This is becoming a much bigger issue , " says Amy McAndrew , an employment lawyer at Philadelphia - based Pepper Hamilton .
" Employers want to have policies because of safety and customer service , but they have to be careful not to be discriminatory . "
Employers may legally adopt an English - only speaking rule if they can show it is a business necessity , such as the need for communication with co-workers and customers or safety - sensitive situations where use of a common language could prevent an emergency , she says .
But Ronna Timpa , owner of Workplace ESL Solutions in Henderson , Nev. , says employers go too far in adopting strict policies that prevent co-workers from talking in their native language even during lunch .
" Imagine how you would feel if you could n't speak your own language in the bathroom , " she says .
The issue typically comes up in lower - wage and service - sector jobs .
The number of charges filed with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) alleging discrimination based on such English - only policies is small but six times as large as 10 years ago , from 32 charges in 1996 to about 200 in 2006 .
" If the rules enter work breaks , they will be difficult to defend or justify , " says Dianna Johnston , assistant legal counsel with the EEOC , adding that some employers also have policies requiring employees to be fluent in English .
Employers have faced lawsuits for enforcing English - only policies .
In April , Flushing Manor Geriatric Center agreed to pay $ 900,000 to settle an EEOC lawsuit based in part on the company 's English - only policy .
The New York - based geriatric center barred Haitian employees from speaking in Creole while allowing other foreign languages to be spoken , according to the EEOC .
That prohibition also included that no Creole be spoken during breaks , and largely affected employees who worked in nursing , food service and housekeeping , the EEOC says .
" There was no justifiable reason when there 's not a specific business necessity , " says Stella Yamada , an EEOC lawyer .
Marc Wenger , a New York - based lawyer representing the geriatric center , says the EEOC characterization is inaccurate and it believes its language policies are consistent with EEOC guidelines .
He says there was no restriction on using other languages during breaks , adding the consent degree was not an admission of wrongdoing .
Some employers have extended the policy to customers , too .
Geno's Steaks , a Philadelphia landmark , generated a storm of media and blogger attention in 2006 when its owner posted a sign requesting that customers order only in English .
At New York - based Hakia , which provides an Internet - based search engine , employees who are hired must speak English , and English is the language used for all business communications , says President Melek Pulatkonak .
Many employees are immigrants who speak Turkish , German , Russian , Indian , Romanian or Spanish .
Employees are free to speak their native language in private conversations .
" We have a very international team , " Pulatkonak says .
" Sometimes we have slips , and we just e-mail them back in English . "
Broadband speeds in the US are abysmal compared to the offerings from other developed countries , according to the Communication Workers of America .
The organization conducted its own download / upload speed tests online , which were taken by roughly 67,000 people across the country , and concluded that the average download speed in the US was 1.9 Mbps .
According to CWA president Larry Cohen , " the results are deeply troubling . "
Various states appear to have much higher averages than others .
For example , Illinois appears to be just above the national average at 2.1 M bps down , with New York 's average at 3.4 Mbps and California 's at 1.5 Mbps .
Rhode Island appeared to have the fastest average download speed , according to CWA 's data , at 5.0 Mbps , with Kansas coming in second with an average of 4.1 Mbps .
The data , says the CWA , is in in stark contrast to broadband speeds available in other countries .
The organization compared its own survey data to numbers provided by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation 's " Assessing Broadband in America " ( PDF ) report , which showed that countries such as Japan and even our closest neighbor of Canada have significantly higher broadband download speeds — 61 Mbps and 7.6 Mbps , respectively .
Data source : Information Technology and Innovation Foundation
However , the CWA 's data conflicts with that of the ITIF report .
ITIF claims that the average broadband speed in the US is 4.8 M bps — still lower than Canada , many western European countries , Japan , and Korea — but more than twice as fast as CWA 's numbers .
In fact , Cohen himself does n't exactly claim that the CWA 's data is valid .
" While we do n't claim that the results are scientific , we do believe this is the first national survey of Internet upload and download speeds , " Cohen said in his testimony to the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications and the Internet .
" I should point out that most people who took our speed test either use DSL or a cable modem . "
Most ?
Those comments do n't exactly instill large amounts of confidence in the CWA 's numbers .
The organization did not specify exactly how many of the 67,000 test - takers used dial - up .
Despite this difference , the ITIF and CWA are in agreement : the US is falling behind in broadband speeds .
Cohen said that the CWA supports a draft bill — the Broadband Census of America Act — that would require the FCC to upgrade its definition of " high speed " to a minimum of 2 M bps down and 1 M bps up .
In theory , this would then provide some motivation for broadband providers who do n't meet the technical definition of " high speed " to bump their offerings to consumers .
The sad truth is that broadband connections of any speed can still be hard to come by in some parts of the country .
The US consistently ranks relatively low in comparison with the rest of the world in both broadband availability and speeds .
We also consistently pay more for our slower connections than those in other countries .
As long as the government continues to make decisions that seem to work against consumers in this area — for example , not requiring cable and DSL providers to share their lines — Americans will continue to be stuck with subpar broadband speeds and prices .
Florida turning away from touch - screen voting / State 's plan for '08 is paper ballots with scanner for counting
2007-02-02 04:00:00 PDT
Delray Beach , Fla . -- Gov. Charlie Crist announced plans Thursday to abandon the touch - screen voting machines that many of Florida 's largest counties installed after the disputed 2000 presidential election .
The state will instead adopt a system of casting paper ballots counted by scanning machines in time for the 2008 presidential election .
Voting experts said Florida 's move , coupled with new federal voting legislation expected this year , could be the death knell for the paperless electronic machines .
If , as expected , the Florida Legislature approves the $ 32.5 million cost of the change , it would be the nation 's biggest repudiation yet of touch - screen voting , which was widely embraced after the 2000 recount as a state - of - the - art means of restoring confidence that every vote would count .
Several counties around the country , including Cuyahoga in Ohio and Sarasota in Florida , are moving toward exchanging touch - screen machines for ones that provide a paper trail .
But Florida could become the first state that invested heavily in the recent rush to touch screens to reject them so sweepingly .
" Florida is like a synonym for election problems .
It 's the Bermuda Triangle of elections , " said Warren Stewart , policy director of VoteTrust USA , a nonprofit group that has advocated optical scanners as more reliable than touch screens .
" For Florida to be clearly contemplating moving away from touch screens to the greatest extent possible is truly significant . "
Other states that rushed to buy the touch - screen machines are also abandoning them .
Earlier this week , the Virginia Senate passed a bill that would phase out the machines as they wear out , and replace them with optical scanners .
The Maryland Legislature also seems determined to order a switch from the paperless touch screens , though it is not clear yet whether it will require the use of optical scanners or just allow paper printers to be added to the touch screens .
On Monday , Rep. Rush Holt , D - N.J. , plans to introduce a bill in Congress that will require all voting machines nationwide to produce paper records through which voters can verify that their ballots were recorded correctly .
Crist , a Republican , at times drew whoops and applause when he announced his plan at the South County Civic Center in Palm Beach County , the epicenter of the 2000 election standoff and home of the infamous " butterfly ballot " that confused many voters .
The touch screens had replaced the punch - card systems that caused widespread problems that year .
" You should , when you go vote , be able to have a record of it , " Crist told a few hundred mostly older citizens at the civic center in Delray Beach , where many residents accidentally voted for Patrick Buchanan in 2000 instead of Al Gore because of the confusing ballot design .
" That 's all we 're proposing today .
It 's not very complicated ; it is in fact common sense .
Most importantly , it is the right thing to do . "

Conservative pundit Bill Kristol on Fox News Sunday this morning criticized the wavering on support for the Iraq war by some Republicans as " extremely stupid . "
" The idea that they will get credit for deserting the war at this point , they voted for the war , they voted to fund the war , now they 're going to what ?
Vote for withdrawal , for surrender , " he mocked .
" Then they 're going to go to voters , Republican congressmen , in 2008 and say , ' Hey , re-elect us ! ' "
" It 's a ridiculous political calculation , as well as dishonorable one , " he continued .

Jeremy Clarkson thinks Perodua Kelisa sounds like a disease
The BBC presenter has been filmed attacking the Perodua Kelisa with a sledgehammer before blowing it up .
But minister Abdul Raman Suliman defended the nation 's car industry , saying Mr Clarkson was like a football commentator who cannot play football .
Perodua had not received a single complaint from UK owners , he told MPs .
He added that the comments were made merely to boost sales of the Top Gear magazine .
' Soulless '
Mr Clarkson has voiced his frustrations with the small three - cylinder model in both magazine articles and on film .
In one article , he said its name was like a disease and suggested it was built in jungles by people who wear leaves for shoes .
And in a DVD car review , he described it as " unimaginative junk , with no soul , no flair and no passion " .
He then smashed it , hung it from a crane with a one - tonne weight attached , before blowing it up .
Perodua is Malaysia 's second national carmaker and began producing small compact models in 1995 .
Sending soldiers to war puts their children left at home at higher risk of abuse and neglect , says a study out Tuesday .
The study among military families shows that reports of emotional , physical and sexual abuse and child neglect peaked during the main deployment of troops to Iraq .
When deployments began , reports of abuse quickly jumped from 5 in 1,000 children to 10 in 1,000 .
The study found that victims were typically age 4 or younger and the abuser was usually the parent who remained at home while a spouse was deployed .
Military families had lower rates of child maltreatment than civilian families before war .
The study found that abuse rates soared when parents were sent to active duty .
" Among military personnel with at least one dependent , the rate of child maltreatment in military families increased by approximately 30 % for each 1 % increase in the percentage of active - duty personnel departing to or returning from operation - related deployment , " according to the study , in the May 15 issue of American Journal of Epidemiology , out today .
" The stress of war extends beyond the soldier and the military personnel to impact the family , " said lead researcher Danielle Rentz , now an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
She conducted the study while at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill .
The potential for greater maltreatment as deployments increase " is something that we have been concerned about for quite some time , " says Barbara Cohoon , a medical care expert with the National Military Family Association .
Army spokesman Paul Boyce says much has improved since the 2002 - 03 period reflected in the study , including support programs in medicine , counseling , schools and the work of chaplains .
At Texas ' Fort Hood , home to about 70,000 military family members , the post is now working with the Military Child Education Coalition to improve community involvement with military families , Boyce said .
" The U.S. Army , like many American communities , takes a solid teamwork approach to assisting families who have a soldier deployed , " he said .
Previous studies have linked military deployment to higher divorce rates and spousal violence , but this study is the first to suggest a link to child abuse .
The scope of the study was limited , analyzing data from a Texas registry of verified child abuse cases in military and other families in that state from 2000 to 2003 , the most recent data available .
Researchers found that after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , the rate of child abuse stayed relatively stable among both military and non-military families , with the rate among military families lower than non-military .
That changed in 2002 .
The rate of abuse within military families steadily increased through the latter half of that year as the nation mobilized for war .
And it dramatically increased in January 2003 , shortly before the invasion of Iraq .
The rate of abuse dipped after the fighting started in Iraq but stayed above the rate of non-military families .
Then it spiked again three months into the war .
Rentz says it is unclear why it dropped : anything from education campaigns to a drop in reported cases over the winter holidays could have played a role , she says .
The researchers used Texas data because it was very complete .
The state is home to several military installations , including one of the Army 's largest at Fort Hood , home of two divisions — the 4th Infantry and 1st Cavalry .
Fort Hood has suffered more casualties in the Iraq war than any other military base in the country .
Rentz says more detailed studies are needed to determine what leads to the abuse , but she says there is no reason to think the situation is better in other states today .
" Families are still under stress , and that is one of the key points , " she says .
" We really need more data to see what is going on . "

Soldiers line up to board a plane to deploy from Fort Hood , Texas , to Iraq .
Deployments coincide with increased child abuse , according to a study .
Fort Hood works with the Military Child Education Coalition to improve community involvement with its 70,000 military families .
Even some fellow Democrats say the city probably suffered from the anti-Rocky backlash .
“ He is one of those politicians who people love to hate , and sometimes he gave the Legislature a great excuse not to do their jobs where Salt Lake City was concerned , ” said Nancy Saxton , a Democrat and City Council member who is running for mayor in the November election .
Mr. Anderson announced last July that he would not seek a third term , saying he wanted to devote the rest of his life to grass - roots organizing involving human rights and global warming .
He said in the interview that he had not made specific plans .
One of the mayor ’s former chiefs of staff , Deeda Seed , who was fired in 2005 , described her former boss this way : “ I used to be good friends with him .
He ’s incredibly intelligent .
He is delightful to talk to .
He can be a really , really good friend .
He could just benefit from a little therapy . ”
( Ms. Seed said Mr. Anderson fired her after they disagreed on policy issues , including how to handle the news media .
He said she was “ almost a complete disaster as an employee and I had no choice but to fire her . ” )
Supporters say Mr. Anderson has made
Utah more interesting , at the very least , by highlighting the political diversity that exists at the state ’s heart , in the state ’s capital and largest city .
He first won office in 1999 , and re-election in 2003 , essentially by winning the votes of non-Mormons , who constitute about 55 percent of the city ’s population .
( Statewide , Mormons constitute about two - thirds of the population . )
In his last election , he got 54 percent of the vote , even though about 80 percent of Mormons voted against him , he said .
Those election patterns — non-Mormons mostly for Mr. Anderson , Mormons mostly against — set the rhythm for a mayoral administration that many people say has isolated Salt Lake City even more by emphasizing that the city ’s political and cultural distinctiveness is also about religion and that being non-Mormon is synonymous with being liberal and urban and different .
“ It ’s embarrassing for the rest of us ; Mayor Anderson is so over the top , nobody wants to be associated with him , ” said Matthew R. Godfrey , mayor of the nearby city of Ogden .
Mr. Godfrey said Mr. Anderson had not worked well with other mayors across the state and that he was out of step with fellow Utahans .
In a sign that east European migration to Britain may have peaked , the National Farmers ' Union has told the immigration minister , Liam Byrne , that the numbers of EU migrants , including Poles , coming to Britain for harvesting jobs has dropped .
The shortage could see a rise in the price of strawberries .
A spokeswoman for Fruitful Jobs , a company which employs seasonal fruit pickers , said the problems were particularly acute this year .
" There is a shortage of fruit pickers from the UK and Poland , " she said .
" There has been a lot of negative press about the conditions the workers would have to put up with , which has put people off . "
Last year , evidence compiled by the Transport and General Workers ' Union alleged fruit pickers , mostly migrant workers from eastern Europe , worked 14 - hour days , seven days a week , with only one 30 - minute break a day .
According to the spokeswoman the good weather in Britain this year may also have played a part .
" The warm weather in April has dramatically brought forward the soft fruit season .
Whereas a large percentage of students finish their courses in early June and begin fruit picking , we are having to find alternative sources of people , " she said .
Philip Hudson , the NFU 's chief horticultural adviser , said that Poles and other east Europeans were now less interested in coming .
" Their standard of living at home has increased more rapidly than anyone could have projected so they are now staying at home , " he said .
" Other countries , such as the Netherlands , have now opened their borders to them to work . "
He said that 13 growers of soft fruit and salad vegetables needed 4,400 workers but were facing a shortfall of 2,400 .
" There is a potential for crops to be left unharvested .
" We are talking about strawberries , raspberries and salad crops .
I do not want to scaremonger but our real concern is that the harvest is going to be left in the field which will mean there will be less British produce in the supermarket . "
The number of eastern Europeans coming to work in agriculture peaked at 22,700 in 2005 but dropped to 19,895 last year .
The first three months of this year saw only 3,400 coming to Britain , well down on 12 months before .
The NFU wants to see an urgent increase in the seasonal agricultural workers quota and see the scheme expanded to other non-EU countries , such as Ukraine .
Farmers have already won the backing of Lord Rooker , the agriculture minister .
But Mr Byrne told the Guardian that the evidence that new European states could not fill Britain 's labour shortages would have to be overwhelming for changes to be made .
" We are phasing out low - skilled migration from outside Europe because we think businesses should hire those close to home first , " he said .
A number of pupils dropped out of the trip
A class of 10 - year - olds at Atwood Primary , Croydon , south London , were due to tour Croydon Mosque as part of their religious education lessons .
But a number of parents withdrew their support saying their children were too young to learn about other faiths .
The school said as a result the trip was no longer financially viable .
Head teacher Alex Clark said some parents did not want their children to experience a religion that was not their own , others thought the pupils were too young and some preferred them to spend time on other subjects .
It is important that children have a range of knowledge about cultures and religions to develop understanding and respect for each other
Head teacher Alex Clark
He added : " We very much regret having to cancel one of our Year 5 class 's educational trips to the Croydon Mosque .
" It is important that children have a range of knowledge about cultures and religions to develop understanding and respect for each other . "
Mr Clark said : " The withdrawal of a significant minority of pupils unfortunately made continuation of the visit unviable .
This was done wholly on financial grounds . "
Leaders of Croydon Mosque were featured speaking out against the radicalisation of young Muslims on BBC's Newsnight programme on 14 November .
Media attention
Shuaib Yusaf , a spokesman for the Croydon Mosque & Islamic Centre , said it has hosted a number of school trips in the past .
He went on : " It is therefore regretful that one school has cancelled a prearranged visit in light of the media attention currently focussed upon the mosque .
" Amongst the reasons cited to the mosque is that some parents do not wish their children to visit a mosque at the centre of " radical " activities .
" Croydon Mosque & Islamic Centre is an old established mosque that provides a range of community based services to 18,000 Muslims in the London Borough of Croydon amongst others , and is not engaged in any ' radical ' activities .
" This is acknowledged by all concerned and the mosque is liaising with schools and the local education authorities to recommence school visits . "
Does God Exist
Does God Exist – A Scientific Inquiry
Does God Exist ?
The other day I was asked to prove the existence of God .
It was a one - on - one conversation with a skeptical friend , who somehow thrust the burden of proof on me .
He did n’t want the religious , moral or philosophical arguments --
He wanted the scientific “ proof . ”
Does God Exist – Is a Scientific Approach Possible ?
When it comes to the question , “ Does God Exist , ” there are really only two possible conclusions :
God either is , or He is n’t .
There ’s no half - way .
There ’s no sliding scale .
Whether you ’re an atheist or whether you ’re a theist , there ’s a certain level of knowledge , and there ’s a certain level of faith .
I thought for a moment …
Can I prove the existence of God -- scientifically ?
In my religious / moral / philosophical experience , He ’s been proven to me .
However , my friend has n’t walked the same journey as me .
He wants the facts -- he wants the naturalistic proof for a supernatural reality .
I came to the conclusion that my friend ’s question was a fair one .
He deserved my best attempt at an answer .
So , I gave it a shot …
Does God Exist – A Scientific Examination of the Evidence
God may not be provable through mathematical formulae or properties of physics , but we live in an era where the evidence of an Intelligent Designer is all around us .
Just look through the Hubble Telescope and peer to the edge of the massive cosmos .
View the monitor of an electron - scanning microscope and delve into the intricate world of a microscopic cell .
Try to comprehend the massive library of complex information inherent in the digital code that turns a fertilized egg into a human being .
Study principles of quantum mechanics and investigate the world of extra-dimensionality .
Review the nature of your conscience , subconscious , standards of morality , and thoughts of religion .
Then , try to reconcile all of these realities with a basic theory of randomness and chaos .
Based on what we know today , I truly believe that atheism ( not believing in any kind of god ) is a much bigger " leap of faith " than theism ( believing that some kind of god exists ) .
I asked my friend , “ Have you really thought about some of the evidences for God ?
Or , are you presupposing a purely naturalistic world , and closing your eyes to some of the possible evidence ?
If I propose some observational evidence , are you even open to examining it ? ”
My friend asked me to go on .
So , here ’s my attempt at some basic scientific observations that point to God :
Causation .
God provides the best explanation for the existence of the universe and all that 's in it .
( The alternative theory is that " nothing " exploded and resulted in everything that we see . )

Irreducible Complexity .

Does God Exist – A Scientific Conclusion
When it comes to the question of “ Does God Exist , ” there are only two scientific worldviews -- Someone / Something did it , or it did itself .
Whether it ’s the beginning of the cosmos or the beginning of life , the beginning of mankind or the beginning of mind , either Someone / Something is responsible for everything we see or it ’s responsible for itself .
“ Does God Exist ? ”
Is this really a question for science at all ?
Actually , it seems this is a matter of forensic science , since we ca n’t re-create the birth of the universe or the formation of first life in a laboratory .
Therefore , we collect the observable evidence in our world and apply our forensic investigation skills to analyze its collective meaning .
In the end , we all need to collect and examine the evidence for ourselves .
Ultimately , whether couched as scientific inquiry or purely religious / moral / philosophical faith , it ’s not a matter for the laboratory .
It ’s a personal , investigative decision for each and every one of us .

“ Climb to the top ?
Glug ! ”
My wife is an American citizen by birth .
But her father was in the foreign service and therefore most of her formative years were spent outside of the US .
Her first language was Japanese , then some English while briefly in D.C. , on to French in the Côte d’Ivoire , then German in Austria …
She speaks English fluently , though with a slight accent that I can only describe as from somewhere else .
It ’s not Japanese , not Austrian , not Ivorian .
Like I ’d really recognize Ivorian if I heard it …
But since it ’s not a heavy accent and her English is in fact better than mine ( she regularly uses words I only memorized for the GRE verbal section ) , I often forget she ’s “ not from around here ” as they say .
So I ’m caught off guard when she uses American idioms , slang , or expressions , and gets them hilariously confused .
And sometimes , I must admit , I end up liking hers better .
1. Glug
My wife and I are flying into San Francisco airport .
We ’re coming in for the standard SFO landing – right over the water .
A typical American sitting by the window , watching the airliner get closer and closer to the water ’s surface with no runway in sight , might look at their spouse with a pained expression and say “ Gulp ! ” .
What does my wife say in a situation like this ?
“ Glug ! ”
Narrowly avoid a fender bender ?
“ Glug ! ”
Dow Jones drops 400 points in one day ?
“ Glug ! ”
“ Our hotel has a spa . Mmmm ! ”
2. Mmmmm
“ Mmmm ” is an often - used American expression to denote joy over food .
For example :
Parent : “ Hey kids , want pizza ? ”
Kids : “ Mmmmm ! ! ”
Waiter : “ How ’s the duck a l’orange ? ”
Patron : “ Mmmm ! ! ”
But my wife uses “ Mmmm ” to express excitement or happiness over just about anything .
Me , checking my email : “ Hey !
Borders just sent out a coupon for 30 % off a DVD . ”
Wife : “ Mmmmm ! ”
Me : “ Want to stay a couple of nights in Japantown while we ’re in San Francisco ? ”
Wife : “ Mmmmm ! ”
And she says it with such enthusiasm .
3. Sweating Megabucks
This one is actually so good that I now use it .
Of course most people are familiar with the phrase “ sweating bullets ” when it comes to being very anxious over something .
But what if you ’re anxious over something financial ?
My wife had a large check that she had misplaced and was searching everywhere for it .
When she finally found it she said “ Whew !
I was sweating megabucks ! ”
Admit it , it works .
4. Pit Spot
Me , driving : “ Sign says 46 miles to next rest area … ”
Wife : “ We ’d better stop at this one , I do n’t think I can wait that long for a pit spot . ”
And in case you read it quickly , it ’s “ spot ” , not “ stop ” …
5 . The Wolf Who Cried at the Door
Once again it ’s been a tough week at work , having been pushed to meet an unreasonable deadline .
It ends with a team meeting where we ’re told that we ca n’t sit on our laurels and that next week will be “ crunch week ” .
Hold on – I thought this week had been “ crunch week ” ?!
And they called last week “ crunch week ” too !
I complain to my wife …
Wife : “ Same old story with them .
The wolf who cried at the door … ”
Me : “ … at the door ? … 🙄 … wolf ? ”
Wife : “ C’mon , you know the saying ! ”
Me : “… 🙄 … 🙄 … 🙄
… You mean the boy who cried wolf ? ”
Wife : “ Of course ! ” ❗
6. Sky Bird
Setting :
The beach in winter .
Me , looking out window : “ I ca n’t believe it .
Some idiot is out there swimming in the freezing ocean …
No wetsuit … ”
Wife , bored : “ Sky bird ”
Me : “ Wha ? ”
Wife , louder , like I do n’t understand English : “ SKY BIRD ! ”
Me : “ … Snowbird ? ”
Wife : “ Oh ? ”
“ I ’m pigging out on this free WiFi ! ”
7. Pig Out
What do you pig out on ?
Ice cream on Birthdays ?
Peeps on Easter ?
Lobster on Anniversaries ?
Why limit yourself only to edibles ?
You see , my wife can pig out on a much wider variety of things .
Because to her , the phrase seems to mean “ to take advantage of ” or “ to do anything to excess ” .
She once wrote a serious , formal thank you note to my parents for a clothing gift certificate , saying “ I ca n’t wait to go to Ann Taylor and pig out . ”
They had a good chuckle .
8. Two Seconds of a Cat ’s Tail
OK – the original phrase meaning a short period of time seems to be “ two shakes of a lamb ’s tail ” .
It ’s not all that uncommon to also hear “ two shakes of a cat ’s tail ” .
But what did my wife say to me one evening when I asked her if she wanted the light on to read a little before bed ?
“ No thanks , I ’m going to pass out in two seconds of a cat ’s tail . ”
9 . Yes means No
From what I understand , this is something left over from her Japanese childhood .
Me : “ You do n’t want any more coffee do you ? ”
Wife : “ Yes ! ”
Me : “ OK , I ’ll make some more … ”
Wife : “ No !
I meant yes , you ’re right , I do n’t want anymore . ”
10 . Orgy
To appreciate , you must understand that my wife is never vulgar and almost never uses profanity ( and when she does , it ’s pretty much Rated G ) .
So it ’s like a cold fish across the face when …
Me : “ How was your day ? ”
Wife : “ Great !
My sister and I went to IKEA and had an ORGY !!! ”
Me , under my breath : “ Glug ! ” 😯
In fairness to her , if you check the dictionary , you ’ll see that you can use the word this way .
But this is like the third or fourth definition that you ’d never know unless , again , you ’re studying for the GRE .
I mean , how often do you refer to a female as a wench , implying just … well … “ girl ” ?

Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite On January 31 , 1967 the Beatles went to Knole Park near Sevenoaks in Kent to make the promotional film for Strawberry Fields Forever .
" There was an antique shop close to the hotel we were using in Sevenoaks , " remembers former Apple employee Tony Bramwell .
" John and I wandered in and John spotted this framed Victorian circus poster and bought it . "
Inspired by the finely - wrought language and the evocative names of the performers on the poster , John began to compose a song based on it .
By now it was hanging on the wall of his music room and John 's long - time friend Pete Shotten can remember him squinting at the words while he picked out a tune on his piano .
Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite was recorded at EMI Studio Two on February 17 , 1967 , and was released on the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band album on June 1 , 1967 , in mono and stereo .
The rarer mono version has very small differences in the sounds of the tape loops during the " circus organ " part in the middle of the song .
John 's original poster was last known to be in the posession of Sean Lennon .
The Real Words John got many of words for Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite right off the original Mr. Kite poster , using some of them word for word , including the title of the song itself .
Notice below , in the complete words from the poster , the unforgettable images from the song , including " over men and horses , hoops and garters " , " somersets on solid ground " , and a " hogshead of real fire " !

The Real Pablo Fanque Pablo Fanque , Mr. Kite and the Hendersons were never more than colorful names to John , but records show that 150 years ago , they were real stars in the circus world .
Mr. Kite was William Kite , son of circus proprietor James Kite , and an all - round performer .
He is believed to have worked in Pablo Fanque 's Circus from 1843 to 1845 .
Pablo Fanque Pablo Fanque was a multi-talented performer who became the first black circus proprietor in Britain .
His real name was William Darby and he was born in Norwich in 1796 .
He started calling himself Pablo Fanque in the 1830's .
The Hendersons were wire - walker , equestrian , tramplinist and clown John Henderson and his wife Agnes , the daughter of circus owner Henry Hengler .
The Hendersons travelled all over Europe and Russia during the 1840's and 1850's .
The ' somersets ' which Mr. Henderson performed on ' solid ground ' were somersaults , ' garters ' were were banners held between two people and a ' trampoline ' in those days was a wooden springboard rather than stretched canvas .

Via Buffalo Geek and Jane Hamsher , who have the YouTube video , is facing a barrage of questions about what he knew in the Foley scandal , when he knew it , and why he did n't do anything about it other than passing it off to
So today he held a news conference , in which he " rented out a daycare facility " in order to surround himself with small children to talk about on Foley 's sexual predation in the halls of Congress .
Even the reporters could n't believe the rancidity of it :
Reporter : Congressman , do you mind asking the children to leave the room so we can have a frank discussion of this , because it 's an adult topic .
It just does n't seem appropriate to me .
Reynolds : I 'll take your questions , but I 'm not going to ask any of my supporters to leave . [...]
Reporter : Who are the children , Congressman ?
Who are these children ?
Reynolds : Pardon me ?
Reporter : Who are these children ?
Reynolds :
Well , a number of them are from the community .
There are several of the " thirtysomething " set that are here and uh I 've known them and I 've known their children as they were born .
Reporter :
Do you think it 's appropriate for them to be listening to the subject matter though ?
Reynolds :
Sir , I 'll be happy to answer your questions , I 'm still , uh ...
Hiding behind children .
Literally , in this case , holding them up to shield himself from the questions the reporters were trying to ask .
I 'm looking at this point for one man in the entire Republican leadership with the integrity of a fleabitten stray dog .
I 'm still looking for that one man .
Update [ 2006 - 10-3 20:9:19 by Hunter ] : BuffaloBlogger clarifies that he did n't _literally_ " rent a daycare center " , just commandeered the student center of a local college for his kids - on - parade press conference .
So you know , it 's not actual child labor for the GOP yet , LOL .
US Politics Economic Inequality and the ' C ' Word Eventually the inherent fundamental absurdities of the global economic system will prove unsustainable .
By Joel S. Hirschhorn
Published April 30 , 2007
Here is what the new report from the UK Defense Ministry 's Development , Concepts and Doctrine Centre warned might happen by 2035 :
The middle classes could become a revolutionary class .
The growing gap between themselves and a small number of highly visible super - rich individuals might fuel disillusion with meritocracy , while the growing urban under - classes are likely to pose an increasing threat ...
Faced by these twin challenges , the world 's middle - classes might unite , using access to knowledge , resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest .
Consider the wisdom of economist John Maynard Keynes :
The rich are tolerable only so long as their gains appear to bear some relation to roughly what they have contributed to society .
Think of it as proportional and justified economic success .
This can be tolerated by poor and middle class people if they believe the economic system is fair and properly rewards those who work harder or have better capabilities .
But truly obscene economic rewards angers people .
When most prosperity and wealth is unfairly channeled to relatively few Upper Class people , it is only a matter of time until fuming , resentful people in the Lower Class decide enough is enough and revolt .
Perhaps violently , if the political system remains controlled by the Upper Class .
Extreme Economic Inequality
Abundant data demonstrate how crazy our economic system has become where a relatively few receive astronomical gains that no rational person could see as justified .
One study tracked down home ownership data for 488 CEOs in the S&P 500 Index set of companies .
The typical home of the CEOs has 12 rooms , sits on 5.37 acres , and carries a $ 3.1 million price - tag .
Companies big enough to rate S&P 500 status hiked their median CEO pay by 23.78 percent in 2006 to $ 14.8 million .
In comparison , U.S. worker weekly wages rose just 3.5 percent in 2006 .
Despite what you hear about the sagging housing market and the many people facing foreclosure , business at the top end of the U.S. housing market is booming .
Sales of homes in the $ 5 million - and - up price range rose 11 percent last year , reports the Dallas - based Institute for Luxury Home Marketing .
Ten residential properties sold for over $ 28 million in 2006 .
The most expensive in New Jersey sold for $ 58 million ; it went to Richard Kurtz , the CEO of Advanced Photonix , a telecom supplier .
In the " ultra - luxury market " a set of suites in New York 's fabled Plaza Hotel was converted last year into one - bedroom condos that start at $ 6.9 million .
From another study we learn that pay for American college presidents over the past decade has jumped seven times faster than pay for college faculty .
In 1996 , only one college president took home over $ 500,000 .
In 2006 , 112 college presidents hit that mark .
Meanwhile , after inflation , compensation for college professors increased just 5 percent since 1996 .
And college students have faced rapidly mounting tuition far higher than inflation rates .
Getting Away with Economic Murder
CEOs are getting away with economic murder .
Bob Nardelli , the CEO who departed Home Depot early this year , had an exit package worth $ 210 million .
IBM CEO Sam Palmisano took home $ 18.8 million in 2006 and will receive $ 34.9 million in deferred pay and $ 33.1 million in retirement benefits when he leaves IBM .
Even more extreme is the case of Occidental Petroleum CEO Ray Irani .
The interest income alone on the $ 124 million that ended the year in Irani 's deferred - pay account totaled $ 679,396 .
The Los Angeles Times estimated Irani 's total payoff for 2006 at $ 460 million .
Leslie Blodgett , the top exec at cosmetics giant Bare Escentuals , collected $ 118.9 million in 2006 , with most of that coming from the $ 117.7 million she cleared cashing out stock options .
She received 4 million additional stock options before 2006 ended .
Economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California at Berkeley and Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics found that the richest 10 percent of the U.S. population received 44 percent of the pretax income in 2005 .
This was the highest since the 1920s and 1930s ( average : 44 percent ) and much higher than from 1945 to 1980 ( average : 32 percent ) .
With more than 140 million U.S. workers , that top 10 percent equals 14 million workers .
The bottom half of that top 10 percent had incomes of about $ 110,000 .
That may not seem all that high , except that the overwhelming majority of Americans can never expect such income .
And remember that many of these top 10 percent Americans are married to or living with equally highly paid people .
The Richest One Percent
When it comes to obscene economic inequality , however , you must focus on the huge gains received by the richest one percent - some 1.4 million people .
Their share of pretax income has gradually climbed from 8 percent in 1980 to 17 percent in 2005 .
Their average income was $ 371,000 .
Who is in the top sliver of richness ?
Economists Steven Kaplan and Joshua Rauh of the University of Chicago estimate that there were about 18,000 lawyers , 15,000 corporate executives , 33,000 investment bankers ( including hedge fund managers , venture capitalists and private - equity investors ) and 2,000 athletes who made roughly $ 500,000 or more in 2004 .
Do those at the top pay their fair share of taxes ?
Middle class Americans , after nearly 30 years of tax - cutting , are now paying about the same share of their incomes in federal taxes that they paid before Ronald Reagan entered politics .
In contrast , America 's richest have seen the share of their incomes that goes to federal taxes cut by over half .
That what happens in a failed democracy and the rich control the political system .
What the future holds for the victimized middle class will not only depend on the uncontrolled greed of the wealthy Upper Class and its control of the political system .
It will also be linked to the coming tsunami of global warming impacts on climate , sea level , water supplies , crops and disease .
There will be devastating impacts on hundreds of millions and perhaps billions of people worldwide .
Lower Class people will be sacrificed – left to suffer the consequences .
The rich will retreat to their walled , protected and well stocked havens .
Add to this scenario the inevitable collapse of the entire economic system .
At some point it will not be controllable as it is now by those in banking and finance , able to manipulate it to sustain economic injustice .
Unsustainable Absurdities
Eventually the inherent fundamental absurdities of the global economic system will prove unsustainable .
The wealthy Upper Class will have siphoned off most of the world 's wealth and hoarded resources to maintain a luxury lifestyle .
What the future holds : Lower Class economic slaves fighting to survive in a medieval , ugly and bleak world that so many science fiction stories have portrayed .
In that hell their best option will be to rise up and revolt against the rich and powerful Upper Class .
With such a prospect , global class war on a sick planet , prevention is a priority .
For us , that requires paying much more attention now to economic inequality , economic injustice , economic apartheid and the many attacks on the middle class .
If not , we get Economic Armageddon along with environmental disaster .

This is the second part in my series on the “ travelling salesman problem ” ( TSP ) .
Part one covered defining the TSP and utility code that will be used for the various optimisation algorithms I shall discuss .
solution landscapes
A common way to visualise searching for solutions in an optimisation problem , such as the TSP , is to think of the solutions existing within a “ landscape ” .
Better solutions exist higher up and we can take a step from one solution to another in search of better solutions .
How we make steps will depend on the “ move operators ” we have available and will therefore also affect how the landscape “ looks ” .
It will change which solutions are “ adjacent ” to each other .
For a simple optimisation problem we can directly visual the solution landscape :
The red dot represents our current solution .
It should be pretty clear that if we simply carry on going “ uphill ” we ’ll get to the highest point in this solution landscape .
If we are using evolutionary optimisation methods a solution landscape will often be referred to as a fitness landscape .
hill - climbing
Hill - climbing , pretty much the simplest of the stochastic optimisation methods , works like this :
pick a place to start take any step that goes “ uphill ” if there are no more uphill steps , stop ;
otherwise carry on taking uphill steps
Metaphorically the algorithm climbs up a hill one step at a time .
It is a “ greedy ” algorithm and only ever takes steps that take it uphill ( though it can be adapted to behave differently ) .
This means that it is pretty quick to get to the top of a hill , but depending on where it starts it may not get to the top of the biggest hill :
As you can see our current solution ( the red dot ) can only go downhill from it ’s current position – yet it is not at the highest point in the solution landscape .
The “ biggest ” hill in the solution landscape is known as the global maximum .
The top of any other hill is known as a local maximum ( it ’s the highest point in the local area ) .
Standard hill - climbing will tend to get stuck at the top of a local maximum , so we can modify our algorithm to restart the hill - climb if need be .
This will help hill - climbing find better hills to climb – though it ’s still a random search of the initial starting points .
objective and initialisation functions
To get started with the hill - climbing code we need two functions :
an initialisation function – that will return a random solution
an objective function – that will tell us how “ good ” a solution is
For the TSP the initialisation function will just return a tour of the correct length that has the cities arranged in a random order .
The objective function will return the negated length of a tour / solution .
We do this because we want to maximise the objective function , whilst at the same time minimise the tour length .
As the hill - climbing code wo n’t know specifically about the TSP we need to ensure that the initialisation function takes no arguments and returns a tour of the correct length and the objective function takes one argument ( the solution ) and returns the negated length .
So assuming we have our city co-ordinates in a variable coords and our distance matrix in matrix we can define the objective function and initialisation functions as follows :
def init_random_tour ( tour_length ) : tour=range( tour_length ) random.shuffle( tour ) return tour init_function=lambda : init_random_tour( len( coords ) ) objective_function=lambda tour : - tour_length( matrix , tour ) # note negation
Relying on closures to let us associate len( coords ) with the init_random_tour function and matrix with the tour_length function .
The end result is two function init_function and objective_function that are suitable for use in the hill - climbing function .
the basic hill - climb
The basic hill - climb looks like this in Python :
def hillclimb ( init_function , move_operator , objective_function , max_evaluations ) : ''' hillclimb until either max_evaluations is reached or we are at a local optima ''' best=init_function ( ) best_score=objective_function ( best ) num_evaluations=1 while num_evaluations < max_evaluations : # examine moves around our current position move_made =
False for next in move_operator ( best ) : if num_evaluations >= max_evaluations : break # see if this move is better than the current next_score=objective_function ( next ) num_evaluations +=1 if next_score > best_score : best=next best_score=next_score move_made=True break # depth first search if not move_made : break # we could n't find a better move # ( must be at a local maximum ) return ( num_evaluations , best_score , best )
( I ’ve removed some logging statements for clarity )
The parameters are as follow :
init_function – the function used to create our initial solution
– the function used to create our initial solution move_operator – the function we use to iterate over all possible “ moves ” for a given solution ( for the TSP this will be reversed_sections or swapped_cities )
– the function we use to iterate over all possible “ moves ” for a given solution ( for the TSP this will be or ) objective_function – used to assign a numerical score to a solution – how “ good ” the solution is ( as defined above for the TSP )
– used to assign a numerical score to a solution – how “ good ” the solution is ( as defined above for the TSP ) max_evaluations – used to limit how much search we will perform ( how many times we ’ll call the objective_function )
hill - climb with random restart
With a random restart we get something like :
def hillclimb_and_restart( init_function , move_operator , objective_function , max_evaluations ) : ''' repeatedly hillclimb until max_evaluations is reached ''' best =None best_score=0 num_evaluations=0 while num_evaluations < max_evaluations : remaining_evaluations=max_evaluations - num_evaluations evaluated , score , found=hillclimb ( init_function , move_operator , objective_function , remaining_evaluations ) num_evaluations + =evaluated if score > best_score or best is None : best_score=score best=found return ( num_evaluations , best_score , best )
The parameters match those of the hillclimb function .
This function simply calls hillclimb repeatedly until we have hit the limit specified by max_evaluations , whereas hillclimb on it ’s own will not necessarily use all of the evaluations assigned to it .
results
Running the two different move operators ( reversed_sections and swapped_cities – see part one for their definitions ) on a 100 city tour produced some interesting differences .
Ten runs of 50000 evaluations ( calls to the objective function ) yielded :
reversed_sections swapped_cities -4039.86 -6451.12 -4075.04 -6710.48 -4170.41 -6818.04 -4178.59 -6830.57 -4199.94 -6831.48 -4209.69 -7216.22 -4217.59 -7357.70 -4222.46 -7603.30 -4243.78 -7657.69 -4294.93 - 7750.79 ( these are the scores from the objective function and represent negative tour length )
In this case reversed_sections clearly performed much better .
The best solution for reversed_sections looked like :
Whereas the best for swapped_cities is clearly much worse :
It ’s pretty clear then that reversed_sections is the better move operator .
This is most likely due to it being less “ destructive ” than swapped_cities , as it preserves entire sections of a route , yet still affects the ordering of multiple cities in one go .
conclusion
As can be seen hill - climbing is a very simple algorithm that can produce good results – provided one uses the right move operator .
However it is not without it ’s drawbacks and is prone to getting stuck at the top of “ local maximums ” .
Most of the other algorithms I will discuss later attempt to counter this weakness in hill - climbing .
The next algorithm I will discuss ( simulated annealing ) is actually a pretty simple modification of hill - climbing , but gives us a much better chance at finding the global maximum for a given solution landscape .

Adobe released early bits of its next big product bet on Monday morning , a web and desktop hybrid code - named Apollo .
Apollo is the first child born out of the Adobe - Macromedia merger of April 2005 , bringing together the desktop strength of Adobe PDF combined Macromedia ’s web - savvy Flash and Apple ’s web browser engine .
Apollo will continue to receive heavy marketing from Adobe building towards a 1.0 launch in the fall .
In this post I ’ll break down the components of Adobe ’s Apollo framework , identify opportunities for application development , and compare the promised features against other software offerings .
What is Apollo ?
Apollo combines Adobe Reader , Flash Player , and Apple ’s Safari browser engine into a single desktop application for the Windows and Mac platforms .
Apollo applications have access to the local file system and are placed on your taskbar or dock just like you ’d expect from an application .
Apollo will be available as an autoupdate for Flash 9 users and will have similar distribution to existing free products from Adobe such as Reader and Flash .
Adobe Internet TV : Philo
Adobe ’s first big Apollo app is an Internet video application codenamed Philo .
The pervasiveness of Flash Player created multi-billion dollar Internet video startups powered by the Flash video format .
The Philo team hopes to expand the display size and quality of distributed videos and get publishers encoding using the latest Flash video encoders .
Publishers can skin the entire video player , delivering MTV content in what looks like a MTV video player , or a Rocketboom - themed player shown above ..
I have not seen or used Philo , but it should directly compete with Democracy player and possibly Joost .
The popularity of online video and cobranded players should help accelerate Apollo ’s adoption .
Apollo components
Expect Apollo to use the latest version of all available components at ship time .
Apollo requires ActionScript 3 , meaning content must be written for Flash 9 and above in order to interact with the Apollo program .
HTML , JavaScript , and CSS are handled by WebKit , the open source browser engine behind Apple Safari , Apple Dashboard widgets and the Nokia S60 browser .
PDF s will support features such as digital signing and approval , and it ’s probably best to develop on the recently released PDF 1.7 format .
Step out of the browser
Modern web applications are pushing the web browser to its limits and already taking advantage of desktop functionality such as JavaScript execution and browser plugins such as Flash or Quicktime .
Publishers can take that same web application running inside a browser tab , wrap it in Apollo descriptors , and create a cross- platform desktop application .
Most Apollo applications will likely be repurposed web pages running inside a specialized environment .
Mac users already have some of this functionality today as fans of a particular service have created WebKit - based applications combining desktop familiarity with a constantly connected web application .
Imagine your heavy , always - open web apps leaving your browser tab and creating an application - like presence in your taskbar .
With a few extra hooks into the Apollo runtime the web application could access files on your hard drive such as your address book , music library , or calendar .
Plugins such as Flash are second - class citizens within the web browser , receiving limited resources even when displayed in the active window .
Safari and WebKit lead Dave Hyatt recently explained some of the plugin issues in detail , including complicated state of balancing system resources and user expectations .
A stand - alone application removes the limits of these resource constraints , letting an Apollo application write more data to disk , consume more CPU cycles , and interact with other application data on your computer ( for better or worse ) .
Existing WebKit app s
Pyro is a desktop application for the Mac that takes 37signals ’
Campfire chat application out of the browser and into the desktop environment .
Pyro accesses local UI elements such as new message displays , and supports system notifications using Growl .
Campfire might stay open during your entire workday , and it ’s useful to have a separate application window and desktop features associated with that workflow .
PandoraMan takes Pandora ‘s Flash - based streaming music player out of a web browser window and into an application in your dock .
You might listen to music throughout the day or enjoy quitting your web browser often , and a desktop application such as PandoraMan helps the music keep playing .
Mac OS X ( Objective C/ Cocoa ) applications taking advantage of the WebCore framework compete with Apollo on the Mac platform .
Mac applications built on WebCore can bind to other libraries on the Mac system , taking advantage of notifications , system libraries , and native UI elements .
Windows Presentation Foundation
Windows Presentation Foundation ( WPF ) is part of Microsoft ’s .
Net Framework version 3.0 .
The presentation layer runs on a user ’s graphics card , taking advantage of the specialized hardware to create a the glassy look of Windows Vista or offload other system tasks .
WPF UI effects will likely become expected behavior from future applications .
Windows developers can take advantage of Internet Explorer libraries on the machine to render HTML while maintaining the same zones and access controls defined by other parts of the system .
A C# developer should be able to write a small application to wrap a website , including plugins such as Flash .
Microsoft ’s planned release of WPF/E will extend the reach of Microsoft runtimes across operating systems and web browsers .
WPF/E is the most direct competitor to Apollo outside the native application space with support for animation , graphics , and common audio and video codecs .
Summary
Apollo extends the reach of the Flash development community onto the desktop , creating new opportunities for application development using ActionScript 3 .
The ActionScript development community can now deploy applications onto cell phones using Flash Lite , inside a web browser using Flash Player , and onto the desktop using Apollo .
Apollo ’s PDF electronic document support will play a role within the enterprise , opening up smarter form handling and reliability .
An enterprise already dependent on PDF workflow and accountability may tap into Apollo for a consistent work flow across the company .
I ’ve heard the write - once run-anywhere many times over the past 10 years , but few applications have actually delivered .
Java and Java Web Start are the closest historical comparisons , but the demand for multimedia content creates a new breed of competitors in the form of Flash , Apollo , and WPF/E .
I ’m still a fan of native application development to create the most feature - rich and well - integrated application possible in the smallest resource footprint .
Java and ActionScript programmers can extend the reach of their code base without learning too many new things , and I definitely understand that attraction , but serious applications should be well integrated .
Adobe has allocated $ 100 million towards investing in companies that enhance its engagement platform and is especially interested in funding Apollo companies .
As of last month Adobe had invested in 6 companies , including word processing company Virtual Ubiquity .
Companies might develop for Apollo to take advantage a strategic investment from Adobe at reasonable terms .

Hey , kid .
That trash compactor you designed is up and running and I 've got to say it looks great .
Lots of grime , a magnetically sealed hatch that can't be opened from the inside , a tentacled garbage creature that practically serves no purpose at all .
It 's got everything a salty old janitor could ever want .
One thing , though .
It takes an awful long time to flatten garbage .
I 'm talking a minute or more , depending on how many flimsy poles I toss in there .
If our capital ships can boogie at faster than light speeds , why can't we make a few walls slide toward one another at a speed that outpaces a Hutt 's leisurely stroll ?

Subject E - 11 Blaster Rifle Calibration Still Off

To Nardo Pace < npace@empiremail.com >
As you know , the E - 11 has come a long way since its initial prototype .
Thanks to your hard work over the past three years the rifle no longer fires completely sideways , and with your latest revision , the number of casualties resulting from blaster fire being directed completely backwards has been drastically reduced .
That said , the E - 11 still has some accuracy issues .
We recently bolted one of the rifles to a testing mechanism so that it could n't move even a millimeter , then set up a human - sized target six feet in front of the blaster 's barrel .
Shooting in two second intervals , we let the E - 11 fire at the target continuously for three days .
The result ?
Not one shot hit the target .
I realize you 're busy , but perhaps we can go over the design one more time and iron this out .

Keep your chin up , ok ?
Do n't let the whole " Death Star getting blown up " thing get you down .
It 's really my fault just as much as it is yours .
Your original plan called for three weak spots , and I asked you to cut it down to one .
If I had suggested we get rid of the weak spots altogether none of this would have happened .
What do we do now ?
Mope ?
No .
We learn from our mistakes and make an adjustment to the blueprint for the new Death Star I 'm working on .
Construction is going great , by the way .
As you suggested , instead of constructing a defensive shell around the framework then working my way inward , I 'm just building all the cool stuff in the middle first .
I think you 're right , it 's the best way to go .

This is obviously a new technology , but might I suggest adding a few security measures to the transport device 's control panel ?
Right now anyone can walk up to this thing and flip a few switches to release the frozen prisoner .

You are responsible for designing my Throne Room , yes ?
Do not doubt it .
I can see the truth inside you .
It burns with a twisted blackness that can not be denied .
I ask you this :
Why is there a chasm in my room ?
Was it really necessary ?
What purpose does it serve ?
Nothing useful has ever come of it .
In fact , sometimes when I awake in the middle of the night and stumble in the darkness while making my way to the Imperial Restroom , I mistakenly wobble along the shaft 's edge .
I also bump my knee on the Imperial Coffee Table , but that is another matter .
I 'm expecting very important company today , but I fully expect that you will draw up plans for a grate to cover this errant hole and have someone build it tomorrow .
It is your destiny .

Mailing - list : contact zsh - users - help@xxxxxxxxxx ; run by ezmlm
As you can probably tell by the topic , I had some free time this weekend and have created quite possibly the * stupidest * ZSH program ever .
ZIRC is an IRC client .
It hooks into ZLE's asynchronous select ( ) support and ZSH 's builtin TCP support to do everything .
Not a * single * external , non-zsh command was used in this program .
If you 're typing something at the prompt and someone messages you , it 'll simply interrupt your current prompt , print out the message and let you continue with your typing .
How to use ( additional docs at the top of the script ) : *)
Source the file (. ./zirc ) *) ( Optional ) Run zsh_aliases , this sets up some aliases to make it a bit more comfortable to use .
me => zirc_action msg => zirc_msg last => zirc_last connect => zirc_connect etc... *)
Important commands : command ( alias ) zirc_switch (sw ) : change channel focus zirc_last ( last ) : change channel focus to last place with a message zirc_query ( query ) : change focus to username zirc_msg ( msg ) : message to focused user / channel zirc_pmsg ( pmsg ) : message to any user / channel zirc_quit ( quit ) : quit with optional quit message zirc_nick ( nick ) : change nickname zirc_connect ( connect ) : connect to IRC server zirc_part ( part ) : Leave channel zirc_help ( help ) : List zirc commands zirc_action ( me ) : Perform action in focused channel / user *)
Screenshot : ( I have my prompt setup to incorporate $ ZIRC_CURRENT to show current focus )

I suppose if you were in some not too busy channels , this thing could be pretty useful , but really , its mostly designed to just be a joke so you can tell your friends : " Yea , well , my shell has an IRC client " Have fun , Andrew Ruder P.S.
I 'm sure there are still some bugs , but I 've just got some other things I should probably be doing this weekend , 0.2 for bug fixes :) -- Andrew Ruder < andy@xxxxxxxxxxx >

This IRC client is pretty ridiculous , I made it entirely as a joke , but it # actually works fairly decently for as little work has been put into it .
#
And of course , afaik , there are * no* external commands used in the making # of this program .
No grep , no sed , nothing ... pretty cool :)
# # Guide to using it : # Step 1 ) Source this file .
# . ./ zirc or whatever #
You can even put this into your .zshrc , it wo n't hurt anything # besides the creation of several _zirc_ * / zirc_ * functions .
# Step 2 ) ( Optional ) Run zsh_aliases #
This sets up several aliases to make it easier to use .
Basically # it strips the zirc_ front end off of everything .
If you want to # see the alias list , type echo $ functions [ zsh_aliases ] # Step 3 ) Run zirc_connect #
It'll explain the syntax and the fairly standardized environment # variables controlling its behavior .
# Step 4 ) Use zirc_msg to message , zirc_pmsg to private message .
# zirc_switch can change to another channel .
( zirc_switch somechan ) # or # zirc_query can change to anything # Step 5 ) zirc_last is very handy as it switches to the channel / user that # last said something to you .

House passes meager “ College Cost Reduction Act ”
Tuition rates continue to skyrocket at US colleges
By Jerry White
18 July 2007
The US House of Representatives passed new legislation last week that Democratic majority leaders claim is the largest college student aid package since the 1944 GI Bill .
In reality , the College Cost Reduction
Act of 2007 will do little to alleviate the financial burden for millions of college students who are confronting skyrocketing tuition costs and a crushing level of student loan debt .
While the GI Bill provided tens of billions to enable returning veterans to attend college , the Democrat - sponsored bill does not propose any new actual spending .
Instead , small increases in student aid will be paid for by cutting $ 19 billion in federal subsidies to the student loan industry over the next five years .
President Bush himself has called for a $ 16 billion cut in subsidies to these for - profit loan companies , which have been embroiled in scandal over deceptive lending practices , payoffs to college officials and the improper collection of hundreds of millions in government payments .
The new bill raises the maximum Pell Grant — the major government assistance program for low - and middle - income students — by only $ 500 over the next five years , to a total of $ 5,200 by 2011 .
The maximum grant has been essentially frozen since 2003 and is estimated to cover only a third of the average cost of attending a four - year public university .
As tuition costs have skyrocketed , the real value of federal Pell Grants have been declining for years .
College costs — including tuition , fees , books , materials and living expenses — have outpaced inflation by nearly 40 percent over the last five years .
According to the latest figures available from the US Department of Education in 2003 - 2004 , the average price of attendance for full - time dependent students was $ 9,800 at public two - year institutions , $ 15,100 at public four - year institutions , $ 29,500 at private not - for - profit four - year institutions , and $ 18,100 at private for - profit less - than - four - year institutions .
The College Board put the average figure for private four - year colleges and universities at $ 30,367 in 2006 - 2007 .
As tuition costs have increased , federal funding has been slashed for work - study grants , Perkins Loans and Federal Student Educational Opportunity Grants .
This has forced millions of students from working class families to take out private loans , while millions more simply forgo college because of the prohibitive costs .
According to calculations from the Project on Student Debt , debt for graduates of public universities has increased by 65 percent over the past decade when adjusted for inflation .
In 2005 , the average US college student graduated with about $ 20,000 in debt .
The measures proposed by the Democratic - controlled Congress are a drop in the bucket .
The new bill will gradually reduce interest rates on federally backed loans over the next five years , from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent , while limiting monthly payments to 15 percent of the borrower ’s discretionary income .
The bill would also grant $ 5,000 in loan forgiveness for police , firefighters and prosecutors , and a complete release from student loans for public servants after 10 years .
For all others , debt forgiveness ( for federal loans ) will only be granted after paying off the costs of student loans for two decades .
In other words , the majority of students will be saddled with student loans until they approach middle age .
The bill passed 273 to 149 in the House , with the support of 47 Republicans .
The Senate is expected to pass similar legislation later this month .
President Bush , however , has threatened to veto the bill , and neither the House nor the Senate is expected to have veto - proof majorities .
Bush has denounced the bill as a “ new entitlement program ” that creates too many new government entities .
The College Cost Reduction
Act will do nothing to stop the single most important cause of rising student costs : ever - increasing tuition rates .
Throughout the country , colleges and universities continue to raise rates , in large measure due to a reduction in state funding .
A much - touted provision of the bill assigns institutions a “ college - affordability index ” based on the growth of tuition .
If a college or university raises its tuition by more than twice the rate of inflation for three consecutive years , it would be required to give an explanation for the cost increases .
It would then have two more years to slow tuition growth before being given “ affordability - alert status . ”
It is unclear what , if anything , this status would imply .
This toothless measure on college tuition serves more to highlight the threadbare character of the bill than anything else .
The situation in Michigan is particularly acute due to the downturn in the auto industry and the state ’s fiscal crisis .
Michigan State University ( MSU ) , the state ’s largest university , recently announced a 9.6 percent increase in tuition .
The hike will cost a typical in - state freshman or sophomore $ 798 more for the full academic year .
Last year , MSU raised tuition by 5.9 percent .
Describing the impact of the tuition increases on working families , Beth Langley , a 1986 MSU graduate , wrote a letter to the college ’s student newspaper .
“ I feel I must voice my disappointment with the decision to increase tuition ( yet again ) by 9.6 percent , ” she wrote .
“ It is the middle - income students who suffer the most .
Forced to take out loans because they do not qualify for state and federal aid ( and because parents cannot afford $ 18,000 per year out - of - pocket ) , these middle - income students may owe $ 60,000 - $ 70,000 by the time they graduate with a four - year degree .
Langley continued , “ This is an obscene amount of debt that is being forced on young people who are embarking on their post - college careers .
When does it end ?
How exorbitantly high will tuition be by the time my second son graduates from high school in three years ? ”
Colleges have raised tuition in anticipation of further reductions in public funding to Michigan ’s 15 public universities .
In an effort to balance the state budget , Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm took back 60 percent of the funding increase it gave to universities last year and will not give universities their August funding , one of 11 yearly payments .
In addition to MSU , Michigan Technological University increased tuition by 9.51 percent and Ferris State University approved a 6.7 percent increase , in addition to imposing a new $ 8 - per - credit - hour fee to cover expenses if the state cuts the university ’s budget .
Oakland University ’s board voted to raise tuition an average of $ 971 for the average full - time undergraduate resident student , making the cost of tuition $ 7,927 per year .
The state has repeatedly cut its appropriation support for Oakland University , reducing state subsidies from 56 percent in 1992 to just 29 percent in 2007 , an all - time low .
Detroit ’s Wayne State University unveiled plans to cut $ 7 million in costs due to reductions in state funding , while it still grapples with a $ 16 million shortfall from last year .
The cost - cutting measure will stop the purchase of computers , printers , copiers , furniture and other related items .
“ It is certain that Wayne State will have to eliminate some filled and vacant positions , cancel courses and scale back programs and services because of the state ’s budget cuts , ” a memo from the college president said .
WSU administrators are bracing for further reductions in state spending .
If the state decreases funds by 1.5 percent , the university administrators warn , Wayne State would have to raise tuition between 12 and 14 percent to balance its budget .
Fox analyst : ' Space aliens kidnapped president ' and ' left this tool ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday June 4 , 2007 Print This Email This On Monday , Fox News covered Vladimir Putin's threat that if the US government goes ahead with setting up a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe , Russia will target its own missiles at European targets .
The discussion led to an unlikely reversal of political positions , with conservative Fox political analyst Tammy Bruce describing the situation as " another glaring example of the growing incompetency of the Bush administration and his foreign policy , " while Democratic strategist Bob Beckel concluded that " I support Bush on this ... and it's a strange day when I do that . "
Bruce began by defending Putin and asked how we in the US would feel if Russian missiles were sited in Cuba or Honduras .
She pointed out that the US missiles in the Czech Republic and Poland are supposedly intended to guard against the threat of potential Iranian long - range missiles , even though those missiles do n't yet exist and we 've said we 're not going to allow Iran to develop them .
She then blew up about immigration and Iraq as well , saying , " I 'm waiting to find the space aliens that kidnapped the president that I grew to admire after September 11 and left this tool behind .
... I 'm furious . "
When Beckel weighed in to insist that in this case he does n't think Bush deserves conservative anger , because " Putin has been a thug from the beginning , " Bruce retorted that " every maniac in the world has felt empowered during the last five years .
That is the president 's issue ... because Bush has been so ineffective . "
The following video is from Fox 's American Newsroom , broadcast on June 4 .
Gold & Silver Dealers Across the United States
Precious metals - especially gold and silver - have historically been used as currency for over 2500 years .
While their they have maintained its value for all this time - unlike paper currency and other assets - and are expected to carry on becoming more and more valuable over time .
Due to their history of holding their value , buying and selling gold and silver is considered a very safe and lucrative way of investing .
One of the most interesting aspects of investing in precious metals is that they tend to be inversely correlated with the stock market and other financial instruments - that is , when the market is unstable and economies are weak , the purchasing power of gold increases exponentially - so while many investors go bankrupt and paper currency declines , those who have bought gold and silver can make a fortune out of selling it .
The main factor in making precious metals so safe is that there is n't much that can end up happening to them .
When you invest on a company , there are way too many things that can go wrong and are completely beyond your control - maybe one of their competitors develop a much better product or services and they lose the majority of their clients , or a new law prevents them from using a very cost - effective material or substance which drastically lowers their profit - or even a major disaster , such as a fire or earthquake , could have them go bankrupt and make all your investment go to waste .
Gold and silver , however , are a tangible , physical objects you can store in a safe or even bury in your back yard - and there is n't much that can end up happening to them .
It 's not subject to this sort of unpredictability - and its supply is n't expected to drastically change anytime soon , its price depends exclusively on demand - which is guaranteed to go up sometimes .
Since currency is so stable and unpredictable , it is very important that you allocate at least 5 per cent of your investment portfolio in gold and / or silver - so you 'll protect your global purchasing power in any situation , and be financially safe in situations of market shock .
It 's for this very reason the majority of National banks have been net buyers of gold for the last five years .
Buying and selling precious metals , however , is n't particularly easier than other means of investment .
In order to do it properly , you need to learn to study this type of investment and make yourself familiar with the nuances of the market and the prices per ounce over time - so you can know when it 's low enough to buy and when it's high enough to sell , depending on your needs and interests .
If you do decide to invest in precious metals , the next step is to figure out whether you want to buy gold or silver .
The two commodities are very closely related - since the 70s , they have moved in the same direction on over three - thirds of all trading days .
The difference is that silver , being a much smaller market , varies much more drastically - about three times as much - than its counterpart .
For this reason , silver has been called " the Devil 's metal " , and is attracts " hot money " investors all around the world .
Regardless of your decision , make sure to keep in mind that , albeit safe , precious metals are n't always the most lucrative investment , unless you can buy them when their price is very low , and sell them when its much higher - and this only happens when the economy is going very well and suddenly crashes .
In times of long - term economical stability , it might prove wise to hold off your precious metal investing for later .
Last night 's episode of Real Time was one of the best in the show 's five season history , making the decision about which clip to post a tough one .
After much deliberation , I finally decided on this : Wrapping up his " New Rules " segment , Bill sardonically shattered the " liberal " notion that President Bush has n't asked us to sacrifice anything for the GWOT .

If you do n't have HBO , Real Time alone is well worth it .
Not to mention The Wire , The Sopranos and Entourage .
Maher :
And finally , new rule : liberals must stop saying President Bush has n't asked Americans to sacrifice for the War on Terror .
On the contrary , he 's asked us to sacrifice something enormous :
Our civil rights .
( full transcript below the fold via IBN )
Now , when I heard George Bush was reading my e-mails , I probably had the same reaction you did-- George Bush can read ?!
( Laughter . )
Yes he can , and this administration has read your phone records , credit card statements , mail , internet logs ...
I can't tell if their fighting the War on Terror or producing the next season of Cheater .
( Laughter . )
I mail myself a copy of the Consitution every morning , just on the hope they 'll open it and see what it says !
( Laughter and applause ) .
So when it comes to sacrifice , do n't kid yourself -- you * have * given up a lot !
You 've given up faith in your government 's honesty , the good will of people overseas , and 6/10 of the Bill of Rights .
Here 's what you 've sacrificed : search and seizure , warrents , self incrimination , trial by jury , cruel and unusual punishment .
Here 's what you have left : handguns , religion , and they can't make you quarter a British soldier .
If Prince Harry invades the inland empire , he has to bring a tent .
( Laughter ) .
You know , in previous wars , Americans on the homefront made a very different kind of sacrifice .
During World War II , we endured rationing , payed higher taxes , bought war bonds , and in the interest of national unity , people even pretended Bob Hope was funny .
( Laughter . )
Right -- like you laughed at him !
Women donated their silk undergarments so they could be sewn into parachutes .
Can you imagine nowadays a Britney Spears or a Lindsay Lohan going without underwear ?
( Laughter . )
Bad example , but look , George Bush has never been too bright about understanding " furriners " , but he does know Americans .
He asked * this * generation to sacrifice the things he knew we would not miss -- our privacy and our morality .
He let us keep the money .
But he made a cynical bet , that we would n't much care if we became a Big Brother country that has now tortured a lot of random people .
And yet no one asks the tough questions , like " Is torture necessary ? " , " Who will watch the watchers ? " and " When does Jack Bauer go to the bathroom ? " ( Laughter . )
I mean , it 's been five years -- is he wearing one of those astronaut diapers ?
In conclusion , after September 11 , President Bush told us Osama bin Laden " could run but he can't hide " .
But he ran and hid .
( Laughter . )
So Bush went to Plan B : pissing on the Constitution and torturing random people .
Conservatives always say the great thing Reagan did was make us feel good about America again .
Well , do you feel good about America now ?
I 'll give you my answer .
And to get it out of me , you do n't even need to hold my head under water and have a snarling guard dog rip my nuts off .
( Laughter ) .
No , I do n't feel very good about that .
They say evil happens when good men do nothing .
Well , the Democrats proved it also happens when mediocre people do nothing .
Who would n’t love to have money just sitting around , waiting to be used in case of an emergency ?
Who would n’t feel better about having money when you need it , instead of going without or using a credit card during the lean times ?
Most everyone will agree that an emergency fund is a good idea , but knowing this is only the first step though .
The next step is to decide how much of a fund you initially want to have .
I ’d recommend whatever seems like a relatively easy goal to you : maybe somewhere between $ 500 and $ 5000 .
The most important step is to actually build your emergency fund .
Depending on your situation , you can go about this in different ways .
One of the easiest ways is to set up an automatic transfer each pay period to an account that you ’ve designated as your emergency fund .
Choose an amount that you know you can live without , because you ’ll probably want to tell yourself that once it ’s in there , it stays in there unless a pre-defined emergency comes up AND you ca n’t find the money elsewhere .
For this reason , when I finally got my emergency fund going I made the amount that was sent to it on a regular basis somewhat low .
That was my minimum commitment .
Of course I also added additional amounts as I got extra money or realized that I wanted to build the fund up faster , but I made sure to stick to my original commitment throughout .
Doing this helps maintain traction .
Another way to start an emergency fund , especially if you do n’t get paid regularly or in set amounts , is to start a change jar or emergency envelope .
This works best if you have cash on a regular basis , because at the end of each day you can simply dump your leftover cash into the jar or envelope .
Once it hits a certain amount , take it to the bank .
You can do something similar with a program like BofA ’s Keep the Change .
You ’ll be surprised at how quickly even a little bit adds when you ’re committed to not spending it .
Leahy rips into every discrepancy in Gonzales 's prior appearances .
He hits on :
. Monica Goodling :
Is Ms. Goodling ’s testimony accurate , and if so , how do you account for your previous , uncorrected testimony to this Committee ?
. Paul McNulty :
Why has your description of who made the decisions , and who was most involved in the decision - making process , changed over time ?
. Bradley Schlozman :
Were you aware of these issues when Mr. Schlozman was appointed interim United States Attorney in the Western District of Missouri ?
How did they affect your decision ?
Then he goes after the testimony Gonzales made on National Security Letters , inviting him to " revise or correct ( your ) misleading testimony . "
Next , he demands legal justifications for the warrantless electronic surveillance program ; in the process , he invokes James Comey 's testimony about the bedside visit to John Ashcroft .
Then , my personal favorite :
He demands an explanation for a memo by Steven " The President Is Always Right " Bradbury , which justified the non-appearance of Harriet Miers .
Leahy goes after this one by invoking the Vacancies Act.
Mr. Bradbury essentially is acting in a capacity -- Assistant Attorney General -- in which he cannot serve , as the last Congress did not appoint him , and Bush has not pursued a recess appointment .
Bradbury still works at Justice , but not apparently in a role that would encompass this memo .
Interesting stuff .
For bonus points , Leahy goes into data mining , the Hometown Heroes Act , Gonzales 's promises of more oversight ; all designed to embarrass AGAG .
Last , though , he drops this nugget :
Apparently , the Department of Justice Inspector General suffers under a limitation that restricts his ability to investigation misconduct by you , the Deputy Attorney General , and other senior Department lawyers .
Will you agree to the removal of this limitation ...?
Imagine !
The Justice IG can't investigate the AG .
How convenient !
Let 's indeed have an explanation for that , Mr. Gonzales .
I 'm all ears .
I 'd say Gonzales is properly set up for potential perjury , would n't you ?
Coming to a TV screen near you , the new reality show : " Who Wants to be Impeached ? "
Cell Phone Companies and Security
This is a fascinating story of cell phone fraud , security , economics , and externalities .
Its moral is obvious , and demonstrates how economic considerations drive security decisions .
Susan Drummond was a customer of Rogers Wireless , a large Canadaian cell phone company .
Her phone was cloned while she was on vacation , and she got a $ 12,237.60 phone bill ( her typical bill was $ 75 ) .
Rogers maintains that there is nothing to be done , and that Drummond has to pay .
Like all cell phone companies , Rogers has automatic fraud detection systems that detect this kind of abnormal cell phone usage .
They do n’t turn the cell phones off , though , because they do n’t want to annoy their customers .
Ms. Hopper [ a manager in Roger ’s security department ] said terrorist groups had identified senior cellphone company officers as perfect targets , since the company was loath to shut off their phones for reasons that included inconvenience to busy executives and , of course , the public - relations debacle that would take place if word got out .
As long as Rogers can get others to pay for the fraud , this makes perfect sense .
Shutting off a phone based on an automatic fraud - detection system costs the phone company in two ways : people inconvenienced by false alarms , and bad press .
But the major cost of not shutting off a phone remains an externality : the customer pays for it .
In fact , there seems be some evidence that Rogers decides whether or not to shut off a suspecious phone based on the customer ’s ability to pay :
Ms. Innes [ a vice - president with Rogers Communications ] said that Rogers has a policy of contacting consumers if fraud is suspected .
In some cases , she admitted , phones are shut off automatically , but refused to say what criteria were used .
( Ms. Drummond and Mr. Gefen believe that the company bases the decision on a customer ’s creditworthiness .
“ If you have the financial history , they let the meter run , ” Ms. Drummond said . )
Ms. Drummond noted that she has a salary of more than $ 100,000 , and a sterling credit history .
“ They knew something was wrong , but they thought they could get the money out of me .
It ’s ridiculous . ”
Makes sense from Rogers ’ point of view .
High - paying customers are 1 ) more likely to pay , and 2 ) more damaging if pissed off in a false alarm .
Again , economic considerations trump security .
Rogers is defending itself in court , and shows no signs of backing down :
In court filings , the company has made it clear that it intends to hold Ms. Drummond responsible for the calls made on her phone . “. . . the plaintiff is responsible for all calls made on her phone prior to the date of notification that her phone was stolen , ” the company says .
“ The Plaintiff ’s failure to mitigate deprived the Defendant of the opportunity to take any action to stop fraudulent calls prior to the 28th of August 2005 . ”
The solution here is obvious : Rogers should not be able to charge its customers for telephone calls they did not make .
Ms. Drummond ’s phone was cloned ; there is no possible way she could notify Rogers of this before she saw calls she did not make on her bill .
She is also completely powerless to affect the anti-cloning security in the Rogers phone system .
To make her liable for the fraud is to ensure that the problem never gets fixed .
Rogers is the only party in a position to do something about the problem .
The company can , and according to the article has , implemented automatic fraud - detection software .
Rogers customers will pay for the fraud in any case .
If they are responsible for the loss , either they ’ll take their chances and pay a lot only if they are the victims , or there ’ll be some insurance scheme that spreads the cost over the entire customer base .
If Rogers is responsible for the loss , then the customers will pay in the form of slightly higher prices .
But only if Rogers is responsible for the loss will they implement security countermeasures to limit fraud .
And if they do that , everyone benefits .
There is a Slashdot thread on the topic .

Ron Paul In His Own Words
20 . NOT A CHICKEN HAWK .
Unlike Dick Cheney , George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld , Paul served in Vietnam for duty … not booty .
He knows the costs : when they ’re worth paying and when they ’re not .
That makes him a credible candidate to put an end to the war in Iraq .
“ As an Air Force officer serving from 1963 - 1968 , I heard the same agonizing pleas from the American people .
These pleas were met with the same excuses about why we could not change a deeply flawed policy and rethink the war in Vietnam .
That bloody conflict , also undeclared and unconstitutional , seems to have taught us little despite the horrific costs . ”
— “ We Just Marched In ( So We Can Just March Out ) , ” April 17 , 2007
“ Why is it that those who never wore a uniform and are confident that they wo n’t have to personally fight this war are more anxious for this war than our generals ? ”
— “ Questions That Wo n’t Be Asked About Iraq , ” September 10 , 2002
19 . HAS FOUGHT FOR SOMETHING
— for human life .
As a medical doctor , he can actually do something besides shuffle paper and grease palms , which makes him an all but extinct species in the Beltway jungle .
And while his training puts him squarely in the science - based community , he ’s also a genuinely religious man who has the trust of social conservatives .
People deserve hard science from principled people like Paul , not soft twaddle from front men for vested interests .
Both a strong libertarian and a social conservative , he just might have the credibility to shape the issues in a way that ’s rational and sensitive to rights .
“ The bottom line is that mental health issues are a matter for parents , children , and their doctors , not government …
It is important to understand that powerful interests , namely federal bureaucrats and pharmaceutical lobbies , are behind the push for mental health screening in schools .
There is no end to the bureaucratic appetite to run our lives , and the pharmaceutical industry is eager to sell psychotropic drugs to millions of new customers in American schools .
Only tremendous public opposition will suffice to overcome the lobbying and bureaucratic power behind the president ’s New Freedom Commission . ”
— “ Do n’t Let Congress Fund Orwellian Psychiatric Screening of Kids , ” January 31 , 2005 .
18 . KNOWS OPEN BORDERS DON’T MIX WITH WARFARE - WELFARE
“ We ’re often told that immigrants do the jobs Americans wo n’t do , and sometimes this is true .
But in many instances illegal immigrants simply increase the supply of labor in a community , which lowers wages . ”
“ The Immigration Question , ” April 4 , 2006 .
“… immigration may be the sleeper issue that decides the 2008 presidential election . ”
“ More importantly , we should expect immigrants to learn about and respect our political and legal traditions , which are rooted in liberty and constitutionally limited government .
Our most important task is to focus on effectively patrolling our borders .
With our virtually unguarded borders , almost any determined individual – including a potential terrorist – can enter the United States .
Unfortunately , the federal government seems more intent upon guarding the borders of other nations than our own .
We are still patrolling Korea ’s border after some 50 years , yet ours are more porous than ever . ”
— “ Immigration and the Welfare Stare , ” August 9 , 2005 .
This is not xenophobic ; it ’s common sense in most countries in the world .
17 . UNDERSTANDS THE NEED TO REIGN IN THE EXECUTIVE .
Paul is very clear on the importance of the separation of powers and the need for checks and balances in the government and he ’s spoken out time and again for strengthening the power of Congress .
“ … why not try something novel , like having Congress act as an independent and equal branch of government ?
Restore the principle of the separation of powers , so that we can perform our duty to provide checks and balances on an executive branch ( and an accommodating judiciary ) that spies on Americans , glorifies the welfare state , fights undeclared wars , and enormously increases the national debt .
Congress was not meant to be a rubber stamp .
It ’s time for a new direction . ”
— “ Searching For a New Direction , ” January 19 , 2006 .
He ’s also stood up against corrupt federal programs like the “ war on drugs ” :
“ We have promoted a foolish and very expensive domestic war on drugs for more than 30 years .
It has done no good whatsoever .
I doubt our Republic can survive a 30 - year period of trying to figure out how to win this guerrilla war against terrorism . ”
“ The drug war encourages violence .
Government violence against nonviolent users is notorious and has led to the unnecessary prison overpopulation .
Innocent taxpayers are forced to pay for all this so - called justice .
Our eradication project through spraying around the world , from Colombia to Afghanistan , breeds resentment because normal crops and good land can be severely damaged .
Local populations perceive that the efforts and the profiteering remain somehow beneficial to our own agenda in these various countries . ”
— “ War on Terror ?
It ’s as Bad as the War on Drugs , ” October 30 , 2001 .
16 . GETS VOLUNTARY SELF DEFENSE
— not only in the constitution but in Anglo - American political history .
Ron Paul really understands what some do n’t : how central the second amendment is to the notion of a self - reliant , vigilant population .
Especially now , the right to arms may be the only safeguard for citizens who do n’t trust the police to protect them .
That includes minorities who ’ve been on the receiving end of police brutality .
“ Gun control historically serves as a gateway to tyranny .
Tyrants from Hitler to Mao to Stalin have sought to disarm their own citizens , for the simple reason that unarmed people are easier to control .
Our Founders , having just expelled the British army , knew that the right to bear arms serves as the guardian of every other right .
This is the principle so often ignored by both sides in the gun control debate .
Only armed citizens can resist tyrannical government . ”
— “ The D.C. Gun Ban , ” March 12 , 2007 .
In the same spirit Paul also opposes the draft , which allows the privileged and powerful to forcibly deploy less privileged young men as cannon fodder .
“ I believe wholeheartedly that an all - volunteer military is not only sufficient for national defense , but also preferable .
It is time to abolish the Selective Service System and resign military conscription to the dustbin of American history .
Five hundred million dollars have been wasted on Selective Service since 1979 , money that could have been returned to taxpayers or spent to improve the lives of our nation ’s veterans . ”
— “ Rethinking the Draft , ” November 28 , 2006 .
15 . SUPPORTS DECENTRALIZATION
CONSISTENTLY
— by supporting national sovereignty against transnational organizations manipulated by global elites .
With the same consistency , Paul supports the states against the Fed and turns power back to local communities and people , instead of bureaucrats .
“ The superhighway proposal is not the result of free market demand , but rather an extension of government - managed trade schemes like NAFTA that benefit politically connected interests . ”
“ This will require coordinated federal and state eminent domain actions on an unprecedented scale , as literally millions of people and businesses could be displaced .
The loss of whole communities is almost certain , as planners cannot wind the highway around every quaint town , historic building , or senior citizen apartment for thousands of miles . ”
“ The ultimate goal is not simply a superhighway , but an integrated North American Union — complete with a currency , a cross-national bureaucracy , and virtually borderless travel within the Union .
Like the European Union , a North American Union would represent another step toward the abolition of national sovereignty altogether … ”
— “ The NAFTA Superhighway , ” October 30 , 2006 .
“ All federal aid for Katrina should have been distributed as directly as possible to local communities , rather than through wasteful middlemen like FEMA and Homeland Security . ”
— “ Katrina Relief Six Months Later , ” February 21 , 2006 .
That ’s also why Paul is against a national ID :
“ This legislation imposes federal standards in a federal bill , and it creates a federalized ID regardless of whether the ID itself is still stamped with the name of your state .
It is just a matter of time until those who refuse to carry the new licenses will be denied the ability to drive or board an airplane .
Domestic travel restrictions are the hallmark of authoritarian states , not free republics . ”
— “ The Worst Way to Fight Terror , ” October 9 , 2004 .
Increased decentralization is the only way to allow polarizing social issues that are less central to take a back seat to the cardinal issues we face today — of war and economic recession .
Contrary to its depiction by a biased media , Paul ’s pro-life position is only opposed to Federal funding of abortions and stem - cell research .
Nothing stops the states or private entities from funding them – a constitutionally sound position that allows diverse lifestyles and views to flourish without allowing them to tyrannize others .
14 . KNOWS THE TWO - PARTY SYSTEM IS BROKEN
and supports opening up the electoral process to more candidates from the grass roots :
“ The two items I will be introducing on Tuesday embrace rather than disgrace the first amendment .
The first is called the Voter Freedom Act of 1997 .
It will prohibit states from erecting excessive ballot access barriers to candidates for federal office .
The Constitution gives Congress the authority to control federal elections , and I firmly believe that the more voices participating , the more likely it is that the entrenched , out - of - touch , Washington establishment will be swept to the side . ”
“ Another part of this vital process is opening the debates .
So the second piece of legislation I am putting forward is the Debate Freedom Act of 1997 …
My legislation simply requires that if a candidate accepts the federal funding for his or her election , then that candidate can only participate in debates to which all candidates who qualify for federal funding — whether they take it or not — are invited to participate . ”
— “ If someone accepts federal cash , then they must follow rules taxpayers set and deserve , ” September 15 , 1997 .
13 . WILL DECREASE TAXES
and eliminate the bureaucracy strangling small businesses that create jobs and wealth .
Fortunately , in Paul ’s lexicon , wealth does n’t mean the paper - jive of money - sharpers on Wall Street .
It ’s hard work , innovation and savings .
That ’s why Paul is also appropriately wary of the IRS ’s strong - arm tactics with citizens — and elected representatives — for political reasons .
“ Imagine that you have taken a position contrary to the official dictates of the government in your nation .
Instead of simply facing criticism from opposing political sides , you find your life turned upside - down ; every aspect of your life is closely scrutinized .
Without warning , your life savings are seized , your personal , private records divulged far and wide .
Suddenly , how willing are you to continue holding your views ? ”
“ The answer is not to simply revise the code , or to make the IRS more independent , or to have an added layer of judicial review , the answer is to fundamentally change the way we collect taxes in this nation .
The nonsensical body of law which governs the IRS is too far removed from sanity to be saved .
And the graduated income tax system is neither fair , economically sound , moral nor useful .
“ In my mind , the jury is still out on whether a flat tax or a national sales tax is the absolute best way to go ( my main goal is for lower taxes , across - the - board ) , but both will go a long way toward eliminating the politically powerful weapon known as the IRS . ”
— “ Fear of IRS misplaced , the real problem is the system , ” April 20 , 1997 .
12 . BACKS SOUND MONEY
and opposes taxation by inflation .
Paul ’s been speaking out for years against the destruction of the dollar .
He ’s one of the few who sees that cheap credit is destroying savings and retirement money , pushing up the cost of living and devastating US standing in the international economy .
“ But as a physician I know that I must diagnose an illness before I can treat a patient .
In the current instance the diagnoses indicates that the squeeze of the middle class is caused not by low wages , but rather by increased costs resulting from central planning .
And the key pillars of our current central - planning regime can be found in tax and monetary policies .
The fact that government creates money out of thin air must be addressed , because it is the entire reason why costs of living increase and standards of living decline …
Again , there is only one reason why prices are rising instead of falling .
Because the government , through its credit - creation mechanism , is engaged in a sort of price controls , it is in fact following a policy that eventuates in price inflation as well as recession .
Plus , this credit creation is at the heart of recent instability in the markets , thus threatening retirement security . ”
— “ Answering the Middle Class Squeeze , ” March 27 , 2000
“ The biggest rip - off of all — the paper money system that is morally and economically equivalent to counterfeiting — is never questioned .
It is the deceptive tool for transferring billions from the unsuspecting poor and middle - class to the special interest rich .
And in the process , the deficit - propelled budget process supports the spending demands of all the special interests – left and right , welfare and warfare – while delaying payment to another day and sometimes even to another generation . ”
11 UNDERSTANDS THE REAL REASON WHY THE POOR ARE BEING SQUEEZED .
Paul understands the real reason low - wage earners are taking it in the neck .
Instead of pandering like the populists with misplaced price and wage controls , he strikes at the root :
“ Our tax burden is at its highest peacetime levels .
This means wage earners are being squeezed by the cost of government as well as the cost of living .
Had Congress not stopped the Clinton - Gore tax on BTUs , ( which they called an economic stimulus package ) , fuel prices would be significantly higher than they are right now .
This points to why government is not the answer .
Increases in costs of living are a real problem , especially for those at the lower end of the wage scale .
Those costs will continue to rise if we allow central planning to continue , but the solution to central planning is freedom , not grant further control over wages to government . ”
— “ Answering the Middle Class Squeeze , ” March 27 , 2000 .
10 . STANDS UP FOR CIVIL LIBERTIES AND PRIVACY
Paul has consistently fought the kind of federal power grab represented by the creation of a national ID as another expensive , corrupt , abusive government boondoggle .
“ The Freedom and Privacy Restoration Act also contains a blanket prohibition on the use of identifiers to “ investigate , monitor , oversee , or otherwise regulate ” American citizens .
Mr. Chairman , prohibiting the Federal Government from using standard identifiers will ensure that American liberty is protected from the “ surveillance state . ”
Allowing the federal government to use standard identifiers to oversee private transactions present tremendous potential for abuse of civil liberties by unscrupulous government officials .
I am sure I need not remind the members of this Committee of the sad history of government officials of both parties using personal information contained in IRS or FBI files against their political enemies .
Imagine the potential for abuse if an unscrupulous government official is able to access one ’s complete medical , credit , and employment history by simply typing the citizens ’ “ uniform identifier ” into a database . ”
— “ Statement of Ron Paul on the Freedom and Privacy Restoration Act ( HR 220 ) , ” May 18 , 2000 .
“ This legislation gives authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security to expand required information on driver ’s licenses , potentially including such biometric information as retina scans , finger prints , DNA information , and even Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) radio tracking technology .
Including such technology as RFID would mean that the federal government , as well as the governments of Canada and Mexico , would know where Americans are at all time of the day and night .
There are no limits on what happens to the database of sensitive information on Americans once it leaves the United States for Canada and Mexico – or perhaps other countries .
Who is to stop a corrupt foreign government official from selling or giving this information to human traffickers or even terrorists ?
Will this uncertainty make us feel safer ? ”

9. KNOWS CURRENT ENTITLEMENT
PROGRAMS ARE BANKRUPT
“ Those future obligations ( of entitlements ) put our real debt figure at roughly fifty trillion dollars - a staggering sum that is about as large as the total household net worth of the entire United States .
Your share of this fifty trillion amounts to about $ 175,000 .
… If present trends continue , by 2040 the entire federal budget will be consumed by Social Security and Medicare alone .
The only options for balancing the budget would be cutting total federal spending by about 60 % , or doubling federal taxes .
To close the long - term entitlement gap , the U.S. economy would have to grow by double digits every year for the next 75 years . ”

8. HAS THE TECHNICAL SAVVY
to deal with healthcare , where government interference has already created a disaster .
“ The problems with our health - care system are not the result of too little government intervention , but rather too much .
Contrary to the claims of many advocates of increased government regulation of health care , rising costs and red tape do not represent market failure .
Rather , they represent the failure of government policies that have destroyed the health care market . ”
“ As a greater amount of government and corporate money has been used to pay medical bills , costs have risen artificially out of the range of most individuals .
Only true competition assures that the consumer gets the best deal at the best price possible by putting pressure on the providers .
Patients are better served by having options and choices , not new federal bureaucracies and limitations on legal remedies . ”

8. OPPOSES CORPORATE SUBSIDIES
that distort the market and burden tax payers , like the bailout of international speculators with tax payer money in the Mexican and Asian crises in the 1990s .
“ But many investors today are eager to embrace the philosophy of free - market economics when it comes to making money and keeping their profits , but at the first sign of those investments going sour , they want the government to socialize their losses at the expense of the taxpayers .
And since these investors have also heavily “ invested ” in American politics , it is easy for the politicians to use your money to help them out .
After all , it is very easy to be generous with other people ’s money . ”
“ President opts to use taxpayer fund to bail out wealthy investors , ” December 29 , 1997 .
“ For a long time I have advocated getting rid of the Export - Import Bank .
It is unconstitutional for the federal government , using your money , to be subsidizing the risky business ventures of corporations .
And often , these ventures involve giving large sums of money and aid to oppressive foreign governments , like China … Subsidizing big corporations is unconstitutional and violative of the laws of free - market economics , no matter what Congress calls the mechanism .
Those who are addicted to corporate welfare have no need to worry ; USEX will be doing the same thing as Ex - Im . ”

7. OPPOSES THE NEO - LIBERAL GLOBALIST AGENDA
and the charade of aid that funds foreign dictators .
He also understands the dangers of national armies in the service of global international bodies , a position firmly rooted in the ideas of Madison and Jefferson .
And firmly opposed to the deluded “ liberventionism ” of today ’s Trotskyites and humanitarian bombers who fancy themselves as global Supermen
“ Neither , of course , does the Constitution allow us to subsidize foreign governments through such taxpayer - supported entities as the World Bank , the World Trade Organization , OPIC , Ex - Im / USEX or any number of other vehicles through which the U.S. Congress sends foreign aid to a large number of countries ( including those who engage in religious persecution ) .
It is time we stopped both policing the world , and funding the totalitarian thugs of planet . ”
” It is ironic that the same federal government which killed innocent children at Waco for their parents “ odd ” religious beliefs , now proclaims itself ready to judge the world ’s nations on their religious tolerance . ”

6. WILLING TO LOOK FOR OIL IN OTHER PLACES
besides the Middle East ;
Paul is n’t piped at the umbilicus to energy companies or in bed with oil executives , unlike our current crop of carbon - dating fossils .
“ Yes , we need Middle Eastern oil , but we can reduce our need by exploring domestic sources .
We should rid ourselves of the notion that we are at the mercy of the oil - producing countries - as the world ’s largest oil consumer , their wealth depends on our business . ”
— “ Our Incoherent Foreign Policy Fuels Middle East Turmoil , ” December 3 , 2002 .
5. BELIEVES THE US GOVERNMENT SHOULD GOVERN THE US
— not the World .
Wow !
What a revolutionary idea .
“ We should stop the endless game of playing faction against faction , and recognize that buying allies does n’t work .
We should curtail the heavy militarization of the area by ending our disastrous foreign aid payments .
We should stop propping up dictators and putting band - aids on festering problems .
We should understand that our political and military involvement in the region creates far more problems that it solves .
All Americans will benefit , both in terms of their safety and their pocketbooks , if we pursue a coherent , neutral foreign policy of non-interventionism , free trade , and self - determination in the Middle East . ”
— “ Our Incoherent Foreign Policy Fuels Middle East Turmoil , ” December 3 , 2002 .
“ The best reason to oppose interventionism is that people die , needlessly , on both sides .
We have suffered over 20,000 American casualties in Iraq already , and Iraq civilian deaths probably number over 100,000 by all reasonable accounts .
The next best reason is that the rule of law is undermined , especially when military interventions are carried out without a declaration of war .
Whenever a war is ongoing , civil liberties are under attack at home .
The current war in Iraq and the misnamed war on terror have created an environment here at home that affords little constitutional protection of our citizen ’s rights .
Extreme nationalism is common during wars .
Signs of this are now apparent . ”
— “ Iran : The Next Neo-Con Target , ” April 5 , 2006 .
4. STANDS UP TO BIG BROTHER
Paul opposes unconstitutional legislation like the Hate Crimes Bill , not because he does n’t understand the fears of the vulnerable , but because he ’s long - sighted enough to know that the danger of creating a category of thought - crimes outweighs them .
Eventually , hate crime laws always end up making political protest or the expression of religious conscience difficult or impossible .
“ It ’s also disconcerting to hear the subtle or not - so - subtle threats against free speech .
Since the FCC regulates airwaves and grants broadcast licenses , we ’re told it ’s proper for government to forbid certain kinds of insulting or offensive speech in the name of racial and social tolerance .
Never mind the 1st Amendment , which states unequivocally that , “ Congress shall make NO law . ”
— “ Government and Racism , ” April 16 , 2007 .
Paul ’s made it clear that he ’s against regulation of the Internet , one of the last remaining forums for free speech , especially on political matters , and one of the few places you can get independent news .
Think what would happen if that freedom disappeared too .
“ I trust the Internet a lot more , and I trust the freedom of expression .
And that ’s why we should never interfere with the Internet .
That ’s why I ’ve never voted to regulate the Internet . ”
— “ California Republican debate transcript , ” May 7 , 2007 .
3. IS RIGHT ABOUT TERRORISM
Unlike most of our representatives , Paul looks like he actually reads what US intelligence ( and just about every other intelligence service in the world ) has been saying about terrorism for years :
“ Consider Saudi Arabia , the native home of most of the September 11th hijackers .
The Saudis , unlike the Iraqis , have proven connections to al Qaeda .
Saudi charities have funneled money to Islamic terrorist groups .
Yet the administration insists on calling Saudi Arabia a “ good partner in the war on terror . ”
Why ?
Because the U.S. has a long standing relationship with the Saudi royal family , and a long history of commercial interests relating to Saudi oil .
So successive administrations continue to treat the Saudis as something they are not : a reliable and honest friend in the Middle East .
The same is true of Pakistan , where General Musharaf seized power by force in a 1999 coup .
The Clinton administration quickly accepted his new leadership as legitimate , to the dismay of India and many Muslim Pakistanis .
Since 9/11 , we have showered Pakistan with millions in foreign aid , ostensibly in exchange for Musharaf ’s allegiance against al Qaeda .
Yet has our new ally rewarded our support ?
Hardly .
The Pakistanis almost certainly have harbored bin Laden in their remote mountains , and show little interest in pursuing him or allowing anyone else to pursue him .
Pakistan has signed peace agreements with Taliban leaders , and by some accounts bin Laden is a folk hero to many Pakistanis . ”

2. IS RIGHT ABOUT THE IRAQ WAR
Horses go before carts , says Ron Paul in his revolutionary way .
“ What is the moral argument for attacking a nation that has not initiated aggression against us , and could not if it wanted ? ”
“ Why are we taking precious military and intelligence resources away from tracking down those who did attack the United States — and who may again attack the United States — and using them to invade countries that have not attacked the United States ? ”
“ Was former CIA counter - terrorism chief Vincent Cannistraro wrong when he recently said there is no confirmed evidence of Iraq ’s links to terrorism ? ”
“ Is it not true that the CIA has concluded there is no evidence that a Prague meeting between 9/11 hijacker Atta and Iraqi intelligence took place ? ”
“ Where does the Constitution grant us permission to wage war for any reason other than self - defense ? ”
” Is it not true that a war against Iraq rejects the sentiments of the time - honored Treaty of Westphalia , nearly 400 years ago , that countries should never go into another for the purpose of regime change ? ”
” Is it not true that the more civilized a society is , the less likely disagreements will be settled by war ? ”
” Is it not true that since World War II Congress has not declared war and - not coincidentally - we have not since then had a clear - cut victory ? ”
— “ Questions That Wo n’t Be Asked About Iraq , ” September 10 , 2002 .
1. IS RIGHT ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS
Ron Paul ’s America is the old Constitutional Republic not the new - fangled Empire .
He ’s consistently stood up for the Bill of Rights against an arrogant executive and supine Congress who ’ve sold them out to jack up their own power at home and abroad :
“ It is with the complicity of Congress that we have become a nation of pre-emptive war , secret military tribunals , torture , rejection of habeas corpus , warrantless searches , undue government secrecy , extraordinary renditions , and uncontrolled spying on the American people .
Fighting over there has nothing to do with preserving freedoms here at home . ”
— “ Getting Iraq War Funding Wrong Again , ” May 1 , 2007 .
“ It is clear , however , that the Patriot Act expands the government ’s ability to monitor us .
The Act eases federal rules for search warrants in some cases ; allows expanded wiretaps and Internet monitoring ; allows secret “ sneak and peek ” searches ; and even permits federal agents to examine library and bookstore records .
On these grounds alone it should be soundly rejected . ”
— “ Trust Us , We ’re the Government , ” August 26 , 2003 .
“ We should remember that Iran , like Iraq , is a third - world nation without a significant military .
Nothing in history hints that she is likely to invade a neighboring country , let alone do anything to America or Israel .
I am concerned , however , that a contrived Gulf of Tonkin - type incident may occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran . ”
— “ The Irrelevance of Military Victory , ” January 16 , 2007 .
Disclosure : Since publication of this article , it appears likely that Ron Paul will supply a blurb for my upcoming book .
The United States made a disastrous miscalculation when it started automatically trying youthful offenders as adults instead of handling them through the juvenile courts .
Prosecutors argued that the policy would get violent predators off the streets and deter further crime .
But a new federally backed study shows that juveniles who do time as adults later commit more violent crime than those who are handled through the juvenile courts .
The study , published last month in The American Journal of Preventive Medicine , was produced by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services , an independent research group with close ties to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
After an exhaustive survey of the literature , the group determined that the practice of transferring children into adult courts was counterproductive , actually creating more crime than it cured .
A related and even more disturbing study by Campaign for Youth Justice in Washington finds that the majority of the more than 200,000 children a year who are treated as adults under the law come before the courts for nonviolent offenses that could be easily and more effectively dealt with at the juvenile court level .
Examples include a 17 - year - old first - time offender charged with robbery after stealing another student ’s gym clothes , and another 17 - year - old who violated his probation by stealing a neighbor ’s bicycle .
Many of these young nonviolent offenders are held in adult prisons for months or even years .
Solutions for Saving the Planet and Humanity
Let 's face reality .
Earth is going to be the first planet terraformed .
The human race is killing our planet by flooding land , sea , and air with pollution and by over use .
Plants and animals are unable to adapt quickly enough to the changes in the environment that mankind is causing .
The Earth is becoming less capable of sustaining the world 's population .
Even humanity is at risk of becoming extinct because of the long term effects of global warming .
Here are my recommendations of what has to be done to save both the planet and humanity .
Recycle everything !
Instead of having our trash sent to landfills , everything that people consume and eventually throw out must be recycled .
Therefore , we need recycling plants for batteries , electronics , organic ( food and garden ) wastes , medals , etc. in addition to recycling paper , plastic , glass , and aluminum .
Even existing landfills need to be recycled .
You can find out about different ways to recycle landfills from this article .
Pollution Free Energy !
Right now this is impossible , but I have faith in science to one day make this a reality .
Reducing energy utilization , such as energy efficient light bulbs , cars , and washing machines will not solve this problem ; but only delay this problem from being solved as soon as possible .
You can read more about possible pollution free energy sources that could be cost effective from this article .
Population Control .
Right now , the Earth can not sustain the existing human population indefinitely , and this is not including the current population growth .
As a result , the world 's resources are quickly dwindling without replacements .
The only logical solution to this problem is population control .
Since the world can not indefinitely support the entire human population , then the world 's population needs to decrease to a level so that the planet can sustain both humanity and wildlife indefinitely .
Renewable Resources .
Humanity is currently consuming more resources than the planet can renew , and this does not include non-renewable resources such as oil .
Therefore , business will eventually have to convert to strictly self sustainable and renewable resources in the near future .
Environmental Protection .
The human race is destroying vast regions of the planet , so much so that the planet 's ability of supporting life is decreasing .
Throughout the world , forests and wild lands must no longer be allowed to be destroyed for human development , and this still may not be enough to support all wildlife .
Land that has become infertile because of man 's actions , such as strip mining and deforestation , must be revived by law .
The world 's oceans also need to be globally managed , since the world 's fish population is suffering from over fishing .
It is estimated that the world 's oceans will no longer be commercially useful for fishing between 2030 and 2060 .
Even air pollution needs to be completely regulated until all air is clean and remains that way .
Manage Global Warming .
Global warming is going to decimate the human civilization if left unchecked .
The four previous solutions above will help slow down global warming , but they will not prevent global warming .
Therefore , further actions must be necessary to either prevent or manage global warming .
For instance , when the world 's oceans start to rise because the polar ice caps are melting , it will be necessary to intentionally flood large portions of land to prevent the world 's ocean from destroying coastal cities and farmland .
One way to help do this is to redirect rivers to not deposit their water into the oceans but into lakes , valleys , canyons , aquifers , empty oil fields , and where ever else possible .
Another solution is to use seawater to flood large sections of unused land , such as deserts .
These solutions will definitely have major consequences , but those consequences will hopefully not include the uncontrolled destruction of cities and countless lives .
These solutions for saving the planet and humanity will not be popular , but nothing is more important than the survival of the human race and Earth .
The first step of addressing these issues is having your help to educate our world leaders of the risks to humanity and the planet .
The second step is to educate our leaders about the possible solutions for these problems .
And finally in the next few years , when our world leaders make these very difficult decisions in order to save the planet , please support these radical solutions .
These solutions will have to be truly global initiatives that all governments must support otherwise the solutions may not be enough .
Therefore everyone in the world must support these solutions .

The Republicans are , I believe , making a gigantic mistake in running away , scared , from the internet .
They ’re running away from voters — and their money .
The latest indication of their fear of the internet is their attempt to fink out on the YouTube / CNN Republican debate .
The party line — as we see from Rush and others — is that YouTube is somehow biased .
That ’s absurd .
That would be like the Democrats saying that mail is biased because the Republicans made the first , best use of it .
If internet video is biased it is a damned bad sign for the right and mighty strange considering the leading work done in the medium by the conservatives in the UK , France , and Germany .
Hugh Hewitt frets that listening to YouTube will open up Republicans to cheap shots .
That ’s merely convenient paranoia .
They ’re looking for excuses to stay away from this dance .
The Republicans are scared of the internet .
They are scared of us .
Giuliani has , as this blog as pointed out frequently , run away from the internet and interacting with voters there at every opportunity :
It shows in his pathetic internet fundraising .
Patrick Ruffini , former Giuliani internet guy ( we can see why that ’s former ) frets that the Republicans will be outraised by $ 100 million because of this attitude .
Meanwhile , Mitt Romney is sniffing snottily at the quality of the questions on YouTube … from citizens .
John McCain has been stiff and scared in his videos .
Sam Brownback has hardly made any videos and the ones he has made are as stiff as a Kansas silo .
The entire party has left the internet to Ron Paul .
And he has taken it and run .
In the end , this is not only short - sighted tactically but also essentially insulting to the American people .
We are on the internt .
Come talk with us .
What , you ’re too scared to ?
Big , tough terrorists do n’t scare you but we do ?
Come on , boys , we do n’t bite .
But we do vote .

Q You spoke very soberly and seriously in your statement about how you weighed different legal questions in coming to your decision on that commutation .
But one issue that you did not address was the issue of the morality of your most senior advisors leaking the name of a confidential intelligence operator .
Now that the case is over -- it 's not something you 've ever spoken to -- can you say whether you 're at all disappointed in the behavior of those senior advisors ?
And have you communicated that disappointment to them in any way ?
THE PRESIDENT : Michael , I -- first of all , the Scooter Libby decision was , I thought , a fair and balanced decision .
Secondly , I have n't spent a lot of time talking about the testimony that people throughout my administration were forced to give as a result of the special prosecutor .
I did n't ask them during the time and I have n't asked them since .
I 'm aware of the fact that perhaps somebody in the administration did disclose the name of that person , and I 've often thought about what would have happened had that person come forth and said , I did it .
Would we have had this , you know , endless hours of investigation and a lot of money being spent on this matter ?
But it 's been a tough issue for a lot of people in the White House , and it 's run its course and now we 're going to move on .
Bush wants to just move along little doggy .
Nothing to see here anymore .
Bush already paid for Scooter 's silence so do n't bother him anymore about it .
He admits that someone in his administration leaked Valerie Plame 's name and he did nothing about it when he said he would fire anyone who was a leaker .
Bush was probably trying to shift the blame to Armitage , but we know Rove leaked her name .. What about him ?
It shifts the focus from Rove , who discussed Plame with two reporters and whose recollections were complex enough that he made five grand jury visits .
And Rover is trying to revise history on his involvement in the case too ... Gee , what a surprise .
And then there 's Cheney 's hand prints all over the place that Bush knew about ...
Hell , Tony Snow would n't admit one way or the other if Dick talked to Bush about the commutation ......

The Foreign Office reportedly asked politicians and diplomats to drop the phrase last year .
But Mr Benn 's open criticism surprised many observers , and critics suggested he might be attempting to woo grassroots Labour activists in his bid for the party 's deputy leadership - an accusation he later described as " unworthy " .
" In the UK , we do not use the phrase ' war on terror ' because we can't win by military means alone , and because this is n't us against one organised enemy with a clear identity and a coherent set of objectives , " he told a meeting in New York organised by the Centre on International Cooperation .
" It is the vast majority of the people in the world - of all nationalities and faiths - against a small number of loose , shifting and disparate groups who have relatively little in common apart from their identification with others who share their distorted view of the world and their idea of being part of something bigger .
What these groups want is to force their individual and narrow values on others without dialogue , without debate , through violence .
And by letting them feel part of something bigger , we give them strength . "
He said " hard power " was not enough : " It can certainly win the battle , but without soft power we cannot win the war that will deliver better governance , sustainable peace and lasting prosperity . "
Tony Blair 's spokesman said he was unsure when the prime minister had last used the term , adding : " We all use our own phraseology . "
He said Mr Blair believed that " in fighting terrorism you should both use military means where necessary but also political means as well " .
Michael Moore , the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , said : " The so - called ' war on terror ' has always been a flawed concept .
Many will be cynical about Hilary Benn waiting until he is running for deputy leader of the Labour party before making these comments . "
US sources played down Mr Benn 's criticism .
David Johnson , deputy chief of mission at the US embassy , told Radio 4's PM programme : " Mr Benn makes an important point we not only do not disagree on , but embrace : the solution will come not just with military force but development and working with other governments . "

There are dozens of ways to hook up DVD players for in car viewing .
A few of them even have recommended configurations for playing video games from passenger seating .
None of the in car entertainment solutions offer a way to connect to online gaming services like Xbox Live .
Brandon Wirtz and I decided to fix that by building the ultimate in - car Xbox Live gaming experience .
With Brandon driving his Jeep and me in the back with a video camera , we captured the whole experience of Brandon ’s roommate , Rose , playing Rainbow 6 Las Vegas and Uno ( with Xbox Live Vision ) while driving around Mountain View .
One of the things I love about being in Mountain View , California this winter is free WiFi from Google .
The entire city has WiFi provided by Google .
My permanent home in Seattle may have a Starbucks on every corner , but their WiFi still has gaps between stores .
A citywide network like the one Google configured creates a number of possibilities for projects that require a persistent network connection .
When you have too much WiFi and too much free time , you get a project like the one Brandon and I did this weekend .
We outfitted Brandon ’s new Jeep Wrangler Rubicon with a 23 - inch Samsung HDTV and an Xbox connected to Google WiFi via my laptop , ala my Xbox 360 wireless connection sharing tip .
We rigged up the HDTV screen to the back of the passenger seat using one of those flat wall mount kits , which was then zip - tied to the headrest .
That was a surprisingly easy way to get a secure fit for the screen .
Everything was powered by two power inverters .
As you ’ll see if you watch the video , we could have powered the HDTV screen and the Xbox 360 off of the same 400 - watt power interver .
The laptop we used for the Internet connection ran off of battery power , although we could have easily powered it from an intverter as well .
If you had none of the parts , the whole thing , including laptop , Xbox 360 , Xbox 360 camera , HDTV and intverters would likely cost around $ 4000 to setup .
If you already have a laptop , Xbox 360 , etc , you could re-create our setup for the cost of a screen and mounting plate .
Spouse acceptance factor on this project is likely very low , but the wow factor may be worth the grief .
Bill Moyers ran a special last night on PBS that examined the separation of church and state in the context of Pat Robertson 's Regent University School of Law and its mission of " bring[ing ] to bear the will of our Creator , Almighty God , upon legal education and the legal profession . "
Moyers paints a stark picture of a law school and a religious leader that are having a profound effect on the American system of law and government .
Seeing Regent 's newly graduated students talk about the philosophy they intend to bring to the practice of law ( and most likely to the federal government ) is frightening to anyone who appreciates the traditional notion of the separation between church and state .

O'Reilly likes to spout off about how radical and dangerous George Soros is to this country , but look what happens when you take his " Talking Points " and replace Soros and the left with Robertson and the right :
[ F ] ar right Evangelist Pat Robertson is buying political influence in America in an unprecedented way .
Robertson is pouring tens of millions of dollars into far right Internet sites and organizations designed to intimidate Republican politicians and advance his radical right agenda .
At the center of this cluster is the notorious Christian Coalition , which has received at least $ 5 million from Robertson himself and an unknown amount from organizations he funds .
Does n't take a Jerry Falwell to figure out that Robertson now has direct access to the most powerful Republicans in the nation .
And now Robertson has set his sights on the political landscape here in America .
He has his character assassins lined up .
He has the Christian Coalition ready to move out .
And he has direct access to the highest levels of our government .
Although BillO never articulates exactly what Soros 's " far - left agenda " entails , it 's pretty clear what Pat Robertson 's " far - right agenda " is :
To move America closer to a Christian theocracy that lives under under Biblical law ; not secular Constitutional law .
To any rational person , Robertson and the religious right are a far greater threat to American values and system of government than Soros could ever be .

Testimonies taken by B'Tselem reveal that during the army 's operation in Nablus in late February , soldiers used two Palestinian children , a fifteen - year - old boy and a eleven - year - old girl , and a twenty - four - year old man as human shields .
The use of human shields constitutes a flagrant breach of international humanitarian law and is explicitly and clearly prohibited by Israeli military orders .
B'Tselem wrote to the Judge Advocate General and demanded that he immediately order a Military Police investigation into the matter .
The military operation , which was given the name " Hot Winter , " began on 25 February , and was intended " to undermine the terror infrastructure " in Nablus , in part by arresting wanted persons and destroying explosives laboratories .
The army imposed a complete curfew for more than two consecutive days on the Old City ( the Casbah ) , in which tens of thousands of Palestinians live .
One person , who went up to his roof during the curfew , was shot and killed by soldiers , and his son was wounded .
According to the testimonies , on the first day of the operation , around five o'clock in the morning , soldiers came to the house of the ' Amirah family , in the Old City , and removed all the occupants from the house and took them to a nearby house , where other Palestinians were also being held .
Then the soldiers ordered one of the family , 15 - year old ' Amid to accompany them in their search of three other houses .
According to ' Amid 's testimony , the soldiers pushed him with the barrels of their rifles and forced him to enter rooms of the house in front of them , open cabinets and empty out the contents , and open windows .
In one instance , according to the testimony , a soldier shot several shots into the room .
Other soldiers took ' Amid 's cousin , Samah ' Amirah , 24 , and used him as a human shield in a similar fashion .
Part of this incident was recorded on by AP television cameras and broadcast both on Israeli television and abroad .
' Amirah was forced to enter every room in his house , while soldiers followed him .
Afterwards a soldier would shoot a round of bullets into each room .
In another incident , which took place on the morning of 28 February , also in the Old City , soldiers took control of the Dadush family house and locked the six members of the family in one room of the house .
Throughout the day , soldiers interrogated all of the members of the family about the location of armed Palestinians who fired at soldiers in the area during the operation .
Around eight o'clock at night , soldiers forced eleven - year old Jihan Dadush to lead them twice to one of the adjacent houses that she had mentioned to the soldiers in response to their questions .
The second time , when they arrived at the house , the soldiers forced her to open the door and enter in front of them .
After combing the inside of the house , the soldiers returned her to her house .
In her testimony to B'Tselem , Jihan said that after the soldiers left , " I was shaking with fear .
I was afraid they would kill me or put me in jail .
The only thing I wanted to do was sleep '
I am afraid that the soldiers will come back and take me . "
The picture that emerges from the testimonies , and particularly the description of the firing into the rooms in the testimonies of ' Amid and Samach ' Amirah , indicate that the soldiers feared the houses they searched hid armed militants or that explosives had been planted in them .
In other words , the mission the two minors and the adult were forced to conduct undoubtedly included an element of danger and it seems clear that the soldiers were aware of this .
In its letter to the Judge Advocate General , B'Tselem pointed out that this was the fourth time since June 2006 ( when " Operation Summer Rains , " in Gaza , took place ) , that the organization had documented Israeli soldiers ' use of Palestinian civilians as human shields .
As far as B'Tselem knows , in only one of these cases did the JAG order a Military Police investigation .
That investigation has not yet been completed .
In light of these cases , B'Tselem expressed its concern that the military order prohibiting this practice is not property communicated to soldiers , and that the delay in investigating these incidents conveys a message of lenience in the military 's treatment of soldiers who engage in such practices .
Legal background
International Humanitarian Law , which establishes the rules applying during armed conflict , requires the sides to distinguish between combatants and civilians , and requires them to protect the lives and dignity of civilians .
The Fourth Geneva Convention specifies that civilians " are entitled , in all circumstances , to respect for their persons , their honor ...
They shall at all times be humanely treated , and shall be protected especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof ' " ( Article 27 )
As a result of this duty to protect the lives and honor of civilians , the Convention explicitly prohibits the use of civilians as human shields by placing them in a way that renders certain points or areas immune from attack ( Article 28 ) .
The official commentary of the Convention refers to this practice , which was common during the Second World War , as " cruel and barbaric . "
The Convention also prohibits the use of physical or moral coercion of civilians , and forcing them to take part in military tasks ( Articles 31 and 51 , respectively ) .
Furthermore , the IHL determines that , during armed conflict , children under the age of fifteen are entitled to special protection by the parties to the conflict , in addition to those provided to all civilians .
The use of children under this age to carry out military tasks is a war crime under international criminal law .
Despite these prohibitions , for a long time after the second intifada began , in September 2000 , and especially during " Operation Defensive Shield , " in April 2002 , Israeli soldiers routinely used Palestinian civilians as human shields by forcing them to carry out life - threatening military tasks .
It was only following a High Court petition against this practice , which was filed by human rights organizations in May 2002 , that the IDF issued a general order prohibiting the use of Palestinians as " a means of ' human shield ' against gunfire or attacks by the Palestinian side . "
Following the order , the use of human shields dropped sharply .
However , the army did not construe as a human shield the use of Palestinians , provided they consented , " to deliver a warning " to a wanted person entrenched in a certain location .
The army continued the widespread use of this practice , which they referred to as " the neighbor procedure . "
Following another petition filed by human rights organizations , the High Court of Justice ruled that this practice , too , violated international humanitarian law and that it was thus illegal .
Scientists at the Paul Drude Institute for Solid State Electronics in Berlin , Germany , have assembled single atoms of different elements , thus forming nanostructures of predefined size and composition .
The team lead by Stefan Foelsch used copper ( Cu ) and cobalt ( Co ) atoms to produce pairs or various chains of atoms on a substrate surface made of crystalline copper .
“ We manipulated the atoms in a low - temperature scanning tunneling microscope ” , says Stefan Foelsch .
He adds : “ We found that the quantum effects in these structures can be understood within the framework of textbook physics describing the electronic properties of simple molecules . ”
Thus , it is possible to taylor “ artificial molecules ” supported by a solid surface made of magnetic and non-magnetic elements .
The nanostructures engineered and characterized constitute a promising model for future investigations in order to gain insight into the magnetism of the smallest structures .
Stefan Foelsch says that this is an issue of utmost technological relevance .
The scientists report on their work in Physical Review Letters ( J. Lagoute et al. : „ Doping of monatomic Cu chains with single Co atoms “ , published online on April 6 ) .
For many women , a birth control pill that eliminates monthly menstruation might seem a welcome milestone .
But others view their periods as fundamental symbols of fertility and health , researchers have found .
Rather than loathing their periods , women evidently carry on complex love - hate relationships with them .
This ambivalence is one reason that a decision expected next month by the Food and Drug Administration has engendered controversy .
The agency is expected to approve the first contraceptive pill that is designed to eliminate periods as long as a woman takes it .
Doctors say they know of no extra risk to the new regimen , but some women are uneasy about the idea .
“ My concern is that the menstrual cycle is an outward sign of something that ’s going on hormonally in the body , ” said Christine L. Hitchcock , a researcher at the University of British Columbia .
Ms. Hitchcock said she worries about “ the idea that you can turn your body on and off like a tap . ”

The fateful night we chose to make sweet love for the first time was a spontaneous night , otherwise we probably woud n't have celebrated the impending consummation at BK .
Even so , we were excited .
So in love .
I played with your package under the table .
We ran home , panties were ripped , life was good .
Little did I know , Satan had plans for me that night .
Not content to let me enjoy our hedonistic debauchery , he stood over the bed , pitchfork in one hand , a heinous strand of stomach flu in the other hand .
A strand of flu that did not mix well with BK chicken sandwiches .
You fell asleep right away , I dozed until I was compelled to run to the bathroom .
I prayed that you would stay asleep through the terrible scene that ensued .
Several courtesy flushes later , I could only hope that you were not awake , since the bathroom is connected to your bedroom .
As I sat on the toilet , I hoped that I would n't throw up .
For some reason I can handle poo but I have a morbid fear of vomit .
I sat with my ass on fire when I got the dreaded " feeling " .
The " cold , then hot , sweating , mouth watering , I 'm going to puke right this second and possibly pass out " feeling .
With my pants still around my ankles , I stood up to puke , but the puke did n't wait until I was fully turned around and positioned over the toilet .
It flew out of my mouth , Exorcist - style all over the glass shower door right next to the toilet .
And behind the toilet .
And all over the toilet itself - although very little actually went into the bowl .
After 30 seconds of puking , I stood , shaking and breathless , realizing I had n't pulled my hair back when I puked .
My hair was full of chicken sandwich .
Obviously I 'm not an expert at vomiting .
Now here 's where retrospect comes into the picture again .
In retrospect , having decided to go to the sink to wash the puke off of my face and out of my hair , I should have done the following two things :
1. Pulled up my pants before walking to the sink2 .
Shut the bathroom doorBeing sick and apparently out of my right mind , I did neither .
I waddled over to the sink with my pants around my ankles , and started splashing water on my face .
That 's when Satan struck his final blow and I began to uncontrollably vomit into the sink , which would have been okay if I had n't simultaneously lost all bowel control and sent projectile diarrhea all over your bathroom door behind me and the rug beneath me .
Was it entirely necessary for you to wake up at precisely that moment and come in to check on me ?
From the look on your face , the image that greeted you was far from pleasant : a deranged woman with puke in her hair , pants around her ankles , shit on the door behind her and on the rug under her , vomit sprayed on the shower door and behind the toilet , vomit in the sink .
Your look expressed many things : shock , disgust , confusion .... how had the hot , sexy woman you had just had sex with deteriorated while you slept ?
I wanted to tell you that it was all a dream , a bad , bad dream that you would wake from and never remember , but I could n't .
I was too busy trying to pull up my pants while slamming the door in your face .
My rants : Burger King chicken sandwiches , Satan , the flu , and fucking retrospect .
When stars are more massive than about 8 times the Sun , they end their lives in a spectacular explosion called a supernova .
The outer layers of the star are hurtled out into space at thousands of miles an hour , leaving a debris field of gas and dust .
Where the star once was located , a small , incredibly dense object called a neutron star is often found .
While only 10 miles or so across , the tightly packed neutrons in such a star contain more mass than the entire Sun .
A new X - ray image shows the 2,000 year - old - remnant of such a cosmic explosion , known as RCW 103 , which occurred about 10,000 light years from Earth .
In Chandra 's image , the colors of red , green , and blue are mapped to low , medium , and high - energy X - rays .
At the center , the bright blue dot is likely the neutron star that astronomers believe formed when the star exploded .
For several years astronomers have struggled to understand the behavior of the this object , which exhibits unusually large variations in its X - ray emission over a period of years .
New evidence from Chandra implies that the neutron star near the center is rotating once every 6.7 hours , confirming recent work from XMM - Newton .
This is much slower than a neutron star of its age should be spinning .
One possible solution to this mystery is that the massive progenitor star to RCW 103 may not have exploded in isolation .
Rather , a low - mass star that is too dim to see directly may be orbiting around the neutron star .
Gas flowing from this unseen neighbor onto the neutron star might be powering its X - ray emission , and the interaction of the magnetic field of the two stars could have caused the neutron star to slow its rotation .
A few items that caught my attention : the decline ( starting in the 1930s ) of the importance of Dividend income which was replaced in part by " Entrepreneurial " income then Capitals Gains and finally in the 60s by Wages .
Also in the 70s and 80s Interest income becomes more important no doubt due to the high interest rates during those decades .
The income data can be found on Emmanuel Saez 's web site .
FIC has announced the official availability of the OpenMoko Neo1973 smartphone developer handsets .
The OpenMoko project was first announced by FIC last year with the goal of creating a comprehensive open - source software platform for touchscreen mobile phone devices .
The hackable Neo1973 handset — which features a 2.8 inch touchscreen , a 266 Mhz ARM processor , and WiFi — is the first phone designed to run the OpenMoko software platform .
The currently available models , which are missing a handful of features and are n't intended for regular day - to - day use , are essentially prototypes for developers who want to get a head start on building software for the platform .
Unlike the final release models , which will be available in October , the prototype units lack WiFi support and do n't have built - in accelerometers .
The Neo Base model , which sells for $ 300 , comes with a battery , stylus , headset , charger , a pair of MicroSD cards , and a USB cable .
The Neo Advanced kit , which sells for $ 450 , also includes a debug board , a Torx screwdriver , and ... a guitar pick — supposedly for opening the phone casing .
The Linux - based OpenMoko software platform , which is still in " pre-alpha " stage according to FIC , uses Xorg , the Matchbox window manager , the GTK toolkit , and other components of the GNOME mobile and embedded software platform .
In some respects , the OpenMoko software stack is similar to Nokia 's Tablet OS , which is used on the N800 .
The OpenMoko software platform is very flexible , and independent open - source software developers have experimentally succeeded in attempts to make it run on other hardware , including a Treo 650 .
FIC says that three more devices based on OpenMoko are scheduled for release in the coming year .
The company also reveals that it has reorganized its mobile technology division to focus entirely on open - source products .
" For the people pushing this project , an open phone is not really even a product .
It 's the very embodiment of our vision of technology , " says FIC product manager Sean Moss - Pultz .
" We absolutely , passionately , believe that something as fundamental to our lives as the mobile phone must be open . "
As an open platform with a growing community of developers , OpenMoko could eventually benefit from an extremely broad ecosystem of powerful third - party software applications .
The key to success hinges on FIC 's capacity to collaborate with the broader GNOME and Linux communities in order to ensure that a glide path exists between the GNOME desktop and the OpenMoko platform .
If FIC can work closely with the Maemo project to ensure ease of portability , it seems likely that the Neo1973 and subsequent OpenMoko mobile devices will be successful .
As a GTK developer myself , I find the Neo1973 highly compelling , but I plan to wait until the final release model is available in October before picking one up for myself .
For those of you who want to experiment with OpenMoko development without buying a handset , instructions for testing OpenMoko on a PC are available at the OpenMoko wiki .
The Bush administration warned Saudi Arabia , until this year one of its closest allies , to stop undermining the Iraqi prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and the defence secretary , Robert Gates , are scheduled to visit Jeddah next week .
Reflecting the deteriorating relationship , the US made public claims that the Saudis have been distributing fake documents lying about Mr Maliki .
The Bush administration , as well as the British government , is telling the Saudis , so far without success , that establishing a stable government in Iraq is in their interest and that they stand to suffer if it collapses .
Relations have been strained since King Abdullah unexpectedly criticised the US , describing the Iraq invasion as " an illegal foreign occupation " .
That was the first sign of a rift between the two , who have enjoyed a solid relationship for decades , based on Saudi 's vast oil reserves .
At a briefing , the state department spokesman , Sean McCormack , did not refer directly to US frustration with Saudi , beyond saying that Ms Rice and Mr Gates , on their trip to the region , " will be wanting more active , positive support for Iraq and the Iraqi people " .
The British government , which retains a close relationship with the Saudis , shares many of the US 's concerns about Riyadh 's role in Iraq but , unlike Washington , is unwilling to go public .
A Foreign Office spokesman said yesterday : " We have always encouraged the Saudis to participate in the political process in Iraq .
Saudi Arabia has a crucial role to play and the Saudis recognise the success of the whole project for the region 's stability . "
The US claims the Saudi royal family is offering financial support to coreligionist Sunni groups in Iraq opposed to Mr Maliki 's Shia - led government .
In a graphic example of the tension , Zalmay Khalilzad , until recently the US ambassador to Baghdad , protested to the Saudis over fake documents distributed in Baghdad which claimed Mr Maliki was an Iranian agent and had tipped off the radical Shia cleric , Moqtada al - Sadr , about a US crackdown on his Madhi army militia .
Mr Khalilzad , who is now US ambassador to the UN , wrote in the New York Times last week : " Several of Iraq 's neighbours - not only Syria and Iran but also some friends of the United States - are pursuing destabilising policies . "
The Bush administration is also expressing its unhappiness with the Saudis for failing to stem the flow of Saudi jihadists across its border to fight in Iraq , often as suicide bombers .
The US estimates that about 40 % of the 60 to 80 foreign fighters entering Iraq each month are from Saudi Arabia .
The administration , like Britain , is still dependent on oil from Saudi and until now has been reluctant to go public about the increasing differences with the kingdom .
Other causes of tension include Saudi support for Hamas in Gaza and lack of support for a US Israel - Palestinian peace plan .
' You may laugh ... "
People are fond of beginning sentences with these words when they mean quite the opposite .
What follows tends to suggest that you really may not laugh at all .
You may laugh , a person might say , but she 's having it amputated next week .
You may laugh , but the smell will never come out of that carpet .
I recently found myself tacitly reprimanded in this way after it had emerged that the chaps accused of crashing that environmentally unfriendly Jeep Cherokee into Glasgow airport had failed to measure the width of said sports utility vehicle , resulting in its not being able to get through the doors , as they are alleged to have intended it to .
For heaven 's sake , I said to an acquaintance .
It 's not exactly brain surgery .
Not five minutes later , it emerged that one of the suspects is in fact a brain surgeon .
Blimey , I gabbled on .
You would n't want to be a former patient of his today , waking up and discovering that some guy who can't master a tape measure was the one tinkering around with your synapses a few months ago .
You'd be marching straight back in and demanding to be opened up again .
I want every piece of that halfwit 's work checked over , you'd be screaming , by someone who 's at least familiar with basic fricking metric units of distance .
You may laugh , my acquaintance replied , but think of the carnage they could have caused .
What a brilliant point , I was tempted to respond in the drippingly sarcastic tone normally reserved for discussions with the council 's parking suspensions department .
Do you know , until you said it , the thought simply had n't occurred .
After all , it 's not as if one has spent much of the last six years dreading the advent of every news bulletin , on account of the fact that some fresh hell will have opened up somewhere in the world , and Hieronymus Boschean visions of whatever human misery is playing out in it will be beamed straight into one 's living room , causing one 's increasingly terrified self to wonder whether 9 am is too early for a drink if one promises to include a mixer .
Do excuse my failure to glimpse the bigger picture .
I did n't say this , alas .
I took my rebuke .
And this week , as the July 21 bomb plot trial came to an end , I suspect similar censure will attend any attempt to prick the sheer common or garden pomposity of your average terrorist .
The discovery that most kitchen cabinets contain products capable of destroying an underground train is obviously hideous .
But when some despicable bungler fails to detonate their chapatti flour , it is apparently not OK to mark either one 's relief , or one 's anger at this vile creature , by taking the mickey .
This blanket po-facedness can't be right .
George Bush is fair game , but these idiots are n't ?
If seriousness is insisted upon , then one can seriously argue that it is precisely this sort of misplaced reverence that allows a murderer to become a soldier , or a freedom fighter , in the popular imagination .
Yet there is so much to find absurd .
Consider , for instance , all those al - Qaida training videos .
Why do wannabe terrorists bother scrambling on their tummies under all those rope nets in the shadow of the Hindu Kush ?
No disrespect , but all their eventual mission will involve is setting fire to their trainers in an aisle seat once the captain has switched the seatbelts sign off and the crew have commenced their in - flight service .
Seems an awful waste of a fortnight in Pakistan to have spent it practising for some Junior Action Man contest that will never happen .
The 72 virgins are guaranteed .
You do n't need to get all buff to attract them .
For a perfect example of the importance of mick - taking , we need look no further than Team America : World Police , the screamingly funny puppet movie by the creators of South Park , which in keeping with the latter TV show really strives for equal opportunities offensiveness .
The film manages to insult everyone from the US government to Hans Blix , lefty Hollywood actors to people who really respect the musical Rent , and Kim Jong - il ...
Oh , Kim Jong -il !
I now ca n't see a picture of the Dear Leader without hearing him speak in the same voice as South Park 's Cartman , screeching such gems as " When you see Arec Barrwin , you see the true ugriness of human nature ! "
It does n't make the old boy seem any less dangerous .
But it removes his aura of what you might call evil dignity , the veneer that attaches itself to our real - life bad guys unless we laugh at them .
The worst thing we can do is confuse such debunking with a lack of respect for the victims of terrorism .
Rather , it is a refusal to dignify the common criminals who killed them .
Poking fun at terrorists is far more than gallows humour , valuable though that wonderfully human device is in times of such dehumanising danger .
It is possible to simultaneously acknowledge how vile and dangerous these would - be murderers are , but to avoid flattering them with the kind of reverence you 'd afford bleeding Delta Force .
We may laugh .
And we should .

He is appealing his case , claiming in part that the instructions given to the jury were flawed because they essentially said he " should have concluded " that his chief financial officer was " perpetuating a massive fraud . "
The deliberate ignorance standard is more common in so - called street crimes like drug cases where a package is placed in a car and the driver delivers the package to a customer but avoids discovering that drugs are inside .
Mr. Petrocelli likened the Enron instruction to someone knowing someone else is about to jump out a window , closing his eyes and only opening them after the other person has already jumped .
Legal scholars said the use of the instruction is particularly troubling in the Enron case because the government argued a different theory of the case .
In an apparent effort to simplify what was long assumed would be a case about arcane accounting fraud , prosecutors argued that Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling deliberately chose to lie and mislead investors and employees in public statements to keep the fiction of Enron 's success going and enrich themselves .
The government , in the end , has not argued that both men shielded themselves from the truth and avoided knowing of illegal acts committed by subordinates .
" The government has n't presented that sort of approach , " said Ellen S. Podgor , a law professor specializing in white - collar crime at Stetson University .
" They have presented a case where this was a guy on the soapbox telling the public lies . "
Mr. Androphy , who has been following the case closely , agreed .
" The government can't argue a theory , offer evidence on a theory and then do a 180 and argue for an instruction on an alternate theory , " he said .
" That 's not permissible . "
Judge Lake allowed the instruction after the government opposed a defense motion to keep it out .
The government said in a filing with the court last week that both Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling asserted the " ostrich defense " by claiming they knew of no wrongdoing other than the crimes committed by the chief financial officer , Andrew S. Fastow .
After one session , Frans de Waal of Emory University said that as recently as a decade ago there was still no firm consensus on many of the social relationships of chimps .
“ You do n’t hear any debate now , ” he said .
In his own studies at the Yerkes Primate Research Center at Emory , Dr. de Waal found that chimps as social animals have had to constrain and alter their behavior in various ways , as have humans .
It is a part of ape inheritance , he said , and in the case of humans , the basis for morality .
The provocative interpretation was advanced in his recent book , “ Primates and Philosophers . ”
Other reports shortly before the symposium had elaborated on the abilities of chimps as toolmakers .
Jill Pruetz , a primatologist at Iowa State University , described 22 examples of chimps in Senegal making stick spears to hunt smaller primates for their meat .
Dr. Goodall was the first to call attention to chimps as hunting carnivores , not strictly vegetarians .
Dr. Pruetz observed several chimps jabbing the spears into hollow tree trunks where bush babies often dwell .
Just one attempt was successful .
Previously , chimps had been seen using sticks mainly to extract termites from their nests .
A team of archaeologists led by Julio Mercader of the University of Calgary reported finding stones in Ivory Coast that chimps used 4,300 years ago to crack nuts .
Today ’s chimps have often been videotaped using rocks as a hammer to open nuts .
The old stones with starch residues from nuts , the researchers said , were the earliest strong evidence of chimp tool use , and the finding suggested that chimps had learned the skill on their own , rather than copying humans .
Other researchers combine field work showing chimp behavior in natural habitats with laboratory experiments that are created to disclose their underlying intelligence — what scientists call their “ cognitive reserve . ”
Image From the top , Ayumu , a 6 - year - old male , shows foresight in stacking blocks ; chimps can outperform humans at some memory tasks ; they use simple tools like twigs to dig out ants and termites , and rocks to crack open nuts .

For example , chimps on their own would not sit at a computer responding with rapid touches on the screen as a test of their immediate memory .
Videos of their doing just that at Kyoto University in Japan especially impressed the symposium scientists .
“ We are currently using Ogre3D in our naval simulator .
After trying other 3d graphics engines , Ogre3D was by far the best for a good combination of qualities : clean and understandable code , excellent documentation , and a great community .
Those three characteristics make me choose it and so far , after almost a year and a half , I have never regretted that decision .
Ogre3D has helped us a lot by speeding up the prototyping phase , testing new techniques for the physics algorithms really quickly , and , as part of my Argo Engine , serving really well as the presentation module . ”
One important function every good attorney undertakes early on , is to ascertain the types and amounts of available coverage .
This is vital and should be done as early on as possible .
This issue can be re-visited often , and your information and strategy updated , as more information is developed .
It is obviously useful to know if there is $ 15,000.00 in available coverage or $ 15 million !
This again leads to the central point that to be TRULY certain of the coverage amounts and provisions , you should obtain and read the actual applicable insurance policy .
If you are the actual insured , or a guest in the home or car of a named insured you have a right to a copy of the insurance policy .
Even if you are the opposing party ( the injured plaintiff trying to obtain a copy of the policy from the defendant or his insurance policy ) many states mandate that the policy also be provided to you .
It can be asked for or obtained directly from the defendant ( if he will ) ; or from his insurance company ( if they will , or if state law mandates ) ; or from his insurance agent or broker ; or in litigation under “ discovery , ” if that route must be taken .
There are many ways to obtain a copy of the policy , and no particular way is the “ right ” way ; just whichever way works .
Some have even gone and obtained a small policy from the opposing insurance company just to see what their policy language and provisions include .
Some have obtained insurance policies from the insurance agent or broker , or even from a secondary insurance carrier representing someone else involved in the accident [ they sometimes share and exchange data ] .
If the insurance company refuses ( when state law demands it ) , people have registered formal complaints with the state insurance commissioner .
At this juncture , it is important to make a clear distinction .
Obtaining and reviewing a copy of the actual insurance policy and its provisions , IS NOT the same thing as obtaining the Declarations Page .
This is an important document , in some ways maybe the most important document .
The Declarations Page is the document that indicates exactly what the AMOUNTS of the actual insurance policy coverages are .
The amounts ; the types , etc .
This is very important , and when used in conjunction with the actual policy itself [ which explains coverages and prohibitions , etc. ] , you will have a complete picture of what you have and what you are up against , and will be able to more fully plan out your personal injury case and strategy .
When the policy itself as well as the declarations page is obtained , this is a good start to your case and can help determine what might be covered , whether there is stacking , etc .
However , this is not the end of the analysis , only the beginning .
Just because there may be ONE policy or set of coverages involved , this ABSOLUTELY does not mean that this may be the only coverage available or that can be involved .
Different from “ stacking ” policies ( the addition of multiple independent policies covering one insured ) there is the principle of additive policies .
For instance , let us say that one day a person is walking to the store and goes to cross the street at an unpainted intersection ; one that has a problem with the traffic light .
This person gets hit by a car ( traveling 40 m.p.h. in a 30 m.p.h. zone ) and sustains catastrophic spinal and brain injuries and is in a coma .
What potential policy / policies could this injured person pursue ?
The analysis can be long , but is often done by attorneys in the following way .
First , obviously one could and would pursue the driver of the vehicle .
( He was speeding , and may be guilty of failure to maintain a proper lookout , negligence , etc. )
Second , if the driver was borrowing the car at the time , we could pursue both the automobile OWNER ’S auto insurance policy [ of the car involved in the accident ] , as well as the DRIVER ’S policy , who was driving the vehicle .
Additionally , if the pedestrian had a vehicle which had medical payments coverage Med Pay , or UM / UIM coverage ( uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage , they are always listed together ) we could pursue either or both of those as well .
UM [ Uninsured Motorist ] coverage covers being hit by someone with no insurance coverage at all , and UIM [ Under Insured Motorist ] coverage is for situations like this , where there are very large injuries and the available coverage from the defendant is inadequate .
Med Pay coverage is medical payments coverage paid to medical providers for the medical treatment undergone as a result of an accident .
Med Pay coverage is paid regardless of who was at fault .
UM / UIM is very important coverage , and coverage that every person should have .
This essentially covers you in an auto accident , as a driver or a passenger ( or even as a pedestrian ) when nothing else might .
This is coverage you can always count on , even if the other party has no insurance at all , or only has the mandated state minimum policy ( usually , $ 15,000.00 ) .
UM / UIM is probably the best ( and most vital ) all around coverage you can have .
Medical payments coverage is also important coverage to have as it covers medical bills .
Neither Med Pay nor UM / UIM is mandated by the state to be able to operate a motor vehicle ; these are optional coverages .
However , UM / UIM is important coverage , and it is VERY unwise to operate without it .
Finally , in our analysis of the scenario above , the pedestrian might have lawsuits against the city for an improperly working traffic control device and improperly marked crosswalk , as well as against ( potentially ) the contractor employed to perform those repairs ( if any , and if they were done negligently ) .
The list could potentially go on and on , but you see the point .
Obviously , there can be many layers of coverage – – not just one – – and it is important to find out what those policies are , what is covered and the amounts of coverage involved .
This should also illustrate our prior point that , in essence , damages are king .
Meaning , if the injuries and damages are severe enough , they will often drive the continuing search for more coverages and assets to make the injured plaintiff “ whole . ”
Also , recognize there are other types of coverage that potentially could have been pursued .
If the pedestrian had “ umbrella ” coverage he could have availed himself of that as well .
[ Umbrella coverage is additive coverage , which is also optional to obtain , and operates as sort of a “ backstop ” coverage , essentially above and beyond all other available coverages like UM / UIM , Med Pay , Homeowners , etc . ]
This “ backstop ” coverage , dollar for dollar and pound for pound , is THE best coverage there is .
Normally , if you have both your auto and home policies with an insurance carrier , in sufficient minimal limits like $ 1 million each ; they will normally offer you umbrella coverage , usually in increments of $ 1 million , $ 2 million , etc. , for only a couple hundred dollars a year .
This is phenomenal coverage ( especially for the amount charged ) , and coverage EVERYONE should seek to obtain if at all possible .
Thus , if something truly catastrophic happened to guests in your home or auto , or you and / or your family ; you would have very sufficient coverage to handle 99.9 % of any accident scenario that could happen , without having to rely on some third party ’s insurance coverage [ if they had coverage at all ] .
After all , often people are uninsured or possess only the state mandated $ 15,000.00 minimum .
In our fictional scenario above , if our pedestrian had been hit by a combination semitractor / trailer , there may have been EVEN MORE levels of insurance to pursue .
( There would have been the owner / operator ’s own policy , the dispatcher ’s policy , the shipping company ’s freight policy , etc. ; these are governed by D.O.T. , I.C.C. , etc. and mandated for all such trucks who must have these coverages ) .
Further , we could take the analysis another step if the accident happened on private business property ( perhaps at the edge of the property line ) , there may have been involvement with the premises liability policy ( depending on the factual scenario ) .
There are any number of policies which could be brought into play or involved in accidents like this .
These are fact driven with many potential scenarios which would determine and dictate what kinds of coverages we might pursue .
It is also important to note , that to “ involve ” coverage , one only need forward an arguable claim .
Not everything at this stage needs to be 100 % certain .
When in doubt , forward the claim and let the insurance company ( ies ) deal with the matter .
The above fictional setting serves to illustrate that there can be many insurance companies involved with various layers of coverages .
However , pursuing these commercial insurance policies are not the only possibility in circumstances such as this .
There are other types of coverages .
There can be claims involving the government or governmental agencies ( selfinsured type claims ) , as well as state or local municipalities which are likewise self - insured [ or that have self - insured retentions – like large deductibles ] .
Essentially , local , state and federal entities enjoy what is known as “ sovereign immunity , ” and are generally immune from lawsuits .
However , almost every one of them has a statutory ( partial ) waiver of this sovereign immunity , in which they allow suit to be filed against themselves up to certain pre-determined threshold limits .
Some entities have insurance ; or are self - insured ; or have a self - insured retention ( basically self insurance up to a point , and insurance beyond that – like a deductible ) .
Each entity sets its own rules .
Federal agencies allow suit to be filed via the Federal Tort Claim Act ( F.T.C.A. ) regardless of the amount of the claim .
First , you must file a form ( SF 95 ) and the agency has so many months to evaluate the claim and make an offer ( or refuse to make an offer at all ) .
You cannot file suit against the federal agency in federal court until the SF 95 has been filed with the appropriate agency , and either the time period for evaluating the claim has elapsed or the claim is denied .
After that , a plaintiff has a certain period of time by which they must then bring their federal law suit .
In addition to the above , there are other types of policies .
In some states , the regular automobile liability policies are labeled Personal Injury Protection ( P.I.P. ) policies .
These not only offer the regular type of automobile liability and / or UM coverages , but these also offer an extended kind of medical payments coverage whereby a wide variety of things are included ; as well as long term care and extended coverage , and wage loss / disability are also added to help someone fully recover .
Often these policies allow coverages in the hundreds of thousands of dollars for surgeries , medical care , extended physical therapy , convalescent care , etc. , and there are also extensive wage loss provisions as well which can provide someone with coverage for wage losses due to injury for years , in amounts totaling tens of thousands of dollars .
This is very good and comprehensive coverage .
Obviously , each policy is unique and has unique provisions and coverage amounts .
Each state mandates the minimum coverages a policy must cover .
Such policies can be a valuable resource and should be investigated fully , even if one was merely a passenger in another ’s vehicle .
This is where reading the policy carefully and accurately can be of great benefit and extremely helpful to you .
An example of the importance of carefully reading an insurance policy , was made clear by two different salesmen who happened to work for a large Chevrolet dealership who were injured in unrelated auto accidents several months apart .
Neither salesmen was at fault , and both were rear - ended by people who had relatively modest policies of less than $ 25 K .
Likewise , both salesmen had concurrent workman ’s compensation claims because the accident happened while they were at work .
However , there are legally set limits on what can ultimately be recovered from workman ’s compensation , regardless of your injuries .
Because both salesmen were fairly hurt , the hunt was on to try to find additional policy limits .
Neither had their own UM / UIM policy limits , and it was assumed that because workman ’s compensation was involved that ALL they could receive was the negligent , third party defendant insured ’s policy limits .
Finally , someone exercised due diligence and demanded a copy of the policy from the EMPLOYER ’S ( Chevrolet Dealership ) automobile insurance company .
This was met with immediate hostility and resistance ; both from the Chevrolet Dealer as well as from their insurance broker and insurance company .
All involved tried to claim that the workman ’s compensation policy was the “ exclusive remedy ” to the salesmen and all that they could go after .
Normally , this would be the case in a properly constructed and written policy .
The employer / auto dealer ( Chevrolet ) and its ’ automobile insurance carrier were none to happy to provide the policy – but they were required to by law .
Both entities assured the salesmen that this dealership had been around for many years and that workman ’s compensation was all that was available to them or that they could receive ; and that the policy provided no coverage for them .
They were wrong !
Quite plainly the insurance policy had a provision for UM / UIM coverage ( even though the dealership insisted that this was meant only for the owner and the general manager of the dealership ) .
Unfortunately for them , the policy was not written that way , establishing such exclusions .
Because of a careful reading of the policy , and the provisions which were there ( and NOT there ) and not just making assumptions or listening to other people , BOTH salesmen ended up receiving policy limits from the respective 3rd party defendants AND from the Chevrolet dealership ( UIM ) auto insurance policy .
Needless to say , the dealership management was quite upset but could stop none of it .
The dealership automobile insurance company did not want two bad faith claims ON TOP of the UIM claims .
So , the dealership that had gone for years without any such claims , suddenly had two claims against it .
Everyone involved learned a valuable lesson about READING THE POLICY !
Simply “ assuming ” things had created this situation and allowed it to go on for years .
The policy was later changed to specifically EXCLUDE salesmen or anyone receiving workman ’s compensation claims , which is perfectly legal and how most policies are written .
However , by then the dealership had two chargeable claims against it .
The salesmen later went back to work there , as they were legally protected under workman ’s compensation law and entitled to their jobs again .
Simply reading the policy proved very valuable for both men ; and it also made one wonder how many other salesmen over the years could have used the policy , but did not , simply because they either listened to the dealership personnel or DID NOT READ THE POLICY ?!
The above are examples of just some of the different types of coverage that could be available to you in auto accident injury cases .
Similar provisions might be found concerning a different type accident involving a different policy ; for instance a premises liability policy involving a slip and fall or an injury on commercial property .
Finding out all that you can , and all of the benefits and provisions available to you , simply takes being a little creative and looking for all possible policies or avenues of coverage , and writing a few letters .
Simply exercising a little diligence .
In addition to finding out about types of coverages and provisions , one may also find out about policy size from the adjusters themselves .
Sometimes they will outright tell you , but some have misgivings [ or there may be company policy against that ] and feel like people would “ over treat ” and run up huge medical bills if they knew there was a large policy .
More often , insurance adjusters will not necessarily “ tell ” you [ or be able to ] policy limit amounts , but they can and often do give you strong hints .
So , even if they will not tell you outright , there is still information to be had there .
For instance , an adjuster might state that the vehicle insured has “ small ” policy limits ( generally meaning a minimum $ 15 K policy or at most a $ 25 K policy ) ; whereas if they indicate a “ medium ” policy limit is involved , they generally mean a $ 25 K to $ 50 K policy .
Stating their insured has a “ large ” policy limit amount , usually means $ 100 K or more .
If the adjuster indicates that the policy limits are “ extremely large ” or indicates that policy limits are “ adequate / or adequate regardless of claim size , ” this generally indicates the largest size policies of $ 1 million or above ; or as a minimum $ 500 K .
The reason they say “ adequate ” is just that ; virtually no matter what size the claim ends up being , those policy limits are usually sufficient .
Thus , even though you may not always get the exact number from the insurance company , even these hints can be of benefit to you in determining what is , or may be , available for your claim .
You can find also sometimes find policy information in a variety of places .
You can do online searches or do basic legal information searches .
One common place to obtain other insurance information is from the insurance companies themselves , or from brokers or agents .
Often times insurance companies will write other insurance companies with their questions , concerns , or theories of liability .
Likewise , they write and put other carriers ( and parties ) on notice that they have “ subrogation ” rights ( the right to recover or recoup amounts they have expended on a claim that was not “ their fault , ” etc. ) .
Often , insurance carriers are more candid with each other than they are with claimants .
Sometimes , just simply asking one carrier , [ such as asking your own carrier for a copy of their file ] or “ poking around ” a little bit can often yield the results you seek .

As software environments become more complex and programs get larger , it becomes more and more necessary to find ways to reduce code duplication and scattering of knowledge .
While simple code duplication is easy to factor out into functions or methods , more complex code duplication is not .
For example , if a method needs to be wrapped in a transaction , synchronized in a lock , or have its calls transmitted to a remote object , there often is no simple way to factor out a function or method to be called , because the part of the behavior that varies needs to be wrapped inside the common behavior .
A second and related problem is scattering of knowledge .
Sometimes a framework needs to be able to locate all of a program 's functions or methods that have a particular characteristic , such as " all of the remote methods accessible to users with authorization X . "
The typical solution is to put this information in external configuration files , but then you run the risk of configuration being out of sync with the code .
For example , you might add a new method , but forget to also add it to the configuration file .
And of course , you 'll be doing a lot more typing , because you 'll have to put the method names in the configuration file , and any renaming you do requires editing two files .
So no matter how you slice it , duplication is a bad thing for both developer productivity and software reliability which is why Python 2.4's new " decorator " feature lets you address both kinds of duplication .
Decorators are Python objects that can register , annotate , and / or wrap a Python function or method .
For example , the Python atexit module contains a register function that registers a callback to be invoked when a Python program is exited .
Without the new decorator feature , a program that uses this function looks something like Listing One(a ) .
When Listing One(a ) is run , it prints " Goodbye , world ! " because when it exits , the goodbye ( ) function is invoked .
Now look at the decorator version in Listing One( b ) , which does exactly the same thing , but uses decorator syntax insteadan @ sign and expression on the line before the function definition .
This new syntax lets the registration be placed before the function definition , which accomplishes two things .
First , you are made aware that the function is an atexit function before you read the function body , giving you a better context for understanding the function .
With such a short function , it hardly makes a difference , but for longer functions or methods , it can be very helpful to know in advance what you 're looking at .
Second , the function name is not repeated .
The first program refers to goodbye twice , so there is more duplication precisely the thing we 're trying to avoid .
Why Decorate ?
The original motivation for adding decorator syntax was to allow class methods and static methods to be obvious to someone reading a program .
Python 2.2 introduced the classmethod and staticmethod built-ins , which were used as in Listing Two(a ) .
Listing Two( b ) shows the same code using decorator syntax , which avoids the unnecessary repetitions of the method name , and gives you a heads - up that a classmethod is being defined .
While this could have been handled by creating a syntax specifically for class or static methods , one of Python 's primary design principles is that : " Special cases are n't special enough to break the rules . "
That is , the language should avoid having privileged features that you can't reuse for other purposes .
Since class methods and static methods in Python are just objects that wrap a function , it would not make sense to create special syntax for just two kinds of wrapping .
Instead , a syntax was created to allow arbitrary wrapping , annotation , or registration of functions at the point where they 're defined .
Many syntaxes for this feature were discussed , but in the end , a syntax resembling Java 1.5 annotations was chosen .
Decorators , however , are considerably more flexible than Java 's annotations , as they are executed at runtime and can have arbitrary behavior , while Java annotations are limited to only providing metadata about a particular class or method .
Creating Decorators
Decorators may appear before any function definition , whether that definition is part of a module , a class , or even contained in another function definition .
You can even stack multiple decorators on the same function definition , one per line .
But before you can do that , you first need to have some decorators to stack .
A decorator is a callable object ( like a function ) that accepts one argument the function being decorated .
The return value of the decorator replaces the original function definition .
See the script in Listing Three ( a ) , which produces the output in Listing Three ( b ) , demonstrating that the mydecorator function is called when the function is defined .
For the first example decorator , I had it return the original function object unchanged , but in practice , it 's rare that you 'll do that ( except for registration decorators ) .
More often , you 'll either be annotating the function ( by adding attributes to it ) , or wrapping the function with another function , then returning the wrapper .
The returned wrapper then replaces the original function .
For example , the script in Listing Four prints " Hello , world ! " because the does_nothing function is replaced with the return value of stupid_decorator .
Objects as Decorators
As you can see , Python does n't care what kind of object you return from a decorator , which means that for advanced uses , you can turn functions or methods into specialized objects of your own choosing .
For example , if you wanted to trace certain functions ' execution , you could use something like Listing Five .
When run , Listing Five prints " entering " and " exiting " messages around the " Hello , world " function .
As you can see , a decorator does n't have to be a function ; it can be a class , as long as it can be called with a single argument .
( Remember that in Python , calling a class returns a new instance of that class . )
Thus , the traced class is a decorator that replaces a function with an instance of the traced class .
So after the hello function definition in Listing Five , hello is no longer a function , but is instead an instance of the traced class that has the old hello function saved in its func attribute .
When that wrapper instance is called ( by the hello ( ) statement at the end of the script ) , Python 's class machinery invokes the instance 's __call__ ( ) method , which then invokes the original function between printing trace messages .
Stacking Decorators
Now that we have an interesting decorator , you can stack it with another decorator to see how decorators can be combined .
The script in Listing Six prints " Called with < class ' __main__.SomeClass '> " , wrapped in " entering " and " exiting " messages .
The ordering of the decorators determines the structure of the result .
Thus , someMethod is a classmethod descriptor wrapping a traced instance wrapping the original someMethod function .
So , outer decorators are listed before inner decorators .
Therefore , if you are using multiple decorators , you must know what kind of object each decorator expects to receive , and what kind of object it returns , so that you can arrange them in a compatible wrapping order , so that the output of the innermost decorator is compatible with the input of the next - outer decorator .
Usually , most decorators expect a function on input , and return either a function or an attribute descriptor as their output .
The Python built - ins classmethod , staticmethod , and property all return attribute descriptors , so their output cannot be passed to a decorator that expects a function .
That 's why I had to put classmethod first in Listing Four .
As an experiment , try reversing the order of @traced and @classmethod in Listing Four , and see if you can guess what will happen .
Functions as Decorators
Because most decorators expect an actual function as their input , some of them may not be compatible with our initial implementation of @traced , which returns an instance of the traced class .
Let 's rework @traced such that it returns an actual function object , so it 'll be compatible with a wider range of decorators .
Listing Seven provides the same functionality as the original traced decorator , but instead of returning a traced object instance , it returns a new function object that wraps the original function .
If you 've never used Python closures before , you might be a little confused by this function - in - a - function syntax .
Basically , when you define a function inside of another function , any undefined local variables in the inner function will take the value of that variable in the outer function .
So here , the value of func in the inner function comes from the value of func in the outer function .
Because the inner function definition is executed each time the outer function is called , Python actually creates a new wrapper function object each time .
Such function objects are called " lexical closures , " because they enclose a set of variables from the lexical scope where the function was defined .
A closure does not actually duplicate the code of the function , however .
It simply encloses a reference to the existing code , and a reference to the free variables from the enclosing function .
In this case , that means that the wrapper closure is essentially a pointer to the Python bytecode making up the wrapper function body , and a pointer to the local variables of the traced function during the invocation when the closure was created .
Because a closure is really just a normal Python function object ( with some predefined variables ) , and because most decorators expect to receive a function object , creating a closure is perhaps the most popular way of creating a stackable decorator .
Decorators with Arguments
Many applications of decorators call for parameterization .
For example , say you want to create a pair of @require and @ensure decorators so that you can record a method 's precondition and postcondition .
Python lets us specify arguments with our decorators ; see Listing Eight .
( Of course , Listing Eight is for illustration only .
A full - featured implementation of preconditions and postconditions would need to be a lot more sophisticated than this to deal with things like inheritance of conditions , allowing postconditions to access before / after expressions , and allowing conditions to access function arguments by name instead of by position . )
You 'll notice that the require ( ) decorator creates two closures .
The first closure creates a decorator function that knows the expr that was supplied to @require ( ) .
This means require itself is not really the decorator function here .
Instead , require returns the decorator function , here called decorator .
This is very different from the previous decorators , and this change is necessary to implement parameterized decorators .
The second closure is the actual wrapper function that evaluates expr whenever the original function is called .
Try calling the test ( ) function with different numbers of arguments , and see what happens .
Also , try changing the @require line to use a different precondition , or stack multiple @require lines to combine preconditions .
You 'll also notice that @require ( expr= " len ( __args ) ==1 " ) still works .
Decorator invocations follow the same syntax rules as normal Python function or method calls , so you can use positional arguments , keyword arguments , or both .
Function Attributes
All of the examples so far have been things that can't be done quite so directly with Java annotations .
But what if all you really need is to tack some metadata onto a function or method for later use ?
For this purpose , you may wish to use function attributes in your decorator .
Function attributes , introduced in Python 2.1 , let you record arbitrary values as attributes on a function object .
For example , suppose you want to track the author of a function or method , using an @author ( ) decorator ?
You could implement it as in Listing Nine .
In this example , you simply set an author_name attribute on the function and return it , rather than creating a wrapper .
Then , you can retrieve the attribute at a later time as part of some metadata - gathering operation .
Practicing " Safe Decs "
To keep the examples simple , I 've been ignoring " safe decorator " practices .
It 's easy to create a decorator that will work by itself , but creating a decorator that will work properly when combined with other decorators is a bit more complex .
To the extent possible , your decorator should return an actual function object , with the same name and attributes as the original function , so as not to confuse an outer decorator or cancel out the work of an inner decorator .
This means that decorators that simply modify and return the function they were given ( like Listings Three and Nine ) , are already safe .
But decorators that return a wrapper function need to do two more things to be safe :
Set the new function 's name to match the old function 's name .
Copy the old function 's attributes to the new function .
These can be accomplished by adding just three short lines to our old decorators .
( Compare the version of @require in Listing Ten with the original in Listing Eight . )
Before returning the wrapper function , the decorator function in Listing Ten changes the wrapper function 's name ( by setting its __name__ attribute ) to match the original function 's name , and sets its __dict__ attribute ( the dictionary containing its attributes ) to the original function 's __dict__ , so it will have all the same attributes that the original function did .
It also changes the wrapper function 's documentation ( its __doc__ attribute ) to match the original function 's documentation .
Thus , if you used this new @require ( ) decorator stacked over the @author ( ) decorator , the resulting function would still have an author_name attribute , even though it was a different function object than the original one being decorated .
Putting It All Together
To illustrate , I 'll use a few of these techniques to implement a complete , useful decorator that can be combined with other decorators .
Specifically , I 'll implement an @synchronized decorator ( Listing Eleven ) that implements Java - like synchronized methods .
A given object 's synchronized methods can only be invoked by one thread at a time .
That is , as long as any synchronized method is executing , any other thread must wait until all the synchronized methods have returned .
To implement this , you need to have a lock that you can acquire whenever the method is executing .
Then you can create a wrapping decorator that acquires and releases the lock around the original method call .
I 'll store this lock in a _sync_lock attribute on the object , automatically creating a new lock if there 's no _sync_lock attribute already present .
But what if one synchronized method calls another synchronized method on the same object ?
Using simple mutual exclusion locks would result in a deadlock in this case , so we 'll use a threading .
RLock instead .
An RLock may be held by only one thread , but it can be recursively acquired and released .
Thus , if one synchronized method calls another on the same object , the lock count of the RLock simply increases , then decreases as the methods return .
When the lock count reaches zero , other threads can acquire the lock and can , therefore , invoke synchronized methods on the object again .
There are two little tricks being done in Listing Eleven 's wrapper code that are worth knowing about .
First , the code uses a try / except block to catch an attribute error in the case where the object does not already have a synchronization lock .
Since in the common case the lock should exist , this is generally faster than using an if / then test to check whether the lock exists ( because the if / then test would have to execute every time , but the AttributeError will occur only once ) .
Second , when the lock does n't exist , the code uses the setdefault method of the object 's attribute dictionary ( its __dict__ ) to either retrieve an existing value of _sync_lock , or to set a new one if there was no value there before .
This is important because it 's possible that two threads could simultaneously notice that the object has no lock , and then each would create and successfully acquire its own lock , while ignoring the lock created by the other !
This would mean that our synchronization could fail on the first call to a synchronized method of a given object .
Using the atomic setdefault operation , however , guarantees that no matter how many threads simultaneously detect the need for a new lock , they will all receive the same RLock object .
That is , one setdefault ( ) operation sets the lock , then all subsequent setdefault ( ) operations receive that lock object .
Therefore , all threads end up using the same lock object , and thus only one is able to enter the wrapped method at a time , even if the lock object was just created .
Conclusion
Python decorators are a simple , highly customizable way to wrap functions or methods , annotate them with metadata , or register them with a framework of some kind .
But , as a relatively new feature , their full possibilities have not yet been explored , and perhaps the most exciting uses have n't even been invented yet .
Just to give you some ideas , here are links to a couple of lists of use cases that were posted to the mailing list for the developers working on the next version of Python : http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2004-April/043902.html and http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/
2004-April/044132.html .
Each message uses different syntax for decorators , based on some C# - like alternatives being discussed at the time .
But the actual decorator examples presented should still be usable with the current syntax .
And , by the time you read this article , there will likely be many other uses of decorators out there .
For example , Thomas Heller has been working on experimental decorator support for the ctypes package ( http://ctypes.sourceforge.net/), and I 've been working on a complete generic function package using decorators , as part of the PyProtocols system ( http://peak.telecommunity.com/ PyProtocols.html ) .
So , have fun experimenting with decorators !
( Just be sure to practice " safe decs , " to ensure that your decorators will play nice with others . )

NSA Activities
President Bush signed a secret finding / directive on 04 October 2001 that formally launched the mass surveillance program called STELLARWIND under the President�s Surveillance Program making NSA the executive agent for what was known as � The Program� .
At least 80 percent of all audio calls are gathered and stored by the NSA , whistleblower William Binney revealed .
The former code - breaker said the spy agency�s ultimate aim is no less than total population control .
The National Security Agency lies about what it stores , said William Binney , one of the highest profile whistleblowers to ever emerge from the NSA , at a conference in London organized by the Center for Investigative Journalism on 05 July 2014 .
Binney left the agency shortly after the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center because he was disgusted at the organizations move towards public surveillance .
� At least 80 percent of fiber - optic cables globally go via the US , � Binney said .
� This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in .
At least 80 percent of all audio calls , not just metadata , are recorded and stored in the US .
The NSA lies about what it stores . �
On 6 June 2013 , the British newspaper The Guardian published a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) order issued in April and requiring a Verizon subsidiary to provide on a daily basis information for all telephone calls made by its US customers both domestically and to locations outside of the country to the National Security Agency .
The sweeping order , issued at the request of the FBI , appeared to be a renewal of similar previous orders and was reported to be legally justified under section 215 of the PATRIOT
Act which authorizes the US Government to compel telephone carriers to provide information about calls ..
Though not officially confirmed , it is believed that similar orders have been issued to other US telecommunications companies .
On 6 June 2013 , the Washington Post also revealed the existence of a secret , reportedly court - approved , program code - named PRISM , which allowed the NSA to directly tap into into the servers of 9 US Internet service providers .
The companies , the Washington Post reported , were AOL , Apple , Facebook , Google , Microsoft , PalTalk , Skype , Yahoo and YouTube ; with Dropbox listed in an internal presentation obtained the Washington Post as " coming soon " .
Microsoft was reported to have been the first recruited to participate in the program , starting in May 2007 , and together with Yahoo and Google to account for 98 % of PRISM production .
Under PRISM , the NSA is able to extract of variety of information , including photos , emails , documents , connection logs and private chats ( both audio and video ) .
The program also operates in parallel with another secret program code - named BLARNEY that collects " metadat " as it is transmitted past certain Internet choke points .
Lawmakers made aware of the existence of PRISM were bound under oath to not reveal its existence .
The contentious Section 215 of the Patriot Act expired 01 June 2015 , but only applied to the collection of metadata � the who , when , and where of a call � but not the what , not the content of the call itself .
But the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) is still going strong , and two major surveillance programs legally based in FISA 's Section 702 � PRISM and Upstream � allow for the collection of voice recordings .
The Prism program collects data from Internet communications � which includes audio and video recordings that could potentially end up being processed by the NSA 's voice transcription programs and added to a massive searchable database .
Upstream is the second program based on Section 702 of FISA , and this is the one that takes communications directly from cables connected to the US that are managed by telecom companies like Verizon or AT&T .
In a transparency report , the Office of the Director of National Intelligence acknowledged that , in 2013 , Upstream collected calls to and from 89,000 targets .
The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized .
The Fourth Amendment enshrines warrant requirement that the American colonists demanded from the Framers , following their experience with British occupation .
That starting point may seem like a quaint vestige from a far - away past , but when that vestige is translated into abuses of enforcement officers , then the right of all Americans to be protected from arbitrary and unfounded invasions becomes much more than a historical remembrance .
The framers of the Fourth Amendment placed a check on the unfettered authority of the state , without probable cause , to conduct a search that had not been tied to the likely commission of a crime .
Without the requirement that a search have a nexus to both criminal conduct and to an external authority ( judge or magistrate ) , a soldier , a federal agent , or a policeman , could take unto himself the right to execute what was called in the colonies a " general warrant " , which permitted a search of a home for " whatever " evidence that might be found .
The National Security Agency used computers to help monitor all international phone calls and e-mails of Americans in carrying out President Bush 's orders to detect Al Qaeda sleeper cells .
Computers would automatically search for key words and phrases , as well as other signatures possibly associated with sleeper cells .
As part of the statistical analysis , computers would create records that compiled profiles of US persons .
All of this activity was under way long before September 11th , with the exception of the creation of records on US persons .
NSA 's domestic spying program depends on the cooperation of the nation 's telecom companies .
A court warrant is almost always required to monitor communications .
But under the secret surveillance program authorized by the President , the National Security Agency bypassed the courts to tap telephone calls and intercept e-mails to and from the United States .
While estimates put the number of people monitered by human analysts in the thousands , the amount of people who have had some information looked at by a machine number much higher than that .
Surveillance in the domestic spying program occurs in several stages , and the first stage is done by a computer - controlled system .
The information that the artifical intelligence system collects comes from faxs , e-mails , and telephone calls that go into and out of the United States .
This machine then shifts through all the infromation and earmarks certain items to be looked at by a human analyst .
According to NSA rules , this first step is not considered an " acquisition " of information .
It is only considered an " acquisition " when the information has been looked at by a human analyst .
PGP creator Phil Zimmermann noted that " A year after the 1994 Digital Telephony bill passed , the FBI disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap 1 percent of all phone calls in all major U.S. cities .
This would represent more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the number of phones that could be wiretapped .
In previous years , there were only about a thousand court - ordered wiretaps in the United States per year , at the federal , state , and local levels combined .
It 's hard to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1 percent of all our phone calls , much less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that traffic in real time .
The only plausible way of processing that amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated voice recognition technology to sift through it all , searching for interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker 's voice . "
The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual [ NISPOM ] definition of an individual who is a US person is different from the State Department 's International Traffic in Arms Regulation ( ITAR ) definition .
Only a U.S. citizen is eligible for a personnel security clearance .
Therefore , the NISPOM definition of U.S. person is an individual who is a U.S. citizen .
The ITAR uses a broader definition of U.S. person based on a person 's right to be hired if he or she is qualified for a job ( employment ) .
In other words , a U.S. contractor can employ a foreign national who has a certain immigration status as a permanent resident and give the person access to unclassified technical data without an export license .
But , such employment does not establish the eligibility basis for a security clearance .
For intelligence purposes , U.S. Persons include a U.S. citizen , native - born or naturalized as well as a permanent resident alien ( legally in the U.S. , with the " green card " ) .
It also includes an unincorporated association made up mostly of U.S. citizens and / or permanent resident aliens , an activity incorporated in the U.S. EXCEPT for a corporation directed and controlled by a foreign government (s ) .
The only document that counts is the permanent resident alien card .
If a foreign national has that , he is a U.S. Person .
An SSN may be a work requirement , but it does not signal that a foreign national has a " green card . "
Illegal aliens may have SSN and but are not U.S. Persons .
Only foreign nationals who are lawfully in the US and who are permanent resident aliens are US Persons .
An alien in the U.S. is not a U.S. Person unless there is specific information to the contrary .
A foreigner going to a US school is not a US Person .
A student visa is not the " green card " designating a permanent resident alien .
A corporation or subsidiary incorporated abroad , even if partially or completely owned by a corporation incorporated in the U.S. , is not a U.S. Person .
Following the September 2001 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington , Mr. Bush says he authorized the surveillance of such calls without court warrants , because part of the terrorist strategy is to place operatives inside the United States .
" They blend in with the civilian population , " he said .
" They get their orders from overseas , and then they emerge to strike from within .
We must be able to quickly detect when someone linked to al - Qaida is communicating with someone inside of America .
It 's one of the challenges of protecting the American people and it's one of the lessons of September the 11th . "
President Bush said that the eavesdropping was legal and said it would continue .
" I have the authority , both from the Constitution and the Congress , to undertake this vital program , " he said .
" The American people expect me to protect their lives and their civil liberties , and that 's exactly what we 're doing with this program .
I 'll continue to reauthorize this program for so long as our country faces a continuing threat from al - Qaida and related groups . "
In the fall of 2001 there was substantial concern that al Qaeda and its allies were preparing to carry out another attack within the United States .
Al Qaeda had demonstrated its ability to introduce agents into the United States undetected and to perpetrate devastating attacks , and it was suspected that additional agents were likely already in position within the Nation 's borders .
As the President has explained , unlike a conventional enemy , al Qaeda has infiltrated " our cities and communities and communicated from here in America to plot and plan with bin Laden 's lieutenants in Afghanistan , Pakistan and elsewhere . "
To this day , finding al Qaeda sleeper agents in the United States remains one of the paramount concerns in the War on Terror .
As the President has explained , " [t ] he terrorists want to strike America again , and they hope to inflict even more damage than they did on September the 11th . "
The President acknowledged that , to counter this threat , he authorized the NSA to intercept international communications into and out of the United States of persons linked to al Qaeda or related terrorist organizations .
The same day , the Attorney General elaborated and explained that in order to intercept a communication , there must be " a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al Qaeda , affiliated with al Qaeda , or a member of an organization affiliated with al Qaeda . "
The purpose of these intercepts is to establish an early warning system to detect and prevent another catastrophic terrorist attack on the United States .
The President has stated that the NSA activities " ha[ve ] been effective in disrupting the enemy , while safeguarding our civil liberties . "
Critics from the opposition Democratic Party and some from Mr. Bush 's own Republican Party say the president went around 1978 rules that would have authorized the surveillance as an emergency security measure so long as the administration got permission from a secret court within 72 hours .
They say the government 's eavesdropping program is illegal and violates the civil liberties of U.S. citizens .
YOUNGSTOWN SHEET & TUBE CO .
ET AL .
v. SAWYER . [ 343 U.S. 579 Decided June 2 , 1952 ] MR. JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court .
" It is clear that if the President had authority to issue the order he did , it must be found in some provision of the Constitution .
And it is not claimed that express constitutional language grants this power to the President .
The contention is that presidential power should be implied from the aggregate of his powers under the Constitution .
Particular reliance is placed on provisions in Article II which say that " The executive Power shall be vested in a President . . . " ; that " he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed " ; and that he " shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States . " .....
" In the framework of our Constitution , the President 's power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker .
The Constitution limits his functions in the lawmaking process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the vetoing of laws he thinks bad .
And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about who shall make laws which the President is to execute .
The first section of the first article says that " All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States . . . . "
NEW ORLEANS – Sixty - four - year - old Vivian Westerman rode out Hurricane Katrina in her 19th - century house .
So terrible was the experience that she wanted two things before the 2006 season arrived : a backup power source and a gun .
“ I got a 6,000 - watt generator and the cutest little Smith & Wesson , snub - nose .38 you ever saw , ” she boasted .
“ I ’ve never been more confident . ” People across New Orleans are arming themselves â€ ” not only against the possibility of another storm bringing anarchy , but against the violence that has engulfed the metropolitan area in the 19 months since Katrina , making New Orleans the nation ’s murder capital .
The number of permits issued to carry concealed weapons is running twice as high as it was before Katrina â€ ” this , in a city with only about half its pre-storm population of around 450,000 .
Attendance at firearms classes and hours logged at shooting ranges also are up , according to the gun industry .
< ...>
Some people are losing faith in the system to protect them .
Earnest Johnson , a 37 - year - old chef who lives in Kenner , bought his first gun recently and visits a shooting range regularly .
“ Things are way worse than they used to be , ” he said .
“ You have to do something to protect yourself . ”
Kevin Cato , a 41 - year - old contractor , bought a . 45 - caliber handgun for protection when he is working in some of the city ’s still - deserted areas .
“ But it ’s not much safer at home , ” Cato said .
“ The police chased a guy through my yard one time with their guns out . ”
Brownback questions abortions for rape victims
TAYLORS , S.C. — Sen. Sam Brownback , campaigning for president on Saturday before the National Catholic Men's Conference , questioned whether rape victims should get abortions .
" Rape is terrible .
Rape is awful .
Is it made any better by killing an innocent child ?
Does it solve the problem for the woman that 's been raped ? " the Kansas Republican asked at the St. Joseph 's Covenant Keepers gathering .
" We need to protect innocent life .
Period , " Brownback said , bringing the crowd of about 500 to its feet .
Brownback also talked about keeping marriage between a man and a woman , saying nations that have allowed same - sex marriages were engaging in bad social experiments , with bad results .
He also encouraged married couples to stay together , saying studies have shown that if couples weather hard times for five years , their marriages tend to last .
After five years , " people are happier than those who have had a divorce , " Brownback said .
It was not clear what research he was citing .
Brownback was the only presidential hopeful invited to speak , said Steve Wood , president of Family Life Center International .
Wood said that the event was about families , not politics , and that Brownback — a Roman Catholic — was there to talk about bringing his faith into public life .
In introducing Brownback , Wood criticized Catholic politicians who fall short on doing just that on issues such as abortion .
" I do n't know about you , but this stuff by many Catholic politicians who say , ' I 'm personally opposed , but . '
But what ? "
Wood said .
" You should have the integrity to be consistent in both the personal and public life , " he said .
Several other attendees at the conference agreed .
" You ca n't separate your political life and your Christian life , " said Barry LeMay from San Jose , Calif .
" I think if a politician 's going to run for office claiming to be Catholic , they need to ascribe to everything that the Catholic Church teaches , " said Michael Scheuren of St. Petersburg Beach , Fla .

Comet Between Fireworks and Lightning
Credit & Copyright : Antti Kemppainen
Explanation : Sometimes the sky itself is the best show in town .
On January 26 , people from Perth , Australia gathered on a local beach to watch a sky light up with delights near and far .
Nearby , fireworks exploded as part of Australia Day celebrations .
On the far right , lightning from a thunderstorm flashed in the distance .
Near the image center , though , seen through clouds , was the most unusual sight of all : Comet McNaught .
The photogenic comet was so bright that it even remained visible though the din of Earthly flashes .
Comet McNaught continues to move out from the Sun and dim , but should remain visible in southern skies with binoculars through the end of this month .
The above image is actually a three photograph panorama digitally processed to reduce red reflections from the exploding firework .
As this analysis will show , the data we have to date do n't support those kinds of projections .
Let 's consider the effect to date of the explosive growth in grain ethanol production .
The difficulty in producing ethanol from cellulose is probably an order of magnitude greater than it is for producing ethanol from corn .
Therefore , it is highly unlikely that the growth curve for cellulosic ethanol production ( presuming it is ever commercially viable ) will rival that of grain ethanol .
So , let 's take a look at how gasoline consumption has evolved as we ramped up billions of gallons of ethanol production .
There have been many claims in recent years that ethanol is going to help wean us off of fossil fuels .
In fact , many of our political leaders claim that as long as we just keep subsidizing the ethanol industry , eventually cellulosic ethanol will take over and we will all motor happily along on E85 .
We are making energy policy decisions based on this assumption .
According to the Renewable Fuels Association 's Ethanol Industry Outlook 2007 ( PDF warning ) :
As a result of the implementation of the Renewable Fuels Standard ( RFS ) , increased octane demand and other market forces , the U.S. ethanol industry produced a record 4.9 billion gallons of ethanol from 110 biorefineries located in 19 states across the country in 2006 .
2006 production exceeded the previous year ’s production by a record one billion gallons , or more than 25 % .
Since 2000 , ethanol production in the U.S. has increased more than 300 % .
2006 was also a record year for construction , with no fewer than 15 new biorefineries coming online .
The addition of these biorefineries , including the completion of expansion projects , added 1.051 billion gallons of new production capacity for the year .
Additionally , 2006 closed with no fewer than 73 biorefineries under construction and 8 expanding that will add 6 billion gallons of new production capacity by 2009 .
( Note to self : Corn futures to double again by 2009 ) .
Ethanol production in 2000 , again according to the Renewable Fuels Association 's page on industry statistics , was 1.63 billion gallons .
According to their data , production in 2006 was 4.86 billion gallons , an increase of 3.23 billion gallons ( 77 million barrels ) .
So , how much gasoline consumption have we displaced with this amazing growth in ethanol production ?
What have consumers and taxpayers gotten for their money ?
According to the EIA , gasoline demand in 2000 averaged 8.4 million barrels per day .
In 2006 , gasoline demand averaged 9.3 million barrels per day .
That is an increase in demand of 0.9 million barrels per day .
This is 329 million barrels per year , or an overall demand increase of 13.8 BILLION GALLONS OF GASOLINE !
So , the next time someone tells you that ethanol production is going to reduce our fossil fuel usage , tell them that in the last 7 years annual ethanol production grew by 3 billion gallons , while annual gasoline demand grew by 14 billion gallons .
This , despite steadily rising oil prices and record high gasoline prices .
But , I would also point out that average annual rack ethanol prices have never - not once in 25 years - been lower than gasoline prices .
And note this is a comparison versus 87 octane , which is always more expensive than the 85 octane that most people buy ( 85 octane has about an 80 % market share ) .

I Am Still Not Convinced
A skeptic , eh ?
Good for you .
Make me prove my point beyond reasonable doubt .
That 's fair .
I am sure you would agree that if the claims of ethanol proponents are true - that in fact ethanol is displacing some portion of our gasoline usage - the displacement should show up if we plot gasoline demand growth .
What I would expect to see is that as ethanol production ramped up exponentially from about 2000 , the gasoline demand curve should drop down below the historical trend .
This would be fairly compelling evidence that something - which could be ethanol - is causing people to reduce gasoline consumption .
Is that what we see ?
( Note : Gasoline production has been corrected for the contained ethanol in the demand numbers reported by the EIA ) .
Figure 2 : Ethanol 's Impact on Gas Consumption .
Source : Me - using data from EIA and RFA
As you can see in the graph , until 2005 there is no variance from the gasoline demand growth curve as ethanol production ramped up .
To argue that ethanol has had any mitigation on gasoline demand , a proponent has to resort to special pleading by suggesting that gasoline demand would have otherwise been stronger if ethanol production had not ramped up .
In 2005 and 2006 , we do see some slightly lower growth in gasoline demand , but the culprit there is almost certainly record high gasoline prices .
In 2005 , Hurricane Katrina hit , followed by a fast run-up in gasoline prices .
At the time , there were wide spread media reports of high prices lowering demand for gasoline .
2006 also saw gasoline prices hitting the $ 3 mark .
Given that ethanol ramped up by 2 billion gallons from 1999 to 2004 with no apparent effect on the gasoline demand curve , it is unlikely that the 1.5 billion gallon increase in 2005 and 2006 is responsible for the small degree of variance .
So there you have it : Billions paid out in subsidies , food prices going up , farmland being used up at a faster pace , increased pollution from herbicide and pesticide runoff - and no apparent impact at all on our gasoline consumption .
This is shaping up to be the largest boondoggle in U.S. history .
But this analysis is exactly the reason I discount the recent reports that refiners might not expand because of the growth in mandated ethanol .
I think this is merely a political shot at those who are demanding that the oil industry should spend billions to expand while also demanding that we reduce our gasoline consumption by 20 % .

Libertarian economists typically adopt a two - pronged approach in their advocacy of free markets .
On the one hand , they stress that people have rights ( whether God - given or self - evident from the exercise of reason ) and therefore should be able to engage in any voluntary activities with each other , free from political interference .
Unfortunately , this appeal to principle is never enough , since the type of person who votes for today 's politicians does n't care much about abstractions .
This leads to the second prong of the argument :
The use of economic science to demonstrate unnoticed and often counterintuitive benefits from activities that the common man despises .
For example , after pointing out that the government has no business sticking its nose into capitalist actions between consenting landlords and renters , the libertarian might use economic theory to illustrate the disastrous effects of rent control .
After all , the right to property is ( rightly or wrongly ) easier to appreciate when populist violations of it lead to housing shortages .
It is in this spirit that I offer the present essay , an examination of the social benefits of stock speculators .
Now when it comes to different ways of making a living , stock speculation certainly would n't make the Top Ten Most Altruistic among Oprah Winfrey viewers .
Indeed , even among people who think that middlemen perform vital services in tangible commodities — such as buying oranges low in Florida , and selling them high in Alaska — there seems to be something artificial about transactions involving nothing more than electronic swapping of shares to corporations .
Even among people who ought to know better , there is a presumption that stock speculation is a zero- sum game , and that if one person buys low and sells high , his gain only comes at the expense of someone else , leaving society on net exactly the same .
Speculators Correct False Prices
Speculators are out to make money , to buy low and sell high , as the cliché goes .
What this truism entails , however , is that the successful speculator — who can consistently buy low and sell high — can predict certain stock prices better than others , and indeed even better than others who are risking money on those very stocks .
For example , if a speculator buys at $ 100 on Monday and sells at $ 110 on Friday , he was only able to do this because other people in this very market did n't realize on Monday that the stock would appreciate so quickly .
( If they did , they would n't have sold for $ 100 .
They would have held onto the stocks and netted the gain themselves . )
If this were the whole story , then stock speculation might truly be a zero - sum game , where the lucky or farsighted enrich themselves at the expense of the unlucky or dimwitted .
This is n't the case , however , because in the very process of profiting from their superior vision , stock speculators influence stock prices .
When stock prices are undervalued , the successful speculator buys shares , an action that drives up the prices in question .
In contrast , if a stock is " overvalued " — and by this term we mean nothing deeper than that the stock will fall in price more quickly than others in the market realize — then the successful speculator may " short sell " it , or engage in comparable actions ( such as buying a put option ) that tend to push down the share price .
In the aggregate , we have thousands or even millions of professionals who study the stock market from every conceivable angle , looking at both political events and fundamental data on individual companies .
Consequently , new information is quickly incorporated into expectations and finds its expression in updated stock prices .
Although some Chicago economists — as is their wont — take this notion of the " efficient ( stock ) market " too far , it is certainly true that individual efforts to make a buck foster a mind - boggling nexus of analysis and communication .
" Oh , what 's this ?
North Korea just tested a nuclear device ?
What are the implications for the share price of IBM ? "
I do n't know , and neither does anybody else — no one could possibly grasp all of the information relevant to this question .
Even so , individuals who believe they have a better handle on this question than most others can put their money on the line by buying ( or shorting ) IBM stock , and waiting for events to bear out their minority view .
There is no guarantee , of course , that the current crop of capitalists will make the right forecasts , but as with every other occupation here too the free market does an excellent job of pruning : people who repeatedly make erroneous bets in the stock market lose all of their money and can no longer disrupt share prices .
Over time , those with the most influence on the stock market are the ones who best predicted its movements in the past .
Who Cares If Share Prices Are " Correct " ?
The leftist reader might giggle at the naïveté of the above analysis .
Who cares about speeding price adjustments , when the " correct " price is itself a completely arbitrary number , based on asymmetric power relations , herd mentality , and self - fulfilling prophesies ?
As with the efficient market hypothesis , certain academic economists do indeed go too far when they completely rule out " irrational " behavior .
However , we must n't commit the opposite error of viewing stock prices as nothing but randomly generated numbers , which have no correspondence to objective economic realities .
Just to illustrate the point , let 's consider an absurd example .
Suppose that everyone on the Earth except you , dear reader , refused to believe that Microsoft shares would ever sell for more than $ 1 as of tomorrow at the opening bell .
The immediate consequence of this strange alteration in expectations would be , of course , an immediate collapse in Microsoft stock .
Even though its stock might currently be trading for $ 28.50 , those owners would try to unload their shares before the market closed today .
But if everyone except you , the reader , believed the price would be at most $ 1 by tomorrow morning , they would n't offer very much for the shares today .
Some transactions might occur at intermediate numbers in the mad race to the bottom , but very quickly ( once everyone realized everyone else thought the same thing )
Microsoft stock would be trading at $ 1 or less .
Now in this insane scenario , what would you , dear reader , do ?
In a famous chapter from the General Theory , John Maynard Keynes argued that the stock market ( at least in its unregulated form ) was a giant game of Musical Chairs ( capitalization in the original ) .
He implied that in our Microsoft example , you would be rendered a capitalist Cassandra ; even though you would know that Microsoft really " should " be priced above $ 1 , it would n't pay for you to purchase it , since everyone else 's ludicrous beliefs would make their predictions come true .
Keynes would argue that , ironically , you too should n't offer more than $ 1 for the stock , since you would never be able to find anyone to buy it back from you ( at an even higher price ) in the future .
As with most of the clever arguments in the General Theory , this one too is dead wrong .
If ( by hypothesis ) nothing had changed with Microsoft 's underlying business prospects , then you would certainly do well to purchase the stock and gain access to the flow of dividend payments issued periodically by Microsoft .
Indeed , one standard definition of the " correct " stock price for a company is the present discounted value of its future dividend payments .
Even if we changed the absurd story away from Microsoft , and to a company that historically has never paid dividends , it would still make sense to buy ownership in a profitable company at rock - bottom share prices .
For one thing , the board of directors might change the dividend policy ( in light of the crazy behavior of traders regarding its stock ) .
Remember : A Stock Is a Share of the Company Itself !
Although one can benefit from buying an undervalued stock because of dividend payments , this is only part of the story .
The more glaring point — yet one that is typically overlooked in discussions of Wall Street — is that stock shares are partial ownership claims on the corporation itself .
Thus , if our ridiculous scenario above came to pass , and Microsoft shares fell to $ 1 each , that means a group of investors could literally buy Microsoft itself for " only " $ 9.83 billion .
Forget about the present value of future net revenues — speculators could almost certainly take Microsoft and sell off its assets to other companies , settle its debts , and still earn more than $ 10 billion .
Because of this very possibility , hedge funds , investment banks , and other gigantic financial organizations would gladly snatch up Microsoft shares at $ 1 apiece , even if they truly believed the share price would never budge one cent above it .
Of course , this leads us to reflect that this very action on the part of professional traders would push Microsoft stock above $ 1 .
Thus we see that , even if I rig the example by giving everyone in the world erroneous expectations regarding share prices , nonetheless the stock price will move back towards its " correct " value so long as people are allowed to seek personal gain through other channels .
Stock prices are no more arbitrary than tractor prices , and correct stock prices are just as important ( indeed , more so ) than correct tractor prices .
It is worthwhile to reflect on this last statement .
What would happen if tractor prices were set randomly ?
There would be many ( disastrous ) consequences , but to name just two :
The proper amount of tractors would n't be produced .
As Ludwig von Mises 's critique of socialism illustrated , market prices in capital goods are essential for the economical allocation of society 's scarce resources .
If tractor prices were set below their " true " levels , then not enough resources would go into the production of tractors .
These resources would flow into other goods and services that consumers considered inferior to the products made possible by additional tractors .
On the other hand , if tractor prices were arbitrarily set too high ( and farmers erroneously paid these prices ) , then resources would be wasted in the production of too many tractors , where " too many " is defined relative to consumer preferences .
Even if we ignore these long - run issues and focus on a given quantity of tractors at the moment , arbitrary prices would still lead to the improper ( from the standpoint of economic efficiency ) use of tractors .
In particular , a price set too low would allow farmers and others to gain ownership and hence disposition of tractors who should n't have such control .
For example , if actual John Deere tractors sold for $ 50 , many parents would no doubt buy them as Christmas or birthday presents for their 10 - year - old sons to drive around aimlessly in the back yard .
It 's not that there is anything intrinsically wasteful about such gifts .
Rather , we know that under current economic conditions it would be a colossal mistake to divert , say , 300 tractors into the young boys ' possession , because these tractors could provide much more valuable services in other lines .
The free market price is the peaceful mechanism of keeping these productive machines out of Johnny 's hands .
Although John Sr. might pay $ 50 to give his son a John Deere for Christmas , he would n't pay $ 100,000 for the novelty .
What is true for tractors carries over to shares of stock .
Although it 's not as tangible as a tractor , nonetheless a publicly traded corporation represents a combination of scarce resources ; the corporation itself can be viewed as a capital good .
As with other capital goods ( such as tractors ) , the corporation has an overall price , and the person who pays the market price is then the owner and can do whatever he wants with his property ( without violating the property of others , of course ) .
Among other problems , if Microsoft shares fell to , say , one millionth of a dollar each , this would be disastrous because Joe Schmoe might buy the entire company for a hundred bucks and play software king for fun .
Now Joe Schmoe might be a poor genius who ends up leading the next revolution in software design , or ( more likely ) he will introduce such innovations as a mandatory game of Minesweeper ( Intermediate level ) every time Excel is opened .
As with tractors , the way to keep Microsoft out of the hands of Joe Schmoe is to set its market price beyond his means — which in the case of Microsoft is $ 282 billion .
Finally , I 'll close by pointing out that even the long - run supply of corporations has a " correct " amount , in the same sense as the long - run quantity of tractors .
Although economists argue about the relative importance of various factors , they can agree that one of the underlying functions of a firm is to reduce transaction costs .
According to Ronald Coase , the firm 's boundaries include those operations that it can perform more cheaply than outsourcing to others .
There is thus a true , economic benefit from the existence of firms ; if the government outlawed such organizations tomorrow , and insisted that everyone be an independent entrepreneur , we would all be much , much poorer .
Once we realize the importance of firms themselves , it is easier to understand the crucial function of the market price of these firms .
To make an obvious illustration :
An individual or family with a small business yet great product line can currently " go public " by issuing shares of stock .
This allows the organization not only to buy larger factories , hire additional secretaries , janitors , assembly line workers , and so forth , but also to bring in high - priced CEOs and other " middle management " professionals who , despite the public 's distaste , do perform valuable services .
But the degree to which the small enterprise can expand ( by issuing stock ) is dependent on the share price it achieves , and thus a correct share price is crucial to ensuring an efficient allocation of scarce factories , as well as CEOs .
Conclusion
Despite their horrible reputation , stock speculators perform a crucial service in the market economy .
Their attempts to buy low and sell high quickly eliminate mispricings in the stock market .
Although not at first obvious , accurate stock prices are crucial to an efficient use of society 's resources .
The average Joe — and senator ! — does n't need to worry about supply disruptions , labor disputes , or natural resource exhaustion .
All of these factors , and thousands more , are watched every day by thousands of experts .
These experts are not appointed by politicians , and are disciplined by the market itself : stock speculators who continually make bad forecasts soon lose their financial capital and thus any influence on the market .

“ It is based on a recognition of the astonishing beauty of things and their living wholeness , and on a rational acceptance of the fact that mankind is neither central nor important in the universe ; our vices and blazing crimes are as insignificant as our happiness .
We know this , of course , but it does not appear that any previous one of ten thousand religions and philosophies has realized it .
An infant feels himself to be central and of primary importance ; an adult knows better ; it seems time that the human race attained to an adult habit of thought in this regard . ”
Robinson Jeffers
Preface , The Double Axe and
Other Poems
The words Robinson Jeffers unleashed in 1947 did not endear him to the established order of things , nor the public at large .
While there is little to dispute in his logic , when applied to the cosmic order , The Double Axe likely sealed his demise in academic and critical circles .
It is not good business to be against war in a time of hyperpatriotism .
It is not good business to suggest that centuries of western philosophy and theology have been mistaken .
It is most assuredly bad business to tell any audience , especially an American one , to grow the hell up .
It shows a good deal of bravery , but it ignores an essential truism about mass communication : no one likes the truth - teller .
No doubt Jeffers has rolled in his grave so many times over that Texaco has considered attaching a bit to his corpse to drill for some of those waning ounces of black gold .
It is a curious debate to be had on whether Jeffers might have known that some sixty years hence , the world ’s lone superpower would not only fall short of the mark in terms of cosmic awareness … it would extend its indifference beyond the world around , including the very people that its core philosophy held paramount .
This callous disregard for our fellow man seems to be the dominant theme emerging in the oeuvre of Michael Moore .
Distilled to the essence , this is what Moore ’s films have illustrated with outrage , humor and poignancy .
If it is the indifference to the plight of the American and international working class , as seen in Roger & Me and The Big One ; if it is the casual approach to gun violence in our culture of fear that Bowling for Columbine masterfully exhibits ; if it comes in the voices of the helpless Iraqis in the jarring footage of Fahrenheit 911 , the underlying message tying all of these elements is clearly that we just do n’t seem to collectively give a damn about our fellow human beings .
Which brings us to Moore ’s latest offering , Sicko .
Much of the media surrounding Sicko would lead the viewer to believe that this is an about face from the combative and , in the eyes of his critics , solipsistic filmmaking approach that has made Mike famous .
If one only has the major media to rely on for a general idea , it would not be beyond reason for him to think that Sicko is a completely different ball of wax .
Fox News gave it good reviews , for heaven ’s sake .
True , Moore has polished his approach .
The film does n’t lose the real story , though in fairness it is hard to think of an example where Moore is more memorable from Roger forward than the subjects of his documentaries .
The hubbub of the kinder , gentler Mike seems to be more a result of news outlets looking for an original angle ( as opposed to reasoned reportage ) and giving offerings at the precipice of the echo chamber .
To the delight of his fans , and for some reason without the dismay of many of his detractors , Sicko is actually vintage Moore .
His filmmaking has evolved , as is in evidence from the more subdued pacing of this latest offering , but is n’t that to be expected ?
Though fewer in number , the sardonic historical footage , replete with not - so - subtle allusions to our irrational response to L’ennemi du jour , is still present .
The somewhat maudlin moments of empathy to his hard luck protagonists are as often as anything else in the Moore canon .
Predatory capitalism ’s vicissitudes are logged with the same force .
George Bush says some very stupid things .
All the ingredients are there , but it could certainly be argued that Sicko delivers the message better than any of its counterparts .
For starters , the film begins with a twist .
When it was revealed that Michael Moore was making a documentary on the health care crisis in the United States , most people likely concluded that it would concern the nearly 50 million Americans without health insurance .
The opening passages deal with some case studies of this group .
As we are told , though , “ this film is not about ( them ) . ”
The majority of Sicko deals with Americans suffering the effects of having insurance as we know it .
Sicko delivers a scathing indictment on the American health care system .
Basically , the argument is made anecdotally .
The story is that of Larry and Diana Smith , for whom medical debt meant relocating to their daughter ’s utility room .
It is that of Julie and Tracy , a Kansas City couple who suffers a tragic and unnecessary loss despite the fact that Julie works at and is insured by the very hospital refusing treatment for her husband .
We see a bit of congressional testimony admitting to what seems obvious to anyone who has ever dealt with an HMO : the less treatment a patient receives , the better for the company .
Insured , middle class people are dying without any reason .
That the focus tends to be more on the middle class than the working class might go far in explaining why this particular film is getting a much better reception than its predecessors .
To take a quite utilitarian view , it could be said that this revelation is more jarring because we expect the poor in America to die from preventable disease .
That the family in the Bedford , Texas subdivision with the two cars and boat are languishing despite a solid diagnosis and a proven means of treatment is news to many .
Basically , it works like this : to receive a reasonable standard of care , one must get through the application , with its plethora of conditions and red flags for preexisting conditions .
Fair enough , but then the patient must be fortunate enough to sidestep the bean counters when care is pursued .
Should he or she actually receive the treatment , said patient better hope there was no fudging on the application .
If there was , and odds are in favor of that , then Aetna , Humana , Blue Cross et al , have people to investigate in order to recoup their cost .
As one insider puts it , “ We ’re going to go after this like it was a murder case . ”
It seems like the people in Sicko would be the only folks out there who did trust the insurance racket .
Many of us are rightfully cynical of the industry .
Sicko succeeds in giving a host of concrete examples that reveal just how cynical we should be .
( See : the Nixon tapes that spotlight the birth of the HMO and the health care industry parlance ’s definition for a “ medical loss . ” )
True to form , Mike takes us again to our neighbors to the north .
Naturally , Canadians display a combination of incredulity and empathy for our condition .
It is a high bar , but this may be the best Canadian footage to be found in Moore ’s work .
The bogeyman of socialized medicine , with its long lines , substandard care and red tape , is roundly refuted .
Beyond the frozen tundra , the viewer is treated to point - counterpoint examples of the health care apparatus in Great Britain , France and even Cuba , both Guantanamo and Fidel ’s part of the island .
All of these developed , and even underdeveloped , countries have universal , single - payer health care .
They all seem to be working quite nice .
The doctors are paid handsomely , people receive the care they need , and , in the case of Great Britain , the cashier is the guy reimbursing patients their travel expenses to the hospital .
France and Cuba serve as the clearest opposites .
This is obvious , given the animosity Americans show towards the two countries .
We need not discuss the social and political differences at length .
Indeed , we should n’t .
As the film clearly points out , maybe we should take some cues from both in order to shore up a health care apparatus that is callous to the point of sadism .
If the dominant note is indifference to suffering , the tonic is that of economics .
Reminiscent of Moore ’s observation in The Big One that layoffs lead to desperation and then possibly crime , which suits the system well because private prisons are performing the services of the laid off , Sicko paints the picture of the debtor nation hooked on pharmaceuticals to allay the stress of all the unseen consequences involved in the presumed agreement between our government and ourselves that you do n’t tax and we do n’t ask for services .
This underlying theme could use further elaboration , but in a sprawling , information packed film of two hours , the lack thereof can be forgiven .
Suffice it to say that Sicko might make us engage in a national conversation about whether or not this compact serves the population .
So , we return to a society in emotional infancy .
Just as Jeffers lamented the shortsightedness of defecating in the nest , this film raises some serious questions about our priorities as Americans .
If one stipulates that the rest of the industrialized world pays far more in taxes … and the contrary could certainly be argued on percentages … then the question that begs to be asked is “ What are they getting for it ? ”
The French welfare state is lambasted in our mainstream media circles , but what is the cost of our buy now pay later mentality ?
If you had to pay a little more , or demand that our government make better use of the billions it has to work with , in order to have education and medicine , would you ?
The average American household surely bears more of a debt burden than what it would cost to provide every citizen in the richest nation on the planet with the fundamental services the Canadian hegemon enjoys .
As history will show , the only people with something to lose are the insurance and health maintenance industries that spent millions putting Hillary ( Rodham ? )
Clinton in her place and subsequently spent nearly a million to keep her in their pocket .
This may mean that we might have to live in a house that is n’t twice as much as we need , eat right , exercise and either pay a little more in taxes or activate politically to hold our legislators accountable .
Would that be too much to ask ?�
The bad news , Mike , is that this would be telling us to put down the toys and grow the hell up .
No doubt the denizens of our health care industry will combat this documentary with their own appeal to be a good citizen and keep shopping .
It is n’t 2004 , and we all know Michael Moore ’s work ca n’t change the country .
Let ’s hope that at least this conversation will reemerge .
One ca n’t be sure of what consensus will be reached at the conclusion of the national conversation .
The good news for Moore is that truth is on his side .
The bad news … well , you might want to consult Robinson Jeffers .

To start a conversation with someone on the train , bus , or subway , start by getting the person ’s attention , then find something that they want to talk about .
When you see someone you want to talk to , glance at them and smile .
Use open body language , like keeping your arms uncrossed and facing them fully .
If the person looks away , puts a book or newspaper in front of their face , or moves , then do n't bother them .
However , if they return your gaze , smile , or look relaxed , then approach them to start talking .
If there ’s a seat available next to them , ask “ Is this seat taken ? ”
Break the ice by asking an open - ended question , like “ How are you handling the heat ” or “ How do you get downtown from here ? ”
To help the person feel more comfortable , talk about yourself before asking a question , like “ This is my first time on the train .
Do you ride often , or is this your first time too ? ”

The following are 10 unconventional weight loss tips that worked for me .
Between January 4 , 2006 and March 31 , 2006 I lost fifty pounds .
These tips work well because almost every tip is focused around completing a small goal .
In my opinion , to stay motivated and lose a significant amount of weight , you should complete many goals in a short period of time .
The reason I call these tips unconventional is that I had not seen a majority of them before starting my diet .
I will start by recognizing the typical “ calories in , calories out ” schpeil .
Yes , to lose weight you have to eat well and exercise .
But there is much more to it than that , and I do n’t want to spend time regurgitating ideas you ’ve heard before .
That brings me to the first point :
Buy a digital scale
This seems easy enough .
I recommend that before starting a diet , buy a scale that is accurate to .2 ( two - tenth of a pound ) .
I will explain why below .
I also recommend either buying a scale that can record your daily weight , or manually logging your weight everyday .
I bought a scale that was accurate to .2 and logged my weight at Sam ’s Club for $ 22 .
It has been a great investment .
Weigh yourself everyday
You ’ll find that almost every other dieter will tell you to weigh yourself only once a week .
I recommend the exact opposite .
I am very goal oriented and I like to see results everyday .
The reason I recommend buying a scale that is accurate to the .2 is that there is a very big difference between weighting 170.8 one day and 170.0 the next day .
Losing .8 pounds in one day is excellent .
However , if your scale is not accurate enough to report the loss and still shows 170 after a day of healthy eating and working out , you will feel extremely discouraged .
A more detailed scale makes it easier to keep a positive outlook .
The more successes ( days with positive weight loss ) the easier it is .
Advertising
Drink 8 glasses of water everyday
This one is obvious and broadly recommended , however , the reason I recommend it is slightly different .
Drinking eight glasses of water per day helps you “ feel less hungry . ”
I ca n’t prove this scientifically , however , when I am at work , I drink 4 cups in the morning and 4 cups in the evening .
On the days that I do n’t drink the water , I feel hungrier , earlier .
Also , on the days I do n’t drink water I feel sleepier , sooner .
Do n’t feel intimidated by trying to drink 8 glasses of water .
Try doing what I do : I have a pint glass I keep at work , it holds sixteen ounces ( as all pint glasses do ) .
All I do is drink two pints of water in the morning and two in the afternoon .
Make your diet public
Tell people you ’re on a diet .
There ’s no reason to be ashamed to be on a diet .
I found that trying to keep my diet a secret was harder than just telling people .
In fact , telling your coworkers , girlfriend , family , etc. will increase your accountability .
It motivated me knowing that my coworkers and family knew that I was dieting because I did not want to fail .
I also chose a typical “ fat picture ” and put it on my fridge , in my cubicle , and on my wall .
I wanted to have a continual reminder to lose the weight .
I know it ’s a cliche , but it was important for me to remind myself of my ultimate goal .
I feel I should also note that although I was 50 pounds over weight , when I told people I was on a diet they often said “ you do n’t need to diet . ”
I found this surprising because I was obviously overweight .
Beware that you will likely hear similar comments .
I found it easier to just accept the “ compliment ” than to try to justify my diet to them .
Remember that you are on a diet for you , and that you do not need to justify yourself .
Advertising
Do n’t diet on the weekends
This is another unconventional bit of advice .
I was able to lose 50 pounds without dieting on the weekends .
I found myself tired , depressed , and unmotivated if I tried to continue my diet into the weekend .
I felt that Friday and Saturday ( my weekend ) was a time to celebrate 5 days of dieting .
You may not find this necessary , especially in the first few weeks of a diet .
However , as many weeks passed , the weekend became a time for me to celebrate my weekly successes and get myself mentally prepared for another five days of dieting .
I considered it a mental recharge .
Do n’t sacrifice your life for your diet
On occasion , you will find yourself unable to eat healthy .
Whether this is because of lunches with your team at work , birthdays , or special occasions , there will be events that you just ca n’t ( or do n’t want to ) eat healthy .
A diet will feel overwhelming if you have to sacrifice special events in your life .
The way I combated this was to exchange a day that I was not going to diet on the weekend .
In other words , if I did n’t diet on Tuesday , for example , I would diet on Saturday , instead .
Make the small changes
This is a pretty common tip , however , I have a twist to it .
Rather than giving up what most diets say you should give up ( soda , coffee , beer , caffeine , etc. ) just make healthier decisions .
I did n’t want to give anything up , so I decided to make some changes instead .
The first switch I made was switching to diet soda .
Do n’t worry , you ’ll quickly get used to the flavor .
Before I started my diet , I swore I would never drink diet soda .
Now thanks to my girlfriend , diet is the only soda I drink .
The second switch I made was to drinking black coffee .
Cut out the sugar and creme , and you get the benefits of coffee ( caffeine ) without the calories .
The last major switch I made was to “ healthy ” beer .
I ’m a Miller Lite drinker , however , by temporarily switching to Beck ’s Premier Light ( 60 calories per serving ) I was able to still enjoy a healthy social life while maintaining my diet .
Advertising
In addition to making the small changes in your diet , make the small changes in your life : park further away , walk to the end of the train platform and get in the last car , and vow not to take an elevator for an entire week .
I also found it advantageous to wear a pedometer and try to compete against myself for how far I could walk in a single day .
The furthest I walked in a day was 6.5 miles .
I voluntarily walked to work twice a week .
Gain perspective by understanding the fractions
Your diet is an incredibly small fraction of your life .
If you live for 80 years , and dieted for four months , that would only be .42 % of your life .
That ’s right , if you diet for four months , it will be less than one half of one percent of your life .
On the other hand think of the major benefits you can get from . 42 % of your life .
If it helps you stay motivated , count down the days starting at 120 .
Rationalize your workouts
Finding the time to get to the gym can be very difficult .
However a 1/ 2 hour workout is only 2 % of your day ( assuming 24 hour days ) .
For me , the most motivating thought was comparing my workouts to sitcoms .
As a huge Everybody Loves Raymond fan , every time I would sit down to watch an episode , I would remind myself that in the 1/2 hour that I was sitting and doing nothing , I could complete my daily workout .
Advertising
You ’ve lost the weight , what now ?
Have a red flag weight
Once you ’ve lost the weight , you need to keep it off .
This is where the red flag comes in .
You need to pick a weight and vow to never get heavier than it again .
It is normal for your body to fluctuate five to ten pounds .
I recommend picking a weight that is ten pounds heavier than what you “ normally ” weigh and never weigh more than it again .
Setting a red flag weight allowed me to keep off every pound for over 1 year .
Lastly , for the curious out there …I followed the Weight Watchers diet .
I did not pay for the diet , nor did I go to meetings .
I found out all the information about the diet on - line .
The first place to look is at their patent .
All well known diets are available via Google Patent Search .
For the several months that I was dieting , I also gave up red meat and made sure to drink a lot of milk .
The preceding tips worked perfectly for me and they will work for you , too .
Prior to creating my own diet plan , I tried to diet several times and failed every time .
I swear by these weight loss tips .
What do you think of them ?
Do you have a tip that did n’t make my list ?
Let us know in the comments .
I will be glad to answer any questions or defend any point .
Democrats call for ' no confidence ' vote on Gonzales Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday May 17 , 2007 Print This Email This Two Democratic senators leading an investigation into whether Alberto Gonzales was involved in firing eight US Attorneys for political motives are calling for a vote of " no confidence " in the embattled Attorney General .
Sens. Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) and Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) plan to introduce a nonbinding resolution expressing the sense that the Senate has lost confidence in Gonzales 's ability to run the Justice Department .
Though the measure would not directly impact Gonzales 's ability to keep his job , it would force Republicans to go on record with their support of the attorney general .
The announcement of the no-confidence measure , which was first reported by Roll Call , comes as Gonzales finds himself under a growing avalanche of criticism .
Five Republican senators -- joined today by Sen. Norm Coleman -- already have called for his resignation , and experts say his close , personal friendship with President Bush is the only reason he still has a job .
" It seems the only person who has confidence in the attorney general is President Bush , " Schumer told reporters , according to the Associated Press .
" The president long ago should have asked the attorney general to step down . "
Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said during a committee hearing Thursday that he did n't think Gonzales 's would be able to keep his job through the US Attorney scandal .
Congressional investigations and press reports continue to expose inconsistencies in his accounts of firing the eight prosecutors .
The attorney general has maintained that only the eight were considered for dismissal , but the Washington Post reported today that the number of prosecutors facing the chopping block was three times that high .
FUNDRAISER CASHES IN -- OBAMA GETS ZERO / Real presidential campaign warns unauthorized effort in state to cease

The state chairman of the " Californians for Obama " campaign has raised thousands of dollars in donations through promotions ranging from celebrity - studded Mexican cruises to CD sales to campaign office " grand openings " in support of the popular Illinois Democratic senator and presidential candidate .
But the official presidential campaign of Barack Obama said Tuesday it was unaware of the activities of the entirely unauthorized Los Angeles - based fundraising efforts of Emmett Cash III -- a self - proclaimed former movie mogul who was a registered Republican until last month .
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton , after being informed by The Chronicle of Cash 's fundraising activities , said the senator 's camp Tuesday issued a stern warning " asking him to close operations . "
Cash , a week after he earned media coverage and addressed supporters at a " Californians for Obama " campaign office opening in San Bernardino , insists he has done nothing illegal .
But critics say his independent efforts to parlay Obama 's presidential drive into a fundraising bonanza illustrates an increasingly disturbing trend in political campaigns of the Internet age -- the proliferation of entrepreneurs who use technology to scoop up voter donations without official campaign sanction .
Cash 's " Californians for Obama " boasted an official - looking Web site ( www.californiansforobama.com) that was graced by a smiling photo of the candidate .
The site pitched a star - studded Obama " Women of Power " cruise for 2,000 to Mexico that attracted donors like a 65 - year - old woman from Compton ( Los Angeles County ) , who said she has paid the $ 2,423 cruise fee believing the funds would help support her candidate .
But a Chronicle examination of the latest Federal Election Commission records on file for the organization for the reporting period ending June 30 shows that while Cash has raised nearly $ 10,000 this year , not one dollar has gone to the Obama campaign -- or any other political candidate .
Indeed , nearly two thirds of the group 's 2007 funding has already been paid out either to Cash himself -- for listed expenses such as salary and travel and snacks -- or to his organization 's accounting firm , Burbank - based Durkee & Associates .
Other expenses include U.S. postage and signs , the records show .
Cash , reached Tuesday by phone in his Southern California offices , said he has never claimed his efforts are official or beneficial to the Illinois senator 's campaign .
The businessman -- who has described himself in past newspaper reports as the former head of Los Angeles - based New World Motion Pictures Studios and associated with films like " Dr. Black , Mr. Hyde " -- notes that his Web sites and literature specify that his group is " an independent committee . "
" We do n't speak for the campaign , " he said .
Cash 's group has raised cash with recent advertising pitches for events such as the Sept. 21 " Women of Power " Carnival cruise to Mexico -- which boasts star attendees like singer Eartha Kitt , poet Maya Angelou and Rep. Diane Watson , D - Los Angeles .
The legendary Kitt " will be interested to know that , " Andrew Freidman , her longtime publicist , said wryly of the chanteuse 's advertised cruise appearance .
" She 'll be performing at the Carlyle in New York during those dates . "
Angelou , the celebrated author , might also be surprised by the invite :
She 's officially endorsed New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton for president .
And staffers in Watson 's Washington office insisted that they know nothing of the trip -- and it is n't on the congresswoman 's schedule .
Cash said his advertisements have noted that the celebrities are " due to availability . "
But Ercell Hoffman , 65 , of Compton said Tuesday she had put her hard - earned cash into a rare political donation to " Californians for Obama " -- $ 2,423.76 to go on the Obama Women of Power cruise with the double goal of rubbing elbows with admired women and helping her favorite presidential candidate .
Hoffman said she was heartbroken when The Chronicle informed her that her donation for passage on the three - day trip from Long Beach to Ensenada -- for which Carnival Cruise lines charges $ 349 -- is n't benefiting Obama 's campaign , something she insisted cruise organizers never told her .
" You 're kidding me , " said Hoffman , a licensed marriage and family counselor .
" It seems to me that 's fraudulent .
That 's incredible .
It 's called Californians for Obama .
... I thought they were representatives of Obama . "
In a 2008 presidential race that is both competitive and consumed with campaign fundraising , the existence of such unauthorized or independent fundraising organizations is not only a cautionary tale to campaigns but to donors as well , political veterans say .
The Federal Election Commission says that such independent fundraising groups have existed for decades and are entirely legal -- as long as they cannot be directly connected to campaigns or fraudulently suggest such a connection to gather donations .
But Obama spokesman Burton said the campaign believes that the efforts should cease because it appears to be " an unauthorized use of the senator 's name to raise money .
...
We want to make sure people are protected . "
Democratic campaign strategist Garry South said such trouble underscores how , for a candidate like Obama -- who has been a formidable fundraiser on the Internet -- " there are a lot of advantages to the Internet and its use in politics , but there also is a nasty underbelly .
This is an example . "
" People can raise money any way they want , and there is not a hell of a lot that a campaign can do about it unless there 's outright fraud , " he said .
" One of the reasons people are poaching on Obama is that he 's a very hot candidate on the Internet . "
But Democratic strategist Dan Newman , also unaffiliated with any presidential campaign , says the freewheeling efforts of Cash 's group suggest concerns about Obama 's official campaign organization in the nation 's most populous state -- a fundraising mother lode .
With an unauthorized group doing business since 2006 , he said , the " strongly worded threats from attorneys " should have come sooner .
" Campaigns have to make it easy and accessible for supporters to get involved in their campaign officially , and they have to react strongly and clearly when something like this comes up , " Newman said .
Ironically , Cash , the unofficial group 's director , has hardly been shy about seeking publicity .
His colorful ventures -- reported in a variety of newspapers over the decades -- have included boasts in 2002 of establishing a new , Hollywood - style movie mecca in Jackson , Miss. , and an official announcement in 2000 that his movie firm had signed a historic 12 - film deal with the Chinese government .
Identified alternately as a boxing promoter , an Olympics booster and the head of a minority contractor 's association , Cash also was identified as director of a 1979 " Miss Black America " contest deserted by judges and lambasted by contestants who complained of living conditions that included cockroaches and meals of salami sandwiches .
On the political front , Los Angeles County voter registration records show that until just last month , Cash was a registered Republican .
He has been previously identified as national chair of " Citizens for Powell , " to draft former Secretary of State Colin Powell for president , and as the " national coordinator " for Perot Voters , a group supporting the presidential campaign of Ross Perot .
Last week , Cash got coverage in the San Bernardino County Sun and was identified as " Obama 's state campaign chairman " as he announced the opening of " Californians for Obama " campaign offices there , though the Obama campaign has no official operation in the city .
Earlier this year , papers in Bakersfield also called Cash " a representative of Barack Obama " and reported on his speech at the local Doubletree Hotel , where he boasted there would soon be " Teachers for Obama , " " Students for Obama , " " Housewives for Obama " and many other groups to help raise $ 40 million for the candidate .
Cash allowed Tuesday that while none of his organization 's money has gone directly to Obama 's official effort , he has contributed to the senator 's run , urging contributors to write checks , sending out mail advertisements and helping to push for voter registration .
He said he has only aimed " to raise money to cover the expenses of what ( we 're ) doing ... it does take a little bit to run up and down the state and to carry people with you . "
Cash , saying he wanted to ensure that Obama supporters were satisfied with their affiliation , also promised to refund Compton resident Hoffman 's cruise donation immediately .
" We 've done everything in accord with the law , and we want to do things to make it better , " Cash said , adding his organization has only one goal : " We want a part of this great man , too . "
Burton says the Obama campaign is well aware of independent committees and groups that aim to help candidates in the 2008 presidential race .
" There are a lot of folks who want to show their support in a lot of different ways , " he said .
" But we encourage people , if they want to help out , to do it directly through the campaign . "
They 're not on board
The Web site for " Californians for Obama , " an independent fundraising organization founded last year , had all the hallmarks of an official campaign Web site -- but was n't affiliated with the presidential effort for Illinois Sen. Barack Obama .
The Web site invited potential donors to take part in a lavish Mexican cruise featuring celebrities -- some of whom said they 'd never heard of the group , including :
Eartha Kitt : Staff says she will not attend .
Rep. Diane Watson : Staff members say they know nothing about the event .
Maya Angelou : Official supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton .

Published : Thursday May 24 , 2007 Print This Email This Even though former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani earned hearty rounds of applause at the last GOP presidential debate after he lashed out at fellow Republican candidate Ron Paul over comments he had made regarding the CIA term " blowback , " the Texas congressman is n't backing down .
" Longshot Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul on Thursday gave front - runner Rudy Giuliani a list of foreign - policy books to back up his contention that attacks by Islamic militants are fueled by the U.S. presence in the Middle East , " Andy Sullivan reports for Reuters .
" ' I 'm giving Mr. Giuliani a reading assignment , ' the nine - term Texas congressman said as he stood behind a stack of books that included the report by the commission that examined the attacks on the United States on Sept. 11 , 2001 . "
In a press release obtained by RAW STORY , Paul 's campaign chairman Kent Snyer says , " I hope Rudy Giuliani reads these books from top foreign policy experts .
We have also included some Cliffs Notes in case Mr. Giuliani is too busy giving $ 100,000 speeches on national security . "
At the May 15 debate , Paul said , " I 'm suggesting we listen to the people who attacked us [ on Sept. 11 ] and the reason they did it , and they 're delighted " that US troops are in Iraq because they provide easy targets for terrorists .
Paul was responding to a question about the origins of terrorist attacks on US soil and noted the generations - long history of US involvement in Middle East politics , including a CIA - sponsored coup to overthrow Iran 's leader in 1953 and regular bombing missions in Iraq over the decade before 9/11 .
" I do n't think I 've heard that before , " Giuliani said , " and I 've heard some pretty absurd explanations for Sept. 11 . "
Paul said he was referring to what the CIA calls " blowback , " in mentioning the hostility American involvement might forment in foreign cultures .
" They do n't come here to attack us because we 're rich and we 're free , " Paul said .
" They attack us because we 're over there . "
Last week , a CNN contributor wrote in an opinion piece that Paul 's assertion in that week 's Republican presidential debate that American foreign policy in the Middle East invited the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 should not be dismissed , lest Americans continue to ignore the lessons of history .
" As Americans , we believe in forgiving and forgetting , and are terrible at understanding how history affects us today , " wrote Roland S. Martin , who also hosts a talk show in Chicago .
" We are arrogant in not recognizing that when we benefit , someone else may suffer .
That will lead to resentment and anger , and if suppressed , will boil over one day . "
Earlier today , the Associated Press reported that an upcoming Senate Intelligence Committee report states that the Bush administration was warned before the invasion that a US presence in Iraq would actually increase terrorist influence .
" Officials familiar with the Senate Intelligence Committee investigation also say analysts warned against U.S. domination in the region , which could increase extremist recruiting , " the AP reported .
" The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the report 's declassification is not finished .
It could be made public as soon as this week . "
The " Reading for Rudy " list includes Chalmers Johnson 's Blowback , Robert A. Pape 's Dying to Win , and Michael Scheuer 's Imperial Hubris , along with the 9 - 11 Commission Report .
Paul 's press release contained the following " Cliff Notes " for Giuliani : # " His [ bin Laden ] rhetoric selectively draws from multiple sources -- Islam , history , and the region 's political and economic malaise .
He also stresses grievances against the United States widely shared in the Muslim world .
He inveighed against the presence of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia , the home of Islam 's holiest sites .
He spoke of the suffering of the Iraqi people as a result of sanctions imposed after the Gulf War ... " -- 9/11 Commission Report , pages 48 - 49 " There are a lot of things that are different now [ after the invasion of Iraq ] , and one that has gone by almost unnoticed -- but it 's huge -- is that by complete mutual agreement between the US and the Saudi government we can now remove almost all of our forces from Saudi Arabia .
Their presence there over the last 12 years has been a source of enormous difficulty for a friendly government .
It 's been a huge recruiting device for al - Qaeda .
In fact if you look at bin Laden , one of his principle grievances was the presence of so- called crusader forces on the holy land , Mecca and Medina .
I think just lifting that burden from the Saudis is itself going to open the door to other positive things . " -- Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , Vanity Fair , May 2003
" One of the greatest dangers for Americans in deciding how to confront the Islamist threat lies in continuing to believe -- at the urging of senior U.S. leaders -- that Muslims hate and attack us for what we are and think , rather than for what we do .
The Islamic world is not so offended by our democratic system of politics , guarantees of personal rights and civil liberties , and separation of church and state that it is willing to wage war against overwhelming odds in order to stop Americans from voting , speaking freely , and praying , or not , as they wish . " -- Michael Scheuer , Imperial Hubris , page 8
" We assume , moreover , that bin Laden and the Islamists hate us for our liberty , freedoms , and democracy -- not because they and many millions of Muslims believe U.S. foreign policy is an attack on Islam or because the U.S. military now has a ten - year record of smashing people and things in the Islamic world . " -- Michael Scheuer , Imperial Hubris , page 165 " The U.S. invasion of Iraq is Osama bin Laden 's gift from America , one he has long and ardently desired , but never realistically expected . " -- Michael Scheuer , Imperial Hubris , page 213 " Although suicide terrorism is virtually always a response to foreign occupation , only some occupations lead to this result .
Suicide terrorism is most likely when the occupying power 's religion differs from the religion of the occupied , for three reasons .
A conflict across a religious divide increases fears that the enemy will seek to transform the occupied society ; makes demonization , and therefore killing , of enemy civilians easier ; and makes it easier to use one 's own religion to relabel suicides that would otherwise be taboo as martyrdom instead . " -- Robert A. Pape , Dying to Win , page 22 " An attempt to transform Muslim societies through regime change is likely to dramatically increase the threat we face .
The root cause of suicide terrorism is foreign occupation and the threat that foreign military presence poses to the local community 's way of life .
...
Even if our intentions are good , anti-American terrorism would likely grow , and grow rapidly . " -- Robert A. Pape , Dying to Win , page 245 " The suicidal assassins of September 11 , 2001 did not ' attack America , ' as political leaders and news media in the United States have tried to maintain ; they attacked American foreign policy .
Employing the strategy of the weak , they killed innocent bystanders , whose innocence is , of course , no different from that of the civilians killed by American bombs in Iraq , Serbia , Afghanistan , and elsewhere . " -- Chalmers Johnson , Blowback , page XV " The term ' blowback , ' which officials of the Central Intelligence Agency first invented for their own internal use , is starting to circulate among students of international relations .
It refers to the unintended consequences of policies that were kept secret from the American people .
What the daily press reports as the malign acts of ' terrorists ' or ' drug lords ' or ' rogue states ' or ' illegal arms merchants ' often turn out to be blowback from earlier American operations . "

RZSL Ukrainian emergency workers saved a drunken swimmer in the Black Sea from an attack by a pod of killer dolphins who were trying to drown him .
The man was reportedly " heavily under the influence of alcohol " at the time .
He had braved the near - freezing dolphin - infested waters in the belief they would be good for his health .
That 's his story and he 's sticking to it .
The man was some 30 m from the shore when observers noticed his distress as he was harried by a feeding group .
asyl Tenishchev , a spokesman at the Ukrainian Emergency Situations Ministry , said : " If our guys had not been there , the victim surely would have been drowned .
The dolphins probably were feeding on fish by cornering schools against the pier and the breakwater , and they saw the man as competition . "
Happily , the unfortunate vodka fan escaped the ordeal unharmed , unlike the New Zealand woman who was struck by a 300 kg leaping cetacean on a pleasure cruise in the days after Christmas .
According to Sydney 's Daily Telegraph , she remains in intensive care in Auckland .
The latest dolphin outrage is classic Black Sea dolphin behaviour according to Interfax , the Russian news agency .
The mammals " lack the reputation of friendliness and love of humans enjoyed by dolphins in wealthy nations " .
Ukrainian animal misadventures have earned their inclusion in the RZSL before .
Last June , a man entered the lion enclosure at Kiev zoo proclaiming " God will save me , if he exists " .
He was promptly savaged . ®

What 's the best way to attract a pile of threatening lawyers ' letters from Microsoft ?
Sell pirate copies of Windows ?

Londoner Jamie Cansdale has just discovered a new approach .
He had the temerity to make Redmond 's software better .
As a hobby , Cansdale developed an add - on for Microsoft Visual Studio .
TestDriven.NET
allows unit test suites to be run directly from within the Microsoft IDE .
Cansdale gave away this gadget on his website , and initially received the praises of Microsoft .
In fact , Microsoft was so pleased with him , it gave him a Most Valuable Professionals ( MVP ) award , which it says it gives to " exceptional technical community leaders from around the world who voluntarily share their high quality , real world expertise with others " .
However , his cherished status did not last .
In December 2005 , he started getting emails from a Microsoft executive called Jason Weber .
The problem was that TestDriven .
NET supported the Express edition of Visual Studio .
Express is the cut - down version that anyone can download for free from the Microsoft website .
It is limited in various ways , and is intended only for hobbyists and students .
Everyone else is supposed to shell out for the paid - for versions .
In fact , as a .NET hobbyist himself , Cansdale says he used Express to develop TestDriven .
NET .
Ironically , he only got access to a fancier version of Visual Studio as part of his MVP goody - bag .
But MS does n't want you supporting Visual Studio Express with your add - ons .
Weber wrote to Cansdale that he had violated Express licence agreements : that he was accessing APIs not available to those who only had the Express version of Visual Studio , or that he had reverse engineered APIs - also forbidden .
Cansdale said from the off - and has stuck by this - that he only used APIs in the public domain , published on Microsoft 's MSDN website for all to see .
He invited Weber to be specific about the API / licence term that was violated .
Weber blanked him , and then began an exchange of increasingly acrimonious correspondence , which can be read on Cansdale 's website here and here .
In the long sequence of emails that followed , Weber treated Cansdale with immense condescension :
" Craig Symonds is a busy Microsoft executive .
We 're fortunate that we could get 30 minutes with him for a conference call " ; consistently evasive when asked to identify the specific legal problem , meanwhile trying to bully Cansdale to withdraw Visual Studio Express support and remove his " hack " .
Cansdale took legal advice , and bravely dug in his heels .
At one point , in a splendid example of the right hand being unaware of who is getting the left hand 's index finger , Cansdale got a letter presaging another MVP award only to have it hastily withdrawn the next day ( find this incident the bottom of the second page of emails . )
Finally , Microsoft lost patience , and in the last few days has hit Cansdale with a flurry of lawyers ' letters , also available on his website [ see here and here ] .
Cansdale now has until 4 pm Wednesday 6 June to disable the Visual Studio Express features of his product .
We await the deadline with bated breath .
Meanwhile , a quiet word in the ear of any earnest young programmer who is considering downloading a copy of Visual Studio Express and slaving deep into the night , striving hard in the Microsofty ways , in the hope one day of earning the glorious rank of MVP .
Do ya feel lucky , punk ? ®

Mumbai business correspondent , BBC News
Rafia Khatoon is a mother on a mission .
Online matchmaking is on the increase in India
She 's looking for a good matrimonial match for her 28 - year - old Rakshi .
Marriage is an integral part of any Indian woman 's life and it's seen as the responsibility of the parents in most Indian families to find a partner for their children .
Generally , Indian men are on the lookout for attractive , educated young women - but for the most part , Indian women are still keen to find a partner who 's financially secure .
That 's why Mrs. Khatoon insisted that her daughter sign up on bharatmatrimony.com , a wedding website that caters to more than 10 million subscribers around India .
The website claims that you can find your perfect match online - and if that does n't work , there are marriage counsellors who can help you to find your soulmate .
But Mrs Khatoon knows exactly what type of man she wants for her daughter .
" I want an IT professional , " she says , " preferably someone based in London , or someone who has the opportunity to work overseas in the future . "
Different profession , same priorities
It may seem an unusual request for a traditional Indian mother to make .
Up to a decade ago , government employees and accountants were at the top of the most - wanted list for marriage proposals in India - because they were guaranteed a stable and steady income and a lifetime of work .
But all this has changed now , thanks to the technology boom in India .
Computer - literate grooms are now all the rage
" You know , in my generation , people were n't so educated , " says Mrs Khatoon , as her daughter Rakshi looks through a list of prospective techie grooms .
" We did n't have so much exposure , so we as Indian parents thought that government employees or doctors and accountants were the best choices for our daughters .
We had never even heard of technology professionals ! "
Now , though , things have changed .
" My eldest daughter , for example , is married to an IT professional and she 's moved to London .
Her husband makes so much money - she has a nice house , a nice car .
" If my younger daughter marries an IT worker as well , then chances are she 'll be financially secure , her children will be financially secure and she will have a good life .
" What more can a mother want ? "
High demand
Murugavel Janakiraman , the chief executive of bharatmatrimony.com , insists that Mrs Khatoon and her daughter are now fast becoming the norm , and not the exception .
In the past few years India 's technology services sector has grown rapidly , adding millions of jobs to the Indian economy .
Young Indian engineering and computer science graduates , in hot demand to fill vacancies in offices around the country , have benefited the most from this boom .
I wish this had happened when I was younger
Frank Raman , technology manager , Mumbai
And because there are just not enough of them to fill all the jobs being created - India 's software trade body , Nasscom , says that there could be a shortfall of half a million IT professionals by 2010 - salaries are on the rise .
" Not only are they most sought after in the professional world , " says Mr Janakiraman , " IT men are also the hottest in the marriage market .
" IT workers can draw salaries of around $ 800 a month [ about twice those available in comparable jobs ] and that 's just at the beginning of their careers .
" They are likely to see their salaries jump more than any other professional in the country right now - with salaries rising about 20 % a year on average . "
Off the market
For the IT professionals who have spent years labouring under nicknames such as nerd , geek or computer whiz - and those are the nicer ones - this attention can come as a pleasant surprise .
They 've hardly ever been seen as the most glamorous of types .
Often stereotyped as hard working and intelligent - and well , just a little bit boring - they 're not often seen as the ideal mate .
Bharat Matrimony 's boss caters to a fast - growing market
" I wish this had happened when I was younger , " says Frank Raman , a technology manager at Datamatics in Mumbai .
" I would have been able to benefit from it at that time - now I 'm married , so girls looking to marry me I 'm afraid are out of luck ! "
His friend , Anup Gandhi , agrees .
" I think it 's fabulous that we 're now in such hot demand , " he says .
" Why not ?
If the Indian woman wants me , I think that 's a very good thing ! "
The latest economic forecasts are looking good for the IT world 's prospective bridegrooms .
They show that the Indian economy has expanded by more than 9 % - with services making up a fifth of that growth .
By 2010 , analysts say that technology will contribute close to a tenth of India 's overall GDP .
So even if Frank is off the market , Anup and his colleagues may be able to keep looking forward to both higher salaries - and domestic bliss .
TMZ has obtained a copy of the infamous manuscript by killer OJ Simpson where he outlines IF he had killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson , HOW it went down .
Get ready folks , it 's disgusting .
The manuscript begins with the passage :
I 'm going to tell you a story you 've never heard before , because no one knows this story the way I know it .
It takes place on the night June 12 , 1994 , and it concerns the murder of my ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her young friend , Ronald Goldman .
I want you to forget everything you think you know about that night because I know the facts better than anyone .
I know the players .
I 've seen the evidence .
I 've heard the theories .
And , of course , I 've read all the stories :
That I did it .
That I did it but I do n't know I did it .
That I can no longer tell fact from fiction .
That I wake up in the middle of the night , consumed by guilt , screaming .
As for the murders , Simpson describes a chilling scene :
I looked over at Goldman , and I was fuming .
I guess he thought I was going to hit him , because he got into his little karate stance .
" What the fuck is that ? " I said .
" You think you can take me with your karate shit ? "
He started circling me , bobbing and weaving , and if I had n't been so fucking angry I would have laughed in his face .
" O.J. , come on ! "
It was Charlie again , pleading .
Nicole moaned , regaining consciousness .
She stirred on the ground and opened her eyes and looked at me , but it did n't seem like anything was registering .
Charlie walked over and planted himself in front of me blocking my view .
" We are fucking done here , man - let 's go ! "
I noticed the knife in Charlie 's hand , and in one deft move I removed my right glove and snatched it up .
" We 're not going anywhere , " I said , turning to face Goldman .
Goldman was still circling me , bobbing and weaving , but I did n't feel like laughing anymore .
" You think you 're tough , motherfucker ? " I said .
I could hear Charlie just behind me , saying something , urging me to get the fuck out of there , and at one point he even reached for me and tried to drag me away , but I shook him off , hard , and moved toward Goldman .
" Okay , motherfucker ! " I said .
" Show me how tough you are ! "
Then something went horribly wrong , and I know what happened , but I can't tell you exactly how .
I was still standing in Nicole 's courtyard , of course , but for a few moments I could n't remember how I 'd gotten there , when I 'd arrived , or even why I was there .
Then it came back to me , very slowly :
The recital - with little Sydney up on stage , dancing her little heart out ; me , chipping balls into my neighbor 's yard ; Paula , angry , not answering her phone ; Charlie , stopping by the house to tell me some more ugly shit about Nicole 's behavior .
Then what ?
The short , quick drive from Rockingham to the Bundy condo .
And now ?
Now I was standing in Nicole 's courtyard , in the dark , listening to the loud , rhythmic , accelerated beating of my own heart .
I put my left hand to my heart and my shirt felt strangely wet .
I looked down at myself .
For several moments , I could n't get my mind around what I was seeing .
The whole front of me was covered in blood , but it did n't compute .
Is this really blood ?
I wondered .
And whose blood is it ?
Is it mine ?
Am I hurt ?
13 September 2002 --
The news is floating around the Web right now about the " discovery " of the first online emotion - conveying icon or " emoticon . "
What readers and reporters are apparently not aware of is that the emoticon or " smiley " being discussed is the first ASCII smiley .
Like so many things , PLATO was doing emoticons and smileys , online and onscreen , years earlier .
In fact , emoticons on PLATO were already an art form by 1976 .
PLATO users began doing smiley characters probably as early as 1972 ( when PLATO IV came out ) , but possibly even earlier on PLATO III ( still to be determined ... old - timer PLATO III users please speak up ! ) .
A close - up of some famous PLATO smileys .
How were these things done ?
Well , on PLATO , you could press SHIFT - space to move your cursor back one space -- and then if you typed another character , it would appear on top of the existing character .
And if you wanted to get real fancy , you could use the MICRO and SUB and SUPER keys on a PLATO keyboard to move up and down one pixel or more -- in effect providing a HUGE array of possible emoticon characters .
So if you typed " W " then SHIFT - space then " O " then SHIFT - space then " B " , " T " , " A " , " X " , all with SHIFT - spaces in between , all those characters would plot on top of each other , and the result would be the smiley as shown above in the " WOBTAX " example .
Below are just some examples of smileys and emoticons collected from lesson =m4= on PLATO in the mid 1970s :
Here 's another close - up of some more :
Someone on Slashdot has pointed out that the second
emoticon from the top of this close - up list looks
an awful lot like Napster 's logo !
It does indeed !
By the way , an interesting dissertation on emoticons and such was done by Janet Asteroff in 1987 .
The dissertation is called Paralanguage in Electronic Mail : A Case Study .
It mentions the Scott Fahlman proposal .
Of course , the dissertation never mentions PLATO ...
The ban is being called the " strike of crossed legs "
Dozens of women are said to be taking part in what is being called the " strike of crossed legs " , a move backed by the mayor of Pereira .
The city in Colombia 's coffee - growing region reported 480 killings last year .
A city official said the idea came from a meeting of wives and girlfriends over the progress of a disarmament scheme .
Rap song
" We met with the wives and girlfriends of gang members and they were worried some were not handing over their guns and that is where they came up with the idea of a vigil or a sex strike , " the mayor 's spokesman told Reuters news agency .
" The message they are giving them is disarm , " he added .
Studies found that local gang members were drawn to criminality by the desire for status , power , and sexual attractiveness , not economic necessity , Colombian radio reported .
One of the girlfriends , Jennifer Bayer , told Britain 's Guardian newspaper : " We want them to know that violence is not sexy . "
Ms Bayer said the women had come up with a strike anthem rap song that included the lyrics : " As women we are worth a lot .
We do n't want to fall for violent men because with them we lose too much . "

In 2006 , financial services firm T. Rowe Price envisioned a new release of its company - sponsored retirement plan website .
Because thousands of participants accessed the website every hour , the main feature of the new release was to put the most important data at users ' fingertips .
However , the requirements also clearly stated that performance must not degrade and that additional display components would be added later .
In short , a new , compact design presenting more financial information on the same - size homepage had to be created .
Our development team decided that AJAX might solve the real - estate issue .
AJAX asynchronously loads web page components without reloading the entire page .
This dynamic loading is accomplished via CSS , DHTML , and the XMLHttpRequest or ActiveXObject JavaScript methods .
These functions can be used directly , or through AJAX frameworks , which provide ready - to - use widgets that work on most browsers .
Several AJAX frameworks were available , and we had to choose the appropriate one for our project a process that required a significant amount of research and testing .
For instance , our requirements included ongoing support for a variety of browsers and usability that had to be maintained .
We educated ourselves , examined several AJAX libraries , and performed browser and load testing throughout the project .
The new AJAX - based retirement - plan website was deployed to production in mid-December 2006 .
To date , we 've received excellent feedback , and we hope you benefit from the process we used to evaluate AJAX libraries and develop our first AJAX - enabled application .
I had a really great time at the Open Source CMS Summit this past week , where I took part in a panel on “ identity and why we care , as well as discussion around implementation , single sign on , security , distributed authentication , user profiles ” .
I finally got to meet Identity Woman , who is a very thoughtful and passionate person ( her youthful appearance did make me wonder how long I can keep up my “ grrl ” shtick ! ) .
And Boris Mann and Roland Tanglao were very gracious hosts indeed .
( I ’ll add a quick “ thanks ” to Lauren for arranging this gig in the first place ! )
In preparation for the panel , I did some reading on the lightweight identity phenomenon that would be the focus of many of the attendees .
Here was my cheat sheet covering quite a lot of the space , both “ heavy ” and “ light ” , along with elevator pitches — which might reflect my idiosyncratic interests but are meant to be objective and accurate as far as they go ( I welcome corrections and augmentations , of course [ UPDATE : Please see some in the comments .
Thanks , Johannes ! ] ) :
OpenID : A system for supporting URL - based identifiers , allowing for a confirmation to prove that it ’s your URL ( a la email confirmation loops )
LID : A system for supporting URL - based identifiers , now coordinating closely with OpenID so as not to compete unnecessarily
YADIS : A policy protocol to let a relying party discover whether an authority uses OpenID or LID and adjust its behavior accordingly
SXIP : A company that has built identity solutions and protocols with an intended focus on easy integration with existing web apps
DIX : A proposal for IETF identity protocol work driven by SXIP ; a BOF is scheduled soon to consider WG creation
Pubcookie : A classic cookie - based system for non-federated single sign - on within a single domain
XRI : An effort within OASIS to build a new URI scheme for use in creating identifiers and resolving information about identities
i-names : Simple XRI - compatible identifiers , which for people take the form of =name
Identity Commons :
An organization developing stock sets of policies for identity information usage , a la Creative Commons
SAML : An OASIS standard for representation and federated exchange of identity information , with a focus on human - facing interactions
Liberty : A set of technology standards and business guidelines for privacy - enabled identity interactions , both human - facing and machine - to - machine
WS - Federation : A privately produced protocol for identity federation , with current product support focusing on human - facing interactions
Infocard : Microsoft ’s new UI component for a client that can mediate identity interactions , similarly to LECPs / ECPs ( see below )
The “ explicitly lightweight ” identity world is a bit new to me ; having gotten the lay of the land , I prepared and presented some slides ( . pdf ) that I hoped would serve as a brief introduction to SAML and Liberty and a spur to further discussion that might put all the systems out there in context .
Following are a few thoughts that may be helpful as a companion to the slides :
Slide 2 : It ’s generally acknowledged that we need to reach across multiple DNS domains to let identity information pass through where appropriate .
But if lightweight identity technology confines itself to low - security “ personal ” uses , then identity will still be stuck in that silo because enterprise and public sector uses require much better safeguards than that .
Thus , at some point we need to solve for the general case and allow for the stepping up of security and privacy safeguards .
If the lightweight solutions are what ’s comfortable for the long tail ( ah yes , Wikipedia has the long - tail graphic I was looking for ) , and SAML and Liberty are most comfortably done by only the first section of the tail , then — as Boris Mann put it — we need to figure out interoperability where they meet .
BTW , I asked other attendees where they stood on WS - Federation and got a lot of eye - rolling !
It ’s not even on the table for them .
( Having learned more about what this community considers to be a reasonable software integration task , I hope to post some more on the topic later . )
Slide 3 : It seems these two use cases , which I agonized over , really do have the highest demand ( another common one is the set of multiple - principal situations that underlie something like the Liberty People Service ) ; during the first day of the summit , which I could n’t attend , apparently a discussion took place around identity use cases that identified these same two .
When it comes to authority vs. relying websites in the SSO Guy use case , a lot of the current technologies use different terminology , but it ’s possible to sync them up .
So , for example , a SAML / Liberty / general - use identity provider corresponds roughly to a SXIP homesite , and a SAML / Liberty / general - use service provider corresponds roughly to a SXIP membersite .
When it comes to authority vs. relying services in the Personal Profile Gal use case , the realization that she ( through her client devices ) can function as her own service is key — essentially you need an identity - friendly client .
A Microsoft Infocard - supporting device corresponds roughly to a Liberty - Enabled Client or Proxy ( LECP , pronounced “ leck - pee ” , unfortunately ) or a SAML V2.0 Enhanced Client or Proxy ( ECP , pronounced “ eck - pee ” , even more unfortunately ) .
A couple of links that may be handy for understanding LECP concepts are here and here , though these are a couple of years old .

A Microsoft Infocard - supporting device corresponds roughly to a Liberty - Enabled Client or Proxy ( LECP , pronounced “ leck - pee ” , unfortunately ) or a SAML V2.0 Enhanced Client or Proxy ( ECP , pronounced “ eck - pee ” , even more unfortunately ) .
A couple of links that may be handy for understanding LECP concepts are here and here , though these are a couple of years old .
Slides 5 - 7 : My goal was to show real examples of SAML assertion structures ( which I believe to be a target on which the entire XML - accepting community is converging ) , and highlight places where it ’s extensible .
In fact , were someone to be interested in this , URL - based identifiers could be accommodated just as easily as the email - based one shown on slide 5 , just by supplying a NameFormat that means “ the identifier is a URL ” .
( SAML does n’t have a “ this is a URL ” identifier NameFormat standardized ; should it ?
Should others write their own a profile ?
Who might be interested in this ? )
And looking at slide 7 , SXIP properties could perhaps have their own attribute NameFormat .
Slide 8 : Here I wanted to make the point that SAML covers a lot of common flows for SSO , including starting out at the service ( relying / membersite ) provider rather than the identity ( authority / homesite ) provider , and using bindings that stick to HTTP redirects along with ones that involve SOAP back - and - forthing but have other efficiencies .
Slide 14 : I forgot to mention that Pat Patterson has posted some nice flash demos ( of identity web services and of our Federation Manager product for easy service provider deployment ) and a video of the Sun-Microsoft web single sign - on interop demo ( high / low res ) .
Yikes , this post is longer than I intended ( “ the long identity post ” ? ) , so I ’ll stop now .
But I ’m sure I ’ll have more to say on the OSCMS experience .
I struck up some new relationships with lots of smart people and I hope to stay in touch , and brainstorm , with many of them in the coming days .

Business issues have been much on my mind of late , and not just for the obvious reasons .
Gavin ( Whythawk ) has pounded this space with a steady stream of posts that come at us from some really different angles .
The S&R crew is largely American and progressive , but he ’s African and Libertarian .
Unlike many Libs I know , though , he ’s not a creature of pure theory – he gets his hands dirty trying to drive investment at the bottom of the food chain in a place where the bottom is about as low as it gets on Spaceship Earth .
The result , for me at least , is that I find myself thinking about how years of fat cat scandal and abuse here in America has worked to make “ capitalism ” a dirty word among folks to left of center .
When we hear talk about markets and capitalism and business , especially as such things are fetishized in the corporate media ( think about how The Apprentice has apparently made Donald Trump into something of a corporate statesman ) , we ’re more likely to think of Nacchio , Ebbers , Rigas , Koslowski , Skilling , Lay and all things Halliburton .
We think of modern robber barons , of men whose pathological greed and power - lust knows no boundaries .
Men who will sit around and joke about stealing a grandmother ’s retirement – a joke that my own particular dark , twisted sense of humor can parse in the right context , but certainly not in a situation where they ’re actually doing it , even as they speak .
What ’s frustrating here is that capitalism is n’t a privilege reserved for Republicans .
It ’s part of the progressive birthright , as well .
Some of our most remarkable business achievements have been accomplished ethically , with a keen eye toward the ways in which the tools of capitalism can be used to create a greater prosperity for everybody .
Enlightened capitalists like Richard Joushua Reynolds , for instance , created an economic base in my home town that afforded generations of working class employees an opportunity to participate in the rewards of their work , increasing educational opportunities and providing genuine security for their families .
( Yeah , I know – tobacco is a somewhat problematic industry , but we ’ll save that chat for another time . )
Thanks to RJR ’s stock investment plans , there were line workers who retired as millionaires .
R.J. Reynolds and his family played a large part in the public life and history of the City of Winston - Salem .
In 1884 he served as a city commissioner .
Reynolds was politically progressive especially for his time .
He established progressive working conditions in his factory , with shorter hours and higher pay .
He also signed a petition for a property tax to pay for public schools and voted to approve an income tax .
After his death , Katharine Reynolds continued his philanthropic activities .
She gave money to establish The Richard J. Reynolds High School and the R.J. Reynolds Memorial Auditorium ( both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places ) .
Construction of the school and auditorium was begun in 1919 under the direction of architect Charles Barton Keen and finished in 1924 ( the school opened in an uncompleted building in 1923 after the destruction by fire of the old Winston High School ) .
Part of that RJ Reynolds progressive bent is something that only the locals seem to know about .
The Reynolda Estate was a massive operation and required a lot of on - site manual labor to maintain .
So he built a village that included housing and a comprehensive set of services for all his employees .
This included building top - notch schools for the children of black workers , at a time when educating blacks was n’t on anybody ’s agenda .
His black workers enjoyed conditions ( and even management opportunities ) that were simply unprecedented at the time .
The Reynolds family also brought Wake Forest University , my alma mater , to Winston - Salem via a massive grant of land and cash , and that institution , which has grown into a top 30 national university , today stands as the largest employer in the county and the new center of an evolving innovation - centered economy .
Wake ’s motto , appropriately enough , is Pro Humanitate .
There are other examples out there – feel free to populate the comment box with your own – but the point is that progressive , “ Pro Humanitate ” principles are not incompatible with capitalism and business .
It seems unfortunate to me that the reminder has to come from South Africa , although I ’m grateful to have a colleague like Gavin aboard to provide those moments of valuable perspective .
Another of my S&R colleagues , Pat Vecchio , is taking a course this summer ( for fun , apparently – he does that sort of thing a lot here lately ) that has him reading Alexis de Tocqueville ’s seminal Democracy in America , a book published in 1835 that today remains one of the greatest assessments of the American system ever composed .
For me , the most important idea in the whole of the book is the principle of “ self - interest , rightly understood . ”
The principle of self - interest rightly understood produces no great acts of self - sacrifice , but it suggests daily small acts of self - denial .
By itself it cannot suffice to make a man virtuous ; but it disciplines a number of persons in habits of regularity , temperance , moderation , foresight , self - command ; and if it does not lead men straight to virtue by the will , it gradually draws them in that direction by their habits .
If the principle of interest rightly understood were to sway the whole moral world , extraordinary virtues would doubtless be more rare ; but I think that gross depravity would then also be less common .
The principle of interest rightly understood perhaps prevents men from rising far above the level of mankind , but a great number of other men , who were falling far below it , are caught and restrained by it .
Observe some few individuals , they are lowered by it ; survey mankind , they are raised .
I am not afraid to say that the principle of self - interest rightly understood appears to me the best suited of all philosophical theories to the wants of the men of our time , and that I regard it as their chief remaining security against themselves .
Towards it , therefore , the minds of the moralists of our age should turn ; even should they judge it to be incomplete , it must nevertheless be adopted as necessary .
It ’s the erosion of this essential principle that lies at the core of what we have become .
In short , capitalism of the sort practiced all - too - frequently in America has been obsessed with self - interest and totally unconcerned with rightly understood .
If we ’re to regain our former greatness – and please , do n’t mistake affluence with greatness – we must insist on rightly understood .
Capitalism must be progressive , not corrosive .
It must be about creating opportunity for everyone instead of building barriers to keep wealth in and people out .
And while locking the pillagers up is an important and altogether satisfying step that a moral society must take , understand what Tocqueville says above .
Our collective greatness is ultimately not about grand acts but about the small , the routine , the ordinary daily acts of self - denial .
Capitalism is n’t a dirty word , and shame on us that we ’ve allowed a few sick men to steal it from us .
It ’s time to steal it back .
Bruce Bartlett says we 're all supply - siders now , but as explained in some detail below , I do n't fully agree :
How Supply - Side Economics Trickled Down , by Bruce Bartlett , Commentary , NY Times :
As one who was present at the creation of “ supply - side economics ” back in the 1970s , I think it is long past time that the phrase be put to rest .
It did its job , creating a new consensus among economists on how to look at the national economy .
But today it has become a frequently misleading and meaningless buzzword that gets in the way of good economic policy .
Today , supply - side economics has become associated with an obsession for cutting taxes under any and all circumstances .
No longer do its advocates in Congress and elsewhere confine themselves to cutting marginal tax rates — the tax on each additional dollar earned — as the original supply - siders did .
Rather , they support even the most gimmicky , economically dubious tax cuts with the same intensity .
The original supply - siders suggested that some tax cuts , under very special circumstances , might actually raise federal revenues .
For example , cutting the capital gains tax rate might induce an unlocking effect that would cause more gains to be realized , thus causing more taxes to be paid on such gains even at a lower rate .
But today it is common to hear tax cutters claim , implausibly , that all tax cuts raise revenue .
Last year , President Bush said , “ You cut taxes and the tax revenues increase . ”
Senator John McCain told National Review magazine last month that “ tax cuts , starting with Kennedy , as we all know , increase revenues . ”
Last week , Steve Forbes endorsed Rudolph Giuliani for the White House , saying , “ He ’s seen the results of supply - side economics firsthand — higher revenues from lower taxes . ”
This is a simplification of what supply - side economics was all about , and it threatens to undermine the enormous gains that have been made in economic theory and policy over the last 30 years .
Perhaps the best way of preventing that from happening is to kill the phrase “ supply - side economics ” and give it a decent burial .
It ’s important to remember that at the time supply - side economics came into being , Keynesian economics dominated macroeconomic thinking and economic policy in Washington .
Among the beliefs held by the Keynesians of that era were these : budget deficits stimulate economic growth ; the means by which the government raises revenue is essentially irrelevant economically ; government spending and tax cuts affect the economy in exactly the same way through their impact on aggregate spending ; personal savings is bad for economic growth ; monetary policy is impotent ; and inflation is caused by low unemployment , among other things .
These beliefs led to many bad economic policies .
In particular , they lay at the root of stagflation , that awful combination of high inflation and slow growth that bedeviled policy makers in the 1970s .
Based on insights derived from the Nobel - winning economists Robert Mundell , Milton Friedman , James Buchanan and Friedrich Hayek , the supply - siders developed a new program based on tight money to stop inflation and cuts in marginal tax rates to stimulate growth .
As the staff economist for Representative Jack Kemp , a Republican of New York , I helped devise the tax plan he co-sponsored with Senator William Roth , a Delaware Republican .
Kemp - Roth was intended to bring down the top statutory federal income tax rate to 50 percent from 70 percent and the bottom rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
We modeled this proposal on the Kennedy - Johnson tax cut of 1964 , which lowered the top rate to 70 percent from 91 percent and the bottom rate to 14 percent from 20 percent .
We believed that our tax plan would stimulate the economy to such a degree that the federal government would not lose $ 1 of revenue for every $ 1 of tax cut .
Studies of the 1964 tax cut showed that about a third of it was recouped , and we expected similar results .
Thus , contrary to common belief , neither Jack Kemp nor William Roth nor Ronald Reagan ever said that there would be no revenue loss associated with an across - the - board cut in tax rates .
We just thought it would n’t lose as much revenue as predicted by the standard revenue forecasting models , which were based on Keynesian principles .
Furthermore , our belief that we might get back a third of the revenue loss was always a long - run proposition .
Even the most rabid supply - sider knew we would lose $ 1 of revenue for $ 1 of tax cut in the short term , because it took time for incentives to work and for people to change their behavior .
...
Moreover , we were adamant that only permanent cuts in marginal tax rates would stimulate the economy .
We thought that temporary tax cuts , tax rebates , tax credits and such were economically worthless , and we strongly opposed them .
Today , hardly any economist believes what the Keynesians believed in the 1970s and most accept the basic ideas of supply - side economics — that incentives matter , that high tax rates are bad for growth , and that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon .
Consequently , there is no longer any meaningful difference between supply - side economics and mainstream economics .
There is no question in my mind that we never could have overcome the stagflation of the 1970s as quickly or with as little pain as we did without the supply - side idea .
But supply - side economics has done its job , just as Keynesian economics did in the 1930s .
Those who campaign as its champions are fighting a fight long won — and it is time for supply - side rhetoric to go , with its essential truths embodied in mainstream economics and its perversions discarded for good .
As noted above , I do n't fully agree , so let me cast this debate in a different framework where it 's easier for me to highlight where we differ .
Let 's start with the following fairly standard picture of the evolution of GDP .
The red line shows actual output cycling over time , and the blue line shows that natural rate of output which also varies over time :
As depicted , the natural rate is subject to both permanent and temporary supply shocks causing growth to be uneven , but generally upward , and actual output is driven away from the natural rate by demand shocks .
That is , the variation in the blue line is from supply - shocks , and the deviation of the red line from the blue line is from demand shocks .
In general , there are two types of policies to consider .
The first is the use of monetary and fiscal policy to stabilize the economy .
The goal here is to use changes in the money supply , government spending , and taxes to manage aggregate demand and minimize the deviations of actual output from the natural rate of output .
This is shown by the dotted red line in the following diagram which is closer , on average to the natural rate than the no-policy outcome shown as the solid red line :
The second type of policy is growth policy .
This is what many people mean when they use the term supply - side policy .
The goal here is to increase the growth rate of output .
This is shown by the upward rotation of the trajectory for the natural rate in the following diagram :
The natural rate of output is determined by the growth of technology , the growth of the capital stock , and the growth of the labor force so policies to increase the growth rate of output are directed at these factors .
Examples of supply - side policies are ( not all have proven to be equally effective , or effective at all in some cases , and this is far from exhaustive ) tax breaks for research and development ( to increase technology ) , tax breaks for IRAs ( to increase saving , investment , and the capital stock ) , tax cuts on capital gains and dividend ( to make capital markets more efficient and increase the capital stock ) , spending on education ( to make labor more productive ) , reductions in marginal tax rates ( so people will increase work effort ) , accelerated depreciation ( to make investment cheaper and increase he capital stock ) , and reductions in estate taxes ( so people will work harder to leave more for their heirs ) .
Note also that it is the upward rotation in the supply - curve that generates the increase in taxes from supply side policies that you often hear about .
The question , of course , is how much additional growth comes from a cut in taxes and here I agree to some extent with Bruce Bartlett .
It depends upon the type of tax cuts that are enacted , some are more productive than others and hence some types of tax cuts generate more tax revenue than others .
Whether the tax cut is permanent or temporary is also important .
We 'd disagree over the magnitude however .
While some types of tax cuts can affect growth , the effect is nowhere near large enough to generate a 33 % tax revenue recovery rate , not even close , and , in any case , all the low - hanging fruit has already been plucked , something that is often overlooked .
That is not the end of our disagreement .
Bartlett does not distinguish between various classes of models , between the short - run and long - run , or between stabilization and growth policy all of which are important distinctions so let me touch upon these issues .
There are two predominant views of the source of fluctuations in output , Real Business Cycle models and New Keynesian models .
Real Business Cycle ( RBC ) theorists believe that most if not all fluctuations in the economy are due to supply side shocks , aggregate demand shocks such as changes in the money supply , changes in taxes , and changes in government spending affect nominal variables such as prices but have little to do with changes in output over time ( however , government intervention does causes inefficiencies in these models so that less intervention is generally preferred to more ) .
Thus , for RBC advocates , the red and blue lines lie nearly on top on one another because nearly all of the movement in output is due to supply shocks .
Obviously , then , in these models demand management - monetary and fiscal policy - can stabilize prices ( and hence increase efficiency ) , but demand management has little effect on output .
Thus , since short - run demand management is ineffective in these models ( and often counterproductive ) , all that 's left is long - run growth policy and that 's why people such as Bruce Bartlett , who have an RBC model in mind when thinking about policy , tend to focus on long - run , supply - side , growth enhancing policies .
Let me turn next to Keynesians .
My focus is on the New Keynesian ( NK ) school , but I should note that I do n't agree with all of the characteristics Bartlett associates with Keynesians of the 1960s and 1970s , and I certainly do n't agree with the claim made in the next paragraph that after the policy failures of the 1970s " the supply - siders developed a new program based on tight money to stop inflation and cuts in marginal tax rates to stimulate growth . "
A standard expectations augmented Phillips curve story does a much better job of explaining these events , and the interest rate targeting rules used from the early 1980s onward are not based upon RBC models .
Most RBC models do n't even include money as it plays not role in either the short - run or long - run .
New Keynesians ( NK ) do not deny that shocks to aggregate supply can affect GDP nor that supply shocks can be large and important .
However , New Keynesians also believe that aggregate demand shocks are important , i.e. that the difference between the blue and red lines is large .
New Keynesians attempt to stabilize actual output around the natural rate as shown above .
Why does NK policy tend to focus on demand shocks rather than supply shocks ?
The answer is that although it would be ideal if we could use supply - side polices to smooth short - run fluctuations in output arising from supply shocks , the reality is that we can not do this .
As Bartlett notes , supply - side polices are very blunt , slow - acting policies that can affect output in the long - run , but they are all but useless in dealing with short - run fluctuations in the economy ( thus , RBC theorists tend to focus mainly long - run growth ) .
Since supply cannot be managed in the short - run , that leaves demand management policies , i.e. monetary and fiscal policy .
As we learned in the 1970s , demand side tools are not very effective instruments for offsetting supply - side shocks - trying to use demand side policy to offset supply shocks helped to generate the stagflation we saw at the time .
We 've learned since then , but practically we are still somewhat powerless to offset supply side shocks in the short - run - all we can do is manage demand to match changes in supply .
That is , if a hurricane wipes out supply , we can use policy to reduce demand to match , but we can't do much to increase supply back to its initial level in the short - run .
What we can do much more effectively , if you believe in NK models , is stabilize demand shocks through demand management policy .
These policies are relatively simple conceptually , the trick is to manage demand so that upward and downward demand shocks are offset by appropriate changes in policy , but that is easier said than done .
Still , we do appear to be able to reduce variation over time through both monetary policy in particular , and also through fiscal policy ( e.g. through automatic stabilizers ) .
The claim made by Bruce Bartlett that " there is no longer any meaningful difference between supply - side economics and mainstream economics " is not something I can agree with .
There are big differences between the RBC and NK schools and big differences in the implications of the two schools for policy in the short - run .
RBC advocates do not believe in short - run stabilization policy , their focus is solely on maximizing long - run output growth .
NK theorists do not deny that robust economic growth is important , but they also believe that government can play a helpful role is smoothing short - run economic fluctuations .
Why do Republicans tend to endorse the RBC framework ?
I believe in many cases that belief in the RBC model arises from an honest view that the evidence is most supportive of this class of models .
But in other cases I believe it is an ideological marriage .
The RBC model has two features that make it attractive .
First , because it says short - run stabilization policy is ineffective , and that government intervention through either spending or taxes generates economic distortions , the RBC framework supports an approach where the role of government in the economy is minimized .
Second , because the RBC framework allows for tax cuts to produce higher growth by reducing inefficiencies , and because it is then possible to argue that tax revenues might increase , it gives two reasons for supporting tax cuts - higher growth and less than a full loss of tax revenue , i.e. a dollar tax cut does not cost a dollar ( or , for serious ideologues , the tax - cuts even pay for themselves ) .
The NK model , on the other hand , supports active government intervention which is at odds with this ideology .
In addition , because the focus in NK models is on stabilization of output around the natural rate , not on growth of the natural rate , tax - cuts do not have the dynamic long - run effects as in RBC models ( though these can be added ) and hence there is not as much ideological support for tax cuts in the NK framework .
This is much too long already , but a few more things .
We do n't we know which type of shock is most important ?
If demand shocks play a substantial role , we should pay attention to the NK policy prescriptions , but if aggregate supply shocks are the primary force behind business cycles , we should abandon short - run stabilization and focus solely on long - run growth .
We do n't we just look at the empirical evidence and figure this out ?
The problem , essentially , is that we only have one time - series , GDP , and we want two things from it , supply shocks and demand shocks .
Since we only have one piece of information and want two things from it , we must make an assumption of some sort .
Under some assumptions , supply shocks appear predominant , but under others , demand shocks are the most important factor in business cycles .
Because we have no way of knowing for sure which assumption is best , and because the econometric evidence changes as the assumptions change , we are left with uncertainty as to which type of shock matters most and hence which model we ought to prefer .
There is much more to say about all of this , I have n't even mentioned New Classical models , but that will have to do for now .
Summarizing , contrary to what is implied in Bruce Bartlett 's commentary , there are two distinct schools in economics , the RBC school and the NK school , and they have very different policy implications .
Not everyone will agree with this , and that is the point I suppose , but I would argue that the mainstream view today is the NK model , though the RBC school has strong advocates and has made important contributions to our thinking ( the long - run incentives Bruce Bartlett mentions are a good example ) .
So , here 's where we agree .
Both NK and RBC advocates see the long - run similarly .
Both schools agree that demand side polices have little effect on long - run growth .
Both agree that incentives matter , and that we should , of course , strive to enhance efficiency and long - run growth whenever possible .
There is a difference in the two schools as to the strength of those incentives , but if that is all that is meant by supply - side polices , then fine , no problem , we 're in agreement .
But there is a big disagreement over the short - run .
RBC adherents take a hands - off , free market approach .
Their model tells them that government interference causes inefficiencies , and that there is nothing to be gained in return in terms of enhanced stability .
NK adherents believe government should take an active role in stabilizing the economy and that is something that , contrary to what is implied above , has not changed since the 1960s and 1970s .
The model used by the NK school is very different from the models we used then - and our approach to policy is similarly different - but the basic idea that government intervention can help to stabilize output and employment in the short - run is unaltered .

Imagine this :
You take a drug test .
Six months later , the lab gets back to you and says that your urine contains trace amounts of a club and date rape drug even though you prefer to spend weekends with your Xbox .
This would be no surprise to scientists at the FBI laboratory in Quantico , Virginia , who discovered that urine samples , kept in a refrigerator for six months , spontaneously produce significant amounts of the drug GHB or other chemicals that can result in a false positive result from the most stringent test used by forensic labs .
This could cause all sorts of innocent people to test positive for exposure to the illicit substance .
The drug , sometimes called liquid ecstasy , is made from gamma butyrolactone , a solvent used to degrease engine parts or clear plugged drains .
Liquid E has become a popular rave drug .
It is also favored by rapists as a means to knock people out before sexually assaulting them .
It is colorless and odorless , which makes it easy to slip into an unsuspecting victim 's drink .
To summarize , the results of our study suggests in vitro production of GHB may increase the apparent GHB concentrations in urine during storage .
To minimize this production , it is suggested that urine specimens be maintained in a refrigerated or frozen condition and analyzed as quickly as possible .
This is particularly important , because GHB analyses are relatively infrequent requests in many laboratories .
Therefore , specimens are likely to be stored for some extended period of time before the analysis is carried out .
The scientists published their findings in the July issue of the journal Forensic Science International .
Their paper did not explain how the urine produces the illegal drug , but it cautioned forensic scientists to test urine samples quickly in order to avoid inaccurate results .
To prove that GHB is spontaneously produced in urine , the scientists collected urine specimens from 31 people that claim to have never used the drug .
They tested each of the urine samples after seven days , 60 days , and 189 days with a machine called a gas chromatography mass spectrometer .
Those instruments are the workhorses of forensic labs because they can be used to identify and determine the amount of many different drugs and poisons in blood , urine , and other bodily fluids .
In most of the samples , there was a dramatic increase in the amount of GHB after six months of storage in a refrigerator .
Several months ago , the owner of a natural soap company showed that a common field test kit used by police to identify GHB can be set off by his products .
David Bronner released a video of his flagship product , Dr. Bronner 's Magic Soaps , creating false positive results in a NarcoPouch 928 test kit .
This seriously called into question the reliability of those tests .
The test that was shown to be misleading by the FBI scientists is considered to be the trustworthy backup of the flawed field test kit .

The database contains nearly 5,000 letters

His delight at the five - year cruise is chronicled in a letter , available online for the first time .
The note is one of nearly 5,000 from and to the scientist held in a database at the University of Cambridge .
The Darwin Correspondence project includes summaries of a further 9,000 letters , written from the age of 12 .
In some of his earliest letters , he recounts talking to his sister Caroline , who had asked him about his personal hygiene .
" I only wash my fe[e]t once a month at school , which I confess is nasty , but I cannot help it , for we have nothing to do it with , " he wrote .
Dr Alison Pearn , co-director of the Darwin Correspondence project , says it is insight like this that makes the letters so special .
" I think the human side is what is arresting about the letters , " she said .
" There is such an interesting and exciting mixture of very cutting - edge science and very personal revelations about his life and family . "
Different paths
Darwin was a prolific letter writer , exchanging correspondence with nearly 2,000 people during his lifetime ( 1809 - 1882 ) .
Nearly 14,500 of his letters are known to exist , with the biggest collection residing in Cambridge .
His theory on evolution has influenced many science disciplines
" Letters were absolutely essential to what Darwin was doing , " said Dr Pearn .
" This is how he gathered data , how he gathered ideas , how he discussed ideas . "
As well as other scientists , Darwin courted diplomats , clergymen , gardeners and pigeon fanciers .
" Pigeons are one of the organisms that Darwin investigated in great detail , in particular to study variation under domestication , " said Dr Pearn .
" Breeding was so wide spread at the time that it was easy for him to tap into a network of people . "
The letters also detail his dealings with other intellectual heavyweights of the time .
These included well known naturalists such as Alfred Russel Wallace , who collected specimens in the Amazon and Malay Archipelago and independently formulated a theory of evolution by natural selection .
In a letter from May 1857 , contained in the new archive , Darwin replied to Wallace who had reported some of his own conclusions in the Annals and Magazine of Natural History and in a letter sent to Darwin on 10 October 1856 .
" I can plainly see that we have thought much alike and to a certain extent have come to similar conclusions , " wrote Darwin .
Darwin was one of the most important figures in the history of science .
He changed forever our understanding of life on Earth .
John van Wyhe
Darwin Online
" I agree to the truth of almost every word of your paper ; and I daresay that you will agree with me that it is very rare to find oneself agreeing pretty closely with any theoretical paper ; for it is lamentable how each man draws his own different conclusions from the very same fact . "
Darwin and Wallace eventually published their theories in a joint paper in 1858 , a year before Darwin published On the Origin of Species .
Letters from throughout this period map out the evolution of his ideas and publications .
Complete collection
The Darwin Correspondence project has existed offline since 1974 .
It has so far published 15 volumes of the scientist 's letters as books .
The Beagle set off for South America in 1831
An agreement with the publisher of the books means the new website will offer digitised versions of the texts freely available to anyone four years behind the hard copies .
Nearly 5,000 pieces of correspondence will be fully searchable when the site launches on Thursday 17 May .
" This is good news for everyone , " said Dr John van Wyhe , project director of Darwin Online , a separate project also based at the University of Cambridge .
" Darwin was one of the most important figures in the history of science .
He changed forever our understanding of life on Earth . "
Set up in 2002 , Darwin Online is putting Darwin 's publications and non-correspondence manuscripts on the web .
It also has downloadable audio files and images .
The most recent addition , the diaries of Darwin 's wife , Emma Darwin , cover six decades of the couple 's life together .
" My aim was to have a website that has everything else , " said Dr van Wyhe .
" We complement each other . "

A London 2012 spokeswoman said the health concerns surrounded a piece of animation shown at the launch , which was recorded by broadcasters and put on the official website .
Emphasising that it was not the logo itself which was the focus of worries , she said : " This concerns a short piece of animation which we used as part of the logo launch event and not the actual logo . "
She said the section of footage concerned showed a " diver diving into a pool which had a multi- colour ripple effect " .
The spokeswoman said : " We are taking it very seriously and are looking into it as a matter of urgency . "

Prof Harding is an expert in clinical neuro - physiology and he designed a test which all moving adverts need to undergo to check they will not trigger a reaction in people with epilepsy .
He told BBC London 94.9 FM : " It fails the Harding FPA machine test which is the machine the television industry uses to test images .
" And so it does not comply with Ofcom guidelines and is in contravention of them . "
The brand incorporates both the Olympic and Paralympic Games , which is ironic as the latter is a showcase for athletes with disabilities
Epilepsy Action spokesman
Christopher Filmer rang BBC London 94.9 FM to say he suffered a seizure while watching the footage on television and his girlfriend also suffered a fit and needed hospital treatment .
" The logo came up on TV and I was thinking about the 2012 Games and then I was out , " he said .
Epilepsy Action said the images could affect the 23,000 people in the UK who have photosensitive epilepsy .
It said it had even triggered breakthrough seizures where people have a relapse after being seizure - free for a long time .
A spokesman for the charity said : " The brand incorporates both the Olympic and Paralympic Games , which is ironic as the latter is a showcase for athletes with disabilities .
" People can strive for years to gain seizure control and it is important that nothing puts this at risk . "
Mulling a rack of beefsteak tomatoes at Whole Foods Bowery , Vanessa Rodriguez , a slender 31 - year - old woman with light brown hair hanging to her waist , removed her ear - buds as a young man sidled up to her to inquire if the produce was organic .
When he followed up with a request for her phone number , she told him politely that the tomatoes were for dinner with her boyfriend .
It was n't the first time she had fended off an approach while grocery shopping at the Whole Foods on Bowery and Houston Street , she said .
Over samples of aged Gouda and amid aisles of extra-virgin olive oil , New Yorkers shopping at Whole Foods Bowery are turning the grocery into a thriving pick - up scene .
The gelato bar , the upstairs café , the chilled , private cheese room , and long checkout lines are where flirting is most rampant in the 71,000 - square - foot store that opened last March , Whole Foods employees said .
" I noticed this man come up to me when I was standing in line , " a tall , blonde , 22 - year - old student who lives in NoLIta , Marya Spence , said .
" He opened the door for me as I was leaving and asked me ,  Is this the exit for the beautiful girls ? '
He was maybe 40 , so it just was n't a match . "
While many pick - up lines fall flat , single shoppers said the floodlit aisles provide a " safer " space to start up conversations with strangers than most bars in the neighborhood .
Peeking into each other 's grocery carts , they said , could also be more revealing of a person 's lifestyle choices than an online profile on a social networking or dating Web site .
" I 'm really health conscious , " a 28 - year - old singer in the band edible red , Collette McLafferty , said .
" I want to date health conscious people , and that could be why Whole Foods seems like a good place to meet people . "
After chatting with an attractive man at Whole Foods two nights ago but forgetting his name , Ms. McLafferty , who lives on the Lower East Side , posted a message on Craigslist looking to reconnect with him .
" He had dark , curly brown hair , blue eyes , he was well built , probably about 5 - feet - 10 , " she said .
She is waiting for a response to her posting , she said .
Ms. McLafferty , who said she has often been approached by shoppers who comment on the tattoo of a dragon around her upper arm , added that flirting was easy at Whole Foods because of low expectations .
" When you go out with the intention of meeting someone , you never meet anyone , " she said .
Singles in New York City have a harder time meeting people than in other cities , a doctor and relationship counselor , James Walkup , told The New York Sun .
" The stress level here is higher , and people do n't take their time to slow down enough to really make connections , " Dr. Walkup said .
New Yorkers with little leisure time are using their time running errands to meet each other , he added .
" I make eyes at people , " a 27 - year - old actor who lives near South Street Seaport , Ari Rossen , said .
" It 's a hip neighborhood , everyone who shops here is young , and there are plenty of things around to talk about . "
Whole Foods Bowery is actively boosting its reputation as a place for singles to meet , a spokeswoman for the store , Rebecca Ulanoff , said .
In August , the store is hosting " Check Out , " a singles night co-sponsored by the Web site Gothamist.com .
The store is also hoping to attract a fashion - forward , eco-friendly crowd tomorrow morning when it sells Anya Hindmarch shopping totes printed with the message : " I 'm Not a Plastic Bag . "
" I think it 's all a hoot , " Ms. Ulanoff said of the store 's reputation as pick - up scene .
" I 've been told that I was pretty when I was walking through the store . "
Still , the café 's no-alcohol policy puts a damper on how far any flirtations could go , a 23 - year - old actor who lives in the East Village , Jacob Pinion , said .
Some shoppers say they avoid the pick - up scene .
" I definitely notice it , but I 've never done it , " Nick Dee , 25 , who lives in Williamsburg , said .
" I 've heard ,  So you like tomatoes , too ? ' at the salad bar .
I think it 's actually pretty lame . "
WHEN the internet took off in the 1990s , it was demonised as a steaming cauldron of porn .
It has certainly made pornography more widely and easily available than ever before .
The online porn industry is difficult to measure , but was valued at $ 1 billion in 2002 by America 's National Research Council .
Google , which publishes its “ zeitgeist ” list of top search queries , redacts sex - related terms from the rankings for fear of causing offence .
But the popularity of pornography is clear from figures compiled by companies that track user “ clickstreams ” .
Last year about 13 % of website visits in America were pornographic in nature , according to Hitwise , a market - research firm .
For comparison , search engines account for about 7 % of site visits .
Yet the Hitwise data suggest that sex sites are now being dethroned .
In Britain search sites overtook sex sites in popularity last October — the first time any other category has come out on top since tracking began , says Hitwise .
In America , the proportion of site visits that are pornographic is falling and people are flocking to sites categorised “ net communities and chat ” — chiefly social - networking sites such as MySpace , Bebo and Facebook .
Traffic to such sites is poised to overtake traffic to sex sites in America any day now ( see chart ) .
Does this mean the internet has matured as a medium ?
After all , pornographic content is often the first to take advantage of new media , from photography to videocassettes to satellite television .
“ Sex is a virus that infects new technology first , ” as Wired put it back in 1993 .
Once a new medium becomes popular , its usage is no longer dominated by porn .
Although this may soon be true for the web , however , it is not true for the internet as a whole .
Much pornographic content may simply have shifted from the web to peer - to - peer file - sharing networks , for example .
Or consider Second Life , the booming virtual world .
It is regularly feted as a flourishing platform for virtual commerce , yet a large portion of its economic activity relates to sex .
Exactly how much is unknown , but an employee of Linden Labs , the company behind Second Life , once ventured that 30 % of transactions related to sex or gambling .
Edward Castronova of Indiana University estimates that sex is “ a substantial portion , perhaps even the majority ” of economic transactions in Second Life .
( Users must first buy genitalia for their avatars , who otherwise resemble Barbie and Ken dolls when unclothed . )
The growing popularity of social - networking sites is not entirely unrelated to sex , either .
Such sites are often used to find and attract potential mates .
Porn sites may have reached a climax , but sex remains as potent online as ever .
選択肢を減らすことの重要性
Google TechTalks でBarry Schwartz博士による講演が公開されていました。
「 The Paradox of Choice - Why More Is Less」というタイトルでした 。
最初は、UNIXコマンドのmoreがlessよりも劣っている理由の事だと思って見始めましたが、そうではありませんでした。
何でも選べてベストじゃないと満足しないというのは、アメリカ人っぽい気もしましたが、かなり面白かったです。
ユーザビリティと機能の問題は良くある問題ですが、お店で展示されている商品の種類を減らした方が売り上げが上昇する話などが新鮮でした。
以下に要約してみました。 ここでは書いていない部分も多いので、詳細はビデオをご覧下さい。
字幕も入っていますし、ゆっくりと話してくれる人なので非常に見やすいと思います。 ただ、スライド( PPT ?)が見られないので、何故観客が笑っているのかが解らないのが残念です。
内容によってはスライドが映る事もあるので、恐らく写せないような微妙な内容の風刺画だったのだと勝手に想像しています。
世の中には Official Syllogism があります。 ( Syllogism : 三段論法、もっともらしい理由付け)
多くの場合、自分でそれを行っている事に気がつかない。
それが間違っていると言う証拠が蓄積されてきて初めて気がつく。
例えば 「人々が自由になればなるほど幸福になっていく」と皆が思っている。
他に考えようがあるでしょうか？ これは、考えるまでもありません。
次は 「人々に選択肢が多く与えられていればいるほど、自由は多くなる」という考えです。
選択が出来ない自由とは何でしょうか？ 多くのアメリカ人にとっては、自由と選択は同義だと言えるでしょう。
これらを組み合わせると 「選択肢が多ければ多いほど人々は幸福になる」ということになります。
ただ、これは単なる三段論法に過ぎず誤りです。
これが誤りであるということを説明して行きたいと思います。
私の近くにあるスーパーマーケットでは、ドレッシングが山のようにおいてあります。
さらに、ドレッシングを作るための原材料を色々選べます。
組み合わせは無限に近くあります。
昔、電話と言え ばAT& Tでした。 それ以外に選択肢はありませんでした。 今は、長距離、短距離などで選べます。 さらに、携帯電話も発展しています。 MP3 プレイヤーが入っていたり、色々です。 ただ、現在は買えなくなった種類の電話機があります。 単に通話の機能しか持たない電話機です 。
昔は、医者に行けば薬を処方されてどうすれば良いか教えてもらえました。
今は、医者に行くと現状の説明と取り得る選択肢の羅列が行われます。
多くの選択肢を渡された患者が「先生ならばどうしますか？」と聞いても「私はあなたではありません」という答えが返ってきてしまいます。
最近では、一般人が自分で購入する事が出来ない薬のCMがテレビで多く出ています。
なぜこれが成り立つかというと、次の日の朝にコマーシャルを見た人が医者に電話をかけて「薬Xを薬Yに変更してくれ」というためです。
仕事も選択肢の増加によって変わりました。
IT の発展によって、地球上のどこにいようが1分単位でも仕事ができるようになってしまいました。
子供のサッカーのつまらない試合を見ながら、携帯電話とノートPCを持っていると「仕事をここでしようか？」と考えてしまいます。
結局つまらない試合を見続けることを選択したとしても、仕事がそこでできると言う選択肢を選択することは30秒毎に考え続けてしまいます。
2世代ぐらい前は、できるだけ早く結婚して子供を産むことは当たり前とされていました。
選択肢は一つだけで、誰と結婚するかでした。
現在は、そのような時代ではなくなりました。 現在は、結婚するしない、子供を産む産まない、いつそれらをするか、その他色々は全て選択可能です。
デフォルトの選択肢というものはありません。
今の若い人は、昔の人よりも考えなければいけない事が非常に多くなってしまいました。
その多くは、昔の人ならば考えなくても良いことでした。
結果として、私が与える宿題をこなす時間が減ってしまったと言えると思います。
これは悪いことではありません。 私が課題で出した論文を読むよりも、将来のロマンチックな人生がどうなるかを考える方が重要です。
まあ、時間をかけたとしても賢いロマンチックな選択をできるとは思えませんが。
選択肢が多いということ
選択肢は良いことです。 ただ、人々が忘れているのは、それが悪いことでもあることです。 自由と選択肢には負の側面があるということは今まで無視され続けていました。
以後の説明は、ひたすら悲観的です。 負の側面を列挙します。 忘れてはいけないのは、選択肢というのは良いものであるということです。
ただ、思ったよりもすばらしくはなかっただけです。

( 途中で質問が入り、まだこれに関してはそのような研究事例があるだけで全てにおいてこれが真とは限らないというような事を言っていた気がします)
もし、あなたが探しているものが何であるか良くわかっているのであれば、選択肢は多い方が良いです。
選択肢が多い方が、本当に欲しいものが何かをわかるからです。
ただし、そのような事はほとんどありません。
例えば、車の詳細な機能を全部羅列して買う人はいません。
いくつかの基準、例えば安全性などをもとにどの車が良いか選ぶというのがほとんどです。
最悪の選択を誘発す る
Speed Datingで相手を選ぶ基準を、賢い事、魅力的であること、笑わしてくれる事、やさしいこと、理解してくれる事、知的であること、イケテルか、など多くの基準を持ちすぎると、
結果として人を選ぶときに単純化しすぎてイケテルかだけを基準に選んでしまう。
そして、次の日の朝に起きて過ちを後悔する。
あまりに複雑すぎる要求は単純化されてしまい、最悪の選択をしてしまうことになる。
401kで選択肢を与えすぎると、何も考えずに銀行に預ける人が増えていく。
ダーツでどれかを選ぶ方がまだマシ。
満足度が低くな る

考えていると、機能は重要だと思われるが、実際にはユーザビリティが重要になる
人々は複雑すぎる機能によって苦労しているが、新しい機能がある機器が出ると、それを買ってしまう
全ての機能を使う人はほとんどいない
機能が多いものは、普通のことをするのが難しくなる

DALLAS - March 19 , 2007 - Disrupt the gene that regulates the biological clocks in mice and they become manic , exhibiting behaviors similar to humans with bipolar disorder , UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers have found .
In a study available online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , scientists from UT Southwestern show that the Clock gene , which controls the body 's circadian rhythms , may be integrally involved in the development of bipolar disorder .
Circadian rhythms include the daily ups - and - downs of waking , eating and other processes such as body temperature , hormone levels , blood pressure and heart activity .
" There 's evidence suggesting that circadian genes may be involved in bipolar disorder , " said Dr. Colleen McClung , assistant professor of psychiatry and the study 's senior author .
" What we 've done is taken earlier findings a step further by engineering a mutant mouse model displaying an overall profile that is strikingly similar to human mania , which will give us the opportunity to study why people develop mania or bipolar disorder and how they can be treated . "
Bipolar disorder , also known as manic - depressive illness , is a brain disorder that causes dramatic shifts in a person 's mood , energy and ability to function - much more severe than the normal ups and downs that most people experience .
About 5.7 million American adults , or about 2.6 percent of the adult population , suffer from the psychiatric disorder .
The study included putting the mutant mice through a series of tests , during which they displayed hyperactivity , decreased sleep , decreased anxiety levels , a greater willingness to engage in " risky " activities , lower levels of depression - like behavior and increased sensitivity to the rewarding effects of substances such as cocaine and sugar .
" These behaviors correlate with the sense of euphoria and mania that bipolar patients experience , " said Dr. McClung .
" In addition , there is a very high co-morbidity between drug usage and bipolar disorder , especially when patients are in the manic state . "
During the study , lithium was given to the mutant mice .
Lithium , a mood - stabilizing medication , is most commonly used in humans to treat bipolar patients .
Once treated with the drug on a regular basis , the majority of the study 's mice reverted back to normal behavioral patterns , as do humans .
The researchers also injected a functional Clock gene protein - basically giving the mice their Clock gene back - into a specific region of the brain that controls reward functions and where dopamine cells are located .
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with the " pleasure system " of the brain and is released by naturally rewarding experiences such as food , sex and the use of certain drugs .
This also resulted in the mice going back to normal behaviors .
" While the Clock gene is expressed throughout the brain , it 's really only been studied in one particular brain region , which is the one that 's involved in circadian rhythms , " said Dr. McClung .
" This is one of the first studies to show that Clock has a major effect on behavior in a different brain region - specifically the one that controls reward responses and mood . "
Dr. Eric Nestler , chairman of UT Southwestern 's psychiatry department and also a study author , said the research is important because it establishes the first complete mouse model for studying bipolar disorder .
" The lack of an animal model for bipolar disorder has been a crucial limitation in our efforts to better understand the biological basis of the disorder , " said Dr. Nestler , who holds the Lou and Ellen McGinley Distinguished Chair in Psychiatric Research .
" Dr. McClung 's findings are therefore very important for the field and provide fundamentally new directions for one day developing improved treatments . "

Other researchers from UT Southwestern 's psychiatry department contributing to the study were : Dr. Shari Birnbaum , assistant professor ; Dr. Sumana Chakravarty , assistant instructor ; Dr. Scott Russo , postdoctoral research fellow ; research technicians Ami Graham , Joseph Peevey and Kole Roybal ; and Vaishnav Krishnan , MSTP student .
Researchers from Harvard University , the Veterans Affairs North Texas Health Care System , Northwestern University and Howard Hughes Medical Institute also contributed .
The study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute of Mental Health .
About UT Southwestern Medical Center

UT Southwestern physicians provide medical care in 40 specialties to nearly 92,000 hospitalized patients and oversee 1.7 million outpatient visits a year .
Today in his radio address , your President again trashed the Democratic plan to set a plan for withdrawal from Iraq :
This means that the Democrats do not have enough votes to override my veto .
By choosing to make a political statement and passing a bill they know will never become law , the Democrats in Congress have only delayed the delivery of the vital funds and resources our troops need .
The clock is running .
Bush is paying the continued price of an unpopular war .
Sixty - four percent now say the war in Iraq was not worth fighting , up six points from last month to a new numerical high .
( It was 63 percent in October . )
A majority has n't said the war was worth fighting since April 2004 , and it 's been even longer since a majority has approved of how Bush is handling it .
Sixty - seven percent now disapprove ; 55 percent disapprove strongly .
In a fundamental change , 56 percent now say U.S. forces should be withdrawn at some point even if civil order has not been restored in Iraq .
That represents a continued , gradual departure from the " you break it , you 've bought it " sentiment that until now has mitigated in favor of continued U.S. involvement until some stability is attained .
Another part of this change has been a shift in views on setting a withdrawal date .
Given pro and con positions ( avoiding casualties vs. encouraging insurgents ) , support for a deadline has risen from 39 percent in late 2005 to 47 percent last summer and 53 percent now .
That 's a majority , but not a large one ; 46 percent still oppose a deadline , underscoring the difficulty of finding consensus on how to get out of Iraq .
That , of course , is Bush - speak .
He still tries to run the country like it 's 2002 .
His days of fear - mongering and tough war rhetoric are so over .
What Bush calls a " political statement " is actually what the American people want .
They 've had it with Bush and his war , which Think Progress reminds us has already been confirmed by a recent ABC News - Washington Post poll Bush never had a plan for Iraq .
Four years later , we 're trapped in a civil war .
The Democrats have started the process to get us out , which is something the Republicans did n't do and wo n't do .
Last night one of those ideal spring evenings – the weather was warm , but not too hot , the sun was shining and everyone was outside enjoying themselves .
I went running through the park and there were a lot of people – families out for an evening walk , the elderly walking in their groups and … ( drum roll please ) hot women out enjoying themselves .
I was n’t in a particularly pick up mood , to be honest .
I ’m still not totally comfortable trying to pick up women while running – it still seems a little foreign to me .
I was determined , though , to practice being social and friendly – I made it a point to say hello to almost everyone I would pass .
This time , though , I would smile warmly and say hi in a more open and friendly way .
So it was n’t like a “ drive by ” hi that I say at the last second as I ’m passing them by .
Instead , I would smile and say hello to them when I was a good 20 feet away .
That way there would be time to see them say hi back and smile .
I ’m even saying hello now to people that I pass by from behind , which I did n’t use to do before .
As I pass them by , I look back , smile and say hello .
Usually , they smile and say hello .
It ’s these little things that really help me be more social when I want to talk to hot women .
About half way into my run , I see a couple of attractive ( mid twenties ) women running towards me !
I do n’t see this very often so I wonder if this is a sign from above .
But I was n’t feeling confident enough to stop and start talking to them , so I only manage to say hello and smile at them as we pass each other .
I ’m kicking myself inside for not taking any further action .
The fear of rejection or disapproval from woman is a powerful force for many guys ( me included ) that I ’m really trying to tame and keep in its place .
I continue running towards my halfway point and keep saying hello to people I pass .
I get to my halfway point , turn around and start running back .
I start thinking of ways I could incorporate practicing picking up women while running without having to actually do it each time .
Kind of like my daily morning pick up practice where I say hi to people in my neighborhood .
I ’m almost out of the park by now and am ready to start running for home , when I see the same two women running towards me again !
So it looks like they turned around the same time as I did .
My thought pattern went something like this :
OK , this is it , this is it !
This is a perfect opportunity .
What have I got to lose – if they say no , I ’ll just continue running for home and chalk it up to another learning experience .
One of them is really hot and this could be fun !
So as we get closer to each other I say hello again .
As soon as we pass each other , I turn around and in a matter - of - fact tone say something like “ Hey , you guys mind if I run with you ? ”
They look at each other not knowing what to say , so while they ’re caught in this pause I just run up to them and say “ I know it might seem weird and all , but why do n’t we try it and if after a minute it ’s not working I ’ll be on my way . ”
They shrug in a “ why not ” kind of way and we start running together .
I ’m pretty upbeat and friendly , asking them questions about their running , if they ’ve been in this park before and what they do .
Turns out they ’re from a different part of the city but not that far away .
After a few minutes of talking , I introduce myself and they tell me their names – Heather and Nina .
They both seem nice but I ’m definitely more interested in Heather than Nina .
She ’s got this sexiness to her but she also seems friendly and open .
As we ’re talking , Heather even asks me a few questions about my running and some of my running gear .
I take that as a good sign since she would n’t be asking me things about myself if there was no interest .
The whole vibe is pretty friendly and casual .
Turns out Heather is a fitness trainer ( yes ! ) and is teaching Nina how to run .
They do a combination of running and walking so we end up walking for most of the time , which is OK with me since I ’ve already done most of my run .
Heather tells me a little of what she does , too , and how she works with kids .
I make a few light - hearted jokes about one of her stories and we all laugh , which breaks up the tension .
We spend about 10 - 15 minutes just walking and talking – there ’s a connection there but it ’s still hard to say if the connection will grow deeper .
We also have some gaps in our conversation , too , but I was n’t as concerned about it as I would be in the past .
In the past , I ’d be desperately trying to keep the conversation going all the time .
Nowadays , I ’m OK with having a few gaps in – it ’s normal and nothing to get hung up about .
I eventually tell them that I should be getting back and that it was very nice to meet up with them .
They tell me the same and I ’m debating whether to ask Heather out .
What the hell , I go for it …
As we ’re saying our good - bye’s I say , “ Listen , I do n’t usually do this kind of thing , but would you guys like to go out sometime ? ”
I did n’t really ask Heather out , I kind of asked both of them out at the same time .
There ’s a pause , they look at each other again , and Heather says “ Why do n’t we run into you here again and we ’ll take it from there ? ”
I say , “ Yeah , right , like I ’m going to see you guys here again – you ’re not from this area . ”
I just look at them , without saying a word , with a “ why not ? ! ” expression on my face .
After a few more seconds ,
Heather says , “ I have a boyfriend . ”
Then Nina says “ And I ’m engaged . ”
So I just say , “ OK , no problem . ”
It got a little awkward for a bit there but I try to ease the tension by wishing them luck in their training .
I got the sense that I was close to Heather saying yes .
A thought that came to me afterwards was that I should have made some kind of an arrangement to meet up again at the park .
That way , she ’d feel safe and would n’t have to give out her number or make any commitment , while at the same time keeping an opportunity open .
I ’m not sure I bought the “ I have a boyfriend ” excuse because why did n’t she mention it after the first time I asked her out ?
I think she just was n’t ready to give me her number – but I think there was an interest there .
I ran back home , feeling great about what happened .
I ’ve never started a conversation with two women while running and actually had it continue for that length of time ( 10 - 15 minutes ) .
I kept saying hello to people for the rest of the run home and I felt good about having put myself out there .
I ’ve said it before but I need to keep reminding myself – it ’s more important that I tried picking up than whether I picked her up or not .
Things I Learned
At the heart of approach anxiety and fear of rejection is the fear that someone wo n’t approve of us or think we ’re strange or weird or stupid .
The same fear that kept me from not saying hi to people that looked like they were busy talking to other people , kept me from not approaching Heather and Nina the first time we ran past each other .
I just thought it would be too weird – more precisely , I thought they would think that I was weird .
By continuing to say hello to virtually everyone I passed , I conditioned myself to think it ’s normal to start talking to people that I meet while I ’m running .
Picking up women starts in the mind , long before the first word is uttered .
I spent time building a connection .
It would have been nice to spend half an hour with them – and maybe I should have !
But I felt that our conversation started to lag so I thought that would be a good time to excuse myself .
In the future , it would be nice to see how long I can stretch the interaction .
The longer we talk , the better my chances of her saying yes when I ask her out .
I found this to be the case when I picked up Anna at the bookstore .
I should have focused on asking out Heather , the woman I was interested in , instead of both of them .
I wanted to be nice and extend the offer to both but I was really only interested in the more attractive one .
Sure , it might seem less threatening if I ask them both out together , but I could have directed my gaze on the one I was interested in while asking her out .
I liked that I did n’t walk away right after their initial resistance to me asking them out .
I tried again by saying that we ’re not likely to run into each other again and then just looked at them .
Now , maybe that was n’t the best way to go about it , but at least I did n’t give up as easily as before .
This is something that I ’ll develop as I practice more pick ups .
I find that women tend to resist new interactions – maybe it ’s a safety mechanism and / or social conditioning , but I think I can eventually get past that so they can see that I would be safe and fun to hang out with .
I was fairly easy going throughout the interaction .
I was n’t that nervous , even though I started talking to a couple of women and one of them was quite attractive .
This is great progress , since in the past I tended to get nervous when talking to hot women .
There ’s still a lot more work to be done here , but I can feel myself improving .
I made sure to include both women in the conversation and not just the one I was interested in .
I like this approach since it shows I ’m a generally friendly person .
If I was in a group of new people and there were guys there , I ’d talk to them , too .
I think too many guys only focus on the one woman they ’re interested in and that can come off as too intense and unfriendly .

Get it ?
Good .
This means LEARN ABOUT FUCKING SPYWARE .
If you absolutely HAVE to go to some site during work hours ( and we ’ll talk about this in a minute ) , then make sure , when the popups start showing up , you click the little black X in the upper right hand corner .
Do n’t click the big flashing “ OK ” in the middle .
Do n’t .
Whatever it is you think you should do – if it ’s not that little grey X in the uppermost right corner , do n’t do it .

Yeah , that ’s right , we know .
Every little site you ’ve gone to .
All the email that passes through your computers .
All the instant message chats you have .
We know .
All of them .
So the next time you decide you just HAVE to visit some idiotic website with a movie of two guys fucking a chicken , the next time you HAVE to spam emails to all your friends about the cute guy you hooked up with the other night and he gave you chlamydia , the next time you HAVE to talk to your ex-girlfriend about hooking up one more time behind your fiance ’s back , think twice about who might be reading that shit , and if you ’ve pissed your IT guys off .

MOUNTAIN VIEW , Calif .  Mayor Bloomberg is decrying the state of the 2008 presidential race , faulting the major party candidates for offering shallow , simplistic prescriptions , and scolding the press for failing to demand more from those seeking the White House .
During an appearance at Google 's headquarters in Silicon Valley yesterday , Mr. Bloomberg said the televised debates among the presidential candidates have been , in essence , a waste of time .
" They have absolutely nothing to do with the job and the qualifications .
And they do n't tell you anything about whether or not any of those candidates would be good or bad presidents .
What they really say is , did they memorize their notes of  What to say if ' and whether their staff was able to anticipate , " the mayor said .
" If you look at both debates , they pandered , what I would argue , the same ways . "
Mr. Bloomberg said the presidential candidates were exploiting the threat of terrorism , and failing to deliver solutions to problems such as illegal immigration , health care , and education .
" I think that none of them are addressing those issues , " the mayor said during an exchange with reporters after the Google talk .
" The press really is not doing its job of holding their feet to the fire .
...
The tough questions are not what are you in favor of , but how are you going to get it through Congress ? "
Mr. Bloomberg painted a picture of politicians in Washington dithering as America runs aground .
" The country is in trouble , " was his grim refrain .
The public critique of the presidential contest could be part of an effort on Mr. Bloomberg 's part to lay the groundwork for an independent presidential bid .
However , he insisted yesterday that he plans to serve as mayor through 2009 and then return to private life .
" I 'm not a candidate for president , " Mr. Bloomberg said .
" My next career will be in philanthropy .
I 've done the government thing . "
The mayor dismissed the debates as " just theater " and said he arrived at his assessment without having watched them on television .
Mr. Bloomberg 's appearance on Google 's campus came in the wake of visits from four declared presidential hopefuls , Senator Clinton , Governor Richardson of New Mexico , Senator McCain of Arizona , and a former senator from North Carolina , John Edwards .
The mayor 's chat was billed as part of a series dubbed " Authors @ Google . "
However , the autobiography that ostensibly prompted the invitation , " Bloomberg by Bloomberg , " was released 10 years ago .
" It is one of the seminal pieces of literature , " he quipped .
Mr. Bloomberg warmed up the technology - oriented crowd of about 1,000 with tales of the " 300 - baud , acoustically coupled " modems used in the early days of the financial news and data service that went on to make him a billionaire .
" He 's got some geek street cred , " Google 's top lobbyist in Washington , Alan Davidson , declared .
Mr. Bloomberg 's freewheeling question - and - answer session was peppered with the kind of provocative , blunt talk that could appeal to some voters while alienating others .
" It 's probably because of our bad educational system , but the percentage of people who believe in creationalism is really scary for a country that 's going to have to compete in a world where science and medicine require a better understanding , " he said in one such foray .
Today , the mayor and Governor Schwarzenegger are to take part in a conference in Los Angeles warning that Washington is addicted to and paralyzed by partisanship .
Messrs .
Bloomberg and Schwarzenegger share the cover of Time magazine this week .
" Washington is sinking into a swamp of dysfunction .
We 're talking about a serious and harmful addiction here , " Mr. Bloomberg was to tell attendees at an opening session last night , according to a prepared text released by his office .
" Unfortunately , there 's no  Promises ' clinic for partisanship . "
Earlier yesterday , Mr. Bloomberg joined San Francisco 's mayor , Gavin Newsom , at an event to build pressure on Congress to drop a legislative provision  known as the Tiahrt Amendment after the Republican congressman from Kansas who sponsored it  that bars the federal government from releasing data identifying the gun dealers that sell the most guns used in crimes .
" It 's a disgrace , " Mr. Bloomberg said .
" It 's a triumph of special interests and ideology . "
He said the restrictions have led to the deaths of police officers by preventing local officials from targeting the bad apples among gun sellers .
The mayor showed a flash of anger when asked by a New York Sun reporter about claims that releasing the gun trace data could prompt a flurry of lawsuits against weapons dealers and manufacturers .
" Let me just get this straight .
You 're worried about lawsuits and I 'm worried about going to funerals ?
That 's the story .
Which would you rather have ?
There 's no flurry of lawsuits .
If people obeyed the law , there would n't be any reason to sue , " Mr. Bloomberg said .
" That 's a ridiculous argument to make . "

That ’s the theory put forth by Laurie David in the Washington Post , describing how the National Science Teachers Association rejected an offer to send 50,000 free copies of Al Gore ’s shockumentary to schools .
The NSTA claimed that it did n’t want to distribute materials from “ special interests ” and besides , the film offered “ little , if any , benefit to NSTA or its members . ”
And , oh yeah — it might tick off the global - warming deniers at Exxon :
But there was one more curious argument in the e-mail : Accepting the DVDs , they wrote , would place “ unnecessary risk upon the [ NSTA ] capital campaign , especially certain targeted supporters . ”
One of those supporters , it turns out , is the Exxon Mobil Corp .
That ’s the same Exxon Mobil that for more than a decade has done everything possible to muddle public understanding of global warming and stifle any serious effort to solve it .
While the NSTA wo n’t distribute science - based documentaries like Gore ’s , it does promote curricula from companies including Exxon :
And it has been doing so for longer than you may think .
NSTA says it has received $ 6 million from the company since 1996 , mostly for the association ’s “ Building a Presence for Science ” program , an electronic networking initiative intended to “ bring standards - based teaching and learning ” into schools , according to the NSTA Web site .
Exxon Mobil has a representative on the group ’s corporate advisory board .
And in 2003 , NSTA gave the company an award for its commitment to science education .
So much for special interests and implicit endorsements .
Exxon may be funding more than just innocuous science materials .
Laurie reports that its free lesson plans for teachers include “ propaganda challenging global warming . ”

Conyers demands answers from Attorney General
Josh Catone
Published : Thursday March 15 , 2007 Print This Email This
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - MI ) today sent a letter to US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales demanding answers to allegations that he may have advised the President to shut down an investigation of the White House 's domestic wiretapping surveillance program because of his involvement with the program , according to a statement released to RAW STORY .
" It would be an extraordinary abuse of authority if you advised the President on this matter after learning that your own conduct was to be investigated , " Conyers wrote .
The full letter is available here ( PDF ) .
RAW STORY reported earlier today on a statement released by Sen. Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) that expressed similar concerns about the reports noting the Attorney General 's possible role in blocking an investigation of which he may have been a target .
Conyers also issued a statement about ABC News reports of emails linking Karl Rove to the US attorney firing scandal .
( RAW STORY 's coverage is here . )
" These latest reports , if true , are proof positive that lower level officials in the Justice Department are being hung out to dry , " said the statement .
" This goes all the way to the top of the Justice Department and to the most senior White House staff . "
Conyers questioned the " truthfulness of testimony given to the United States Congress " by the Justice Department .
" The White House and Justice Department owe us answers , not cover stories , and the patience of the Congress is running out , " he said .
The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to receive additional documents tomorrow and Conyers had not yet seen the emails referenced in the ABC News report at the time he released the statement .
Good story , bad headline
Since we often criticize journalists here on Language Log , I try to praise good reporting on language - related issues when I can find it .
And Rafaela von Bredow's May 3 story about Dan Everett and the Pirahã , in Spiegel Online , is very good .
She explains the facts , the interpretations and the issues in a clear and readable way .
Unfortunately , her work is spoiled by a seriously misleading headline and sub - head -- which I 'm sure that she did n't write .
As Nicole Stockdale explains , " [ h ] eadlines are written by copy editors , who battle deadlines to clean up or rewrite the reporter 's copy , massage it , then crown it with a spiffy headline " .
When the editor does n't understand the story , the result is what you 'd expect .
In this case , some anonymous Spiegel editor gave Rafaela von Bredow 's story the title " Living without Numbers or Time " , and the sub - head " The Pirah ã people have no history , no descriptive words and no subordinate clauses .
. . "
It 's true that the Pirahã lack number words , but it 's false that they " [ live ] without Time " .
It 's apparently true that they have no subordinate clauses , but false that they " have no history [ and ] no descriptive words " .
So three of the five cited facts about the language are wrong .
That 's 40 % correct , a failing grade by any reasonable standard .
Good stories are often spoiled by bad headlines -- is n't it past time to do something about this dysfunctional aspect of journalistic culture ?
[ Before going on , I should note that the body of Bredow 's article is marred by a couple of unfortunate phrases , like
What the tribesmen did n't realize , however , was that Everett , a linguist , was eavesdropping , and he could already understand enough of the Amazon people 's cacophonic singsong to make out the decisive words .
[ emphasis and dictionary links added ]
The idea that the Pirahã communicate via " harsh and unpleasant monotonously rising and falling inflections " is a value judgment added by the reporter or her editor , and it ill behooves a speaker of the much - maligned German language to sling around words like cacophonic .
However , there are only few issues of this sort in the body of the article , and in my opinion they do n't spoil its generally clear and insightful presentation of the basic facts and issues . ]
For those interested in the aspects of Pirahã treated in the headline and subhead , the stuff about numbers is well covered in the links given here .
As for subordinate clauses , Everett does argue that Pirahã lacks them , as has also been claimed for several other human languages .
( Here 's a sketch of what English might be like if it worked that way . )
With respect to time and descriptive words , I 'll quote a few relevant passages from Daniel L. Everett , " Cultural Constraints on Grammar and Cognition in Pirahã : Another Look at the Design Features of Human Language " , Current Anthropology , Volume 46 , Number 4 , August - October 2005 ( a preprint is available for those without access to a subscription ) .
Dan 's discussion of time and tense does suggest that something a bit unusual might be going on :
I have argued elsewhere ( 1993 ) that Pirahã has no perfect tense and have provided a means for accounting for this fact formally within the neo-Reichenbachian tense model of Hornstein ( 1990 ) .
This is an argument about the semantics of Pirahã tense , not merely the morphosyntax of tense representation .
In other words , the claim is that there is no way to get a perfect tense meaning in Pirahã , not merely an absence of a formal marker for it .
Pirahã has two tenselike morphemes , - a `remote ' and - i `proximate ' .
These are used for either past or present events and serve primarily to mark whether an event is in the immediate control or experience of the speaker ( " proximate " ) or not ( " remote " ) .
In fact , Pirah ã has very few words for time .
The complete list is as follows : ' ahoapió ' another day ' ( lit. ' other at fire ' ) , pi'í `now ' , so 'óá ' already ' ( lit. ' time - wear ' ) , hoa `day ' ( lit. `fire ' ) , ahoái ' night ' ( lit. ' be at fire ' ) , piiáiso ' low water ' ( lit. ' water skinny temporal ' ) , piibigaíso ' high water ' ( lit. ' water thick temporal ' ) , kahai ' aíi ' ogiíso ' full moon ' ( lit. ' moon big temporal ' ) , hisó ' during the day ' ( lit. ' in sun ' ) , hisóogiái ' noon ' ( lit. `in sun big be ' ) , hibigíbagá ' áiso ' sunset / sunrise ' ( lit. 'he touch comes be temporal ' ) , ' ahoakohoaihio ' early morning , before sunrise ' ( lit. ' at fire inside eat go ' ) .
Specifically , Dan thinks that this is a one of many linguistic symptoms of a general pattern , in which
Pirahã culture constrains communication to nonabstract subjects which fall within the immediate experience of interlocutors .
There 's plenty of room for argument here about whether " nonabstract " is a fair characterization of morphemes that mean things like " remote " vs. " proximate " , " other " , " temporal " and so on .
With respect to talk about tense and time , Dan argues that
[ I ] n the context of the present exploration of culture - grammar interactions in Pirahã , it is possible to situate the semantics of Pirah ã tense more perspicaciously by seeing the absence of precise temporal reference and relative tenses as one further example of the cultural constraint on grammar and living .
This would follow because precise temporal reference and relative tenses quantify and make reference to events outside of immediate experience and cannot , as can all Pirah ã time words , be binarily classified as " in experience " and " out of experience . "
In any case , there 's no support for the view that the Pirahã " [ live ] without time " .
As one more nail in the coffin of this notion , I 'll quote one of the example sentences from Everett 2005 :
kohoai - kabáob - áo ti gí ' ahoai - soog - abagaí eat - finish - temporal I you speak - desiderative - frustrated_initiation " When [ I ] finish eating , I want to speak to you . "
By the way , you might think that this example includes a subordinate clause , but Dan says " no " :
There is almost always a detectable pause between the temporal clause and the " main clause . "
Such clauses may look embedded from the English translation , but I see no evidence for such an analysis .
Perhaps a better translation would be " I finish eating , I speak to you . "
What about the claim that the Pirahã have " no descriptive words " ?
The only part of the the Spiegel article that might have given rise to this preposterous claim is the sentence
Apparently colors are n't very important to the Pirahãs , either -- they do n't describe any of them in their language .
Dan Everett does argue that the Pirahã have no basic color terms ( though Paul Kay , one of the commentators on the Current Anthropology article , is not convinced ) .
I 'm not sure what it would mean for a language have " no descriptive words " , but a couple of additional Pirahã examples should establish that it's not true in this case :
bii - o3 pai2 ai3 blood - dirty / opaque be / do " blood is dirty "
kahaí kai - sai hi ob - áa 'áí arrow make - nominative he see - attractive " He knows how to make arrows well . "
( lit .
" He sees attractively arrow - making . " )
[ Update : Julia Hockenmaier raises a possibility that should have occurred to me -- the headline might have been botched in translation .
She points out that the headline and subhead in the German version read :
LINGUISTIK : Leben ohne Zahl und Zeit
Das Volk der Pirahã kennt keine Vergangenheit , keine Farbwörter , keine Nebensätze .
Das macht seine Sprache zur merkwürdigsten der Welt - und zum Zankapfel der Linguisten .
and comments :
' Zeit ' in German means both tense and time , so I think this is just a translation error .
Similarly , ' Vergangenheit ' means either ' past ' or ' past tense ' ( especially in this list of language - related terms ) , but not ' history ' ( that would be 'Geschichte ' ) .
And the original does n't say ' descriptive terms ' , but ' color words ' .
She also asks
By the way , how is this absence of tense different from , say , Chinese ?
It really does n't seem that unusual to me .
As I understand Dan 's argument , he 's claiming that the Pirahã 's time - related morphology is consistent with their general cultural pattern , not that it 's unique . ]

I am finally beginning to understand the appeal of Fred Thompson .
Even though he seems at a loss to describe , rationally , why he might want to become president , or what he might do when he was president , or what the difference might be between being president and having a really good sandwich , the simple fact cannot be argued : Fred Thompson has been on the TV .
And being on TV is , in these most modern times , exactly equivalent to reality .
It 's better then reality , even : it 's megareality , for those people who , unlike you , can afford to supersize their reality , and bling it out a bit .
Reality is not reality unless it has a narrative , and a plot , and is populated by people more attractive and influential than you .
Fred Thompson is an accomplished lawyer , because he played one in a fictional TV show .
Fred Thompson became a Senator because in a movie , he had played a Senator .
In the same way that Paris Hilton is important because there is an entire industry which revolves around telling us she is important , Fred Thompson is presidential because on the TV , it currently says so .
Thompson , inescapably , has been on TV .
This is inarguable , and with that one sparkling nugget of experience , the case is -- or should be -- closed .
Like Reagan , he has played roles which required looking earnest , which is entirely the same thing as being earnest .
He has read lines which were witty and articulate , which is exactly the same thing as being witty and articulate .
Like a political version of Paris , we are required to be entranced by him , because somebody in charge of such things decided that he was " attractive " , which is exactly like being intelligent and knowledgeable , except much better , because attractiveness is worn on the face and in the hair , admired by all , whereas more ephemeral " intelligence " , if it threatens to be made visible for even a moment , is roundly disliked and frowned upon .
Attractive people -- and by that I mean , the people who have been deemed to be attractive not by you or I , but by people whose entire jobs it is to decide these things and announce them earnestly on the newsstands and the Idiot Box -- are celebrated , are fawned over , are sought after .
Intelligent people , though , are just pushy .
Al Gore thought he was better than you ; this is why he was loathed .
The handsome Thompson , however , is better than you , by virtue of the aforementioned being attractive whilst on TV , which makes it all right .
He deserves entry into the race , based on those qualifications : he is eminently presidential , based on that resume .
He is Reaganesque , even , if Reagan had been less of a 50 's - era leading man type and more of a tenderized , slightly doughy , puzzlingly lumpy ex-football player turned midpriced motivational speaker .
I 'm not sure whether Thompson ever played second fiddle to a dull - eyed and vaguely unwilling thespian chimp , however .
But if both Ronald Reagan and Dick Cheney could do it , I 'm sure Fred could if the situation ever came up .
Which , no doubt , it might .
Thompson could have been , however , lacking one critical requirement for the presidency .
Thompson was elected to the United States Senate after he portrayed a Senator in a movie , thus giving the American people a nice fictionalized demonstration of how he'd look in the role -- a visual aid we get much too infrequently , in these days when we are Far Too Goddamn Stupid To Extrapolate These Things Out On Our Own .
He 's played the director of the CIA , he 's played military men and various law enforcement officers , thus by modern publicity standards amply qualifying him for all those real - life roles .
He has played a white supremacist .
And at least twice now , in two separate strokes of fortune , he has played an American president .
That had threatened to be a resume hole that could n't be overlooked .
Without him playing the role on the TV or in a movie theater or on a convenient freely distributed DVD , we would have no idea what kind of president he'd be .
Would he be a stern but gruffly lovable Martin - Sheenesque - but - conservative presence , dispensing pearls of wisdom as he , when offstage for an idle moment , appoints the last necessary Supreme Court Justices to cement far right conservative positions into the law for the next several decades ?
Or more the Lloyd Bridges type , from Hot Shots !
Part Deux ?
Would he be one of those shadowy , barely visible chief executives that haunt the presidential visions of those that create our darkest thrillers -- an incompetent boob or malicious , venomous half - criminal , world entwined around his fingers , the obstacle in chief , powerful would - be thwarter of some as - of - yet unknown but no doubt far more handsome action - oriented protagonist ?
There was no way to know -- until 2005 , when Thompson starred as a fictional president in a 45 minute docudrama produced for the Nuclear Threat Initiative about the possibility of terrorists using stolen " loose nukes " against America , and more recently a mere few weeks ago , when Fred Thompson quite remarkably and fortuitously appeared as President Ulysses S. Grant in an HBO made - for - cable adaptation of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee .
The potential resume hole in his fictional expertise has thus been doubly fictionally plugged , the last instance being a mere fortnight before his sorta - not - but - kinda - yes unofficial official entrance into the race and we can , with satisfaction , know what sort of chief executive Fred Thompson would be .
Or rather , we can choose between two possibilities .
He might be a theatrically stern president , heading a complacent and incompetent American government incapable of taking proactive action to prevent terrorist attacks on our soil -- perhaps a little too close to the current mark for comfort , for 2008 voters -- or alteratively , he would be theatrically stern president who dresses in old - timey clothes , drinks brandy freely , and who and we'd see for maybe about five stern minutes out of his term in grand total .
But in either case , that 'd be enough for the usual conservative suspects to bubble with admiration .
Either would suffice , so long as he played the role sternly , and with conviction .
There is no difference , after all , between being truly erudite , and merely playing the part .
That much we know ; that much has been demonstrated .
There is no difference between being a good leader , and pretending to be one : it is a distinction without value .
There is no between doing something , and merely saying you will do it ; both will be treated the same .
There is no difference between being competent and being incompetent , so long as competence is asserted .
There is no difference between having integrity , and being corrupt but genial ; either will gain the same praise , and in the same proportions .
We have learned all these things from the words and actions of the national pundit press , this last decade - plus .
These things must be true , must all be synonymous -- for the only other possibility is that the entire fabric of our nation , collectively , from the top down , from page A1 onward , is too stupid or corrupted to really know the difference .
I propose , therefore , that since we seem utterly and hopelessly doomed towards blurring the worlds of the real and the fictional -- listening to a mere five minutes of the Republican presidential debate should have demonstrated the unholy merging of the two nicely , especially re : the recitations of fictional histories of the Iraq War -- we simply go whole hog , so to speak .
We cut the middleman , we stop going for the merely half - empty glass , we give up and finally throw the baby out with the now disturbingly filthy bathwater .
We treat the press as the entertainment supernova it so earnestly strives to be , we finally cut to ribbons that one remaining thin , translucent plastic sheet separating politics and reality television , between the socially responsible and the salaciously irresponsible , we abandon forever the notions of political accountability , we stop feigning interest in issues , in accuracy , in oversight , and in ideas entirely , and merely go for the haircut and boobs coverage .
There is a more direct path towards presidential mediocrity than a mere Fred Thompson , and one that will finally arrive at the goal we have been striving for since long before the days of Mencken .
The perfect nexus of reality TV , of entirely fictionalized earnestness , of slavish , spittle - flecked reporting and vapidity practiced as deadly art .
The simpleness is staggering in its simple simplicity .
We should , in deference to the enforced vapidity of the press , simply abandon all hope of anything better , and elect Paris Hilton as our president .
We have already had a reality TV series revolving around the seemingly simple proposition of trying to somehow coax an honest day 's work out of the delicate and endowed heiress : this could be the much - needed blockbuster sequel .
She may not strictly meet Constitutional requirements -- her age , for example , seems to constantly oscillate between twelve and pickled -- but she meets the wealth and connectedness requirements so admirably that I am sure we would be quite willing to waive whatever remaining laws might obstruct her upwards ascension , just as we already have taken to doing .
I am not saying she would be a great president , or even a tolerable one , or even a less than catastrophic one .
I am saying that , given the predictable interests of the nation and the press , she may be the best we can do .
At the very least she comes with a dedicated press phalanx , a veritable ( if uncalled for ) media army steeped in the tawdry , savage and cannibalistic in their fights over even the slightest trinkets of personal misery -- oh , what we would not give for dedication towards exposure and probing , monomaniacal research , in the Washington press .
The things those reporters would find , if redirected away from Paris Hilton 's shoe rack , and towards the halls of power !
We 've lived through six years of Bush .
We 've seen Paris ' boobs , and we 've seen Bush 's boobs , and Bush 's various and more free - ranging boobs have done more lasting damage and gotten far less slavish coverage .
It is entirely possible , I admit , that under a Paris Hilton presidency things would take a dramatic turn towards the even worse , and that her administration would , between drinking binges , White House sex tapes , and pandering celebration of the wealthy and powerful that sails right past the lofty heights of the oligarchic and into circuslike and Neroesque , along with all the rest of the presumably predictable peccadillos -- none of these flaws on their face much worse , we must admit , than the abstract behavior of many previous presidents -- bring even more ruin upon the nation .
But at least it would be very well covered , in the press .
Very , very well covered indeed .
With cameras , and helicopters , and driving scenes , and earnest psychological analyses , and computer generated models of the various rooms she might or might not be in at any particular time , and smiles on anchors ' faces like it was Christmas morning and Santa had just delivered anatomically correct Ken and Barbie dolls just like they had asked for , and pundits galore , by satellite and in studio and via telephone and remote feeds and perhaps the entire prolonged event could even gain its own musical theme : maybe a single riff , descending , a siren call towards national apocalypse .
The national interest , covered with such fervor and fanfare ?
The fate and future of the nation , the fate of the courts , of our sky and soil , our national security , the future dreams of our children , all covered as if it were a single extraordinarily wealthy and connected and spoiled white girl ?
We should be so lucky .
IS IT legal to make a copy of that DVD you 've just bought so the family can watch it around the home or in the car ?
In one of the most watched copyright cases in recent years , a judge in northern California ruled last month that copying DVDs for personal use was legal , given the terms of the industry 's licence and the way the copies were made .
The wider implication of the ruling remains clouded — not least because the DVD Copy Control Association , the loser in the case , has 60 days to appeal .
But whatever the video industry may like to think , the writing is on the wall for copy protection .
Copyright is a tricky thing .
It protects only the way that an author , designer , photographer , film - maker or composer has expressed himself .
It does not cover the ideas or the factual information conveyed in the work .
What constitutes fair use or an infringement is trickier still .
Much depends on the purpose and character of the borrowed material 's use .
Limited reproduction for the purpose of criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , scholarship and research is considered fair game .
But the wholesale repackaging of the content for commercial use is a flagrant infringement .
In America , the Audio Home Recording
Act of 1992 made it legal for people to record copyrighted radio broadcasts for personal use .
But while the act said nothing about making digital recordings , ripping copyrighted music tracks off CDs and storing them on an iPod has become an everyday occurrence .
Despite the number of iTunes downloaded for a fee , Apple would be in trouble if people were prevented from transferring legitimately owned CDs to their iPods .
The software Apple gives away to iPod customers is designed to let them do just that .
Most people think it ludicrous that they can't do the same with the DVDs they own .
Now it seems , despite squeals from the movie industry , the law is finally moving in the video fan 's favour .
The issue in the recent case was whether Kaleidescape , a maker of digital “ jukeboxes ” that store a person 's video and music collections and distribute the entertainment around the home , had breached the terms of the DVD Content Control Association 's CSS ( content scrambling system ) licence .
A Kaleidescape server stores digital content ripped from CDs and DVDs on its hard drive .
The content is then encrypted and fed to various screens and speakers around the home by a secure cable .
Kaleidescape claimed that content distributed this way was even safer than it was on the original polycarbonate disks .
The judge not only agreed , but could n't find any breach of the copy - protection licence either .
If the case ends there , to all intents and purposes the notion of fair use would appear to apply to DVDs as well as CDs .
The movie industry , which nowadays depends as much on DVD sales as on box - office receipts , still seems to think that making life difficult for its customers is a recipe for success .
After likewise shooting itself in the foot for ages , the record industry is now falling over itself to abandon DRM ( digital rights management ) on CDs .
A number of online music stores such as eMusic , Audio Lunchbox and Anthology have given up using DRM altogether .
In a recent survey by Jupiter Research , two out of three music industry executives in Europe reckoned that dropping DRM would improve sales .
The latest music publisher to do so is EMI , which announced in January that it had stopped producing CDs with DRM protection .
“ The costs of DRM , ” it declared , “ do not measure up to the results . ”
In an open letter entitled “ Thoughts on Music ” , even Steve Jobs , Apple 's charismatic boss and chief evangelist , recently called for the elimination of DRM .
From this month , Apple 's iTunes will sell EMI 's highest quality recordings ( those with sampling rates of 256 kilobits per second ) without DRM for a small premium .
Belatedly , music executives have come to realise that DRM simply does n't work .
It is supposed to stop unauthorised copying , but no copy - protection system has yet been devised that can not be easily defeated .
All it does is make life difficult for paying customers , while having little or no effect on clandestine copying plants that churn out pirate copies .
Now the copy protection on DVDs is proving just as easy to bypass .
The biggest flop has been the CSS technology featured in the recent Kaleidescape case .
It was first cracked back in 1999 by a Norwegian programmer called Jon Lech Johansen , who showed , in a few short lines of elegant code called DeCSS , just how trivial such lauded protection systems really were .
Since then , even the DRM used to protect the new high - definition video disks ( the Blu-ray format from the Sony camp and its HD - DVD rival from the Toshiba alliance ) have been cracked wide open .
While most of today 's DRM schemes that come embedded on CDs and DVDs are likely to disappear over the next year or two , the need to protect copyrighted music and video will remain .
Fortunately , there are better ways of doing this than treating customers as if they were criminals .
One of the most promising is Audible Magic 's content protection technology .
Google is currently testing this to find the “ fingerprints ” of miscreants who have posted unauthorised television or movie clips on YouTube .
The beauty of such schemes is that they do n't actually prevent anyone from making copies of original content .
Their purpose is simply to collect royalties when a breach of copyright has occurred .
By being reactive rather than pre-emptive , normal law - abiding consumers are then left in peace to enjoy their music and video collections in any way they choose .
Why could n't we have thought of that in the beginning ?

Mutant mice live longer , age slower and eat more .
Reducing the influence of adrenaline helps mice live longer .
Getty
Researchers have created a mutant mouse that lives longer despite eating more and weighing less — all thanks to the loss of a single protein .
Without this protein , the body is less susceptible to the heart - pounding effects of the hormone adrenaline , and may become more resistant to some forms of stress .
Scientists are already developing drugs to inhibit this protein , called type 5 adenylyl cyclase ( AC5 ) .
" Clearly we would be very interested in such a compound , " says cardiologist Stephen Vatner , who is part of the team that discovered this effect .
Currently , the main focus of ageing research is on using calorie restriction as a way of activating a metabolic ' fountain of youth ' .
The new discovery , that knocking out a single cardiac gene could lengthen lifespan , was an unexpected byproduct of heart research .
Vatner , together with Junichi Sadoshima and other colleagues at the New Jersey Medical School at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark , had initially set out to determine whether getting rid of AC5 leads to a healthier heart .
Drugs that block adrenaline signalling , called beta - blockers , are known to help patients who have had heart attacks or suffer from an irregular heartbeat .
As the researchers revealed in 2003 , mutant mice lacking AC5 were more resistant to heart failure caused by pressure within the heart1 .
But in the process , the research team also realised that the mutant mice lived longer than their normal counterparts .
Now , in a paper published in Cell this week2 , they report that the treated mice lived 30 % longer and did not develop the heart stress and bone deterioration that often accompanies ageing .
Anti-cancer properties
AC5 could boost longevity by reducing the trauma caused when chemically reactive forms of oxygen accumulate .
The accrued damage from these molecules is thought to contribute to ageing .
AC5 mutants make more of a protein called ERK2 , which regulates oxidative - stress responses .
When Vatner and his colleagues increased ERK2 levels in budding yeast , these yeast lived longer .
There are several mysteries about the mice lacking AC5 .
Young mutants weigh the same as their normal counterparts , but elderly AC5 mutants weigh less — even though they eat more .
That suggests a metabolic change , says Vatner , which could be mimicking calorie restriction .
It is also possible that mice without AC5 are more resistant to cancer , Vatner adds .
" The major reason that old mice die is not because of heart failure , " says Vatner .
" The majority of normal mice die from some sort of tumour . "
It is possible , he says , that the mutants are longer lived because they are able to stave off tumour formation .
The wonder drug
All of that makes an AC5 inhibitor sound like a miracle drug , but the solution may not be that simple .
In the absence of AC5 , mutant mice still respond to adrenaline , but the hormone 's effect on the heart is less pronounced .
But adrenaline responses come in handy during stressful ' fight - or - flight ' situations , cautions Michael Bristow , a cardiologist at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver .
AC5 is part of a complicated pathway , he adds , and the full ramifications of knocking it out are not yet known .

There could also be mental side - effects , notes H. Kirk Hammond , a cardiologist at the University of California , San Diego in La Jolla .
Mice that lack AC5 do not respond as well to morphine or antipsychotic drugs such as haloperidol .
Both Bristow and Hammond agree that the results are exciting and that they open up a new avenue of ageing research .
But Hammond adds that although an AC5 inhibitor may make a fine drug for protecting the heart , there are more straightforward options for boosting longevity .
" I think first what I would do is get people to slow down on the highway , stop eating Big Macs and stop smoking , " says Hammond .

Technology has revolutionized the way we live one way or another .
Perhaps , try asking yourself , when was the last time you leave the house without a mobile phone or eat without taking a photo first ?
As convenient as a mobile phone may be , it has its downside too .
May it be the limitation of your iPhone storage capacity or screen size , you ca n’t help but wonder how to you can deal with these problems effectively .
So , to free up your iPhone memory storage , you can choose to transfer photos from your iPhone computer or delete them permanently .
Here ’s exactly how you do it with or without the presence of iTunes .
1. Transferring Photos From iPhone to Computers Through iTunes
Transferring photos from your iPhone to your computer through the use of the iTunes app is one of the easiest method out there .
When you ’re an iPhone user , it ’s probably Apple ’s rule of thumb to install the iTunes app in your computers for all iPhone - related problems .
When you need to transfer photos to the computer via iTunes , the app will automatically sync all pictures between your iPhone and your laptop or desktop .
However , it only copies those pictures that are saved on your smartphone but not on your computer .
To do this , follow these steps :
If you do n’t have the iTunes app installed on your PC , click here for the installation file .
Otherwise , proceed to the next step .
On your computer , double - click on the iTunes app icon to launch .

Once you ’ve selected a range of photos / albums , click on “ Apply . ”
Click on “ Done ” when the syncing progress has been completed .
2. Transferring Photos From iPhone to Computers Through Windows Explorer
Also known as File Explorer in other Windows computers , the Windows Explorer is another method to transfer photos from iPhone to your computer .
This method does n’t require the iTunes app or any third - party software .
Through this method , all your photos and videos will be stored in one folder instead of per album .
As a result , it ’s more difficult to manage all your pictures and choose the best photos for transferring .
If you ’re using this method , follow these set of instructions on how to transfer photos from iPhone to your computer using Windows Explorer :
Using a USB cable or cord , connect your iPhone to your Windows desktop or laptop .
Ensure that you ’ve unlocked your iPhone .
When you ’re prompted with a dialog box saying “ Trust This Computer ? ” , tap on “ Trust ” on your iPhone .
3 . On your Windows desktop or laptop , open My Computer .
4. From the Windows Explorer panel , you should have your iPhone under the “ Portable Devices ” section .
5. Double - click on that folder to open the file .
You will see the “ DCIM ” folder .
6 . Open the DCIM folder .
7. Select your expected photos from your iPhone .
You can either select all photos or multiple - select your photos .
8. Right - click on the selected files or you can tap “ Ctrl + C ” on your keyboard to copy these photos .
9 . Paste these images on your desired folder by selecting “ Ctrl + V ” on your keyboard .
3. Import Photos and Videos From iPhone to Windows PC
Under the same section of transferring photos from iPhone to your computer using Windows Explorer is through the import method .
To perform this process , here are the steps :
Unlock your smartphone .
With a USB cable or cord , connect your iPhone between your desktop or laptop .

On the left navigation , double - click on “ This PC ” or “ Computer ” depending on the Windows version running on your PC .
Right - click on your iPhone ’s device name .
Click on “ Import Pictures and Videos . ”
In the pop -up panel , click “ Review , Organize and Group Items to Import ” or “ Import All New Items Now . ”
Depending on your preference , the first one will display a list of files grouped accordingly .
You can choose multiple files and / or folders that you want to import .
Otherwise , selecting the other option will immediately start the importing process .
4. Transferring Photos From iPhone to Computers Through AutoPlay Feature on Windows
Through the AutoPlay feature , it ’s similar to transferring photos from iPhone using Windows Explorer .
Also , in this process , you must ensure that your computer ’s AutoPlay feature is activated .
Here are the instructions to follow if you ’re using this method instead :
With a USB cord or cable , connect your iPhone to your PC .
Once you ’re prompted with a “ Trust This Computer ? ” pop-up on your iPhone , tap on “ Trust . ”
3. From your Windows PC , an AutoPlay pop-up is displayed prompting for your action .
4. Under Device Options , click on “ Import Pictures and Videos . ”
5. Click on “ Import Settings ” so you can specify the folder path for saving your photos and / or videos .
6 . Then , click on “ Browse ” when prompted with the “ Import Images To ” for folder path specification .
7. Click on “ OK ” once you ’ve specified the folder location or name for your photos and videos .
5. Transferring Photos From iPhone to Computers Through iCloud
Another platform for transferring photos from iPhone to any computer without the iTunes app is using iCloud service .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz admitted on Thursday he made a mistake and apologized for his handling of the promotion and pay increase of his girlfriend and staffer Shaha Riza .
“ I proposed to the board that they establish some mechanism to judge whether the agreement reached was a reasonable outcome , ” Wolfowitz said in a statement he read at a news conference before upcoming meetings of finance ministers in Washington this weekend .
“ I will accept any remedies they propose , ” he added .
Wolfowitz defended his actions to send Riza on an external assignment to the U.S. State Department soon after he joined the bank in 2005 , saying he was in “ uncharted waters ” in his new job .
“ In hindsight , I wish I had trusted my original instincts and kept myself out of the negotiations .
I made a mistake , for which I am sorry , ” he said .
The bank ’s board , which includes government representatives from the bank ’s 185 member countries , was meeting on the matter on Thursday .
After an adjournment , the board resumed their meeting focusing on whether Wolfowitz bent the rules on Riza ’s promotion and violated staff rules .
But the World Bank ’s employee representative group called for Wolfowitz to resign during a staff meeting at the bank .
“ The president must acknowledge that his conduct has compromised the integrity and effectiveness of the World Bank Group and has destroyed the staff ’s trust in his leadership , ” according to written remarks presented at the meeting by staff association chair Alison Cave and obtained by Reuters .
“ He must act honorably and resign , ” she said .
Cave said it seemed impossible for the institution , whose mission is to fight global poverty , to move forward “ with any sense of purpose under the present leadership . ”
WOLFOWITZ AT STAFF MEETING
Witnesses said Wolfowitz came to the meeting and tried to defend his actions .
The controversy spilled into the open last week when the staff association questioned the promotion and pay increase of Riza , prompting an investigation by the board .
World bank President Paul Wolfowitz listens to a journalist in Johannesburg March 15 , 2007 .
Wolfowitz on Thursday said he made " a mistake for which I am sorry " over his handling of a promotion and pay increase for a staff member , Shaha Riza , whom he is dating .
REUTERS / Siphiwe Sibeko
Wolfowitz , who was nominated by President George W. Bush , joined the bank after serving as deputy defense secretary at the Pentagon , where he was one of the chief architects of the U.S. war strategy in Iraq .
Lingering distrust among many staff members and resentment over his close ties to the Bush administration and his role in the Iraq war has overshadowed his first two years at the bank .
“ For those people who disagree with the things that they associate me with in my previous job -- I ’m not in my previous job , ” Wolfowitz said .
“ I ’m not working for the U.S. government . ”
The White House , which nominated Wolfowitz for the job in 2005 , reiterated its support for him .
“ In dealing with this issue he has taken full responsibility and is working with the executive board to resolve it , ” White House spokesman Tony Fratto told Reuters .
Development group Oxfam said in a statement such controversies could be avoided if the choice of World Bank president was not a U.S. political appointment .
Wolfowitz said that when he joined the bank he told the board about his relationship with Riza to address potential conflict of interest issues .
He said he took the advice of the board ’s ethics committee to relocate Riza , a former senior communications officer in the Middle East Department .
I saw this headline in the news :
Wolfowitz Blames Media for Resignation
Uh , Mr. Wolfowitz , that is the way it is supposed to work .
The media is supposed to bring to light problems and issues that organizations typically cannot fix by themselves .
The headline should read : Wolfowitz Blames Self for Resignation
How To Choose CD / DVD Archival Media
( Last updated January 11th 2013 )
Translations : Serbo- Croatian by Jovana Milutinovich
Ahh , I ’ve been planning to write this one for awhile : an entire article on archival quality media .
As I do professional software development as well as professional photography ( what a weird combination ) , I need archival quality CD and DVD media to store my data on .
However , one of the hardest things to is actually find good media , or even understand why it is good media .
This article focuses on the history of Compact Discs , writable CD / DVD media , and why DVD+R is superior to DVD-R .
If you want to just know what media is worth buying , skip to the summary at the bottom .
Short history of the Compact Disc
The invention of the Compact Disc has had a large impact on both music and computing in the last 20 years .
Invented in 1979 as a joint project between Sony and Philips to counter the self - destructive nature of consumer audio playback ( such as tapes and records that could only be played so many times before the recording degraded significantly ) by switching to a resilient digital format .
The CD was also designed to store standard computer data , as in 1985 the first CD drives for computers were released ; massive , bulky , and expensive , it was not until the mid-90s that they really took off , driven almost solely by video games and large multimedia applications .
In 1990 , Sony and Philips went back to the drawing table , and then came out with the CD - R , a record - once medium .
Yet again , the first CD burners were large , expensive , and bulky , but by the late 90s having a CD burner was the new ‘ in ’ .
The first few generations of CD media , designed by Taiyo Yuden ( a company who I respect , and buy all my archival quality media from ) , actually kind of sucked ; it was n’t until around 2000 that companies started producing very high end media .
CDs and DVDs store individual bits ( encoded in various ways depending on the media ) with spots of reflective and non-reflective areas .
This method is called ‘ pits and lands ’ , where pits ‘ absorb ’ light ( ie , are ‘ off ’ bits ) and lands ‘ reflect ’ light ( ie , are ‘ on ’ bits ) .
With pressed media , the pressing method causes pits to reflect the laser ’s light away from the sensor , and the lands to reflect it back at the sensor .
With burned media , a high energy laser causes spots of organic dye to go opaque and obscure the reflective surface for the pits , leaving the organic dye for lands alone .
Short history of the DVD
While burning was becoming popular in the late 90s , so was playing high quality video on DVDs .
Storing almost 7 times the data of a 700 MB CD ( or almost 13 in the case of dual layer DVDs ) , allowed companies to store massive amounts of data on one disc , leading to the movie industry to drop VHS tapes and the video game industry to drop CDs .
In 1995 , the first DVD specification was ratified by over a dozen companies including Sony and Philips , as well as Thompson , Pioneer , and Mitsubishi .
By 2000 , at least half the homes in the US and Japan had DVD players .
So , obviously , the next step was to produce burnable DVDs .
Two separate , and incompatible , efforts took hold .
The first one , Pioneer ’s DVD - R ( pronounced ‘ DVD dash R’ ) was released in 1997 , using different data storage methods than pressed DVDs ( appearing to be more like CD - R than DVD ) , a poor error correction scheme , and the ‘ wobble ’ laser tracking system of DVD -R is inadequate for the job .
The second effort , lead by the DVD +RW Alliance ( headed by Sony , Philips , Mitsubishi , and Thompson ) was released in 2002 , as an alternative to the poorly implemented DVD - R. DVD+R uses a superior ‘ wobble ’ laser tracking system , a far better error correction method , and the media quality itself is typically higher .
( See the ‘ Why DVD+R ? ’ section below for a more technical explanation )
Why archival media is hard to produce
Unlike pressed CDs / DVDs , ‘ burnt ’ CDs / DVDs can eventually ‘ fade ’ , due to five things that effect the quality of CD media : Sealing method , reflective layer , organic dye makeup , where it was manufactured , and your storage practices ( please keep all media out of direct sunlight , in a nice cool dry dark place , in acid - free plastic containers ; this will triple the lifetime of any media ) .
The silver and aluminum alloys used in virtually all blank CD / DVD media has one major issue , requiring the manufacturer to lacquer a protective seal over the entire disc : silver and aluminum oxidize when they hit air , turning the normally reflective layer into silver or aluminum rust .
Some ( very expensive ) media uses gold instead which does n’t oxidize , however DVD media cannot use gold due to design issues ( not true anymore , see update 1 below ) .
Today , only the cheapest of the cheap media has severe issues with sealing practices ( as such , avoid any media made outside of Japan and Taiwan ; especially avoid media made in India ) .
Assuming that the protective seal and reflective layer are manufactured correctly , the next issue is the organic dye .
The first organic dyes , designed by Taiyo Yuden , were Cyanine - based and , under normal conditions , had a shelf life of around ten years ; simply , that was simply unacceptable for archive discs .
Taiyo Yuden , Mitsubishi Chemicals , Mitsui Co. , and Ciba Specialty Chemicals spent the next ten years trying to produce the best organic dyes , eventually reaching archive - quality CD media .
Taiyo Yuden produced ‘ Super Cyanine ’ , a chemically stabilized version of the original Cyanine dye designs , while TDK offers media that uses ‘ metal - stabilized Cyanine ’ dye , leading to similar shelf lives as Taiyo Yuden ’s media .
Taiyo Yuden states their Super Cyanine dye is chemically stable for at least 70 years , and TDK states their metal - stabilized Cyanine is also stable for 70 years .
On the other hand , Mitsubishi went in a different direction and produced what is called a Metal Azo dye , that they claim is stable for around 100 years .
Azo dyes are chemically stable , however , the shelf life of media using Azo dyes typically does not exceed that of Super Cyanine and metal - stabilized Cyanine .
The third dye produced for CD media is called Phthalocyanine dye , with the majority of such dyes produced by Mitsui and Ciba .
Typically marketed as more resistant to heat and UV radiation than Cyanine and Azo , modern Cyanine and Azo dyes last just as long in extreme conditions .
DVDs also use similar dyes , however manufacturers have intentionally kept what dyes they use a secret ( instead of a feature in their marketing of the media ) , and all blank DVDs are intentionally the same color ( as different dyes on CDs make blanks different colors , however , it is not indicative of what dye is used due to some manufacturers using different colored silver alloys and non-reactive additives in the dye ) .
Why Taiyo Yuden media , and how to buy in the US
The best discs in circulation tend to be Taiyo Yuden media .
In Japan , you find their media under the brand
That ’s , which are wholly owned by Taiyo Yuden .
As of late 2009 , Taiyo Yuden announced they were buying the JVC Advanced Media brand , and making it a wholly owned and operated brand for TY products .
They did this to put Taiyo Yuden products on store shelves worldwide .
See update 4 at the bottom for a full explanation .
Simply put , I have never had problems with any kind of Taiyo Yuden media .
Ever .
I have bought CDs and DVDs under a dozen different brands ( including non-Taiyo Yuden manufactured TDK and Verbatim ) , and the only ones that have had a 100 % success rate is Taiyo Yuden .
If you cannot find any company selling media under the Taiyo Yuden / JVC Advanced Media brand , I suggest buying from the SuperMediaStore.com , who offer a wide range of Taiyo Yuden CD media , DVD-R media , and DVD+R media .
I tend to buy just from them , as they are the only company that guarantees that their media is actually from Taiyo Yuden and not a fake ( see the above linked FAQ on information about fake Taiyo Yuden media ) .
Why DVD+R ?
This is the most technical section of the article .
If you do n’t understand the basics of how CD / DVD media works , or find such technical discussions boring , skip to the next section .
As I said earlier , DVD - R sucks for data preservation for three reasons : inferior error correction , inferior ‘ wobble ’ tracking , and the fact its data writing methods look like an un-needed halfway point between CD -R and DVD+R .
The wobble tracking I shall explain first , then the error corrections method , then the specifics of ATIP / pre-pit / ADIP optimum power settings .
For a CD / DVD burner to track where it is on the disc , it uses three things : the ‘ wobble ’ of the data track ( where it actually wobbles back and forth instead of in a straight line ) to tell where it is in the track , the position of the track to tell where it is on the disc , and some additional information on the disc to tell where the track ( singular , as CDs and DVDs only have one track , and it is written in a concentric spiral ) begins and ends .
This additional information on a CD- R is called the ATIP ( Absolute Time In Pregroove ) , which contains how long the track is , where it begins , what the maximum and minimum writing speeds are , what formula dye it uses , who actually made it , optimum power control settings , and error correction data .
The ATIP is stored as a frequency modulation in the wobble itself .
However , since the wobble changes subtly to encode data , it is impossible to use with the small size of tracks DVD requires , as electric noise in the laser pickup and wobbles introduced by the electric motor spinning the disc , these could easily be read as frequency changes in the real track itself .
On DVD-R , they tried to solve the problem with something called ‘ pre- pits ’ where spikes in the amplitude of the wobble appear due to pits fully out of phase with the rest of the track ( ie , between two spirals of the track , where there is no data ) .
This can be viewed as a simple improvement over CD - R as it makes it easier to track the wobble ( since the wobble is constant except for the easy to detect and remove spikes ) .
Unfortunately , this method as one flaw : due to electric noise in the laser pickup , it would be very easy to miss the pre-pit ( or read one that was n’t actually there ) if the disc were damaged or spun at fast speeds .
The time to read a pre-pit is 1T ( roughly .0000000038th of a second ) , which even for a computer can be easy to miss .
DVD -R traded hard to track frequency changes for hard to read wobble - encoded data .
On a DVD+R , however , they came up with a much better method .
Instead of changing the frequency of the wobble , or causing amplitude spikes in the wobble , they use complete phase changes .
Where CD - R’s and DVD - R’s methods make you choose between either easy wobble tracking or easy ATIP reading , DVD +R ’s method makes it very easy to track the wobble , and also very easy to encode data into the wobble .
DVD+R ’s method is called ADIP ( ADdress In Pre-groove ) , which uses a phase change method .
With ADIPs ’ phase changes , the direction of the wobble changes and continues on going in the exact opposite direction ( ie , counter - clockwise to clockwise , or the reverse ) .
For example , if the wobble was ‘ going up ’ , the phase change causes it to instantly reverse direction start ‘ going down ’ no matter where it in the wobble cycle .
The phase change is very easy to detect , and also continues for a set period ( in this case , one 32T section of the track , or 32 times longer than the pre-pit method of DVD - R ) .
The state of the phase change ( clockwise or counter - clockwise ) encodes the individual bits in each block
In essence , with the phase change method , not only do you have an easy way of tracking the wobble , but you now have an easy way of reading wobble - encoded data .
As I mentioned earlier , this wobble - encoded data includes error correction of wobble - encoded data itself .
Error correction is the most important part of media , because if it does not work , then you ’ve lost your data , even if there is nothing seriously wrong with the disc .
The DVD- R specification states that for every 192 bits , 64 of them are not protected under any scheme , 24 of them are protected by 24 bits of parity , and the last 56 bits are protected by another 24 bits of parity .
This weird ( to put it mildly ) scheme allows you to easily scramble or lose 25 % of the data that is required to read your disk !
This information is almost more important than the actual data burned on the disc itself .
The DVD+R specification , however , states that for every 204 bits of information , it is split into four blocks of 52 bits containing 1 sync bit to prevent misreading because of phase changes , 31 bits of data , and a 20 bit parity ( that protects all 32 bits of data ) .
The sync bit is always the same value in all four blocks , and exists only to prevent phase inversions .
Now , the third item on the list : how DVD+R discs burn better .
As I said earlier , ATIP / pre-pit / ADIP stores information about optimum power control settings .
This information is basically formulas stating how much output power is needed , what the laser startup power should be , and other pieces of information you require to properly burn a DVD .
Optimum power control output is dependent on three things : burning speed , laser wavelength , and information given to the drive about the media .
DVD-R basically fails on all three accounts because DVD+R simply includes far more information about the media in the ADIP data than DVD - R does in it ’s pre-pit data .
DVD+R includes four optimum profiles , one for four major burning speeds ( usually 2x , 4x , 6 x , and 8x , though this can change as speeds increase ) .
Each of these profiles include optimum power output based on laser wavelength , more precise laser power settings , and other additional information .
With this information , any DVD+R burner can far more optimize it ’s burning strategy to fit the media than it can with DVD -R , consistently providing better burns .
For comparison , DVD - R includes one profile , optimum power output based for that one profile only and uncalibrated towards what wavelength it is for , less precise laser power settings , and no other additional information .
Typically , DVD- R burners have to already know how to burn a certain piece of media ( and include this information in their firmwares ) before they can properly burn to it .
New media often is not properly supported .
In addition to the optimum power control profiles , DVD+R also gives four times more scratch space for the drive to calibrate the laser on ; more space can only improve the calibration quality .
So , in short , DVD+R media exists to simply produce better burns and protect your data better .
And finally , the end of the article …
Finally , after roughly three pages of technical discussion , we arrive at the end of my dissertation on archival quality CD / DVD media .
So , you ’re probably now wondering , in simple terms , what media do I recommend ?
To begin with , I do not recommend CD - RW , DVD - RW , or DVD +RW media in any form for permanent storage .
This is mostly a no - brainer , but those discs are meant to be able to be changed after burning , and they are simply unsuitable for long - term archival storage .
I also do not recommend DVD -R media due to DVD+R ’s superior error correction and burning control .
That said , I recommend Taiyo Yuden media across the board .
Taiyo Yuden currently manufactures 52x CD-R , 16x DVD-R , and 16x DVD+R media in normal shiney silver , inkjet printable , and thermal printable forms .
Taiyo Yuden may be one of the most expensive ( if not the most expensive ) , but their media quality is unsurpassed .
Also , as I mentioned earlier , I recommended buying from SuperMediaStore.com as they are the only online US distributor that guarantees that their Taiyo Yuden media is certified as coming from Taiyo Yuden .
So , what am I using ?
Due to Taiyo Yuden ’s superior media quality , and DVD +R ’s superior design , I use only Taiyo Yuden DVD+R media .
I recommend this media to everyone who wishes to keep their data for a long , long time .
Update 1 : It seems MAM - A and Kodak actually has managed to make a gold DVD , though no one else seems to be manufacturing them ( Taiyo Yuden / JVC Advanced Media now makes an archival gold disc , see update 6 ) .
However , MAM - A ’s gold archival media still does n’t seem to exceed TY quality ( although Mr 60,000 in the comments below puts TY second best to MAM - A ) .
Due to the extreme cost of gold archival media ( $ 2+ a disc ) with very little increased protection ( if any ) , I ’ll still say TY media is better .
I want to see more independent tests on this before I change my recommendation .
In addition , I ’d like to mention that Verbatim has been relabeling other brands of disc as their own .
If the box / spindle / cakebox the discs come in do n’t say they ’re manufactured with Verbatim ’s proprietary Azo dye ( sometimes called Advanced Azo , sometimes not , depending on the product ) then they are n’t Verbatim media at all and should be avoided as they may not meet typical home archival standards .
Update 2 : ( Sept. 19th 2007 )
Its almost been a year since I first wrote this article .
My recommendations for media have not changed , my recommendations for DVD burners have .
Samsung : Samsung is currently producing two drives worth owning , the
Samsung SH - S222 AB ( SATA ) .
They ’re not considered archival grade , but they ’re not bad .
TEAC : TEAC makes an archival drive that is ISO / IEC10995 compliant , and is very expensive .
Comes in two forms , external USB DV - W5000U and internal SATA DV - W5000S .
I ’ve seen DV - W5000U drives for sale for $ 500 , and refurbished DV - W5000S drives for $ 150 -200 .
This is the elite of drives , and recommended if you ’re very serious about 30 + year archival storage .
Update 3 : ( July 26th 2009 )
Its been awhile since I updated this article .
Pioneer is no longer manufacturing drives worth using .
Just buy a Samsung or TEAC drive like I link to above .
I ’m using two Samsung drives now after my PX - 716 finally died after years of service .
My recommendation on TY and Verbatim has n’t changed , and I imagine it will never change ; DVD media will not change significantly from here on out .
Bluray in my opinion is not worth switching over to unless you ’re storing data that can be measured in hundreds of gigabytes , and at that point you might want to look into archival tape storage .
When Bluray is worth switching over to , I ’ll write a follow up article to this one .
High quality single layer media will have to drop below 50 cents a piece and Bluray burners will have to become ubiquitous ( much like DVD burners are now ) before that happens .
I ’m thinking 2011 or later .
Update 4 : ( August 3rd 2010 ) Taiyo Yuden has bought the JVC Media brand and is now operating under the JVC Advanced Media brand .
You can now buy TY inside JVC boxes and get your usual TY quality .
This site has the conversion of part numbers .
JVC has not bought Taiyo Yuden , and Taiyo Yuden is in full control of this new venture .
They merely bought they name so they can put TY products on store shelves worldwide .
SuperMediaStore.com is selling almost all JVC Advanced Media branded TY products in place of the old TY branded ones .
Update 5 : ( September 27th 2011 )
A few people have asked about how PIE / PIF scans work .
DVD-R and DVD+R both employ two stage error correction .
PIE ( Parity Inner Error ) just means error correction was used , PIF ( Parity Inner Failure ) means the error was unrecoverable using the inner ECC block but still may be recovered using the outer ECC block .
On tools that give avg / max / total , max PIE values above 140 , or max PIF values above 4 * means the disc needs to be replaced but the data most likely is n’t corrupted yet **.
For a burn to be considered still pristine you want max PIE below 20 and max PIF 3 or lower .
Discs will NOT be pristine after 5 years , but there is a fall off of PIF / PIE increasing after 6 months and does n’t seem to start picking up again until 5 - 10 years depending on storage environment .
Totals for PIF can be as high as 100 k yet have a max of 20 , and total PIF can be as high as 1000 but have a max below 3 .
Max PIE is considered mostly fatal above 280 and can reach as high as 1664 , and max PIF can reach as high as 208* .
DVD+R generally will maintain lower values for both due to superior error correction techniques .
* Some tools and / or drives wo n’t list above 4 for PIF .
** Some tools and / or drives also list PO ( Parity Outer ) uncorrectable errors .
This is for any read that has a max PIF above 4 .
This indicates a mostly unrecoverable data corruption error , which would effect ( if I ’ve done my math right ) 36 k of data ( although that does n’t mean the whole 36 k of data is corrupted , just that its corrupted inside of that 36 k ) .
This still does not indicate the disc is unreadable , some obsessive ripping tools will try multiple reads in an effort to get a valid read or different incorrect reads that can be merged into a valid read .
Update 6 : ( January 11th 2013 ) Taiyo Yuden announced last year that they are now producing an ISO / IEC10995 compliant archival grade gold alloy DVD -R .
Sadly , its not DVD+R and I ’m hoping they ’ll consider making a DVD+R version as well .
Not many vendors carry this disc yet .
Also , a few people have asked when I ’m going to write that Bluray follow up article .
I do n’t think Bluray is viable for long term archival storage yet .
I continue my recommendation that if you need to store hundreds of gigabytes of data or more , consider archival tape .
School authorities in the American heartland state of Kansas have delivered a rebuff to subscribers to the notion of intelligent design by voting to banish language challenging evolution from new science guidelines .
In a 6 - 4 vote on Tuesday night , the Kansas state board of education deleted language from teaching guidelines that challenged the validity of evolutionary theory , and approved new phrasing in line with mainstream science .
It was seen as a victory for a coalition of moderate Republicans and Democrats , science educators and parents who had fought for two years to overturn the earlier guidelines .
The decision is the latest in a string of defeats for proponents of creationism , and its modern variant , intelligent design .
It reverses the decision taken by the same authorities two years ago to include language undermining Darwinism - on the insistence of conservative parents and activists in the intelligent design movement .
In redrafting guidelines for science teaching , the board removed language suggesting that key concepts such as a common origin for all life on Earth and for species change were seen as controversial by the scientific community .
The board also rewrote the definition of science , limiting it to the search for rational explanations of what occurs in the universe .
The move , though limited in its scope , was seen as significant because it rejected a key argument of subscribers to intelligent design : that providing children with arguments for and against evolution merely amounts to fair play .
But Kansas remains a conservative state and many people harbour misgivings about teaching evolution to school children .
The school board received a petition with nearly 4,000 signatures opposing Tuesday 's decisions .
Overcoming such misgivings will be difficult , said Jack Krebs , a former maths teacher who is president of Kansas Citizens for Science .
" The bigger issue is the cultural divide .
The intelligent design people and the anti-evolution people truly believe that science as it is practised is atheistic , and excludes God , and this is really the heart of the cultural battle , " Mr Krebs said .
Despite this latest setback proponents of intelligent design remain active across the US .
In the last five years , anti-evolution legislation has been introduced in 24 state legislatures and similar policies were under consideration in at least 20 states , according to the National Centre for Science Education in California .
Given the deep passions surrounding the teaching of evolution in Kansas , it is widely expected that proponents of intelligent design will not let up in their campaign over science teaching .
" They have really been on a rollercoaster for the last 10 years in Kansas , " said Glenn Branch , deputy director of the National Centre for Science Education .
" This is n't really good for the state of science education in Kansas for the treatment of evolution to be in such flux .
It probably does have the effect of encouraging creationism in the local classroom . "
Backstory
Teaching creationism in American public schools has been outlawed since 1987 when the supreme court ruled that the inclusion of religious material in science classes was unconstitutional .
In recent years , however , opponents of the theory of evolution - first developed by Charles Darwin , above - have regrouped , challenging science education with the doctrine of " intelligent design " , which has been carefully stripped of all references to God and religion .
Unlike traditional creationism , which claims that God created the earth in six days , proponents of intelligent design say the workings of this planet are too complex to be ascribed to evolution .
There must have been a designer working to a plan - that is , a creator .

One of my favorite books is Bertrand Meyer 's Object Oriented Software Construction
The book explores object oriented programming using the Eiffel language and one of the things that I always loved about Eiffel was the defensive programming techniques that it teaches and the strong focus on contracts and preconditions ( a technique that is used extensively in Gnome ) .
Until very recently I had not noticed it , but the Eiffel compiler and the Eiffel suite of libraries and even the development IDE ( EiffelStudio ) were open sourced ( Emmanuel mentions this to me during the Lang .
Net conference and I do not remember any big news about it ) .
They have just launched a community site Eiffel Room .
There are a bunch of Flash - based presentations on Eiffels here .
In this presentation you can see a demo of the IDE .
In particular see the " System Metrics " section .
A few months before his son was born , Thomas Wolfe of Wheeling , W.Va. , consulted the rabbi of his Reform congregation to discuss plans for the baby ’s circumcision .
“ I had the perception that a circumcision was just an innocuous procedure , with no risk , ” he later told the Forward .
After the rabbi had recommended that Wolfe find a ritual circumciser , or mohel , to perform the newborn ’s bris , Wolfe did a little Internet research .
“ It was n’t really until that time that I became aware of all the controversies , ” he said .
While the United States is one of the few industrialized countries in which a majority of newborn boys are circumcised , recent surveys show that the American circumcision rate , which was close to 90 % in the 1960s , is now at only 57 % .
But even though the national rate has declined , circumcision remains the norm in all major Jewish denominations ; most newborn Jewish boys have either a traditional brit milah or have the procedure performed at a hospital .
Nevertheless , a small but vocal minority of Jewish activists have begun to question the importance , and even the morality , of circumcision .
Some have even begun using alternative “ bris - less ” brisses to welcome their sons into the world .
The Internet is full of Web sites sponsored by circumcision opponents , who often call themselves proponents of “ genital integrity ” or “ intactivism . ”
After conducting his research , Wolfe decided to forgo circumcising his son .
Instead , he arranged a so - called brit shalom ceremony , a newly created ritual that celebrates birth while omitting circumcision .
His own son ’s case behind him , Wolfe is now pressing for broader change .
This past May , he began circulating a petition calling on Reform rabbis and congregations to reconsider a 1982 rabbinic edict affirming the centrality of circumcision in Reform Judaism .
As of now , the petition has drawn about 70 signatories .
But despite — or perhaps because of — their small numbers , Jewish anti-circumcision activists remain vocal in demanding that Jews change the way they view circumcision .
Mark Reiss , a retired diagnostic radiologist , is executive vice president of Doctors Opposing Circumcision and a strong advocate of the brit shalom ceremony .
Reiss , who is a member of a Conservative congregation in San Francisco , believes that the time has come for Jews to abandon the practice .
“ A lot of scholars feel that circumcision was an atavistic cultural remnant from the days when pagans sacrificed their boys to the gods , ” he told the Forward .
Reiss has been active in creating a database of rabbis and laypeople who will officiate at brit shalom ceremonies .
There are no restrictions on the content of the ceremony , according to Reiss .
Some parents simply use it as a naming ceremony , some celebrate the “ intactness ” of their child and some design versions all their own .
Moshe Rothenberg of Brooklyn officiates at around six or seven brit shalom ceremonies a year .
He preserves many of the traditional aspects of the bris , including a blessing over wine , a festive meal and a sandak ( a person close to the family designated to hold the newborn during the ceremony ) .
Instead of a circumcision , however , Rothenberg incorporates unconventional rituals .
“ One time we gathered stones and cast them into water to remember all the living people in the child ’s life in one bowl and all the people who are n’t there in another bowl , ” Rothenberg told the Forward .
“ Sometimes we do a ritual involving nature , often consecrating a plant or tree on behalf of the baby . ”
At the brit shalom of his own son , Rothenberg retold the biblical story of Abraham and Sarah welcoming angels disguised as travelers into their home .
It was these angels who told Sarah she would give birth to Isaac .
After the story was told , the baby ’s feet were washed .
This symbolically linked him to Abraham and Sarah , who washed their guests ’ feet as a sign of hospitality and respect .
Many brit shalom proponents have based their stance on medical grounds .
Reiss and other anti-circumcision activists claim that there are several medical reasons to abandon the practice .
These include the possible pain experienced by a child during the procedure , the risk of infection and the theory that the foreskin provides sexual sensation that circumcised men can never experience .
Reiss also argues that many of the perceived benefits of circumcision are in fact spurious .
“ Circumcision has always been related to whatever the disease of the decade was , ” he said .
For some doctors , however , recent studies showing that circumcised heterosexual African men are around half as likely as their uncircumcised counterparts to contract HIV simply back up what they have claimed all along : that circumcision is not only harmless but also beneficial .
Edgar Schoen , a pediatric endocrinologist who was the chair of the 1989 American Academy of Pediatrics ’ Task Force on Circumcision , claims that there at least 10 known medical benefits provided by circumcision .
For example , there is some evidence that circumcision decreases the risk of infant kidney infection early in life and helps prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases .
Still , the official position of the 1999 American Academy of Pediatrics ’ Task Force on Circumcision is equivocal : “ Existing scientific evidence demonstrates potential medical benefits of newborn male circumcision ; however , these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision . ”
Schoen argues that this decision was reached because of the influence of what he calls “ anti-circ ” activists .
“ These people are very good with the sound bites , and they get on all the talk shows and all over the Internet , ” he said , adding that such activists are especially effective in convincing young liberal Jews not to circumcise their sons .
“ For young , trendy Jewish parents , everything has to be natural and organic .
‘ Why would the foreskin be there if it was n’t good ? ’
That resonates with a lot of young Jewish parents . ”
Jewish critics of circumcision have not limited their arguments to the medical realm , with some contending that the central issue is one of volition .
Eli Ungar - Sargon , a Chicago - based filmmaker , recently released the documentary “ Cut , ” an exploration of circumcision from religious , scientific and ethical perspectives .
Ungar - Sargon , who was raised Orthodox but no longer identifies with a specific denomination , told the Forward that he views circumcision “ as gross violation of human rights . ”
He said , “ I think the real central ethical issue here is one of autonomy .
Do we have the right to permanently alter another person ’s body without their permission ? ”
At the end of the day , every couple has to make its own decision , said Rabbi Donni Aaron , head of program designed to train Reform mohels .
But , she added , most of the parents she has encountered eventually choose to circumcise their sons , and that trend is unlikely to change any time soon .
“ If for thousands of years it was clear that the practice was harmful , ” she said , “ it would have gone away a while ago . ”
The men gathered in darkness beneath downtown Oklahoma City streets .
In underground Chinatown , flickering bulbs sent shadows skittering across the hand - drawn pictographs on the walls .
Amid the click of mah - jongg tiles and the bubbling talk of poker players , opium smokers lay drowsily on the floor , pipes slipping from languid fingers .
Nearby , other men rested on grass mats in cell - like living quarters or made egg rolls , wontons and tofu for the restaurants above them , in the daylight world .
The pay was low , the hours long .
Few women ventured below .
This was n't what the men had come here for .
These men , these hidden men , left the famine and rebellion of 19th century China seeking peace and prosperity in America .
Many came to San Francisco — Jiu Jin San , the " Mountain of Gold ” — dreaming of wealth , only to find hard labor and persecution .
State and federal exclusion laws drove them south and east from California , and some settled in Oklahoma .
" At the very beginning , in the 1890s , we 're talking about 50 to 80 ( people ) , ” University of Central Oklahoma historian Bing Li said .
" At the turn of the century before statehood , we 're talking about 200 or 250 , mostly in the Oklahoma City area . ”
By the time they arrived here , they had learned their lessons :
Be discreet .
Avoid attention .
Go underground .
Hundreds inhabit caverns
For decades , the existence of the subterranean Chinatown has been debated , despite Li's research and written records that seem to confirm its reality .
In 1921 , for example , The Oklahoman reported on an inspection of a 50 - room " colony ” below 14 S Robinson Ave .
An excerpt follows :
Witnesses : Six inspectors of the state health department ; one police detective .
They waded into Oklahoma City 's Chinatown Wednesday and visited all its nooks ever seen by white man , and came away reporting the 200 or more inhabitants of the submerged quarter in good health and surroundings and as sanitary as all get out .
A resident , Hauan Tsang , led the officials through " a dozen connected caverns . ”
Then the inspectors " slipped ” over to another basement below California Avenue , where they were greeted with open arms and wide grins .
The friendly reception made them wonder if word of their earlier visit had spread — and if so , how .
There are no telephones in the apparently unconnected places .
...
The old police theory that a second basement beneath the whole raft of Chinese dwellings is connected by a tunnel with the suburbs of the colony was called to mind to explain the unexpected welcome .
The existence of such a tunnel was never confirmed .
Nor were rumors of a third level said to contain a temple and cemetery .
In all likelihood , news of the inspection spread in a more prosaic way — by Chinese living and working in the daylight world .
The 1922 city directory lists a Chinese library at 210 ½ W California Ave. , not far from the second site visited by the inspectors .
The librarian , D.N. Koo , lived at 12 S Robinson Ave. , near the entrance to the first site .
A Chinese restaurant occupied the same address — where federal agents discovered 25 men in an opium den beneath the building in August 1922 .
" Down a flight of stairs went the officers , tipped off by freight clerks , and through an oaken door which is ( entered ) by means of a hanging rope , ” The Oklahoman reported .
" They entered a room where air potent with sunny dreams of sleepers was only so much thick , stifling mist to them .
... Four Chinese lay unconscious when the raid was made .
" Their pipes had clanked to the floor .
The opening of the den followed the discovery shortly before noon of narcotics , oriental tobacco and rum in a freight shipment at the Frisco depot . ”
The restaurant proprietor , Wong On Chong , was arrested on suspicion of being " the operator of a gigantic smuggling business . ”
‘ A continual menace '
" There were legal Chinese - Americans , legal owners , ” Li said .
" They owned businesses above ground .
You 'd better believe they took advantage of the cheap labor ” provided by illegal Chinese workers in Oklahoma City .
In part , cheap labor is what funneled the Chinese workers to Oklahoma in the first place .
The men sailed to America seeking gold but soon found themselves in a sweat economy , earning a meager wage amid the clank and clang of the railroad industry , Li said in a 2006 scholarly paper .
By 1860 , at least 10,000 Chinese worked for the Central Pacific Railroad .
But when completed railway projects resulted in mass lay - offs , sentiment toward the Chinese soured , Li wrote .
In 1877 , white workers rioted in California , and the U.S. Congress was told that Chinese laborers had driven wages so low that they were " a continual menace ” threatening to " degrade all white working - people to the abject condition of a servant class . ”
In 1878 , the federal court ruled that Chinese people could not become citizens .
Four years later , Chinese immigration was banned .
Unwelcome , illegal and unable to bring their families from China to America , many Chinese left the West Coast , beginning a decades - long migration inland to try to escape racial violence and persecution , Li wrote .
Some found a home along Robinson Avenue , lingering until about 1929 before drifting away from the area .
Their time downtown prompted rumors and wild stories that lasted for years .
White families warned unruly children to behave lest the Chinese took them into their subterranean lair , never to be seen again .
One account claimed the Chinese fled the basements after a man committed suicide there .
The extent of the tunnels grew with each person who told the story .
" If recollections by some residents are correct , ” The Oklahoman reported in 1969 , " an underground ‘ Chinese city ' once extended from the North Canadian River to NW 17 and Classen — quite a distance for digging tunnels .
" And ( if ) everyone 's memory is to be believed , there were so many tunnel entrances to this underground city that it was nearly impossible to walk a downtown sidewalk without falling into one . ”
Abandoned ‘ city ' found
In April 1969 , wrecking crews demolishing unused buildings in the downtown area discovered a set of " expertly handcrafted stone stairs ” in an alley behind the Commerce Exchange Building at Robinson and Sheridan avenues , Li said .
The steep steps ended at a scarred , wooden door sealed with an intricate Chinese padlock and leather straps .
Underground Chinatown , it seemed , had just been found again .
As the city council debated whether to declare the discovery a historic site , former Mayor George Shirk — the director of the Oklahoma Historical Society — led an expedition into the long - abandoned ruins .
Among those with him was Jim Argo , then a photographer for The Oklahoman .
" Shirk took us down there to see this place , ” Argo said recently .
" He told us it was a Chinese laundry and opium place .
...
We went down that narrow flight of stairs until we were down in the basement .
They had little individual rooms where people lived , about the size of a prison cell .
I do n't think there was any outside light coming in . ”
Flashlight beams zigzagged around the low - ceilinged structure , picking out an old stove and tattered papers bearing Chinese symbols , apparently some sort of accounting system .
Yellowed editorial cartoons about China and a faded American map clung to a wall in a large living area , and a dozen coat hooks hung in a neighboring room .
Some of the walls were brick and cool to the touch .
Others , used to break large spaces into smaller rooms , were made of wood or wallboard , while The floors were composed of damp cement .
A sign attached to a small cubicle bore two words : " Come Gamble . ”
In all , the chambers occupied a space about 50 feet wide by 140 feet long ; Shirk 's explorers found a second Robinson Avenue entrance .
" Shirk guessed that similar rooms exist under the remainder of the block , ” The Oklahoman reported , " but no access to them were found . ”
City council members elected not to save the site .
It was destroyed in the name of urban renewal , and what once was underground is now buried .
The Cox Convention Center marks its grave .

The SavetheInternet coalition turned one year old this week and celebrated with ... a press conference .
While not the single most exciting approach to birthday parties the world has ever seen , a press conference provided an opportunity to reflect on all that has happened regarding network neutrality in only a year .
It also provided a powerful reminder of why CEOs like AT&T's Ed Whitacre need to watch their mouths .
Senator Byron Dorgan ( D - ND ) , one of the driving forces behind the Senate 's Dorgan / Snowe
Net neutrality bill , joined the call to offer his thoughts on why a bill is needed .
He recalled reading a quote last year from Ed Whitacre in BusinessWeek in which Whitacre complained about companies that used " his pipes " and did so " for free . "
That moment was illuminating for Dorgan .
Even though he was raised in a small town ( cue standard politician story about hardscrabble upbringing here ) , Dorgan said that " I can understand a pretty significant threat to the open architecture of the Internet . "
He thanked the coalition for its work , and said that he would seek hearings on the issue in the Senate Commerce Committee in the next few months .
Craig Newmark , who identified himself as the " customer service " person for Craigslist , took the microphone next .
" The Internet has always been about playing fair , " he said , adding that he hears from plenty of telecom employees who do n't support what their bosses have said .
Pretty much everyone is for net neutrality , Newmark said , except people running " fake grassroots campaigns and that sort of thing . "
Tim
Wu , a professor at Columbia who has been heavily involved in this issue , pointed out how much progress had been made in a year .
We 're now seeing a " sea change in telecom policy , " he said , pointing out that Net neutrality has become an issue that people truly care about .
It 's become one of the first " third rails " in telecom policy , he said — any politician who comes near it gets " shocked by the electric reaction they receive from the public . "
But perhaps most surprising was Michele Combs of the Christian Coalition , who claimed that Net neutrality had become a " true family issue . "
Who would have thought that standing up for traditional marriage and for unfettered access to Google would be two of the Christian Coalition 's main issues in the upcoming presidential race ?
But that 's exactly what 's happening .
Combs said that neutrality is " number two on our agenda " now , in large part because her group represents 100,000 churches , most of whom now use the web for everything from posting sermons to hosting online calendars to running e-mail lists .
The churches fear that , without Net neutrality , it could get harder to access and distribute certain kinds of content .
The conference illustrated one of the movement 's biggest successes , which has been its ability to assemble a truly diverse coalition that includes both the Christian Coalition and MoveOn.org , Craigslist and US senators .
With Rep. Ed Markey ( D - MA ) set to introduce a neutrality bill in the House shortly , the issue promises to get a thorough hearing during this session of Congress .
One of the best features of GMail is its huge storage space .
It ’s almost near the 3GB mark and it ’s still growing , giving us reassurance that Google was sincere when they said , “ that you ’ll never have to delete another message . ”
Most GMail users by now , must have loved and mastered the labels and archive features of this free service from Google .
The only e-mail they must have deleted besides those nasty spams are messages that are really not worth storing away in the GMail archives .
On the other hand , the rest of your messages are safely tucked in there , properly labeled and served immediately once you use the powerful search built in to GMail .
This is all possible is you can access your GMail account .
Yes , unbelievable as it may sound , Google is not God and so its servers , from time to time , do suffer from internal glitches , bugs , attacks etc. that will render some of its wonderful services unavailable for its many thousands of users .
That friends , include GMail .
During these rare occassions the worst thing could happen is that your messages could become lost ( though I could n’t imagine how since its Google who ’s behind the service so this scenario is very remote ) but hey being prepared for the worst comes from expecting the worst , no matter how confident and trustful you are of Google ’s capabilities .
So what ’s the solution ?
Back - up your GMail .
Not by setting up a forwarding feature to another non GMail address because those services could knocked down as well .
Not with any other 3rd - party service and not even in your own hardisk , but with Google Groups .
Yup , this nifty and uber - cool e-group service by Google is all you need to backup your GMail messages .
Here ’s how you do it .
1 ) Create a new Google Group .
Name it with something like “ yourGMailaddress+archive ” or “ archivefor + yourGmailaddor ” something similar .
2 ) Give it a description that will give you a hint that this is your backup archive for your Gmail .
3 ) Set Access level to “ Restricted ” since this would only be your GMail backup and archive .
4 ) Skip the “ Invite members ” step .
5 ) Go to “ Group settings ”
6 ) In the “ Advanced ” tab , click on the “ Use Google Groups to manage remote archive ” option .
Enter your GMail address instead of a non-Google Grooup mailing list .
7 ) Click “ Save Changes ” .
Remember to copy - paste the e-mail address in step number #
3 . You ’ll need it later on when we setup your GMail to forward messages to this Google Group .
Sample e-mail : archiveforyourgmailadd-garchive-41973@googlegroups.com
You ’re done with the first part , which is creating a Google Group that will serve as backup and archive for your GMail messages .
Now we continue …
Log on to your GMail account .
9 ) Go to “ Settings . ”
From here you have two options :
a) Set up your GMail to forward all your incoming messages to your archive Google Group .
a.1 ) Paste the Google Group archive e-mail we took note of earlier into the forwarding e-mail field .
b) Create a “ Filter ” to specify which messages to forward to your Google Group archive .
The specific details of this filter is all up to you .
b.1 ) Paste the Google Group archive e-mail address we took note of earlier into the “ Forward it to ” field .
Apply an appropriate label if you wish , then click “ Create filter ” .
You ’re done !
You just created a Google Group that would back up your GMail messages and setup your GMail account to forward your messages to that Google Group .
In the event you cannot acces your GMail , or you accidentally deleted a message , you can still access the messages sent to you via that backup Google Group and use other means available to respond to those messages .
Pretty neat , eh ?

Lisp is for the mediocre programmer , too .
( Based on my posting < 2T2radg3IosmNv8%stesch@parsec.no-spoon.de > )
Every now and then I read a Usenet posting or blog entry about the somewhat frightening question from management : " Will someone else be able to work on your Common Lisp code ? "
Then most people explain why they had to say " no " .
You all know the reasons why they think they have to give this answer .
But are the reasons really valid ?
I do n't think so .
It is the job of a programmer to work with different tools .
Programming languages are such tools , among others .
It is expected that a Java programmer can learn the Eclipse IDE within a few days even if he was a long time user of Netbeans .
A programmer has to use many tools he would n't choose by himself .
Do you think most of them really like writing their e-mails at work with Outlook ? :-)
Common Lisp is one of the tools that are available .
If you think it fits the task at hand then use it .
Chances are good you are no wizard , guru , demi-god .
Just a person who does his job .
You were able to learn Common Lisp and so should be someone who does n't have to go through the initial phase of a project in a new language .
Everyone following you has better and more books , more libraries , a bigger community — Common Lisp has gained a nice momentum and more and more people use it just for fun and for work .
Everyone following you can rely on your code .
It is very easy to test and fool around with single functions of your program .
Common Lisp is for the mediocre programmer , too .
A programmer bitching about the parentheses and refusing to learn something new or different , is n't a mediocre programmer .
He is a bad programmer and a very bad employee .
Who wants to employ someone who does n't want to learn for and on the job ?
The manager / boss who asks you if someone can pick up or support your work when you choose Common Lisp is the same one who expects his staff to be flexible .
" No , I do n't think anybody can be as good and flexible as me . " is the answer you give when you say " no " .
You all know the essays and rantings of Common Lisp users about how wonderful the language is and that you must one of the top programmers choosing it .
They are wrong .
All it takes is to be a programmer .
Even if you are just mediocre .
OK , some programmers who just do their job do n't learn programming languages just for fun .
They do n't have to be bad ones .
Just the typical worker who does n't want to be bothered with work related stuff after a day 's work .
It 's sad but there are such people in every profession .
But it 's no reason to believe these people are n't able to learn Common Lisp just because they have n't thought of it themselves .
Yesterday , the Washington Post published an editorial titled What Atheists Ca n’t Answer .
The author , Michael Gerson , is an influential evangelical Christian and was formerly George W. Bush ’s chief speechwriter .
Compared to most attacks on atheism , including a few I ’ve rebutted recently , Gerson ’s essay is fair and honest .
He rightfully steers clear of the slanderous and unfounded insults so common in apologetic literature , conceding that human beings can be good without God .
However , while he agrees that atheists can be moral , he expresses a time - worn worry :
Human nature , in other circumstances , is also clearly constructed for cruel exploitation , uncontrollable rage , icy selfishness and a range of other less desirable traits .
So the dilemma is this :
How do we choose between good and bad instincts ?
… Atheists can be good people ; they just have no objective way to judge the conduct of those who are not .
This is a serious argument and deserves detailed consideration .
Following is the text of a reply I sent to Gerson and to the Post .
Dear Mr. Gerson :
This is a response to your July 14 column , “ What Atheists Ca n’t Answer ” .
You wrote that , in the dilemma of choosing between good and evil , theism gives us reason to “ cultivate the better angels of our nature . ”
However , any honest assessment of history would conclude that religion makes people bad at least as often as it makes them good .
Religion has inspired great acts of charity and selflessness , beautiful music , art and architecture , and countless examples of human kindness and compassion .
It has also inspired horrific , bloody wars , brutal inquisitions , tyrannical theocracies , fanatical campaigns of terror , and countless incidents of discrimination , prejudice , and bigotry .
Far from being a force that pulls ceaselessly toward the moral apex of the universe , religion is more like a megaphone , amplifying both the good and the bad of human nature in equal measure .
This is not surprising to an atheist , because there is no objectively verifiable evidence of any god who wants people to behave in any particular way .
As a result , people can without fear of contradiction invent a god who speaks for them , who confirms all their opinions and prejudices – and this is exactly what all religious people do , the liberal as well as the conservative .
You worried that atheists have no compelling answer to a person who says , “ I ’m going to do whatever I please . ”
But religion does not solve that problem .
If anything , the problem is far worse when the malcontent is a theist who claims that his desires are not just some idiosyncratic expression of individual preference , but the very will of God .
An atheist , at least , has no warrant to claim holy sanction or divine infallibility for his opinions , and in theory can be persuaded by reason .
On the other hand , a person who sincerely believes that they are acting in accordance with the will of the creator is immune to evidence , diplomacy , and compromise – as the many religious wars still smoldering after millennia should make abundantly clear .
In your column , you said that morality cannot be anchored without reference to a higher power : that if God had not commanded us to be good , we would have no reason to be good , and no justification for condemning those who were not .
This claim betrays its own incoherence , for we can then ask , why does God command us to be moral ?
Does he have reasons for that edict ?
If so , then we too can make use of those reasons , for if they are good ones , they will stand on their own without reference to who is giving them .
On the other hand , if God has no reasons for his commands , then religious morality is cut loose from any anchor .
God commanded us to be merciful and kind , but that was just an arbitrary choice with no deeper significance .
He could just as easily have commanded us to be vicious and cruel , and those traits would then be the definition of goodness which we were all bound to follow .
Can any rational person accept such a nonsensical conclusion ?
You asked what reason an atheist can give to be moral , so allow me to offer an answer .
You correctly pointed out that neither our instincts nor our self - interest can completely suffice , but there is another possibility you ’ve overlooked .
Call it what you will – empathy , compassion , conscience , lovingkindness – but the deepest and truest expression of that state is the one that wishes everyone else to share in it .
A happiness that is predicated on the unhappiness of others – a mentality of “ I win , you lose ” – is a mean and petty form of happiness , one hardly worthy of the name at all .
On the contrary , the highest , purest and most lasting form of happiness is the one which we can only bring about in ourselves by cultivating it in others .
The recognition of this truth gives us a fulcrum upon which we can build a consistent , objective theory of human morality .
Acts that contribute to the sum total of human happiness in this way are right , while those that have the opposite effect are wrong .
A wealth of moral guidelines can be derived from this basic , rational principle .
You said that in an atheist ’s world , the desire for meaning and purpose are “ a cruel joke of nature . ”
Nothing could be further from the truth .
I am an atheist , and my life is full to bursting with meaning and purpose .
I rejoice to be alive in this beautiful , complex , awe - inspiring world .
I am grateful for the interactions with my fellow human beings who illuminate my mind with their brilliance , inspire me with their dedication , and offer me the chance to enter into the deep communion of love .
The knowledge that our lives are finite does not make them less precious , but infinitely more so , as we know that we must seize this one opportunity while we possess it and drink deeply from the rich spring of all that life has to offer .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Internet search leader Google is facing criticism from major media companies for reportedly working closely to help two Web sites accused of film pirating .
The Wall Street Journal reported that Brandon Drury and Luke Sample , who are accused of promoting film piracy in a suit brought by major film studios , got significant support from Google between 2003 and 2005 .
Among the keywords
Google reportedly sold to two Web sites accused of promoting film piracy are " bootleg movie download " and " download Harry Potter movie . "
The two men had Web sites - EasyDownloadCenter.com and TheDownloadPlace.com - which the paper said enabled users to search for movies on the Internet and then download them onto their hard drives .
The Journal reports that Google , attracted by the heavy traffic the sites were generating , assigned account representatives who suggested keywords they could bid on , including " bootleg movie download , " " pirated , " and " download harry potter movie . "
Google ( Charts ) also offered Drury and Sample credit so they did n't have to use their credit cards to pay Google 's fees , according to the report , although it is n't clear if the offer was accepted .
And Google was paid $ 809,000 for ads placed by the two sites over the three - year period , according to the report .
Google has been trying to reach agreement with the major television and movie studios for the proper use of copyrighted material on its sites , especially its YouTube video site that Google recently purchased for $ 1.65 billion .
So Google has been trying to placate the studios even though it is not a defendant in the pirating case involving Drury and Sample .
The Journal reports that on Friday , Google had an afternoon conference call with studio representatives , during which lawyers for Google said the company would remove certain ads the companies objected to , create a list of approved advertisers and refrain from selling keywords used by rogue sites to lure users to pirated material .
In addition , the Google lawyers said the company would introduce internal guidelines on monitoring keywords and train its ad sales force about how to avoid selling such ads .
Among the media companies that had complained about Google 's support for pirates , according to the Journal , were News Corp. ( Charts ) , Viacom ( Charts ) , Sony , Time Warner ( Charts ) , Walt Disney ( Charts ) and NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric ( Charts ) .

Big media beats up on YouTube
" The IDF is preparing itself for an all - out war , and this is a major change in the military 's working premise following the Second Lebanon War , " said Major - General ( res ) Eyal Ben-Reuven , who served as the Northern Command chief ’s deputy during the war .
" By preparing for an all - out war , we can also deal with Palestinian terror , and not the other way round , as it was believed so far , " Ben-Reuven said at an Institute for National Security Studies conference covering the different aspects of war .
When conflict breaks out with Syria , he said , Israel will face a challenge , because the Syrians " will be willing to take military and civilian hits but will strive to harm the Israeli home front in order to gain future achievements in a political process and to further split Israeli society .
" Therefore , the IDF 's mission will be very focused and will have to be quick , in order to neutralize as quickly as possible the strategic areas threatening Israel 's soft underbelly , thus preventing Syria reaching its coveted goals . "
Ben -Reuven explained that in order to carry out such missions successfully , an extensive ground operation will be needed , and for this purpose the IDF is currently renewing its maneuvering abilities , including training and perfecting technology .
According to the major - general , if such ground operations were carried out during the Second Lebanon War , it would have ended very differently .
The IDF was not defeated in the Second Lebanon War , said Ben-Reuven , but failed in utilizing its strength and realizing its goals due to poor military and political leadership .
" The war was a harsh slap on the face and proved that we were wrong in 2000 , when our readiness and military power was aimed at Palestinian terror , and now we realize that we should be preparing for something completely different . "
Ben -Reuven , who was recently in charge of training senior military commanders , pointed out that the army must change its view on this matter .
" Someone who was a good regimental commander will not necessarily be a good divisional commander .
It does n't work that way on the modern battlefield .
One must undergo the appropriate training in order to understand their job well , " he said .
Former Military Intelligence head Major - General ( res. ) Aharon Ze'evi Farkash also spoke at the conference .
Ze'evi addressed the Lebanese problem , saying Hizbullah was currently dealing with political struggles and strengthening , including arming itself with short and long range rockets .
Farkash also pointed out that the war with Lebanon may actually increase chances of Israel and Lebanon reaching a settlement following the internal processes in Beirut .

With the market for downloadable over - the - air content flat , operators and music companies are looking to other ways of making money from mobiles , says Adam Webb
Although Apple 's iPhone is only released in the US tomorrow , its ringtone has been available for download for months , picked up by alert listeners to Steve Jobs 's demo in San Francisco in January .
Being a MIDI sequence , it 's free .
Free ringtones ?
It 's enough to put a shudder through the music and mobile businesses .
Yet they might have good reason to worry .
One of the many anomalies of the mobile music market is that , while a full track bought directly from a network will cost between £ 1 and £ 1.50 , a 20 - second snippet from the same original can be priced at up to three times as much .
Globally , this has created a multi-billion - pound business .
In 2005 , German - based content provider Jamba !
reportedly amassed profits of $ 600 m ( £ 300 m ) on the back of its Crazy Frog ringtone .
Meanwhile , cumulative " realtone " ( music tone ) sales for R&B artist Akon recently surpassed the 11 m mark , greater than either of his two albums .
Realtones generate royalties for record labels ( though monophonic and polyphonic tones , or those from animated amphibians , do not ) , creating an unexpected silver lining for the music business which is stuck in a generally rather black digital cloud .
Lucrative purchases
But if the iPhone and the majority of next - generation handsets is anything to go by , the future of mobile entertainment lies in " sideloading " - transferring existing content , such as music , from a PC , as opposed to the more lucrative ( for operators ) process of purchasing products over the air .
" I think the ringtone business is in peril now because the operators have allowed into the market mobile phones which can sideload MP3s and use them as ringtones , " says Andrew Bud , executive chairman of mBlox and vice - chairman of the Mobile Entertainment Forum .
With nobody able to explain convincingly just why consumers continue to pay a premium for a novelty product , the ringtone industry is something of a gravity - defying act anyway .
One analyst goes so far as to describe ringtones as " digital jewellery " , with most concluding that their value is a combination of personalisation and convenience .
According to the digital music business research consultancy Music
Ally , the retail value of the UK 's music ringtone market this year will be between £ 100 and 120 m , compared to £ 30 m for full track mobile downloads .
With networks taking a slice of between 40 % and 50 % from each transaction , this looks slightly less impressive from the music industry 's perspective .
But a BPI press release earlier this month ( tinyurl.com /2epp8w ) quotes research by Informa Telecoms & Media that the western European realtone market is set to increase this year by 56 % .
Surely things can only get better ?
However , Informa 's analysts were unavailable to explain their calculations .
And certainly sideloading ( along with excessive data charges and poor user experience ) is one of three significant roadblocks to bigger sales .
Sideloading highlights some of the mobile market 's inherent contradictions .
The facility is essential for handset manufacturers such as Nokia and Ericsson , which are in effect competing head - to - head with Apple in the MP3 player market .
But that is not necessarily in the vested interest of the networks that want consumers to buy content over the air , preferably within their walled garden .
Meanwhile , music - enabled handsets able to store hundreds of tracks are increasingly commonplace - the BPI release notes that 40 % of UK phones can play music files - and if the example of the iPod is anything to go by , the majority of these will be ripped from CD collections .
Notably , the current specification for Apple 's iPhone has no 3G capabilities , and is custom - built for sideloading .
If converting those tracks into a user - generated ringer is similarly straightforward ( as it is on popular models such as Sony Ericsson 's Walkman range ) and costs nothing , then the days of the £ 3 ringtone look numbered .
Mobile measurement company M: Metrics claims that 12 % of UK mobile users are already sideloading their music collections , compared to 2.5 % who buy tracks over the air .
Countering Informa 's predictions , they also suggest that the realtone market is , at best , flat , with 1.1 million UK consumers buying one or more ringtones in April , compared to 1.35 million in September last year .
Anecdotally , record labels agree .
Last year , Rob Wells of Universal Music Group International claimed that the UK ringtone market was in terminal decline .
Whether sideloading will sound its death knell is another matter .
Nobody within the mobile business anticipated the demand for either ringtones or text messages in the first place , indicating the market 's unpredictability , says Music Ally 's Steve Mayall .
And since the industry is rife with unrealistic predictions and hype , that makes it incredibly difficult to assess .
" Somebody said yesterday [ at Monaco 's Mobile Entertainment Market conference ] that mobile content is a $ 40bn industry , but it 's not , " says Mayall .
" It 's not even half that .
It 's not bigger than the entire music or film industry , and that kind of hyperbole is in danger of hurting the whole business .
The reason that ringtones have been so popular is simply the convenience factor - and that is n't going away .
That ability to make an instant purchase is still there , and businesses can still make a decent amount of money from ringtones . "
Bundled future
But the fact remains that some fundamental changes will be necessary if this digital jewellery is to retain its allure .
Seth Jackson , MD of marketing and distribution company Indie Mobile , says the future will most likely be a bundle ( where , for a couple of quid , you 'll get a full track , a ringtone and a video ) .
Elsewhere , innovative products are being introduced : EMI , for instance , has just unveiled a remixable realtone for the hip hop artist MIMS , while independent labels such as Ninja Tune are using them as freebie promotional tools .
What is certain is that prices cannot remain static .
And as with moves to incorporate VoIP services and flat - rate data charges , it is innovation that will move the market forward , rather than the protection of any perceived golden goose .
" You can look at something like sideloading in two ways , " Mayall says .
" You can either say this is bad for the business as they 're not getting money from OTA [ over - the - air ] downloads or ringtones , or you could say that it 's encouraging people to think of their phone in a different way , and as a potential music player .
Once you 've got that notion established then you can build business models off the back of it .
And that 's really the way they 're going to have to go . "

To date , only nine drops have fallen in our famous Pitch Drop experiment .
We 're home to the famous Pitch Drop experiment , which holds the Guinness World Record for the longest - running laboratory experiment .
The experiment demonstrates the fluidity and high viscosity of pitch , a derivative of tar that is the world 's thickest known fluid and was once used for waterproofing boats .
Thomas Parnell , UQ's first Professor of Physics , created the experiment in 1927 to illustrate that everyday materials can exhibit quite surprising properties .
At room temperature pitch feels solid - even brittle - and can easily be shattered with a hammer .
But , in fact , at room temperature the substance - which is 100 billion times more viscous than water - is actually fluid .
The experiment explained
In 1927 Professor Parnell heated a sample of pitch and poured it into a glass funnel with a sealed stem .
He allowed the pitch to cool and settle for three years , and then in 1930 he cut the funnel 's stem .
Since then , the pitch has slowly dripped out of the funnel - so slowly that it took eight years for the first drop to fall , and more than 40 years for another five to follow .
Now , 87 years after the funnel was cut , only nine drops have fallen - the last drop fell in April 2014 and we expect the next one to fall sometime in the 2020s .
The experiment was set up as a demonstration and is not kept under special environmental conditions - it 's kept in a display cabinet - so the rate of flow of the pitch varies with seasonal changes in temperature .
The late Professor John Mainstone became the experiment 's second custodian in 1961 .
He looked after the experiment for 52 years but , like his predecessor Professor Parnell , he passed away before seeing a drop fall .
In the 86 years that the pitch has been dripping , various glitches have prevented anyone from seeing a drop fall .
See for yourself
To see the experiment for yourself , view the physical set - up in its display case in the foyer of the Parnell Building ( Building 7 ) .
Alternatively , you can watch the experiment 's live video stream .
More than 35,000 people from some 160 countries are registered to view the stream .
Professor Andrew White is the Pitch Drop 's third and current custodian .

Samsung believes that by 2010 , 30 % of all LCD televisions will include LED backlights instead of the conventional flourescent used in most sets now .
What 's different from the LED units we 've seen before is that Samsung wants to use white LEDs , with single diodes custom - coated to produce the same backlight previously requiring combinations of red , green , and blue bulbs .
Samsung recently invested in Intematix , which produces custom phosphor coatings for LED bulbs to create uniform color -- required in a television to faithfully reproduce colors .
Until recently costs have been higher for LED backlight units , keeping them relegated to higher - end models .
Samsung claims the single bulb process reduces costs by 40 % , but time will tell whether white - only LEDs are truly better or cheaper than tri-color LEDs , or if they are just the next " Reveal lightbulb " marketing gimmick .

No !
It ’s a simple fact that you can never be productive if you take on too many commitments — you simply spread yourself too thin and will not be able to get anything done , at least not well or on time .
But requests for your time are coming in all the time — through phone , email , IM or in person .
To stay productive , and minimize stress , you have to learn the Gentle Art of Saying No — an art that many people have problems with .
What ’s so hard about saying no ?
Well , to start with , it can hurt , anger or disappoint the person you ’re saying “ no ” to , and that ’s not usually a fun task .
Second , if you hope to work with that person in the future , you ’ll want to continue to have a good relationship with that person , and saying “ no ” in the wrong way can jeopardize that .
But it does n’t have to be difficult or hard on your relationship .
Here ’s how to master the Gentle Art of Saying No :
Advertising
1. Value Your Time
Know your commitments , and how valuable your precious time is .
Then , when someone asks you to dedicate some of your time to a new commitment , you ’ll know that you simply cannot do it .
And tell them that : “ I just ca n’t right now … my plate is overloaded as it is . ”
2. Know Your Priorities
Even if you do have some extra time ( which for many of us is rare ) , is this new commitment really the way you want to spend that time ?
For myself , I know that more commitments means less time with my wife and kids , who are more important to me than anything .
3. Practice Saying No
Practice makes perfect .
Saying “ no ” as often as you can is a great way to get better at it and more comfortable with saying the word .
And sometimes , repeating the word is the only way to get a message through to extremely persistent people .
When they keep insisting , just keep saying no .
Eventually , they ’ll get the message .
4. Do n’t Apologize
A common way to start out is “ I ’m sorry but … ” as people think that it sounds more polite .
While politeness is important , apologizing just makes it sound weaker .
You need to be firm , and unapologetic about guarding your time .
Advertising
5. Stop Being Nice
Again , it ’s important to be polite , but being nice by saying yes all the time only hurts you .
When you make it easy for people to grab your time ( or money ) , they will continue to do it .
But if you erect a wall , they will look for easier targets .
Show them that your time is well guarded by being firm and turning down as many requests ( that are not on your top priority list ) as possible .
6. Say No to Your Boss
Sometimes we feel that we have to say yes to our boss — they ’re our boss , right ?
And if we say “ no , ” then we look like we ca n’t handle the work — at least , that ’s the common reasoning .
But in fact , it ’s the opposite — explain to your boss that by taking on too many commitments , you are weakening your productivity and jeopardizing your existing commitments .
If your boss insists that you take on the project , go over your project or task list and ask him / her to re-prioritize , explaining that there ’s only so much you can take on at one time .
7. Pre-Empting
It ’s often much easier to pre-empt requests than to say “ no ” to them after the request has been made .
If you know that requests are likely to be made , perhaps in a meeting , just say to everyone as soon as you come into the meeting ,
Advertising
“ Look guys , just to let you know , my week is booked full with some urgent projects and I wo n’t be able to take on any new requests . ”
8. Get Back to You
Instead of providing an answer then and there , it ’s often better to tell the person you ’ll give their request some thought and get back to them .
This will allow you to give it some consideration , and check your commitments and priorities .
Then , if you ca n’t take on the request , simply tell them :
“ After giving this some thought , and checking my commitments , I wo n’t be able to accommodate the request at this time . ”
At least you gave it some consideration .
9. Maybe Later
If this is an option that you ’d like to keep open , instead of just shutting the door on the person , it ’s often better to just say ,

“ This sounds like an interesting opportunity , but I just do n’t have the time at the moment .
Perhaps you could check back with me in [ give a time frame ] . ”
Next time , when they check back with you , you might have some free time on your hands .
10 .
It ’s Not You , It ’s Me
This classic dating rejection can work in other situations .
Do n’t be insincere about it , though .
Often , the person or project is a good one , but it ’s just not right for you , at least not at this time .
Simply say so — you can compliment the idea , the project , the person , the organization … but say that it ’s not the right fit , or it ’s not what you ’re looking for at this time .
Only say this if it ’s true — people can sense insincerity .

A total of 343 firefighters died in New York on 11 September 2001
The video repeats accusations that failures by the then - mayor of New York led to the deaths of 121 men .
The video says Mr Giuliani failed to provide working radios for crews and halted the recovery effort too soon .
His campaign denounced the footage , saying the union behind it was known to support only Democratic candidates .
Mr Giuliani is seen as one of the frontrunners in the race for the Republican nomination .
' Taking the hit '
The 13 - minute footage was made by the 280,000 - strong International Association of Firefighters ( IAFF ) .
The video highlights accusations repeatedly made by fire union officials and relatives .
It says Mr Giuliani pushed for a faster clean - up at Ground Zero before all the remains had been recovered , and placed an emergency centre in a building that later collapsed .
It also accuses the former mayor of failing to provide working radios for firefighters , saying it made it impossible for them to learn that the Twin Towers were about to collapse .
" Virtually the whole thing goes back to him with the radios , " Jim Riches , a fireman whose son was killed on 9/11 , says in the footage .
" He 's the guy on the top , and he 's the guy you yell at .
He takes the hit .
And my son is dead because of it . "
The video - which also offers testimony from other firefighters and their relatives - says Mr Giuliani is exploiting the disaster as a theme for his presidential candidacy .
' Disgrace '
In response , Mr Giuliani 's camp accused the IAFF - which has feuded often with him since 11 September - of playing partisan politics .
Former firefighter Lee Ielpi , whose son died in the attacks , called the footage a " disgrace " , dismissing the allegations against Mr Giuliani .
" I was there .
I saw it .
I experienced it .
I 'm not going to let lies like this go , " he said .
" Fortunately , rank and file firefighters know the difference between politics and leadership , " Mr Ielpi said .
Mr Giuliani's campaign also said he had a long history of supporting firefighters on health and safety issues .
This time , in Great Britain :
Schools are dropping the Holocaust from history lessons to avoid offending Muslim pupils , a Government backed study has revealed .
It found some teachers are reluctant to cover the atrocity for fear of upsetting students whose beliefs include Holocaust denial .
And , its not just 20th Century history that is getting ignored in the name of being solicitous to ethnic sensitivity :
There is also resistance to tackling the 11th century Crusades – where Christians fought Muslim armies for control of Jerusalem – because lessons often contradict what is taught in local mosques .
Because , you know , the 11th Century was just yesterday .
Are your friends making you fat ?
Or keeping you slender ?
According to new research from Harvard and the University of California , San Diego , the short answer on both counts is " yes . "
Appearing in the July 26 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , a study coauthored by Nicholas Christakis of Harvard Medical School and James Fowler of UC San Diego suggests that obesity is " socially contagious , " spreading from person to person in a social network .
The study -- the first to examine this phenomenon -- finds that if one person becomes obese , those closely connected to them have a greater chance of becoming obese themselves .
Surprisingly , the greatest effect is seen not among people sharing the same genes or the same household but among friends .
If a person you consider a friend becomes obese , the researchers found , your own chances of becoming obese go up 57 percent .
Among mutual friends , the effect is even stronger , with chances increasing 171 percent .
Christakis and Fowler also looked at the influence of siblings , spouses and neighbors .
Among siblings , if one becomes obese , the likelihood for the other to become obese increases 40 percent ; among spouses , 37 percent .
There was no effect among neighbors , unless they were also friends .
The researchers analyzed data over a period of 32 years for 12,067 adults , who underwent repeated medical assessments as part of the Framingham Heart Study .
They were able to map a densely interconnected social network of the study 's subjects by using the tracking sheets ( which had previously been archived in a basement ) that recorded not only the subjects ' family members but also unrelated friends who could be expected to find them in a few years .
The network map took two years to assemble and includes information on the participants ' body - mass index .
Among the first things the researchers noticed was that , consistent with other studies finding an obesity epidemic in the U.S. , the whole network grew heavier over time .
Also immediately apparent were distinct clusters of thin and heavy individuals .
Statistical analysis revealed that this clustering could not be attributed solely to the selective formation of ties among people of comparable weights .
" It 's not that obese or non - obese people simply find other similar people to hang out with , " said Christakis , a physician and a professor in Harvard Medical School 's department of health care policy .
" Rather , there is a direct , causal relationship . "
Further analysis also suggested that people 's influence on each other 's obesity status could not be put down just to similarities in lifestyle and environment , to , for example , people eating the same foods together or engaging in the same physical activities .
Not only do siblings and spouses have less influence than friends , but also geography does n't play a role .
The striking impact of friends seems to be independent of whether or not the friends live in the same region .
" When we looked at the effect of distance , we found that your friend who 's 500 miles away has just as much impact on your obesity as [ one ] next door , " said Fowler , an associate professor of political science at UC San Diego and an expert in social networks .
In part because the study also identifies a larger effect among people of the same sex , the researchers believe that people affect not only each other 's behaviors but also , more subtly , norms .
" What appears to be happening is that a person becoming obese most likely causes a change of norms about what counts as an appropriate body size .
People come to think that it is okay to be bigger since those around them are bigger , and this sensibility spreads , " said Christakis .
" This is about people 's ideas about their bodies and their health , " Fowler said .
" Consciously or unconsciously , people look to others when they are deciding how much to eat , how much to exercise and how much weight is too much . "
" Social effects , I think , are much stronger than people before realized .
There 's been an intensive effort to find genes that are responsible for obesity and physical processes that are responsible for obesity and what our paper suggests is that you really should spend time looking at the social side of life as well , " said Fowler .
The policy implications of the study , the researchers say , are profound .
The social - network effects extend three degrees of separation -- to your friends ' friends ' friends -- so any public - health intervention aimed at reducing obesity should consider this in its cost - benefit analysis .
" When we help one person lose weight , we 're not just helping one person , we 're helping many , " Fowler said .
" And that needs to be taken into account by policy analysts and also by politicians who are trying to decide what the best measures are for making society healthier . "
" It 's important to remember , " Fowler said , " that we 've not only shown that obesity is contagious but that thinness is contagious . "

Democrats smell blood — and campaign cash — in the uproar over the Justice Department ’s firing of eight federal prosecutors last year .
“ This could be George Bush ’s Watergate , ” Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean wrote in an e-mail soliciting campaign funds yesterday .
Senate Democrats said their investigation into the firings is intended to preserve independence for federal prosecutors and keep them from being used as political foot soldiers for the executive branch .
“ Every single U.S. attorney has to have an objectivity and independence , and a willingness to pursue facts , wherever those facts lead them , ” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat .
“ My greatest worry about this whole episode is that it is having a chilling effect on the objectivity of U.S. attorneys all across this nation . ”
However , Republican senators , while unhappy with the Justice Department and the White House ’s bungled response to inquiries , charged Democrats with using the issue for political and financial gain .
Sen. Arlen Specter , Pennsylvania Republican , said Sen. Charles E. Schumer , New York Democrat , was using information gained in congressional inquiries he directed to attack Republicans through the Senate Democrats ’ fundraising arm , which Mr. Schumer chairs .
“ I believe there is a conflict of interest between Senator Schumer ’s position as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the leader of this inquiry , ” said Mr. Specter , the Judiciary Committee ’s top Republican .
Mr. Schumer rejected Mr. Specter ’s criticism during a low - key but tense exchange in a Senate Judiciary Committee session .
“ I fail to see any conflict whatsoever , ” said Mr. Schumer , who chairs the Judiciary administrative oversight and the courts subcommittee , which last week interviewed four of the fired prosecutors .
Mr. Schumer said his investigation has focused “ exclusively ” on the Justice Department and the White House , and the Senate Select Committee on Ethics will handle any issues regarding lawmakers .
Attacks on Sen. Pete V. Domenici , New Mexico Republican , have been posted on the DSCC ’s Web site ( www.dscc.org) since last week .
The DSCC site says that Mr. Domenici “ could be the focus of an obstruction of justice investigation by an independent counsel that could result in criminal penalties , ” and attributes this statement to ethics lawyer Stanley Brand .
Mr. Domenici is under scrutiny for a phone call he made in October to then - U.S. attorney for New Mexico , David C. Iglesias .
The senator asked Mr. Iglesias whether he would finish a corruption case involving local Democrats before the November election .
When Mr. Iglesias said he would not , Mr. Domenici said , “ I ’m sorry to hear that , ” and hung up , Mr. Iglesias testified to Mr. Schumer ’s subcommittee last week .
Mr. Iglesias said he felt “ leaned on . ”
Mr. Domenici said last week , “ I did not pressure him .
I asked him a timing question .
He responded .
I concluded the conversation . ”
In addition to Mr. Iglesias ’ firing , Democrats are investigating whether at least two others of the dismissed prosecutors were run out because they were pursuing corruption cases involving Republican congressmen .
Democrats yesterday took the first step toward issuing subpoenas for presidential adviser Karl Rove and other White House officials .
Subpoenas for 11 current and former Justice Department officials also were authorized .
But the White House , while feeling heat over calls for the president to replace Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales , said complaints about the dismissals were mistaken .
“ The president has the authority to remove people who serve at his pleasure , and these were people who had four - year terms , all of whom had expired , ” said White House spokesman Tony Snow .
But Mr. Specter said he is willing to vote in favor of the subpoenas if Mr. Rove and others do not testify under oath willingly .
Sen . Patrick J. Leahy , Vermont Democrat and chairman of the Judiciary Committee , had scheduled the committee for a vote on White House subpoenas , but Mr. Specter requested that the vote be held over for a week .
“ Let ’s give them a chance to respond before we get tough , ” Mr. Specter said .

It sounds like the setup for a dull economist ’s joke .
Who gets the better deal : the cautious economist who sells his house through a real estate agent , or his risk - taking colleague who finds a buyer on his own ?
But the question — debated by two Northwestern University economists who chose different methods to sell their homes — and the research it helped prompt are serious .
And the answer will be of interest to anyone who has paused to consider whether paying a real estate agent ’s commission , typically 5 to 6 percent of the sale price , is worth it .
The conclusion , in a study to be released today based on home - sales data from 1998 to 2004 in Madison , Wis. , is that people in that city who sold their homes through real estate agents typically did not get a higher sale price than people who sold their homes themselves .
When the agent ’s commission is factored in , the for - sale - by - owner people came out ahead financially .
The study is to be made public on Northwestern ’s Web site .
Madison is home to one of the biggest for - sale - by - owner Web sites in the country .
The economists pitted that site against the local multiple listing service operated by real estate agents .

( 1. ) The Connection
One of four phones Lenny uses for business ; this one is for staying in touch with runners making deliveries .
The phone numbers are prepaid , attached to no name .
( 2. ) The Money
About $ 25,000 , a fraction of his savings .
He nets an average of $ 5,000 a week and stores much of his money in a safe bolted to the floor of his apartment .
( 3. ) The Tools
A portable digital scale used for weighing small quantities of cocaine .
For larger amounts — between 100 and 500 grams — he uses a triple - beam balance .
( 4. ) The Product
One ounce of cocaine , purchased for $ 800 in Washington Heights , bagged and ready to be sold for $ 2,500 .
Every day he tells himself the same thing .
You are doing nothing wrong .
It plays through his mind on repeat , keeping his nerves in check .
You have no reason to worry .
Tonight , a Friday , he is walking down a cobblestone street in Soho , hands wedged in his leather jacket , his posture slump - shouldered , as if he ’s curling in on himself .
In his right - hand pocket , there is a plastic bag containing numerous smaller plastic bags — “ tickets , ” he calls them — filled with either a gram or gram and three quarters of cocaine .
The smaller ones he calls “ chiquitas . ”
They cost $ 60 .
The big ones , known simply as “ big ones , ” go for $ 100 .
He is heading to see a customer , a twiggy , doe - eyed woman who asked to meet outside an art gallery .
He thumbs through the Baggies , able to gauge the weight with his fingertips , and secures her order in his fist , all the while humming along to the voice in his head .
You are doing nothing wrong —
This is deluded , he knows , but in his business , delusion is everything : both what you ’re selling and how you sell it .
His name is Lenny Starke , or at least that ’s what we ’ll call him here , and seven days a week he moves through the city like this : making pickups and deliveries , a sequence of handshakes and handoffs that earns him , tax - free , about $ 5,000 a week .
This places him somewhere in the middle of the $ 92 billion worldwide cocaine industry , above petty street dealers , below the organized syndicates that are his main suppliers .
Given Lenny ’s upbringing — the socially ambitious parents , the airy Manhattan apartment , the uptown private school — dealing seems an odd career choice .
But to him , it ’s almost logical .
His financial portfolio is impressive : $ 30,000 in a safe bolted to the floor of his apartment , another $ 25,000 in storage at a “ wholesome ” friend ’s house , and a steady stream being invested and washed clean in the stock market .
And when Lenny wants to spend a weekend on Shelter Island or comes down with a cold or just feels like staying inside and playing Grand Theft Auto — a video game in which the hero is a drug dealer — he has a rotating cast of employees who do the work for him .
All this , and he is not yet 25 .
“ I ’m going to be financially set , ” says Lenny .
“ I can skip a step .
I ’m able to pay for my apartment without having to work a crap job or having to ask Mommy and Daddy to send me rent checks every month — that , to me , is just as bad . ”
It ’s an absurdly warm night for March , still early , edging on 6:30 , that hour when the tension of the workweek gets eclipsed by a restive desire to get a little lost .
Lenny ’s cell rings repeatedly .
Per dealer protocol , the number is prepaid , attached to no name , untraceable .
The phone is an old - school , beat - to - hell Nokia that he refuses to upgrade , Lenny being somewhat superstitious .
“ Probably it ’s the warm weather , but I ’m thinking tonight ’s gonna be busy , ” he says after taking a call , this one from a 21 - year - old kid so “ papered up ” — Lenny ’s term for those with enviable wealth — that his parents bought him an entire brownstone .
“ The kid is a spoiled brat , basically , who wants to pretend he ’s all thugged out , ” Lenny continues , seemingly unaware that the same could be said about him .
“ Anyway , those calls just now ?
That ’s three more orders , and we only walked , what ?
Four blocks .
It ’s cool , but I was hoping to kick it , have a beer .
I ’ve been working since , like , noon , right ?
Went up to midtown for the day shift .
That ’s finance types mainly , guys in suits , some people in fashion .
I meet them at their offices .
Or on the street , real quick , boom - boom , you know ?
Or in banks , right in the lobby by the ATMs .
Banks are my favorite .
Nobody is thinking people are buying coke at a bank . ”
Dealing has always appealed to Lenny ’s two most dominant personality traits : an obsession with money and chronic impatience , characteristics that do n’t exactly set him apart from his peers , kids who came of age during the hip - hop and Internet booms , two movements united by the philosophy that money is something to be made quickly , dubiously , and only in large amounts .
“ I was always the kid that wanted more , ” is how Lenny puts it .
“ I never grew up with nothing , but I never had enough .
If you gave me $ 20 , I wanted $ 40 .
I like eating out , I like nice things .
I ca n’t really function if I ca n’t get what I want .
Ever since I was little , I would just go out and get , you know ? ”

But , lately , as his friends settle into careers in private - equity consulting and cosmetics PR , Lenny has found himself questioning his profession .
Whenever he tries to imagine himself five or ten years down the line , his mind either shudders and comes up blank , or spits back images of clichéd cautionary tales : Lenny the Addict , Lenny in Jail , Lenny Dead .
“ I ’m not gonna be 30 years old and feeding my babies with this , ” he declares , but given that he ’s often in debt up to $ 15,000 to a man who regularly carries a gun , getting out is more complicated than suddenly growing a conscience and tossing your phone into the East River .
“ You have to get out smoothly , ” says Lenny .
“ Same way you got in . ”
With this in mind , he has recently set in motion a plan for retirement , one that gains momentum with each customer he greets —
“ Hey , baby , what ’s up ? ”
Outside the gallery , the doe - eyed woman hurries across the street , her vintage riding boots clicking on the cobblestones .
There must be an opening tonight , because bodies are pouring into the street , blocking traffic .
Beneath the thin yellow glow of the streetlights , the figures are silhouetted : a sea of conceptualized hairstyles all referencing bands that Lenny , who listens almost exclusively to hip - hop , has never heard of .
“ Yeah , baby , long time no see . ”
With that , Gallery Girl presses her waxen cheek to his , kissing the air just below his earlobe .
Lenny can smell her perfume — vaguely citrus , superclean .
He shakes her hand , sliding the two big ones she ordered into her palm .
She slips the Baggies into her purse as they walk through the crowd making small talk , two old friends who know nothing about each other .
Eventually , they stop and she gives him another delicate kiss , this time reaching out her other hand , the one that ’s been palming $ 200 the entire time .
“ See ya , baby , ” she says , cantering across the street and disappearing through the gallery door .
Lenny , meanwhile , goes into accounting mode .
After every delivery , he pulls out his T - Mobile Sidekick and uses its tiny keypad to record the specifics of the transaction just completed : customer nickname , quantity purchased , cash received .
This information will be erased later tonight , once he gets home and downloads it into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet tracking every deal he ’s made over the past year .
That file is then purged from his hard drive and stored on an unlabeled diskette : a cheap , flimsy piece of plastic that Lenny hopes will make him a small fortune .
Like many markets , the drug business thrives on mergers and acquisitions , or what is known in the trade as “ selling your numbers ” — giving up your phone and client list for a fee .
Every dealer keeps track of his profits in one way or another , though Lenny ’s Excel document is likely a rare prep - school touch , one he hopes will boost his sale price .
Recently , he heard about a pot -delivery service going for $ 50,000 , but cocaine is both a pricier drug and a growth industry — use among adults has been increasing nationally since 1999 — so he ’s thinking he could double that number .
“ The rule in any business is that you do n’t sell your company for what it makes in a year , ” explains Lenny , “ but for what it makes in two or three or four years , right ?
Well , in my business , you ca n’t do that .
Someone gets arrested and — boom — it ’s over .
So you gotta sell it based on what you make in , like , six months . ”
And that , in outline , is Lenny Starke ’s retirement plan : Cash in , cash out , and use the windfall to invest in something legitimate .
A business of some sort .
Real estate , for instance .
Maybe get an M.B.A. Every now and then Lenny even thinks , half - seriously , about law school .
“ Yeah , it ’s ironic or whatever .
People say , ‘ Oh , law school , yeah - yeah … ’ But doing this has made me better suited , ” he claims .
“ I ’m a good talker , good at sitting down with people and working out deals .
Half of law is the pretrial stuff you do n’t see on TV , striking deals behind the curtain , which all comes down to money .
Well , that ’s the shit I do every day . ”
To find the origin of Lenny ’s hustling instinct — to understand how an upper - middle - class kid becomes a serious drug dealer — you have to go back to high school .
Freshman year , he was a skinny kid , decent at sports , interested in student government .
But by the time he was 15 , Lenny had joined the ranks of privileged children who , searching for appealing avenues of rebellion , choose to emulate the lower classes with a cartoonish take on black culture .
“ Basically , ” he says , “ I started running around acting like a fake thug , ” a pastime that revolved around “ local street - dogging - type things , ” like stealing North Face jackets off the backs of younger kids and skipping class to smoke blunts in back alleys .
Lenny loved pot , but he also saw it as a business opportunity , partly because selling would mean free product for himself .
Like his favorite rapper , Tupac Shakur , put it : I smoke blunts on a regular , fuck when it counts / I ’m tryin ’ to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce .

“ It was almost like a hobby at first , ” says Lenny .
“ I remember when I got my first ounce , breaking it up , how it was like a little celebration . ”
Moving from buyer to seller proved surprisingly easy : Just tell the guy selling you that dime bag that you ’re looking to buy in larger quantities ; he ’d rather sell an ounce all at once than move it one gram at a time .
From the beginning , Lenny displayed a knack for business .
He went down to Chinatown and purchased hundreds of tiny clear - plastic cubes : blue for boys , pink for girls , his first foray into elementary branding principles .
He had a stationery company print up 1,000 business cards — the word juice surrounded by palm trees , his pager number in the bottom right corner .
But his greatest innovation was his distribution method : “ I made somebody else sell it for me .
I got the stereotypes , one of the only black kids , so nobody knew it was me . ”
Then , just as the business was running smoothly , something unexpected happened : High school came to an end .
As Lenny watched his friends get accepted to places like Wesleyan and Yale and Skidmore , his mailbox filled with rejection letters .
He ended up at a college never once mentioned by his school ’s guidance counselor , which only reinforced the notion that his talents lay elsewhere .
So he expanded his services to include Ecstasy , LSD , mushrooms , Special K .
In a shift so subtle he did n’t even notice it at the time , Lenny went from being a fake thug to a kid who resembled the real thing .
“ I ’m upper middle class , ” he says .
“ I did n’t grow up with a gun in my house , but I fell in love with that gangster shit . ”
He looked sharp in a fur - trimmed hoodie .
His velour track pants were Sean John .
He walked with a no- bullshit swagger .
When a heavily tattooed kid conned him out of 100 pills of Ecstasy , Lenny sought retribution :
He set up a fake deal and hired an associate to press a pistol into the guy ’s ribs as they drove around Queens .
“ Come on , man !
Please !
I do n’t wanna die in these streets ! ” he screamed as Lenny , sitting in the backseat , looked on impassively .
It was only a matter of time before one of his friends — an increasingly shady lot of outer - borough roughnecks , none of them connected to his private - school past — introduced Lenny to the cocaine trade .
“ One day , he pulls me aside , ” Lenny recalls , “ and he ’s like , ‘ You ’ve got to check this out . ’
It was a fucking manila envelope full of cocaine .
Pure , powdery .
No rocks , nothing .
He was like , ‘ I got this girl in South America , she sends it to me . ’
You would n’t believe how many of these fucking letters come through .
You can put an ounce of cocaine in there ” — 28 grams , about $ 2,500 on the street — “ and by the time it gets here , it ’s like a thin piece of paper . ”
Lenny had tried coke once before but did n’t understand the fuss people made over a substance that , to his mind , made you nervous for fifteen minutes , a fiend for two hours , then depressed for an entire day .
“ But I ’m like , Fuck it .
I did a line , and it was amazing .
I traded 60 pills of Ecstasy for 20 grams .
I split it up into little Baggies , then I ended up sniffing all my profits away .
But I sold a little bit of it and kept in touch with the guy , and from there … ” Lenny lingers on the memory for a moment .
“ Well , I was serious about it . ”
“ I meet them at their offices .
Or on the street , real quick , boom - boom .
Or in banks , right in the lobby by the ATMs .
Banks are my favorite .
Nobody is thinkng people are buying coke at a bank . ”
He was 21 , barely going to class , hooked up with an anonymous South American distributor , and selling coke to friends , friends of friends , and people he did n’t recognize who swore they were friends .
Somewhat unwittingly , he was building a network that tapped into an underserved demographic : white kids in their twenties who were curious about coke but did n’t have a reliable source .
These were customers born in the mid-eighties — too young to have vivid recollections of the crack epidemic .
By the time they were entering the prime years of postadolescent experimentation , cocaine had been socially declassified as a scourge , doing a line no more frowned upon than puffing on a joint .
“ Now everyone ’s into coke , talking about it openly , laughing about it , ” says Lenny , echoing a 2005 report from the National Drug Intelligence Center , which noted that the perceived risk associated with powder cocaine has steadily declined , especially among the young , since the early nineties .
“ Do you listen to hip - hop ? ” Lenny asks .
“ Suddenly , every rapper ’s talking about coke . ”
He mentions Cam’ron , the platinum - selling Harlem artist : What you want , coke or piff ? / I got it all smoke or sniff …
Bird ’s - eye view /
The birds I knew / Flip birds / Bird gang /
It was birds I flew …
“ Birds , ” explains Lenny , “ is slang for a kilo of coke . ”
The letters from South America were n’t arriving fast enough , so Lenny asked around and found another connection : a surly older guy who often had a gun tucked into the waist of his pants .
“ We ’ve never had a conversation longer than ten seconds , ” says Lenny , but he suspected that his new supplier was “ mobbed up . ”
His product was even more pure , and reasonable at $ 25 a gram , about a third of the street value .
( The Bush administration claims that thanks to the $ 4 billion war on drugs in Colombia , cocaine in the U.S. now costs $ 170 a gram and is 15 percent less pure than it used to be .
“ I do n’t know who their connection is , ” Lenny deadpans , “ but someone ’s getting ripped off . ” )
Lenny would buy anywhere from 200 to 600 grams at a time from his new source , the coke coming not in powder form but in a hard , crystalline brick — not excessively “ doctored up ” with baking soda or baby laxatives .
Sometimes , depending on how much he picked up , Lenny could see the symbol of the cartel indented in the brick .
He had money in his pocket , a Glock 9 hidden away for protection , and superfluous jewelry jangling from his neck and wrists .
He was also dipping into the product with greater frequency , developing a habit that rivaled most of his customers ’ .
He took a leave of absence from school and moved back into the city , holing up with a friend in an unfurnished apartment , his days an alkaloid blur of crushing up product , sniffing , selling , and muting cocaine ’s tweaky comedown with heroic quantities of hydroponic pot .
Nights rolled around , and Lenny , barely of legal drinking age , was cruising around in limos and spending $ 2,000 on bottle service .
“ I used to be the king of Suede , ” he says , more embarrassed than proud of this today .
It was around this time that he discovered “ coke groupies , ” quasi - anorexic girls willing to give up any last shred of dignity for a free line .
But their presence was better in theory than reality .
“ Sex is overrated , ” says Lenny , “ or at least it ’s only worthwhile if it ’s with a girl you ’re crazy into . ”
One night , he had to take a Viagra just to be able to perform adequately , an experience no 21 - year - old man should have to live through .
Lenny was pushing it , he knew .
Sitting on the couch in the middle of the day , he ’d glance over at his buddy — his sallow skin , the way his eyes had caved into his face , the spastic twitch in his jaw — and some fogged - over cluster of cells in Lenny ’s mind would remind him that he was practically looking in the mirror .
Then one day he showed up at his apartment and right away he could tell something was off .
He walked through the entryway and into the kitchen , taking in the upturned drawers , the broken dishes , the slashed mattress in the bedroom , the clothes all over the floor — it was so surreal that it took him a moment to process that he ’d been robbed .
His TV and DVD and VCR were gone .
So were a pound of marijuana and a briefcase safe with $ 25,000 inside — the bulk of his life savings .
And it was n’t a random act .
The thief had entered the apartment through the roof .
Lenny had been targeted .
The past few months flashed back like a checklist of how not to run a business .
All those nights he tooled around in white stretch limos , just because he could .
And the steady stream of nameless girls with Gucci-embossed leather bags prancing in and out at all hours .
To say nothing of his own wardrobe of Purple Label cashmere sweaters from Ralph Lauren , Prada loafers , silk - lined Donna Karan motorcycle pants , and the eighteen - karat - gold Cuban necklace hanging stupidly from his neck — $ 2,500 worth of precious metal practically taunting someone to jump him .
“ I blamed myself , ” says Lenny , “ for being so loose . ”
He considered getting out right then .
He owed his connection $ 5,000 , which happened to be exactly what he had in his savings account .
He could chalk up the burglary as some kind of accidental intervention , pay off his debts , and move on .
Or he could get serious : Stop using , keep a low profile , stay in the game another year or two , and cash out .
For all the talk of dealers inevitably imploding , Lenny knew scores of guys who owned buildings , small businesses , racehorses — guys you ’d never suspect got started pushing product .
His indiscretions aside , these had always been his business models .
He reached for his phone , dialed his connection .
“ Yo , I ’ve been jacked , ” he said .
“ I need you to loan me some stuff , help me get back on my feet . ”
Two years later , Lenny is on the move .
He climbs the cracked tile steps of an East Village walk - up , delivering a chiquita to a painter who lives in a funky little studio .
He ’s got a $ 5,000 watch on his wrist , but other than that , he is inconspicuous , efficient , a pro .
From the East Village , he hops a cab uptown — no driving for Lenny ; owning a car is “ too hot ” — and drops off two big ones at an Upper West Side apartment , then another chiquita to an asset - management specialist standing outside an Irish pub in Hell ’s Kitchen .
“ It ’s all about the speed getting to each spot , ” Lenny explains as he slides into the backseat of another cab , pouring the Baggies into his lap and counting them .
“ If I ’m taking too long , someone will call back and say , ‘ I ’m gonna call someone else . ’
That ’s the competition , you know ? ”
Meanwhile , one of his “ partners ” is traversing the city making similar stops , staying in constant contact via Nextel .
He ’ll sell $ 1,000 worth of tickets tonight , keeping 20 percent of the profits and kicking $ 800 up to Lenny .
Until recently , Lenny always hired other people to do the grunt work , just like in high school .
“ That way , I ’m getting paid , ” he says , “ but no one ’s putting my face to the service . ”
But these days , since he ’s priming his company for auction , he prefers to do as much of the work himself as he can .
In a business of deception , finding trustworthy employees is a challenge : A few months back , Lenny caught a worker cutting his Baggies with baking soda , pocketing the extra profits , and pissing off regular customers , which is just the sort of misstep he can’t afford to repeat .
He ’s already piqued the interest of a few potential buyers and plans to start showing them the spreadsheet over the next few months .
( “ Honestly , I do n’t even know if drug people know how to read a spreadsheet , ” says Lenny .
“ We ’ll just have to see . ” )
Serious prospects will then trail him for a week , to see that the numbers add up .
Then he ’ll make the biggest deal of his life — assuming , of course , that he is genuinely ready to give up the game .
On the corner of 24th and Sixth , Lenny meets up with two club kids , followed by a bartender at a gay bar farther downtown .
Then it ’s another cab back to the East Village .
He has just shy of 200 regular customers , and the list grows solely by word of mouth :
When Lenny gets a call from an unfamiliar number , he asks for a reference , then calls that reference to make sure it ’s legitimate .
His primary market is still kids in their twenties , many of them new to the city , the majority living in the East Village and on the Lower East Side .
But he does not discriminate .
Among his regulars are strivers , slackers , black kids , white kids , Asian kids , NYU kids , socialites , agoraphobics , a lesbian couple , an Afghan lawyer , an Ivy League undergrad who deals Lenny ’s product on campus , and a Russian “ diplomat brat ” who lives out of town but comes to New York twice a month to hole up in a hotel suite with his lover .
“ I ’d like to market more in the finance world , ” says Lenny .
“ One guy I know , he ’s always telling me to go after that scene , dudes who have no issue burning through $ 500 on a Friday night .
But it takes time .
You ’re basically saying to people , ‘ Tell your friends about me , ’ and hoping the message gets to the right people . ”
At least 6 million Americans do cocaine every year , making it more popular than 50 Cent ’s last album .
Ninety percent of the supply comes from Colombian cartels , passing through numerous hands before it reaches Lenny .
Because 72 percent of the cocaine comes across the Texas - Mexico border , Houston has emerged as America ’s leading distribution center .
( The rest arrives by ship via the Caribbean , with a small percentage coming directly from South America . )
From Houston , the drug is shipped to other cities hidden in tractor trailers .
Once it reaches New York , the supply is controlled mainly by the Mafia and Latino street gangs .
Lenny has contacts in both worlds .
That way , he can play the two against each other , keeping the price low and quality high .
Whenever one supplier jacks up the price , Lenny takes his business elsewhere until the price comes down .
“ That ’s why we call it ‘ the game , ’ ” he says .
Truly pure cocaine is impossible to come across on the street ; most users are so accustomed to sniffing diluted product that pure coke would be too potent to enjoy .
A kilo arriving in the U.S. tends to be 80 to 90 percent pure and cost between $ 17,000 and $ 25,000 .
Before reaching someone like Lenny , it ’s cut twice to make four kilos with about 22 percent purity , each of which will then generate around $ 100,000 in street - level sales .
( Some kilos are cut up to three times , bringing the purity down to 11 percent , but you can only sell this inferior product in “ ignorant ” markets — college kids , indiscriminate addicts , etc. )
Lenny tests the purity of all his purchases by weighing it , cooking it , then placing it on a triple - beam balance :
The additives sizzle away , revealing the weight of the pure drug .
“ My suppliers are straight with me , ” he says , “ because they know I ’ll know if they start giving me shit .
Since I ’m making them money , fucking me on quality is not in their interest .
So if it ’s not that good , they tell me , and I only buy a little to keep them happy .
When it ’s good , that ’s when I stock up , keeping my customers happy . ”
Lenny prefers his “ mobbed up ” connection , because with him , Lenny can run a tab , paying only 50 percent up front .
Also , the product is delivered to Lenny ’s apartment , allowing him to avoid walking the streets in possession of enough cocaine to put him in jail for 25 years .
But sometimes things happen — turf wars , executions — that temporarily pinch the supply and increase the price , at which point Lenny takes a nerve - racking trip uptown , where the cocaine trade is split between the blacks of East Harlem and the Latinos of Washington Heights .
According to a report by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy , Washington Heights is “ the primary distribution center for retail and wholesale cocaine and heroin throughout the Northeast , ” a fact that comes as no surprise to Lenny , who knows numerous blocks where half the crumbling buildings are fronts for bulk narcotics distribution .
Each street has a boss , who employs women and children to do the work , so Lenny ends up buying two ounces of coke from “ like a 20 - year - old hoochie gangster bitch ” who hides the product in her cleavage .
“ You give her a hug , cop a little feel , deal done , ” Lenny explains .
A white guy with a private - school diploma can easily become a piñata in this world , but Lenny knows how to behave .
“ You just have to show up with attitude , ” he says .
“ Basically , you give them a look that says , If you do n’t fuck with me this time , I ’ll be back .
Also , the first few times , I brought my gun .
You know , just in case . ”
At Tompkins Square Park , Lenny hops out of the cab .
It ’s well past midnight now , and the street is teeming with scraggly indie rockers , suburban pseudo - punks , and other kids giving new personalities a test run .
Lenny hooks up two girls with rigorously straightened hair , then darts into a nearby bar , where he ducks into the bathroom with a graduate student , emerging $ 200 richer .
On occasion , Lenny sells other drugs — pot and Ecstasy , mainly — but he has built his company around cocaine because it ’s the most lucrative and , these days , the most in - demand .
He could make substantially more selling larger quantities : moving into wholesale , supplying guys like him .
But that would mean storing keys in his apartment , and Lenny rarely buys more than half a kilo at a time .
He carries much less than that , so that if he ’s arrested , his jail time would be minimal , likely just a few days .
“ It ’s like this , ” he says .
“ Whoever I deal with deals with a gang , someone who ’s taking the risk of talking to the cartel .
I pay a little bit more to stay disconnected from that . ”
But staying disconnected from the syndicate level means being more connected to the spontaneous customer , an increasingly capricious contingent the later it gets .
As Lenny walks out of the bar , his cell phone rings , beckoning him to a Nolita apartment , where a self - tanned , stiletto - heeled woman insists he kiss her new lapdog before she pays him for her three grams .
“ Oh , come on ! ” she begs .
“ I see the dog , ” says Lenny .
“ Very cute .
But I ’m good . ”
“ Just a little peck !
Do n’t be a prude ! ”
“ Sometimes I feel like a vulture , like if it was n’t me selling it , half my customers would n’t be comfortable doing it .
At the same time , I do n’t create the demand , right ?
The product sells itself . ”
Lenny rolls his eyes , obliging as she rummages through a drawer , searching for her money .
The cash is buried under a stack of empty boxes of Lexapro , an antidepressant .
Lenny walks out , shaking his head .
“ It gets mad lonely and depressing , ” he says , ducking into a bar and ordering a beer .
As he scans the crowd — kids his age , all huddled in groups , faces flushed , enjoying themselves — his melancholy turns bitter .
“ And here I am , a Friday night , running around like this .
Do you see me with friends ?
No .
Do you think I can have a serious girlfriend ?
Fuck no .
How can I have a girl ?
They say I do n’t commit , I do n’t give back .
Well , no shit .
I ’m too busy pretending to be nice to bitches like that , coke fiends I do n’t even know . ”
Lenny sighs , rubs his temples , orders another beer .
Sometimes he can’t help but be disgusted by his customers , people living the heedless life he gave up when he “ changed from being a consumer in that environment to being a provider for that lifestyle . ”
But Lenny is a consummate salesman , and to his customers he plays the role of cordial and crooked shrink , supplying all the hollow justifications that once kept his own fears at bay .
When clients invite him to hang out , Lenny understands their motives :
They need to convince themselves that he is merely a friend who happens to have drugs on him , not a dealer supporting an unhealthy habit .
So Lenny chills , sips a beer .
Sometimes customers insist he do a line with them , at which point Lenny , who no longer uses , “ accidentally ” blows out through the straw so the coke flies everywhere , and then laughs it off .
Every morning , he wakes up to a dozen missed calls on the Nokia , all delivery requests made between four and six in the morning , all from a few jonesing clients .
When he calls back , the customer always plays innocent : must ’ve been a fluke of the phone , a mistake of some sort .
And at least once a night , a client will hesitate at the last minute , coming down with a case of buyer ’s remorse , at which point Lenny is forced to really turn it on .
“ I ’ll sit back and reassure you , ” he says .
“ Like , ‘ Listen , I ’m not going to criticize you for what you do .
If you think you ’ve done a lot , it ’s nothing compared to what a lot of people do or what I ’ve personally done in a week ’s time .
If you ’re really stressed out from your girlfriend and you want to go out all night and have a good time — please , I understand where you ’re coming from . ’ ”
When Lenny thinks a customer truly is going too far , he will refuse to make the delivery .
But even this is a subversive form of business management :
“ The client that buys a little bit consistently is way better than the client that , like , OD ’s and then never wants to do it again . ”
This Lenny learned from a customer who lived near Union Square .
First it was one delivery a week , then two , then three .
On each visit , his customer seemed ten pounds lighter .
Lenny noticed that the same miserable pizza would sit on his kitchen table for a week straight , clearly the guy ’s sole source of nourishment .
At one point , he owed Lenny $ 500 and disappeared completely .
“ Then he comes back , like , ‘ Hi , I went to rehab ! ’ ” Lenny recalls .
“ I ’m like , ‘ That ’s cool , man , pay my ass and stay away from this shit . ’
I was happy for him .
He looked better , was going to the gym .
But sure enough , he starts smoking weed again , then doing coke again .
And — boom — this time he left the country .
Have n’t heard from him since . ”
Lenny is not immune to guilt .
“ Sometimes I feel like a vulture , like if it was n’t me selling it , half my customers would n’t be comfortable doing it , ” he says , before reverting back to the entrepreneur ’s selective , capitalistic logic : “ At the same time , I do n’t create the demand , right ?
The product sells itself .
My job is to get the word around , let people know it ’s available , and be responsible about making my appointments . ”
In the end , what ’s most difficult for Lenny is admitting that the rush he gets from selling — the instant gratification , the bolstered confidence , the feeling that he ’s the nucleus around which everything orbits — is in many ways identical to what his customers call him to experience .
As much as he says he is working to sell his business , it ’s hard to know if and when he ’ll make the move .
’ In September , ” says Lenny .
“ I ’m out in September . ”
It ’s after three in the morning now , and he is walking along East Houston , past dingy bars serving last call and drowsy - eyed girls in heels and pre-torn jeans .
The coke - to - cash ratio in his pockets has shifted , from about 30 tickets and $ 20 , to three tickets and $ 2,500 .
A busy night , as predicted .
“ Or maybe October , ” he goes on .
“ I do n’t fucking know .
November at the absolute latest .
Or I might wait for the holiday season , that ’s the hottest time of the year .
Probably January ’ 07 . ”
Looking for after - work drinking partners , Lenny calls a few friends from high school and a girl “ I ’m , like , basically in love with . ”
But no one picks up .
“ I ’m telling you , man , I ’m sick of this , ” he says .
“ I hardly go out with anyone , right ?
And when I do , guess who always picks up the bar tab ?
Everyone eats off me .
Always .
They do n’t like what I do , but they like what it gets them .
Girls act all worried , then ask to borrow my credit card .
It ’s fucked up , but there it is . ”
It ’s not that Lenny does n’t realize how lucky he is .
He has no police record , has never had a gun pulled on him , and has n’t had to threaten violence since he switched to selling coke .
But he also knows that everyone ’s luck eventually runs out .
Some nights , thinking about this , he can barely sleep .
“ I have nightmares all the time , ” he says .
“ I ’m getting shot in the head , or I ’m awaiting bail .
I shoot people in my dreams no problem , I go on all these murderous rampages .
Someone steals $ 50 K from me and keeps saying , ‘ I did n’t steal it , I did n’t steal it ! ’
I have mad issues about trust .
I ’m sure that if I went to a doctor , I could get all sorts of drugs .
Like anti-anxiety or whatever . ”
Not long ago , Lenny was on one of his law - school kicks again .
He bought a book of LSAT practice tests , turned off his phone , and sat down to see how he would do .
They proved more challenging than he expected .
So accustomed to being on the move , he has n’t mastered the skill of sitting still for two and a half hours .
He tapped his foot .
His eyes darted around .
His mind got snagged on more immediate business concerns .
“ Thing is , ” he says , “ every six months I stay in it , I can throw another $ 25 K onto my price .
More people talk about me , more people call me , my number becomes more valuable .
But then I get there , and I want more .
That ’s always been my problem .
It ’s a risk , but obviously there is appeal in that , you know ?
It ’s not like I do n’t want to get out .
I do .
It ’s just … ”
But Lenny does n’t finish the thought .
His phone rings , a customer from earlier looking to replenish his supply .
A seven - block walk for an extra $ 60 .
Lenny shakes his head .
“ Fuck it , ” he says .
“ Let ’s get on that . ”
Video : CNN covers 9/11 conspiracy film ' Loose Change ' RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday September 13 , 2006 Print This Email This
On the fifth anniversary of 9/11 , a group of conspiracy theorists gather at the World Trade Center to call attention to their belief that the U.S. government participated in a cover - up of the 9/11 attacks .
In the following video , CNN's Paula Zahn reports that an internet film titled " Loose Change " has lead many to question the government 's version of events on 9/11 .
Three amateur filmmakers created the film with $ 2,000 and a laptop computer .
CNN reports that the internet film has spread like " wildfire " .
It has been downloaded 10 million times and translated into 13 languages .
A transcript follows the video .
# ZAHN : Well , the nation remembered the victims of 9/11 yesterday .
This rally took place near the site of what was the World Trade Center .
A group of conspiracy theorists gathered to demand an investigation of who was really behind the terror attacks .
It 's all because of an Internet film called " Loose Change " that is challenging the official version of 9/11 .
Deborah Feyerick set out to find out more about the people behind it .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE ) DEBORAH FEYERICK , CNN CORRESPONDENT
( voice - over ) :
The conspiracy theorists began even before the smoke had cleared .
First impressions pulled apart and analyzed .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
It appeared to be a U.S. military helicopter .
FEYERICK : On the scene reports presented as evidence of a possible government cover -up .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
There 's no reason to believe that this jet was there for any nefarious purposes but the Secret Service was very concerned .
FEYERICK : Every reason , every answer .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
The man in the video looks and acts nothing like bin Laden .
FEYERICK : Scrutinized and challenged .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE :
Are we supposed to believe that it disappeared into this whole without leave any wreckage on the outside ?
FEYERICK : These are some of the events called into question by a film made for $ 2,000 bucks by three friends using a laptop computer .
It 's called " Loose Change . "
When it hit the Web last year , it spread like wildfire , downloaded some 10 million times , translated into 13 languages .
The 80 - minute documentary presents its own evidence and asks viewers to look closely and asks viewers to look closely and ask questions like , could the trade center have been brought down by bombs ?
Could the Pentagon have been hit by a missile and what happened to plane debris in Shanksville ?
DYLAN AVERY , DIRECTOR , LOOSE CHANGE :
To accept the official story of 9/11 , you really have to accept hundred of different coincidences all at once .
FEYERICK : Dylan Avery is the film 's writer , director and narrator .
Jason Bermas did the research and Korey Rowe was the executive producer , a war vet who fought al Qaeda in Afghanistan .
KOREY ROWE , PRODUCER , LOOSE CHANGE : I met my enemy and the people that supposedly pulled off this attack .
These people are not strong enough and they 're not advanced enough to pull off these synchronized attacks .
FEYERICK : They are not engineers or trained investigators and only Jason has a college degree .
( on camera ) :
In your mind , there 's no question that it was actually a conspiracy .
CROWD : Absolutely .
FEYERICK : They 're not alone .
The Zogby poll of 1,200 Americans taken in May found that 42 percent feel the government and 9/11 commission took part in some kind of cover up .
Former Senator Bob Kerrey spent months investigating the attacks as part of the 9/11 commission .
He says the only conspiracy was the one by al Qaeda .
BOB KERREY , FORMER SENATOR :
The substantial evidence the U.S. government did n't do enough to confront what was an obvious enemy , but the fact that they did too little , in some cases did n't do anything is not evidence that the United States government organized this conspiracy .
FEYERICK : The filmmakers do n't buy it and say they 've meticulously studied the events of September 11th .
JASON BERMAS , RESEARCHER , LOOSE CHANGE :
The bottom line is the World Trade Center , one , two and seven have to be controlled demolitions .
We have isolated the blast points , 20 , 40 and 60 floors below the World Trade Center .
FEYERICK : We showed this clip to Glenn Corbett , a fire expert who helped investigate the physical collapse of the towers .
GLENN CORBETT , FIRE EXPERT , JOHN JAY COLLEGE :
There 's no doubt that the subsequent fires that erupted could weaken that steel and bring the buildings down without any help from explosives .
FEYERICK : As for the filmmakers ... ( on camera ) : ... You say this is a conspiracy .
Is n't it possible that it was simply a colossal failure by the U.S. government ?
AVERY : For them to have been completely caught off guard by September 11th , we would have to believe that our government is , you know , The Three Stooges .
FEYERICK : But regardless of what you believe , the film certainly has people thinking .

Gordon D. Johndroe , a spokesman for the National Security Council , said the interagency review covered anti-Taliban and counternarcotics activities as well as efforts to counter extremism and to integrate the central government with local and provincial governments .
“ We are proud of the progress that has been made in the last five years , but know there is more to do , ” he said .
“ The United States is committed to the people of Afghanistan for the long term . ”
Mr. Neumann , who has been the ambassador here for just over a year , laid out a full menu of tasks that he said the American - led effort needed to accomplish in Afghanistan , including reviving the country ’s economy , building roads and power plants and improving security .
He said plans drafted in 2002 to train the army and police force needed to be revamped and expanded .
Mr. Neumann , a decorated Vietnam veteran whose father served as the American ambassador to Afghanistan from 1966 to 1973 , said the country ’s security forces had to be better supplied .
“ We have a war , not in all parts of the country , but we have a war , ” he said .
“ So we have to build a much better equipped army and a much better - equipped police . ”
Training the police represents an even larger challenge than strengthening the army , Mr. Neumann said .
“ The police need a whole huge , major effort , ” he said .
“ That was n’t what the program was designed to do when we were at peace . ”
The senior American official said Afghans widely saw the force as corrupt and failing to provide security .
A sharp increase in suicide attacks and roadside bombings over the past two years has persuaded many Afghans that security has sharply deteriorated under Mr. Karzai .
The tactics appear to have migrated from Iraq , according to the official , probably via the Internet and people traveling between the countries .
The eldest children in families tend to develop higher I.Q. ’s than their siblings , researchers are reporting today , in a large study that could settle more than a half - century of scientific debate about the relationship between I.Q. and birth order .
The average difference in I.Q. was slight — three points higher in the eldest child than in the closest sibling — but significant , the researchers said .
And they said the results made it clear that it was due to family dynamics , not to biological factors like prenatal environment .
Researchers have long had evidence that firstborns tended to be more dutiful and cautious than their siblings , and some previous studies found significant I.Q. differences .
But critics said those reports were not conclusive , because they did not take into account the vast differences in upbringing among families .
Three points on an I.Q. test may not sound like much .
But experts say it can be a tipping point for some people — the difference between a high B average and a low A , for instance .
That , in turn , can have a cumulative effect that could mean the difference between admission to an elite private liberal - arts college and a less exclusive public one .
FAMED for its restorative powers , it now seems that laughter also helps breast milk to fight skin allergies .
Breastfed babies with eczema experienced milder symptoms if their mothers laughed hours before feeding them , according to a study by Hajime Kimata at the Moriguchi - Keijinkai Hospital in Osaka , Japan .
He showed breastfeeding mothers either a feature length Charlie Chaplin movie or bland footage of weather information , and took samples of breast milk at regular intervals afterwards .
Two milk feeds later , he also measured their babies ’ allergic reactions to dust mites and latex .
Those infants whose mothers had laughed had markedly reduced reactions ( …
Using advanced brain imaging techniques , researchers at Georgetown University Medical Center have watched how humans use both lower and higher brain processes to learn novel tasks , an advance they say may help speed up the teaching of new skills as well as offer strategies to retrain people with perceptual deficits due to autism .
In the March 15 issue of Neuron , the research team provides the first human evidence for a two - stage model of how a person learns to place objects into categories discerning , for example , that a green apple , and not a green tennis ball , belongs to " food . "
They describe it as a complex interplay between neurons that process stimulus shape ( " bottom - up " ) and more sophisticated brain areas that discriminate between these shapes to categorize and " label " that information ( " top - down " ) .
A human can't function without the ability to sort between objects and organize them in fluid ways , said the study 's lead author , Maximilian Riesenhuber , Ph.D. , the principal investigator for the Laboratory for Computational Cognitive Neuroscience .
" We make sense of the world by learning to recognize objects as members of categories such as ' food , ' ' friend , ' or ' foe , ' but it has not been clear how the human brain does this , " he said .
The researchers theorized that a very simple yet efficient way of doing this kind of learning would be for the brain to first learn how objects vary in shape , and then , in a second stage , to learn which shapes go with which labels , allowing the brain to sort an object into different labeled " bins " when necessary .
For example , a green apple and a green tennis ball are both green and round , but only an apple can be eaten and only a green tennis ball belongs to a sport .
In this study , the research team asked human volunteers to undertake a series of tasks presented to them on a computer screen .
All of them involved cars that were generated with a computer graphics morphing system , allowing the researchers to generate thousands of cars with subtle shape differences .
" In the beginning , all the cars looked very similar to the participants because they did not have any experience with them , " said Riesenhuber .
" It 's like if a person had never seen faces before , they would all look similar at first .
"
In the first experiment , the participants looked at series of cars presented at different parts of the screen and performed simple position judgments on the images , while their brain activity was being measured using an advanced functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) technique that made it possible to more directly probe neuronal tuning than in previous studies .
Investigators found that cars activated a particular region in participants ' brains , the lateral occipital cortex , which had also been found by other studies to be important for object recognition .
Then the volunteers were given several hours of training using images of the cars .
In these sessions , participants had to learn how to group the cars into two distinct categories .
This was easy at first , Riesenhuber said , because the cars were obviously not alike , but then the researchers began to " tighten the screws " by making the two categories increasingly more similar .
" Over the course of the training , the participants got better at finer and finer category discriminations , " Riesenhuber said .
" This represents a crucial step in category learning where small differences in shape can have a big impact on category labels -- as in the tennis ball and apple example -- and where big differences in shape -- such as between an apple and a banana -- can have no impact on the label , such as when categorizing both as ' fruit ' .
" Now that the volunteers had learned how to categorize small shape changes , they were shown the cars from the first experiment while again being scanned , allowing the researchers to compare how training had enhanced the brain 's ability to process car shapes .
They found again that cars selectively activated an area in lateral occipital cortex , but that now neurons in that area appeared to be finely tuned to small car shape differences .
In a third scan , the investigators finally asked subjects to categorize the same car images shown in the other scans .
This time , two areas of the brain , the now familiar area in lateral occipital cortex as well as an area in lateral prefrontal cortex , were found to be active when processing the images .
" The lateral prefrontal cortex is known to be the center of cognitive control , " Riesenhuber said .
" That is where the brain connects physical input to an action or response , deciding what task to do and how to respond to a stimulus .
"
In essence , fMRI was showing that both the higher and lower brain regions had worked together to learn a task , he said .
These findings might be helpful in understanding disorders that involve differences in the interaction of bottom - up and top - down information in the brain , such as autism or schizophrenia , Riesenhuber said .
It also suggests how the learning of visual skills can be enhanced by directly monitoring neuronal activity .
" This could be useful , for instance , to speed up learning to detect targets in unfamiliar imaging modalities , such as baggage X rays or radar images , " he said .
The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health and a National Science Foundation CAREER award to Riesenhuber .
Co-authors include , from Georgetown University , first author Xiong Jiang , Ph.D. , Evan Bradley , B.S. , Regina Rini , B.A. , and John VanMeter , Ph.D. ; and Thomas Zeffiro , M.D. , Ph.D. , from Massachusetts General Hospital .

THE celebrity TV weatherman was pretty much invented in Los Angeles .
They have names like Dallas Raines and Johnny Mountain , and before them , the avuncular man in the bow tie known to millions simply as Dr. George .
Steve Martin mocked this culture in his movie “ L.A. Story , ” in which he plays a weatherman who tapes his forecasts in advance because , well , L.A. has no weather .
But although the TV news provides the overnight lows and five - day forecasts , the job of understanding the weather and making the long - term predictions falls to the meteorologists and climatologists who toil behind the scenes .
Many work for the federal government and universities .
They are generally a conservative bunch , quick with the caveat and the nuance -- knowing their forecasts can have huge and costly implications , including how farmers plant their crops and how government agencies calibrate water supplies .

Then there is Bill Patzert .
Over the last two decades , the climatologist at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge has emerged as perhaps the leading expert on weather in Southern California .
He was one of the scientists ahead of the curve on predicting the effects of a huge El Nino in 1998 and ever since has tilted with the windmills of meteorology convention .
Shortly after NASA ordered its scientists in 2004 not to comment on the global warming catastrophe movie “ The Day After Tomorrow , ” Patzert appeared on the CBS Evening News in a Hawaiian shirt .
“ Anyone who thinks the human race does not have a powerful impact on the environment and climate , ” Patzert said , “ definitely has their head in the sand . ”

To some meteorologists , Patzert has become just like one of those TV weathermen -- quick with the flashy quote .
But the 65 - year - old surfer has also gained a loyal following from those who say his forecasts for Southern California are simply the most accurate .
Over the last five years , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington predicted three times that increasing sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific -- the phenomenon known as El Nino -- would result in wetter - than - normal winters in Southern California .
Each time Patzert disagreed .
Much to the dismay of federal scientists , he started talking about “ fictional El Ninos , ” flaccid “ El Wimpos ” and disappointing “ El No Shows . ”
In July , NOAA predicted another global El Nino , expected to affect Southern California and the Southern states .
The 2006 - 07 season , it said , would be warm and rainier than average .

Patzert ’s forecast : Dry. Really dry .
And he was willing to stake his reputation on it .
WHY are there such enormous disparities between forecasts ?
One reason :
When it comes to El Nino , NOAA tends to emphasize data from a network of buoys running across the equatorial Pacific from Asia to the Americas .
They make measurements on the upper 500 meters in the ocean , where the major deviations in temperature take place .
The weather consequences can be dramatic depending on the size of the temperature increase , the area of ocean involved and the duration of the phenomenon .
For NOAA , an increase of about 1 degree Fahrenheit over three months in a defined area of the Pacific meets the threshold for El Nino .
Patzert , on the other hand , is an expert in analyzing satellite data .

The satellites measure the elevation of the sea surface as a result of the expansion of water as temperatures increase in the upper 500 meters .
The satellites are not as hyperfocused on El Nino and look beyond to other climate patterns .
One of those patterns is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation , a slow - moving variation of temperatures between the western and eastern sections of the Pacific .
In 1998 , the western Pacific was becoming warmer than the eastern Pacific , leading Patzert to conclude that in the long term , an “ El Nino - repellent ” pattern was forming that would favor drought in Southern California for many years .
The technologies each have strengths that complement each other , as well as blind spots , but perhaps the biggest wild card is how human beings interpret the data .
“ There ’s a competitive sense over who owns the big phenomenon , and who understands it , ” said James Baker , who headed NOAA from 1993 to 2001 .

Patzert has made Southern California his beat .
On Wednesday , he and two other researchers released a NASA - JPL study showing that California ’s temperature rose nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit in the last 50 years , largely because of urban growth .
His expertise in the region has won Patzert some loyal disciples , including Robert Krier , the San Diego Union - Tribune ’s Weather Watch columnist .
“ Patzert has been reliably closer to the actual total at the end of the season than [ NOAA ] , our local National Weather Service guys , a local meteorology professor and the Scripps guy , ” Krier said .
“ He was one of the few to go below normal on the rainfall prediction for this year .
The others were convinced El Nino would dominate . ”
Those who disagree with Patzert sometimes point out that he is not a meteorologist but an oceanographer .
But Patzert said that as far as El Nino was concerned , that was no disadvantage .

After all , El Nino is a child of the ocean .
And so is Patzert .
HIS father , Rudolph Patzert , was a commercial fisherman in Long Island , N.Y. , and after World War II , captained a gunboat that carried 1,380 Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine .
Even after the family moved to Gary , Ind. , the younger Patzert enjoyed trips on Lake Michigan .
Advertisement
After graduating from Purdue University , Patzert studied oceanography at the University of Hawaii , where he discovered surfing and found a mentor in Klaus Wyrtki , one of the pioneers of El Nino research .
Wyrtki said he remembered Patzert enthusiastically scuba diving to anchor transmitters in shark - infested waters .
“ He was always ready to do something and to go somewhere , ” Wyrtki said .
In 1974 , Patzert was a young scientist working under the direction of Wyrtki and other big - shot El Nino experts who predicted that an El Nino would arrive in the following year .
Advertisement
In the winter of 1975 , Patzert was the chief scientist working for UC San Diego ’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography aboard the Moana Wave , a research vessel , as it scoured the northern coast of South America to track El Nino .
That El Nino turned out to be a bust , and so did the forecast .
But Patzert continued to be obsessed with the weather pattern .
In 1983 , he left Scripps and went to work for NASA under the promise of a new era of satellite oceanography .
He worked in Washington , D.C. , for three years before moving back to Southern California .
Advertisement
In 1998 , a “ monster El Nino ” began to develop in the Pacific , and Patzert emerged as one of the most prominent scientists who explained it .
The scope of that El Nino played well to one of Patzert ’s strengths -- his ability to have fun with words .
One day he drove by a Burger King , so the next time he talked about the coming El Nino , Patzert called it “ a real whopper . ”
Then he called it “ El Nino Grande , ” a nod to a Taco Bell item .
El Nino became “ the real deal ” based on a McDonald ’s marketing campaign at the time .
But as January 1998 came to a close , and Southern California remained dry , some climatologists began to waver on El Nino , thinking it might be a bust .
Advertisement
That put Patzert on the defensive .
In late January , Robert Jones , then a columnist for The Times , visited Patzert at the JPL campus .
Patzert stared at the sky and excitedly pointed out tropical clouds .
“ He ’s a desperate man , of course , ” Jones wrote the next day .
Jones was sure Patzert would have egg on his face over El Nino , so he did not hesitate to accept the scientist ’s $ 10 bet .
Advertisement
“ Sure enough , it started raining , I think a week later , ” Jones said recently with a laugh .
In that February , more than 13 inches of rain poured down on L.A .
Jones made good on the bet , mailing Patzert a $ 10 bill , along with a note that read , “ Bill , why prolong the agony ?
I capitulate . ”
Patzert keeps a copy of the $ 10 bill and the note framed on his office bulletin board .
IT was n’t just reporters who started to call on Patzert .
He became a frequent speaker at schools , junior colleges , universities , rotary clubs and senior citizen groups .
Advertisement
Some scientists criticized him for talking to the media instead of waiting to publish his findings .
They whispered about him become a talking head -- someone who liked the sound of his own voice .
But others came to respect the fact that he marched to his own drum -- something that was becoming increasingly rare in the button - down , highly politicized world of climate and weather forecasting .
“ NOAA sees themselves as the official arbiters , so they ’re always conservative about what they say , ” Baker said .
“ There ’s a little bit of an art to the whole process .
It ’s an inexact science . ”
And nowhere is the science more inexact than when it comes to El Nino .
In 2002 , NOAA announced that El Nino was “ baaack ! ” Patzert shrugged it off , saying it was n’t much of an El Nino .
Locally , the result was a kind of a draw .
Southern California was wetter - than - average -- but only by an inch .
Two years later , when NOAA forecast a weak El Nino , L.A. experienced record rainfall , but it was from the Arctic and not related to El Nino .
( Patzert had predicted dry conditions . )
Advertisement
For Patzert , El Nino had become a convenient explanation for too many things going on in the world .
Patzert was n’t arguing that El Nino would have no effects , just that it was being overhyped .
In December , he projected that if El Nino was going to affect the U.S. , it would most likely be in the Gulf Coast and Florida -- which , in fact , turned out to have wetter weather than the other Southern states .
He quipped that El Nino was even being blamed for stupid things people did that turned out bad -- such as taking a trip down a roaring flood control channel on an inner tube .
“ Do n’t blame El Nino , ” Patzert said .
“ That was El Nincompoop . ”
Advertisement
This season , NOAA was back with an El Nino forecast .
As winter came , the government forecasters were looking like they might finally have it right .
The mild , spring - like temperatures that descended over much of the East Coast in the early winter -- giving rise to unseasonal daffodils in places like New York -- were attributed by some weather scientists , including some at NOAA , to El Nino , rather than to global warming or other climate patterns .
El Nino had struck as predicted in Australia , where drought is the result .
But Patzert shook his head .
To him , this was the season of “ La Nada . ”
The nothing .
Advertisement
In early January , more than 1,000 weather experts from the U.S. and around the world attended the American Meteorological Society conference in San Antonio .
Scientist after scientist rose to present evidence that El Nino was coming .
Louis Uccellini , director of NOAA ’s National Centers for Environmental Prediction in Camp Springs , Md. , declared : “ I think we ’re starting to see signs , signatures of El Nino . ”
But Patzert repeatedly described El Nino as “ El No Show , ” to the clear irritation of Robert Livezey , the head of NOAA ’s Climate Services Division .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t want to hear anything more about ‘ No Show ’ until the end of January or February , ” Livezey said .
“ If we do n’t see the impacts , then OK .
Let ’s make the noise .
Let ’s get the attention . ”
The conference ended with the debate over El Nino unresolved .
Then on Feb. 1 , NOAA put out a news release .
The agency said it had given up on El Nino having much of any impact in North America .
As of today , L.A. has experienced 2.47 inches of rain for the rain year , making it the driest on record so far .
Patzert said he knew from experience that forecasting could be difficult and perilous , but so was gloating .
“ There ’s nothing people enjoy more than a bad forecast .
Making fun of the weatherman is a classic .
Believe me , I ’ve been made fun of , ” he said .
“ In the end , Mother Nature knows a hell of a lot more than any of us . ”

EMERGENCE
PBS Airdate : July 10 , 2007
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON : Many people think that the laws of nature and the universe tell us that everything breaks down .
Things fall apart , energy wanes , living things grow old and die .
Yes , we have some good laws which explain all that , but what about the emergence of life ?
What about the complexity of life ?
Where do they come from ?
Are these rare , miraculous developments ?
Or is this kind of complexity inevitable , following natural laws we just have n't quite figured out yet ?
Correspondent Carla
Wohl went looking for the answer .
CARLA WOHL ( Correspondent ) :
It is mysterious how a flock of birds or a school of fish move as one , with such grace and coordination , as if there 's one brain behind them all or an invisible force at play .
An explanation may be found in emergence , a science that tries to explain complex patterns and behavior that arise in the world around us .
Some believe emergence may reveal more than just how birds and fish do this , but how we think and how life itself began in the first place .
But while many of science 's mysteries long have been explained — gravity , we predict with Newton 's laws of gravity , and magnetism , through Maxwell 's laws — but things like this remain largely unpredictable .
JOHN HOLLAND : Emergence , when you first see it , seems mysterious .
But then , if I go back and read the papers at the time of Maxwell , electromagnetism seemed very mysterious , too .
CARLA WOHL : Let 's start with what we do know about emergence .
It 's an order we might not expect to see .
Usually where there is order , there is a leader — a conductor of an orchestra or a general with his army — orders come from the top , and they go down .
JOHN HOLLAND : Yeah , and they go down .
KEITH STILL ( Crowd Dynamics Limited ) :
Top - down order , where you have one brain controlling the functions of the entire group .
CARLA WOHL : A leader at the top and many who follow down below : it 's just how we expect things to be .
So who 's in charge here ?
Him ?
No .
Him ?
Unh uh .
JOHN HOLLAND : There 's no conductor ; there 's no general .
ROBERT HAZEN : There 's no leader .
There 's no director that 's telling every fish where to go .
CARLA WOHL : Well , then what about these birds ?
KEITH STILL : There 's no one in charge of the birds either .
CARLA WOHL :
So if the order is n't coming from the top down , where is it coming from ?
JOHN HOLLAND : The organization comes from the bottom up .
So , at the bottom , we have these things that are following their own sets of rules , often fairly simple .
One is to go in the same direction as the other guys .
Another is " Do n't get too close , but do n't get too far from my neighbors . "
CARLA WOHL :
And perhaps the most important rule : if someone 's coming after you , get out of the way .
From these simple rules , very complex patterns can spontaneously emerge .
JOHN HOLLAND : What we see is a pattern emerging from the bottom up .
CARLA WOHL :
And so it came to be called " emergent complexity " or simply , " emergence . "
Of course , different creatures have different rules , but whether ants or wildebeests or this slime mold ...
JOHN HOLLAND :
The behavior emerges from the actions that are controlled by the rules , and behavior of the whole is more than the sum of the parts .
And that 's the flag for emergence .
CARLA WOHL :
And you might not have noticed it , but it 's not just seen in animals .
KEITH STILL : Similarly , with crowds ; there are no leaders within certain types of crowds .
CARLA WOHL : Crowds of people ?
We do it just like the birds and fish ?
KEITH STILL : Movement is happening at a very much subconscious level .
You do n't think about how to walk , you just do it .
CARLA WOHL : Keith Still studies the emergent complexity in crowds .
He says these people crossing the street have no idea they 're part of a larger pattern .
KEITH STILL : As if they 're following each other in long conga lines , what happens is that the first individual that finds a gap is being followed by those people that find it easier to follow something that 's moving in roughly the right direction than it is to carve their own path through the crowd .
CARLA WOHL :
So emergence happens with all kinds of living things that move in groups .
KEITH STILL :
It can be a crowd , it can be a flock of birds , a school of fish .
These are all emergent phenomena , when you 're getting a large - scale order out of a small - scale interaction .
CARLA WOHL : But emergent complexity can be found in non-living things as well .
JOHN HOLLAND : Anything I know that exhibits emergence , involves , a lot of , we might call them agents , a lot of individuals or parts .
We could call them parts .
CARLA WOHL : John Holland 's first experience with emergence came from some fairly unsophisticated electronic parts that came together to create something almost intelligent .
And he saw it a half century ago with a game of checkers .
You used to look at this as child 's play , right ?
JOHN HOLLAND : Yes , I did .
CARLA WOHL : I believe it 's your move , too , by the way .
JOHN HOLLAND : Oh , all right .
CARLA WOHL : What changed your mind ?
JOHN HOLLAND : What changed my mind was my encounter at IBM — this was in the early ' 50 s — I was busy at that time simulating neural networks .
CARLA WOHL : Meanwhile , a coworker , Arthur Samuel , was doing something else .
JOHN HOLLAND : He programmed the machine to play checkers .
And I thought , " Well , what he 's doing is interesting , but that is n't anywhere near as deep as simulating neurons . "
CARLA WOHL : It 's checkers , right ?
JOHN HOLLAND : Yeah , it 's checkers .
CARLA WOHL : As it turned out Samuel had achieved something far deeper than anyone at IBM expected .
JOHN HOLLAND : He programmed the rules , and the machine would move according to the rules .
CARLA WOHL : Not only was the computer following the basic rules of checkers , it had another set of rules as well , a strategy to favor moves that might lead to victory .
JOHN HOLLAND : Simply by its experience with him and other players , it favored better moves than he did .
That machine learned well enough that it could actually beat Samuel himself .
With this learning I have emergence .
CARLA WOHL :
It was emergent because when the computer followed simple rules , something as unpredictable and complex as learning emerged , something — until then — only living things could do .
Fifty years later , computers really do n't seem to have come all that far .
( Film clip from 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) : Good evening , Dave .
How you doing , Hal ?
CARLA WOHL : 2001 has come and gone .
( Film clip from 2001 : A Space Odyssey ) : I 've wondered whether you might be having some second thoughts about the mission .
CARLA WOHL : Computers were supposed to be having conversations with us , thinking for themselves .
So why can't they ?
Holland says that 's because there 's another important factor in emergence to consider : complexity depends on how connected the parts are to each other .
JOHN HOLLAND : Compare the central nervous system , our brain , to a computer .
There 's a major difference .
Each element in a computer , each transistor , contacts , at most , 10 other elements , but in the human brain each individual neuron contacts 10,000 other neurons .
CARLA WOHL :
So the sheer number of neurons in our brain , as well as the number of connections between them , is what makes our brain so much more complex than a computer .
JOHN HOLLAND : I 've got billions of neurons and each one touching 10,000 others , so we get the emergence and , maybe — some of us believe that — consciousness is one of the emergent phenomena here .
CARLA WOHL : Consciousness ?
Could something so complex spontaneously emerge from individual parts following simple rules ?
It may seem counter - intuitive .
Many of us think that without a leader or a plan , things become more disordered with time .
ROBERT HAZEN : Our intuition about the world is that things deteriorate , we get old , we die .
CARLA WOHL : Buildings crumble , we expect decay .
ROBERT HAZEN : This is the increase that 's inevitable in the universe of disorder .
CARLA WOHL : But if order can emerge from disorder , could we actually expect to see something as complex as life itself emerge ?
ROBERT HAZEN : Many of us believe that life follows inevitably as another emergent complex phenomenon .
CARLA WOHL : Bob Hazen , an astrobiologist with the Carnegie Institution is trying to find out if life on Earth emerged from simple molecules arranging themselves into something living .
Hazen hypothesizes that the right molecules , under the right conditions will do this , form increasingly more complex structures , and those complex structures will form even more complex structures and so on , until finally you get life .
To start he needed a simple molecule .
He chose pyruvic acid .
ROBERT HAZEN : Pyruvic acid is a good proxy for the kind of simple molecule that would have been abundant on the early Earth .
It 's colorless , it 's basically odorless .
You load it into a gold tube — it 's like threading a needle — you then seal this up .
CARLA WOHL : Hazen is trying to reproduce the energy of the heat and pressure deep within the Earth .
ROBERT HAZEN : Typical conditions that might occur in volcanic zones on the floor of the ocean .
Seal this up .
CARLA WOHL : He pressurizes and heats the capsules to 250 degrees centigrade .
ROBERT HAZEN : Just like a pressure cooker .
Emergent complexity takes place in any environment where you have lots of agents coming together , molecules coming together , and energy .
CARLA WOHL : And in a week 's time he 's re-created the heat and pressure .
The one thing missing is water .
ROBERT HAZEN : That 's the magic trick .
Put it in water , and bingo !
Those molecules self - organize into an enclosure — cell - like structures called vesicles , a structure which is essential for life .
CARLA WOHL : So here the agents are molecules .
The rules are the rules of chemistry .
What emerges is one step closer to something biological , an important first step towards life .
ROBERT HAZEN : And the origin of life must have been a sequence of emergent steps from simplicity to complexity .
You go from the simplicity of volcanic gases like carbon dioxide and water to organic molecules .
CARLA WOHL : Still , a vesicle needs to capture energy and nutrients to grow , replicate and divide , before it can truly be a living thing .
And whether these steps are emergent is , for Bob Hazen , the great mystery to be solved .
ROBERT HAZEN :
This whole concept of emergent complexity gives us a whole new way of thinking about the universe , going from the simplicity of the earliest universe to the complexity of the modern , living world .
JOHN HOLLAND : Even Hawking says complexity is the study of the 21st century .
Maybe in 20 years it 'll be the standard science , for all I know .
ROBERT HAZEN : Scientists would love to quantify emergent complexity .
We 'd love to be able to have a formula that told us what systems become complex , how complex they become .
JOHN HOLLAND : My guess is that we will find some laws that will let us describe some things in these complex adaptive systems , patterns that we can recognize and maybe even make predictions about .
And that 's the great advantage of Newton , of Maxwell .
And maybe someday we 'll get our own Maxwell .
With their immaculate dinner - suit plumage , smiley beaks and cute waddling gait , penguins are some of the most unusual and endearing members of the bird kingdom .
A new fossil find , however , has revealed that one of their ancestors was a far more fearsome beast .
The fossil , which was discovered in Peru and is described today in detail by scientists reveals a creature that was over 1.5 metres tall and weighed as much as a person .
The 36 million year old tropical bird 's intimidating appearance was topped off with powerful forearms , a chunky neck and a potentially vicious 18 centimetre long spear - like beak .
The discovery of the giant penguin is also shaking up scientists ' understanding of penguin evolution .
The finds indicate that penguins made the journey to equatorial regions much earlier in their evolutionary history than researchers had realised .
And because the penguins lived during a period when the Earth was experiencing a ' greenhouse ' climate the pair of species are challenging what researchers thought they knew about how species adapt to hotter temperatures .
" It 's a monster , " said Julia Clarke at North Carolina State University who described the fossils with her team in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today .
The two main finds are remarkably complete and well preserved .
" The bone preservation is extremely good , " she said , " We have so few relatively complete penguins from that period of penguin evolution . "
The detail is so good that the researchers were able to see fine patterning on the beak of the giant penguin left by a sheet of keratin - the material that makes up feathers .
The giant species has been christened Icadyptes salasi , while Perudyptes devriesi , was around half as big .
If it were alive today , Icadyptes would tower over the largest penguins in the planet - the emperors .
Familiar to fans of natural history documentaries , their epic migration across the Antarctic wilderness to bring food to their chicks was celebrated in the film March of the Penguins .
But even these modern day giants were only around half as big as their prehistoric ancestor .
The team do not have any direct evidence for the penguins ' diet , but the wings of both birds are adapted for swimming and both were found in sediments laid down just off shore .
Icadyptes ' elongated beak would have been capable of snaring large fish , but its shape is so unusual , the team believe it used a previously unknown technique for catching prey .
" It is distinct from anything we have in living penguins , " said Prof Clarke .
Attachment points for neck muscles are also very large suggesting that it had a powerful neck , perhaps for spearing prey .
The discovery goes against the general rule that as climatic conditions get warmer , species tend to evolve a smaller body size .
The theory is that large size is useful in the cold because it reduces the ratio of surface area to volume , making it easier to conserve heat .
But Icadyptes was found in a region that resembled the modern day Atacam desert at a time when the Earth was experiencing an extremely warm period in its history .
The researchers speculate that there may have been an increase in ocean upwelling at the time around what is now the Peruvian coast .
This would have fertilised the food chain leading to an abundance of fish and so easy pickings for the mammoth birds .
The find also contradicts the idea that penguins did not reach equatorial regions until between 4 and 8 million years ago , well after a cooling period had set in that began to swell the ice caps at the poles .
Today , only one species - the Humboldt penguin - is found on the coast of Peru .
The team are keen to point out that although these species were adapted to a tropical lifestyle , it does not mean that current penguin species will be able to adapt quickly to rising temperatures associated with man-made climate change .
" Current global warming is occurring on a significantly shorter timescale .
The data from these new fossil species cannot be used to argue that warming would n't negatively impact living penguins , " said Prof Clarke .
The Icadyptes fossil is the most complete of any giant penguin yet discovered .
But it may be smaller than the largest giant known .
Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi or Nordenskjoeld 's Giant Penguin , which is thought to have lived up to six million years ago , could be up to 2 metres high and weighed in at nearly 100 kilogrammes .
It is known from fossils on Seymour Island off Antarctica and New Zealand .
The Peruvian monster penguin and its older cousin were discovered in the Ullujaya Valley and Quebrada Perdida respectively .
Both locations are in the Ica Department of Peru .
Back in the days of the Cold War , spies found ingenious and unusual ways to communicate with each other , hiding their communications in plain sight , whether encrypted or not .
For instance , an intelligence agent ( spy ) might contact his case officer ( handler ) by placing an ad in the personals section of the local newspaper .
This practice , it seems , continues today .
On or around May 8 , the following personal ad appeared on the Internet classified ad site Craigslist .
( It has since been removed . )
For mein fraulein Mein Fraulein , I have n’t heard from you in a while .
Wo n’t you

212 //// 796 //// 0735
If you actually called the number , up until a couple of days ago you would have heard this prerecorded message ( MP3 ) .
It ’s a head scratcher to keep you National Security Agency analysts occupied in your spare time .

You used to hear broadcasts not unlike this on shortwave radio all the time , stations which broadcast nothing but numbers all day .
Nobody has yet come forward with an answer as to what exactly these stations were broadcasting , or to whom , or what was the point of the messages .
If anyone does know , they likely can’t say because it ’s classified information .
On or around May 12 , Craigslist pulled the ad , but the number remained up and running , and someone tipped off our friends at 2600 Magazine .
Its editor Emmanuel Goldstein mentioned the number on the May 24 episode ( MP3 ) of the WBAI radio show Off The Hook .
After that , it was flooded with calls from aspiring phone phreaks and other curiosity seekers , and that ’s when some more of the details behind the number began coming out , through brute force , as it were .
The number is a VoIP setup from a small provider yet to be identified , but the wholesaler is a company called RNK Telecom .
The account was prepaid , and the flood of calls after the radio show quickly depleted the account balance ; callers over Memorial Day weekend would have heard a message ( MP3 ) saying your account balance was too low .
Now the number gives nothing but a busy signal .
Many questions remain , of course , now that the number seems to be no longer functioning .
Who put the ad on Craigslist ?
What is the encrypted message ?
Is this all some sort of elaborate prank ?
Or could it be a viral marketing scheme of some type ?
The question which most interests me , though , is what does the message mean ?
The Craigslist posting is typical of how intelligence agents might communicate in hostile countries where they are actively trying to evade the country ’s intelligence services .
The message at that phone number , though , seems like an easier avenue of attack for this particular problem , at least right now .
The first thing I notice is that it contains an unusually high number of zeros .
And that ’s just about where my cryptanalytic skills end .
Anybody else want to take a crack at it ?
Update : Ryan Singel ( of Wired ) thinks it ’s just two young cryptanalysts in love , “ sending love notes and taunting Mossad , the NSA and the phone phreakers at the same time . ’
He also points to some links indicating those shortwave numbers stations are still around .
Go take a listen .
Update :
There is now a second phone numbers station message for you to puzzle over , too .
Update :
And now there ’s a third phone numbers station as well .

Confessions of an I.R.S. Auditee
Last April , we wrote a column about tax cheating .
It included a passage about the I.R.S. ’s National Research Program , “ a three - year study during which 46,000 randomly selected 2001 tax returns were intensively reviewed . ”
The goal was to determine some of the specifics of tax cheating : what kind of incentives work and do n’t work , what kind of people are more likely to cheat and how , etc .
“ The I.R.S. does n’t specify what these 46,000 people were subjected to , ” we wrote , “ but it may well have been the kind of inquisition that has earned the agency its horrid reputation . ”
The other day , we received an e-mail from a reader who was among the subjects of the National Research Program .
Although she wants to remain anonymous , she is willing to share her experience .
I wish I could at least name her accountant ; he sounds worth hiring :
I was one of the “ lucky ” 46,000 participants , and I wanted to tell you I “ won . ”
They did ask VERY probing questions , and it was a much more in - depth audit than I guess regular audits usually are .
My accountant was very helpful and took it as personal challenge , thankfully charging me very little of what he could of , considering the hours and hours we both put in to contest it .
I work in the entertainment industry “ below the line ” as a costume and prop builder .
2001 was a slow year due to an impending strike that never went through , and I only made $ 21,000 that year ( less than 1 / 2 of what I usually make ) and larger than usual percentage of that was 1099 income .
I keep meticulous records , and claim everything , down to a $ 15 pants alteration .
We held all meetings at the accountant ’s office , and the binder the IRS guy had on me was enormous .
And he would n’t let us look at it .
He asked me over and over about where I keep my cash in the house , rephrasing it like a lawyer or a cop , and I kept telling him how I keep no cash in my house other than loose change .
That question must have come up 6 or 7 times .
They went through all of my bank statements line by line for the entire year , making me justify every single deposit , which I did , including a $ 30 birthday check from an elderly aunt .
After everything was said and done , we found that I was probably OWED another $ 450 back from the IRS that year , and by that point I was so mad I wanted to fight for it .
My accountant wisely counseled me to just let it go , and call it even .
I paid the IRS nothing .
I paid my accountant a couple hundred dollars , which was then deductible the next year .
He probably could have charged me $ 1500 at least , and we used his offices as home base for weeks .
He now has a loyal client for life .
It was a pretty shitty July , but it was one of those experiences that helps put the rough times in life in perspective .
One thing that never gets old is when someone visits me and asks to check some email on my computer .
I always smile and gracefully hand over the keyboard and watch as nothing but gibberish pours onto the screen .
This totally freaked out Jeff Atwood ( ok , freak may be too strong a word , but allow me some dramatic license ) as he watched in disbelief as I demonstrated my ability to tap on all the wrong keys , but see the right words show up on the screen .
It ’s my dirty little secret — I type in Dvorak .
What keeps it interesting is that I type on a physical QWERTY keyboard , but use the Dvorak keyboard layout by switching my Input Language setting within the Regional and Language Control Panel applet .
This explains why it looks like I tap the wrong keys if you watch me type .
I switched to Dvorak over five years ago as one of several desperate measures I took to attempt to reduce the pain of coding .
As I wrote recently , your fingers travel roughly 16 miles in an average eight - hour workday .
At the time , I believed the prevailing idea that the QWERTY layout was specifically designed to reduce coding speed because typewriters used to jam if people typed too quickly .
As the Freakonomics blog points out , there ’s a continuing dispute on whether or not this is urban legend or in fact true .
The theory behind Dvorak is that the keys are supposed to be arranged in such a way that letters that occur with higher frequency in the English language are on the home row and under stronger fingers .
For example , the letter e is under the left middle finger .
The goal is that your fingers would travel less during the course of typing , ideally reducing occurrences of repetitive stress injury , while also increasing typing speed and comfort .
Does it succeed ?
Hard to say .
Personally , I think there ’s a law of unintended consequences at work here .
If you can type faster with this layout , and you still work 8 hours a day , does n’t that mean that your fingers might end up traveling just as much ?
At the very least it does mean your fingers pound on more keys during the day .
So if your keyboard does n’t have a light touch , it could end up being more painful .
I use the GoldTouch keyboard which I find to have a light touch , but not too light .
In the end , what probably helped more than switching to Dvorak was that I started taking more breaks to stretch .
Typing less is a sure way to reduce the stress of typing .
While learning Dvorak , I had to try and totally give into it , which meant my productivity dived for a short while .
Fortunately , it was a slow time at work and only took me a couple of weeks to get up to a decent speed .
Since typing is all about muscle memory , one thing I experimented with was trying to type in QWERTY on Macs , and Dvorak on Windows .
I wondered if it would be possible for me to associate QWERTY with the Mac and retain my ability to type in QWERTY when on a Mac .
That did n’t work .
Well , it kinda worked .
I can still touch type QWERTY , but at about 60 % of my former speed .
Imagine that you 're the guy who has to deliver the bad news .
You straighten your tie , clear your throat , and jangle your keys as you step into your boss 's office .
She does not look like an executive who has gone to the sorts of conferences where managers are reminded not to shoot the messenger .
It is , in fact , quite possible to imagine her stashing a Glock just out of sight in a desk drawer .
Come to think of it , it 's been months since you 've seen Jenkins , the last guy to deliver bad news .
" Boss , " you begin , " about that $ 18 billion we just spent ?
Well , turns out it was n't strictly necessary ... "
It 's a conversation that could be playing out at telcos like Verizon in the next few years if a new consortium of hardware vendors and phone companies has its way .
The group is led by ECI Telecom and includes members like Spanish telephone giant Telefonica , but it 's based in Israel and funded in part with a grant from the Israeli government .
The group 's goal is audacious : achieve fiber optic speeds over copper wire .
If they succeed , Verizon 's $ 18 billion decision to run fiber all the way into consumers ' homes might be a costly one for them and other companies around the world that have jumped on the fiber optic bandwagon .
The group hopes that the answer will be found in the use of Dynamic Spectrum Management ( DSM ) to boost DSL speeds .
" The main obstacle for the advancement of DSL technology is the interference ( " crosstalk " ) generated from different DSL lines that share the same telephone cable binder , " said Professor John Cioffi , Professor of Engineering at Stanford University , a pioneer of DSM research .
" DSM is a promising technology for the future evolution of broadband access networks using existing copper infrastructure . "
To avoid interference , current DSL implementations use static spectrum management that is built for a " worst - case " scenario .
Most actual phone lines would allow for far better performance , and DSM technology will allow each DSL connection to be regulated in real time by the hardware based on measured crosstalk and on current data needs of each customer .
The end result could be DSL connections that top out at 100 M bps or more .
More bandwidth than fiber ?
One of Dr. Cioffi's presentations of DSM contains a slide that argues that copper actually has more available bandwidth than fiber ; it just needs to be better used .
He points out that a bundle of 50 Cat 3 twisted - pair wires ( the kind that might be used in the last segment of the phone network ) has 10 Gbps of available bandwidth to distribute to the fifty homes at the end of those wires .
By contrast , fiber to the home has only 2.5 Gbps to distribute to its homes .
" DSM is the next step in the evolution of telco 's access infrastructure .
It will allow telcos to provide high - bandwidth services cost - effectively by leveraging FTTC ( fiber - to - the - curb ) topologies rather than replacing all copper wires with fiber - optics until the subscriber premises ( fiber - to - the - home ) , " said Zvika Weinshtock , VP of Marketing for ECI ?s Broadband Access Division .
It 's not hard to see why this technology would interest telcos .
Many have moved slowly on FTTH deployments over cost concerns .
Others , like Qwest , have decided to remain on the sidelines .
DSM , should it provide good real - world results , could keep the existing copper infrastructure competitive for many more years , and could give DSL users massive speed boosts , something welcome to power users who might cast a lustful eye on faster FiOS or cable modem connections .
While Verizon has made a big bet on FTTH , do n't call the money wasted just yet .
The commercialization of DSM is just beginning , and real - world results may never jibe with laboratory experiments .
For the forseeable future , FTTH still offers the fastest available speeds .
April 26 , 2006  --
Hundreds of soldiers wounded in battle in Iraq have found themselves fighting off bill collectors on the home front , according to a report to be released tomorrow .
The draft report by the Government Accountability Office , which ABC News obtained , said that hundreds of wounded soldiers had military debts incurred through no fault of their own turned over to collection agencies .
" Financial friendly fire , " said Rep. Tom Davis , R - Va. , chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform .
" Because their financial records are so bad , this is a friendly fire where we are hurting and wounding our own . "
Army specialist Tyson Johnson of Mobile , Ala. , had just been promoted in a field ceremony in Iraq when a mortar round exploded outside his tent , almost killing him .
" It took my kidney , my left kidney , shrapnel came in through my head , back of my head , " he recounted .
His injuries forced him out of the military , and the Army demanded he repay an enlistment bonus of $ 2,700 because he'd only served two - thirds of his three - year tour .
When he could n't pay , Johnson 's account was turned over to bill collectors .
He ended up living out of his car when the Army reported him to credit agencies as having bad debts , making it impossible for him to rent an apartment .
" Oh , man , I felt betrayed , " Johnson said .
" I felt like , oh , my heart dropped . "
Payroll Errors , Says Military
And there are many more like Johnson .
Staff Sgt. Ryan Kelly lost his leg in a roadside bomb attack in Iraq .
He did n't realize it , but the Army continued to mistakenly pay him combat bonus pay , about $ 2,000 , while he was in the hospital rehabilitating , and then demanded that he pay it back .
He , too , was threatened by the Army with debt collectors and a negative credit report .
" By law , he 's not entitled to the money , so he must pay it back , " said Col. Richard Shrank , the commander of the United States Army Finance Command .
The Army said it moved wounded soldiers out of the battlefield so quickly its accounting office could not keep up , resulting in numerous payroll errors .
" This is no way to win a war , I can tell you that , " said Davis .
" You 'd think after four years after fighting a war in Iraq , the government would have its act together . "
But the Army said it is now trying to correct the problem .
Since ABC
News first reported on the plight of soldiers , featuring Johnson and Kelly in a " Primetime " investigation in October 2004 , the Army has forgiven most of their debts .
But Davis said there may be thousands more whose thanks for putting their lives on the line has been a knock on the door from a Pentagon debt collector .
ABC News ' Maddy Sauer contributed to this report .
Immigration memo intended for Rove arrives on Democrat 's fax
Larisa Alexandrovna
An immigration memo intended for embattled White House advisor Karl Rove arrived instead on the fax machine of a Democratic congressman , RAW STORY can reveal .
The congressman who received the fax opted not to comment , and asked that his name not be used .
The focus of Smith 's memo , addressed to " Hon. Karl Rove , " is on immigration politics .

" Immigration needs to be considered in the context of : ( 1 ) . Media Bias , ( 2 ) .
Animosity toward the president and ( 3 ) the feelings of the Republican base , " Smith 's memo states .
Smith is a member of the Subcommittee on Immigration , Border Security , and Claims as well as the Subcommittee on Economic Security , Infrastructure Protection , and Cybersecurity .
No issues regarding the legislative jurisdiction of these committees are mentioned .
Smith goes on to suggest that " Liberals can easily and accurately be painted as opposing enforcement . "
His office did not return a call seeking comment .
The document , verified by RAW STORY and traced to Smith 's fax machine telephone line , follows .

Originally published on Monday September 19 , 2005 .
Brouwenstijn 's now crumbling wallet is one of hundreds stored in brown envelopes marked " effects " at the Red Cross International Tracing Service ( ITS ) in Bad Arolsen , central Germany .
Other envelopes contain everyday objects such as a bronze powder press , whose pale pink contents briefly cloud the air when opened , a tiny lipstick embossed with the words " kiss proof " , and a white rosary .
These trinkets and bits of paper are , in thousands of cases , the only remnants of lives that ended , as Brouwenstijn 's did , at the hands of the Nazis , the envelopes protecting their memories .
Before the end of this year , the fragmented stories of 17.5 million individuals held in concentration and slave labour camps during the second world war are due to be revealed to historians and academics for the first time .
For decades the ITS - founded in 1943 to search for " displaced persons " - has restricted access to the largest collection of Nazi death camp records to survivors .
Even so , many of their requests for information have taken years to be answered .
But last year the 11 - country committee that controls the ITS voted to open up the records .
Now the committee has set procedures in motion to open the files before the end of this year , once a ratification process has been completed .
In preparation , all the archive 's 50 m documents are in the process of being digitised and indexed for electronic use by the ITS 's 330 workers , in what will amount to 7,000 gigabytes of data .
This week the Guardian was given access to the vast storehouse , with contents stretching across 16 miles of shelving .
The archivists say it is unlikely that the Bad Arolsen collection will throw any new light on the Holocaust .
But studying even a fraction of the mass of information , recorded meticulously by Nazi bureaucrats - and sometimes prisoners - with the aid of typewriters , pencils or ink , on everything from the mundane to the extraordinary , allows a vivid picture to emerge of a vast number of lost lives .
Punishments
In one file randomly plucked from a shelf , there is a report by a doctor from Ljubljana held at Dachau describing a regular punishment inflicted on prisoners by their SS guards .
" They tied their hands behind their backs and suspended them from the branches of the trees by their wrists so that their feet were off the ground , " he wrote .
" This procedure would usually take place around 11 am so that every prisoner had a chance to see the men hanging when they went to the mess . "
A file on Melk , a sub-camp of Mauthausen in Austria , contains a sketch by a Swiss dentist showing where he buried the personal possessions of deceased prisoners for safekeeping .
Among the more famous of the documents is " Schindler 's List " , which details the identities of the more than 1,000 men and women saved by industrialist Oskar Schindler , including glaziers , doctors , engineers , and seamstresses .
" Annelies Maria Sara Frank " - how the Nazis listed the young diarist Anne Frank - leaps off the page of the alphabetical list No 40 of deportations to Westerbork .
Her final destination is left blank - as is known , she perished in Bergen - Belsen .
It is an archive with many tales to tell .
One of the most shocking is a neat handwritten report within the pages of a frayed ledger from Mauthausen which describes how on the orders of the Reich security department in Berlin , 300 people were shot in the neck between 11.20 am and 12.54 pm on April 20 1942 , as a present for Hitler on his 53rd birthday .
All 300 names are listed .
Records for the camp Gross - Rosen in Poland , about which few documents exist , detail head lice controls , including prisoner numbers and the precise number of lice they had .
These records have provided some survivors with their only piece of written evidence that they were in a camp at all , evidence which has proved vital in several compensation claims .
Records for Buchenwald give a glimpse into the bizarre day - to - day workings of the camps .
A so - called " manpower report " reveals that seven hairdressers and 252 tailors were at work in the camp on January 8 1940 .
There are also detailed reports of the Death Marches - the Nazi attempts to move prisoners from camps to the German heartland at the end of the war - pieced together from eyewitness accounts , detailing how many perished along the way .
The German government has been accused by critics , including Holocaust survivor groups , of refusing to open up Bad Arolsen due to fears that any move to make the information more widely available outside Germany would result in it facing further compensation claims , adding to the £ 42bn it has already paid to victims of the Nazi regime .
Paul Shapiro , director of the Centre for Advanced Holocaust Studies at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , went so far as to say that " preventing researchers from having access to the Holocaust documents is in itself a form of Holocaust denial " .
Last generation
Others say it is urgent that the archive is opened because the last generation of Holocaust survivors are now in their twilight years , and not least because the Holocaust has become so institutionalised .
But the ITS , which last year received 200,000 requests for information , insists that the reluctance is due to concern about data protection , and that it is only abiding by German law .
This German propensity to do things by the book is also used to explain the fact that while it is described as a confidential service to trace missing people , rather than an archive , Bad Arolsen 's information remains out of bounds .
There are also concerns about protecting individuals .
" There are cases in our files of priests accused of paedophilia , and whether true or not you would not want a family stumbling across such information , " said ITS 's spokeswoman , Maria Raabe .
Some files detail cases of hereditary and sexually transmitted diseases , which might be considered sensitive information .
" And there are cases where people just do n't want to be found - who deliberately disappeared after the war , or who do n't want to be traced by an illegitimate child they gave birth to or fathered , " she said .
" We have a duty to protect their identities . "
The technology has created what some call an addiction .
Others are more cautious , describing it as a compulsion .
Whatever the label , internet pornography is becoming yet another outlet for those with pre-existing compulsive personalities while for others , it has made it easier to do the things that a former head of the American Academy for Matrimonial Lawyers , J.Lindsey Short , says " traditionally lead to divorce " .
An increasing number of men appear to be hooked , and the women in their lives are flailing about in unhappiness , self - doubt and self - blame .
Michael Flood , a research fellow in gender studies at La Trobe University and co-author of the 2003 report Youth and Pornography in Australia , says : " This is not about couples going to the porn store to spice up their sex lives .
Men in growing numbers are using porn in ways that are secret , shameful and damaging .
It is having a damaging impact on intimacy and sexuality . "
It is difficult to determine the scale of the problem .
A survey of more than 9000 American internet users by the psychologist Alvin Cooper and colleagues in 2000 found about 9 per cent were addicted - those who spent more than 11 hours a week looking at porn .
A 1998 survey of internet users by David Greenfield , founder of the Centre for Internet Studies , found almost 6 per cent met the criteria for compulsive use , with porn sites and chat rooms being most seductive .
The godfather of US sex addiction research , Patrick Carnes , the author of In the Shadows of the Net : Breaking Free of Compulsive Online Sexual Behaviour , claims 3 to 6 per cent of people are sex addicts .
An Australian survey of about 1000 porn consumers by Alan McKee of the Queensland University of Technology and colleagues found 0.4 per cent said they had an addiction .
But all online surveys are flawed : they are not based on representative population samples , depend on self - selected participants and lack control groups .
What seems undeniable is that a subset of people spends so much time porn gazing online that they are damaging their relationships .
The Herald has waded into unchartered waters to chronicle the impact of the compulsive use of internet pornography on relationships .
Psychologists , relationship counsellors and men were among those interviewed .
But it was the long and candid interviews with women aged 25 to 50 whose partners were obsessed with pornography that proved most illuminating .
The problems may be confined to a minority , but it was surprisingly easy to find women whose lives had been turned upside down by their partner 's online activities .
The same themes emerged over and over .
The men spent hours online , searching for progressively more hard core images .
Family time or couple time was the first casualty .
Then sex lives floundered and withered away as men lost interest .
Men became , in the words of Dr Margaret Redelman , the president of the Australian Society of Sex Educators , Researchers and Therapists , " lazy lovers " .
In the end they could not be bothered with real - life sex .
In other cases , sex lives became porn - like , male - focused , extreme and lacking in intimacy .
Women 's self - esteem nose - dived .
They felt they could not compete with the nymphs on screen .
They did not measure up to the bodies or sexual performance of the women their men were watching .
Connie , a 50 - year - old graphics designer , whose former partner looked at pornography constantly , says : " After a while I started to feel worthless . "
Karen 44 , whose eight - year marriage broke up over her husband 's porn obsession , agonised over " why he preferred that to me " .
A well - conducted British survey based on a representative sample of partners of regular porn users shows these feelings are widespread .
Most partners are largely neutral about their men's regular pornography use , the survey , published in the Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy in 2003 , shows .
But a significant minority - about one - third of the women - found it highly distressing .
About 32 per cent said their partner 's porn use had adversely affected their sex life , 39 per cent said it had negatively affected their relationship , 34 per cent had lessened self - esteem , 41 per cent felt less attractive and desirable since having discovered their partner 's use , and 42 per cent said it made them feel insecure .
More than one - quarter viewed it as a kind of affair .
The Australian women interviewed felt betrayed and inadequate .
And always they were under pressure not to appear controlling , uptight or unreasonable .
Men 's consumption of pornography is natural , many believed , and to judge it as anything but positive is to risk being labelled a prude , or worse , a nag .
Within a few weeks of falling in love , 29 - year - old Gracie was virtually living with her boyfriend in his Bondi flat and sharing his computer .
These days sharing a computer with a lover can be more toxic than sharing a toothbrush .
And so it turned out for Gracie .
Like all the women interviewed for this article , Gracie , a human resources manager , insists she is no prude .
She is a willing sexual explorer .
But even she was surprised at what her 33 - year - old boyfriend , a builder , stored under his " favourites " file .
" There must have been 20 porn sites there .
I was pretty shocked - not that they were there , only that there were so many , " she says .
" Whenever I put anything into the search field , there would generally be a site related to porn come up .
So if I typed in a word starting with 'l ' , I would get a listing of ' Lolitas ' , ' lesbians on lesbians ' …
You get the picture . "
His internet history file unleashed a tsunami of pornography .
But what is a girl to do when she is madly in love , is not averse to a bit of pornography and considers herself to be " cool " ?
She tiptoes around the subject for weeks .
She raises the issue gingerly : " I 'm totally fine , just wondering why there 's so much . "
She thought she loved him and she did not want to ruin the relationship by being censorious .
But her boyfriend 's pornography consumption begun to affect their sex life , and then their broader relationship .
The sex became impersonal and aggressive : " It became more ' porn ' style - pulling my hair , no kissing , slapping around a bit , all stuff I was initially OK with .
And always he wanted to come in my face , " Gracie says .
" There was no real intimacy , no thought about what I might like .
That 's when I began to realise … "
Slowly the sex tapered off : " I would wake up and find him looking at it , I would go to bed at night and he would look at porn , " Gracie says .
" We would argue ; he would look at porn .
I would take the dog for a walk , and he would look at it .
I would brush my teeth ; he would use it . "
She blamed herself .
He blamed her .
She questioned , she cried , and finally , after a violent argument , she left .
A team of American researchers from Stanford and Duquesne Universities has called cyber - sex compulsion a " hidden public health hazard " .
Sexual counsellors and psychologists in Australia are less colourful .
Brett McCann , a senior lecturer in the sexual health program at the University of Sydney , says it is a growing problem " with big implications for the public health dollar .
There 's no quick fix , and by the time the problem is uncovered , there 's usually a crisis in the relationship . "
Greta Goldberg , a clinical psychologist of more than 30 years experience , has counselled adolescents aged 13 and 16 for internet pornography compulsions , as well as adults .
" It 's more pervasive .
It 's catching more people , and it 's likely to be a huge problem in future , " she says .
Relationships Australia , the country 's biggest counselling network , reports an increased number of clients raising the issue .
Pamela Lewis , the director of client services , says : " More women are saying , ' We used to be close , now he spends his time on porn sites . '
It 's another one of those things wrecking relationships . "
Dr Amelia Haines , a therapist at the Sydney Centre for Sexual and Relationship Therapy , reports seeing a lot of people for whom internet pornography is " out of hand " .
" Men want to see what else is out there .
Some end up spending three hours a night looking for the right image , the right trigger .
They search and search .
Usually what they look at is not too scary .
They worry more about wasting so much of their lives , they 're embarrassed about how much they 're accessing , and they can't stop . "
Compared with alcohol problems , and violence - control issues in relationships , obsessive pornography use is still a second - order marriage - wrecker .
It is usually part of a constellation of problems .
Ironically , the lack of high - speed broadband in Australia has kept internet porn 's full potential on a leash .
That downloading of porn clips is slow has helped maintain the popularity of old - fashioned video and DVD pornography .
Even so , figures provided by Nielsen / NetRatings NetView show 2.7 million Australians visited an " adult " website in March ( this figure counts repeat visitors to adult websites only once ) ; 4.3 million visited in the first three months of this year .
More than 35 per cent of all internet users in the quarter ending March visited an adult website at least once .
For couples in trouble over internet porn , it is a secret misery .
Women say over and over the problem needed to be brought out in the open .
" I 'm glad you 're writing about this , " they say .
Rebecca , a 25 - year - old medical student , strives for a clinical detachment from her fiance 's obsession with pornography .
She thinks of his problem as an addiction , like other substance abuses , characterised by compulsive use , secrecy , and shame .
" It should be treated like any other addiction , " she says .
" And abstinence is the best course . "
She says his problem is tied to low self - esteem , even though to the world he appears a " charismatic , outgoing person " .
With porn , he did not have to worry what others thought of his performance .
But during the three years of " struggle " over his obsession , she has not always been so objective .
" I was always the one pushing for sex , " she says .
" If anything I 'm more of a sexual deviant in bed . "
Originally he confined his daily porn gazing to when she was not in the house .
A quick flick through his internet history revealed an escalating habit .
It reached a point where " porn became easier than actually having sex " , she says .
She felt about as sexy as a " can of kidney beans .
I felt unwanted .
I found myself going to the internet and asking , ' What is it those women have I do n't ? '
I felt worse about myself .
I told him , ' I 'll give you whatever you want .
What can I do to make it more like porn ? " '
Ordinary women 's desire or desperation to " make it more like porn " has helped fire the popularity of Brazilian waxes , according to Nancy Etcoff , a Harvard medical school psychologist and the author of Survival of the Prettiest : the Science of Beauty .
Unlike the natural - looking porn stars of the 1970s such as Linda Lovelace of Deep Throat fame , the nymphs populating internet porn today have their pubic hairs ripped out after an application of hot wax .
The desired look is " clean " and pre-pubescent .
" Women today are emulating porn stars who have no pubic hair , " says Etcoff , " and I think men like it . "
Many women like the look , too , but a disgruntled sufferer of a Brazilian wax says on the Herald website : " Because girls are always so keen to be every man 's fantasy , we did it , and now it is considered the norm to go through the extremely painful and costly experience of having all our pubic hairs ripped out every three weeks .
My older sister never had to go through all of this . "
Women are also under pressure to emulate the porn stars ' apparent penchant for anal sex , according to four consecutive Swedish studies , the latest published in 2005 in the International Journal of STD and AIDS .
Young men who are regular porn consumers are more likely to have had anal sex with a girl , and most of the men liked it .
Most young women did not like anal sex , with fewer than half saying they would do it again , the studies found .
Redelman says : " Young women report a lot of their partners want anal sex .
They 've seen it on videos or the internet and they want to explore , but most young women are n't that comfortable with it . "
Nadine , a 30 - year - old accountant , who observed her boyfriend , a 33 - year - old lawyer , graduate to harder and harder porn sites over years , says : " He loves anal and I hate it .
He knows that I do but he still insists on it .
I dread it and honestly , I close my eyes and pray that he hurries up and gets it over with it . "
The secret use of pornography is the true home - wrecker , according to most of the psychologists contacted .
The most common pattern is for one partner to eventually discover the other 's obsessive use .
" When it 's consensual use in a limited way , it 's unproblematic , " says Eric Hudson , the national president of the Australian Association of Relationship Counsellors .
" But where it is secretive , it is experienced as a betrayal of the relationship . "
And secret use , he says , like an affair , can be a symptom of other problems .
Alex , a 38 - year - old computer programmer who worked at home , describes himself as an " ex porn junkie " .
He admits the deception over his porn use was the last straw in a faltering 12 - year relationship .
It was not uncommon for him to browse for three or four hours at a time most days when he had work and " better things to do " .
He did not understand his compulsion when he was in its grip .
Now he realises it was his escape from unhappiness and insecurity .
" I could retreat to the security of my fantasy world , " he says .
" I thought it was relatively harmless .
I 'd started as a teenager with magazines , but with the internet there was so much more content .
It was always available . "
After he was sprung , he was devastated when his marriage broke up .
He felt like a worthless person .
" My wife was a very honest , upfront sort of person , " he says .
" It was the fact I had been deceiving her for so long that made her so angry and upset . "
Now that he is not so controlled by pornography , he worries about young people learning about sex from the internet .
" It 's a big wide world out there , people are doing strange things , a lot of it not particularly kind to women , " Alex says .
" I was fascinated , I wanted to have a look , but with teens growing up this will be their experience . "
Whether people can become " addicted " to pornography , as they can to heroin or tobacco , is debatable .
Most experts steer clear of pathologising behaviour just because it is not mainstream .
Hudson says people in the grip of internet pornography , who feel they need progressively bigger hits , experience it as an addiction .
But they are not physically addicted .
People have some control over their sexual behaviour , he says .
McCann says people should seek help early if they believe they are developing a habit that could damage their relationship .
Gracie 's former boyfriend , when last contacted through his MySpace site , had one " friend " - from an interactive adult porn site .
" Some things never change , " she says .
Rebecca 's fiance , having acknowledged his problem , has remained " abstinent " for months and life is " absolutely fantastic " , she says .
It may not be strictly addictive but for a silent minority , internet pornography has brought anguish , shame and broken hearts .

I do n't know where these guys ever got the impression that this is all they need to give in terms of performance , but it 's not acceptable .
You guys knock shit around in there , lose your load and think you 're Gods .
It 's not a self challenge to see how hard you can slam into her .
It 's a two person deal , for fucks sake .
And no amount of changing positions makes up for it ... it just prolongs the boredom .
Ditto for needing to have sex in every possible location like you 're marking your spot .
The sex WOULD BE INTERESTING enough if you just did it right .
All you 're doing by bugging women to have sex in the car , on the dresser , in the woods , is putting them in places where they 're going to pull a muscle or get dirt on their ass cheeks while you bore them to sleep .
Woohoo .
And WHY do you have to be SO predictable ?
There 's nothing more boring than making out with a guy , getting turned on , and then being bored to death by the same ol ' , same ol ' routine that I swear to God , you guys found in some book somewhere that every single one of you read in high school and have sworn by ever since .
Kiss , and for WAY too short a time , by the way ... grab the ass ... grab a boob ... squeeze it and massage it in a way that is n't a turn on for anyone but you because it 's awkward and fumbly and does n't leave even a trace of someone who is trying to pleasure the woman attached to the boob he 's working on ... get a boob out ... suck on it while squeezing the ass ... blah .
Get the pants off ... fingers , clit , blah ... do the whole digital penetration thing all wrong - usually too rough ... get to the oral ... get to the sex ... in out in out , we covered that already .
Snore .
What is with people ?????
It 's not that I have a problem teaching and communicating , but it'd be nice for people to at least come through the door with a clue or two in their pocket .
Shit .
Get with it already .
Be unpredictable .
Get out of your rhythm ... it's old and been done by everybody too many times .
Surprise somebody !
Figure out how to be interesting without getting into every position you 've ever seen in all your pornos , every single time you have sex because you know what happens when you do all those positions every time ?
They get boring .
Predictable .
Do something else !
Here 's some help : women have thighs , areas behind the knees , shoulders , backs , toes , tops of the feet , forearms , hips , wrists , ankles , outer sides of the breasts , hair , butt cheeks that are good for more than smacking .
There 's a backside to that neck and it's a lot more sensitive than the right and left sides .
There are good things to be had in all of these places .
Figure them out .
There is more than one speed ... learn it .
Change it up !
If you 're going to run around acting like your penises make you something worthy of the egos you carry around , then for crying out loud , at least earn your reputation properly .
Until then , quit crying about how you want slutty women who know what they 're doing in bed who can please YOU .
Women ( especially slutty ones ) are bored with you because mostly , you 're all the same .
I 'm sure there are some middle - aged and older men in here who know what I 'm talking about .
There will also be some who do n't because some people just never figure it out .
WASHINGTON -- Leading conservatives yesterday attacked the Republican party as big - government , free - spending coddlers of illegal immigrants and said the country 's conservatives should withhold support from the GOP 's current slate of presidential nominees to force them to the right .
" I feel very angry and betrayed " by the GOP , some of whose elected officials have backed a " guest worker " immigration plan , abortion rights , and tax increases , said Richard Viguerie , chairman of Conservative - HQ.com .
" We should withhold support from all major Republican [ presidential ] candidates today .
Not one of them deserves our support today , " he told a ballroom full of activists at the Conservative Political Action Conference 's annual meeting yesterday .
Further , he said , conservatives should withhold " all support " from GOP national committees , which Viguerie said have not produced federal candidates who adhere to conservative principles .
Ken Blackwell , a failed GOP candidate for Ohio governor last year , agreed that conservatives should at least wait to endorse a presidential candidate .
" The Republican Party -- our natural home in a two - party system -- is in disarray , " Blackwell lamented .
At least one conference participant sported a sticker that featured a circle with a line drawn through the words " Rudy McRomney " -- broadcasting the wearer 's opposition to the early leaders in polls for the GOP nomination , former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani , Senator John McCain of Arizona , and former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney .
Conservatives said they are frustrated and angry , and blamed the GOP 's massive losses in the 2006 elections on Republicans who deviated from a hard - line conservative agenda .
The mood puts added pressure on a slew of GOP presidential candidates set to speak to the meeting today .
Social conservatives are leery of Giuliani , who supports abortion rights , and of McCain , who authored a campaign finance law that limits interest groups ' financial influence in political campaigns .
Romney 's evolution to a socially conservative agenda pleases some religious conservatives , but some are still unhappy with his earlier , softer positions on gay rights and abortion rights .
Former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee has disappointed fiscal conservatives for signing tax increases on gas and cigarettes , while Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas has been criticized for his support of an immigration bill that conservatives insist would give amnesty to illegal immigrants .
Phyllis Schlafly , a longtime opponent of gay rights and the Equal Rights Amendment , won loud cheers yesterday when she derided programs to provide bilingual drivers ' license tests and to offer low - wage jobs to immigrants instead of " our own high school dropouts . "
All of the GOP candidates except McCain are scheduled to appear today before the conference .
Representative Duncan Hunter , a lesser - known California Republican running for president , will also speak before the conservative activists .
Kevin Madden , a spokesman for Romney , acknowledged that conservatives are frustrated because of the election losses of 2006 .
But he said the party -- including its conservative wing -- needs to unite around an agenda and a candidate who can win .
" The conservative movement is going through a certain degree of reflection and renewal , " Madden said .
" We need to come together and find some unifying themes . "

HAMBURG , Germany ( Reuters ) - EU efforts to speed action on climate change took a blow on Tuesday when Japan refused to follow the EU line on how to establish a new international regime once the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012 .

A statement from EU president Germany , which chaired a gathering of EU and Asian foreign ministers in Hamburg ahead of next week ’s meeting of Group of Eight ( G8 ) leaders , said talks to establish a new regime should be completed by 2009 .
But Japan said it could not accept a 2009 target , saying big polluters such as the United States , China and India should be included before any such target was set .
“ Japan cannot agree with this because we should think about how we can invite non-Kyoto members such as the U.S. , China and India and others , ” Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mitsui Sakaba told reporters .
“ We should work first for the inclusion of those countries .
Fixing the target should come much later . ”
Germany is leading a drive to persuade the United States to follow Europe ’s lead on climate change before a June 6 - 8 summit of the Group of Eight industrial nations .
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants the G8 to agree concrete steps that would prepare the ground for an extension of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which commits signatories to reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases .
“ We need the Asians as well , ” said a spokeswoman for EU External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero - Waldner .
“ Global warming is something that is global and we need all continents participating in the post - Kyoto plan . ”
The EU has agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 , challenging industrial and developing countries to go further with a 30 percent cut that it promises the EU would then match .
POST KYOTO
The German statement said the Hamburg meeting -- which brought together the 27 EU states with the 10 countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations , as well as China , Japan , South Korea , India and Pakistan -- had stressed the need for “ a global and comprehensive post - 2012 climate regime ” .
It said this should be “ in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities ” -- indicating that not all countries would be expected to move at the same pace .
It said the meeting had acknowledged the role of targets for the use of energy from renewable sources and improved energy efficiency , “ taking national circumstances into account ” .
Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said a balance had to be struck between the right to develop and the environment , but developing countries could help by allowing more transfers of clean technology .
“ All countries should work together in terms of exploring new sources of energy , alternative energy and clean technology , ” he told a news conference .
“ In this respect , perhaps the developed countries can do more ... we are moving towards the same goal and we should each contribute in our own way to environmental protection . ”
The Association of South East Asian Nations said its 10 members needed time but action was required .
“ If we go on arguing about whether this number or this standard is fair or not fair we will never agree on what to do , and in the meantime the earth is getting warmer and more things are happening , ” said ASEAN Secretary General Ong Keng Yong .
2006 -12-06 : Today it 's exactly one year ago that I had to take a hard decision .
Due to a legal threat I had to remove an application from my download page that , judging from the feedback I got ( and still get ) , made a lot of people very happy .
pearLyrics .
A simple tool that automatically looked for lyrics for the song playing in iTunes .
What made it different from the rest , and so popular , was that it actually did find a lot of lyrics due to it 's unique search algorithm .
Finally it got too successful .
Warner - Chappell had concerns that it was infringing their copyrights .
After an incredible amount of media coverage and an open letter of EFFs Fred von Lohmann it probably turned into too negative publicity for Warner Chappell , so finally , the unthinkable happened : the CEO of Warner - Chappel called me and said that he was sorry for the way they approached this issue .
We even concluded that we should work together to bring lyrics to music fans all over the place .
Wow , so what an adventure , what a promise .
Big times ahead .
A highly idealistic goal and a big company promising their support .
Critical voices already brought up the theory that this might just be a PR action on behalf of Warner - Chappel to get rid of the negative press - and honestly , that was also my thought .
But hey , let 's stay open minded and see what the future will bring .
Well , fast forward one year and a couple of phone calls and emails .
Presumably Warner - Chappel signed a deal with Gracenote ( hey , good news , expect lyrics support in iTunes soon ) and therefore does n't want to deal with a little developer anymore .
After all , pearLyrics and it's negative publicity for Warner - Chappel is long gone ( well , ok , speculation on my part ) .
So what 's up , where is pearLyrics ?
Well , sad to say , but I guess this is the final good bye to a piece of software I 've put a lot of passion and hope into , that made a lot of people very happy and one or two a bit angry .
It 's not only Warner - Chappel , but also the rest of the music industry .
No one out there could guarantee me that I was on the safe side if I released it again .
For me as a little freeware developer this whole experience was stunning and frustrating at the same time .
On the one hand it feels a bit strange if your freeware app is shared on filesharing networks ( of course , this is perfectly fine for me ) , that an application so small and unimportant captures so much interest .
On the other hand it 's a sad world , where money decides who is on the right side of the law .
There is simply no way I could risk a law suit , even if I 'm absolutely sure that I 'm doing the right thing .
I 'm a software developer , not a law expert after all .
This incident made me think twice before releasing any new software .
" Well then , is there the slightest chance to get an unofficial version of pearLyrics , maybe even as a universal binary to support the newest Intel Macs ? " you might wonder .
Well , let me put it this way : I 'm glad to help friends optimize their personal workflow on their Macs .
I would like to say " Thank you very much " to all the fans of pearLyrics out there , it was great to get all your encouraging feedback , to all the media that reported about this little incident showing that the world actually cares about justice .
To get inspired by the promising press - release from one year ago take a look here :
pearLyrics - good news for lyrics fans after all ?
LOVERS know only too well that men usually need a “ recovery period ” after orgasm , and that sexual intercourse with orgasm is more satisfying than an orgasm from masturbation alone .
Now scientists think the two phenomena might be linked .
Following orgasm , the hormone prolactin is released into the bloodstream in both men and women .
The hormone makes us feel satiated by countering the effect of dopamine , which is released during sexual arousal .
Stuart Brody of the University of Paisley , UK , and Tillmann Krüger of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich , measured blood prolactin levels in male and female volunteers …
They even have celebrity endorsements for drugs , on chat shows , conveying important treatment information on odds ratios and relative risk - if I can slip into 1990s teen slang for a moment - " not " .
It could n't happen here .
But now , excitingly , it looks like it might .
The pharmaceutical industry HAS consistently been knocked back in the EU , and WAS turned away on its last request to " educate " the public in 2004 , but the EU " Pharmaceutical Forum " is reconsidering , and reports next month .
Like the rest of the advertising industry , pharmaceutical companies look at their nails innocently when you suggest that adverts might affect behaviour , even though they know - that we know - that they 'd only spend money on it if it worked .
In fact , specific campaigns have been shown to affect prescribing practice , because modern doctors listen to their patients ' demands , and pharmaceutical consumer advertising is growing twice as fast as advertising direct to doctors , for one simple reason : history has shown that you are stupid and easily led , although your education in bad science may stand you in good stead .
Doctors are trained to spot bullshit , and this is one area where paternalism , I would argue , is acceptable .
Pharmaceutical companies produce next - level , postgraduate bullshit .
Drug reps brandish literature that is the comedic parallel of the promotional stories you get in the media for supplement pills , but the tricks are far more complicated : they cherry pick the literature - looking only at the positive studies - they use surrogate endpoints - a blood test rather than a stroke - they use inadequate controls - a lower dose of the competitor 's drug .
They do all this far more subtly than the homeopaths , or the fish oil gang , because they are addressing a critical audience .
The best the public and journalists can offer in the face of big pharma's advanced hustling is a rather infantile set of conspiracy theories that all drug company research must be " biased " ; but they can't quite explain why , because it 's boring and largely impenetrable , and so they only focus on the few clear examples of corporate fraud , where safety data has been mischievously withheld .
But the move the drug companies are demanding is far more interesting than the right to produce straight adverts .
They want the opportunity to " educate " the public , directly , building awareness of disease , and biological treatments , and re-framing our understanding of our bodies .
This is a far more sinister project , and one pursued by all flavours of pill peddler .
The nutritionists and food supplement industry - whom the newspapers continue to picture as a quaint cottage trade , rather than a multibillion - dollar pill industry - run about telling everyone they 've got food intolerances , or hidden dietary deficiencies , or frightening disease risks , for which they have the solution , in a pill .
The drug companies , meanwhile , overplay the role of medication in the treatment of mild depression , and sell new conditions like " restless legs syndrome " , or " female sexual dysfunction " , for treatment with pills which they , too , already had in the warehouse .
Pills are seductive and easy , especially for problems with a strong psychological or social component ; but the tragedy is , in the UK , there is nobody advocating against this disempowering pill mentality : only different groups , some of whom claim to be " alternative " , squabbling over who can sell the most pills .

Redmond , WA - At a technology conference for developers , representatives from Microsoft and Intel outlined the Can't Do Shit ( CDS ) Road Map for future cooperative products between the two companies .
They predict that in 6 years it will be impossible to violate a copyright with a computer , or to do anything at all for that matter .
" We 're very confident that with the release of our Palladium platform and Intel 's LaGrande none of consumers ' previous digital media will work .
No MP3s , no movie files , nothing , " said Josiah Witman , Microsoft 's head of the Palladium initiative .
" The following year we plan to release a new version of Office that will be unable to function with any files created by previous versions .
Thus furthering the CDs initiative greatly . "
He also stated that the version of Windows slated for release in 2007 code named Shredder would destroy all files upon installation .
" We must be sure consumers do not have any illegal digital content on their systems , " emphasized Witman .
Intel foresees a similar path .
" Our LaGrande processor will make sure that any digital media is completely inaccessible without paying a fee .
The next generation of processors will perform at double the speed but will be incapable outputting any video signals .
If consumers can bypass Microsoft 's content protection system we have to make sure they can't utilize it in any way , " said Harold Gresler of Intel .
Developers agreed that the future of computing is not being able to do shit .
" I can't wait to start developing for the CDs platform .
You give the customer control of the computer and they just screw things up , " said Tom Robbins of Plusex Designs .
" It 's better to make sure they can't do shit .
Then you 've got a stability . "
Many militant computer users have begun stocking up on computer hardware and digital media and plan on never upgrading again , " If that 's the path computing is taking then I 'm staying here in 2002 . "
To discourage hoarding Microsoft and Intel plan a joint lobbying effort on legislation that would mandate upgrades to the new computer system by all citizens .
" We can't have fringe computer groups stockpiling useful hardware and software , " said Gresler .
" We envision CompSquads destroying antiquated equipment so Americans can enjoy only the most cutting edge technology . "
Many consumers agreed , " I think Microsoft and Intel are moving very quickly with this new plan , because I 'm already at the point where I can't do shit with their products . "
Representatives from Real endorsed the development road map and said that they would do their best to make sure that their next media player , RealTwo , would be unable to do shit .
" We plan to have Real Two take file associations for everything .
When you click on a .doc file RealTwo will try to open it .
It will completely paralyze novices , and cause experts to destroy their computers in fits of rage . "
Music and movie executive applauded the plan .
RIAA president Hilary Rosen stated that " when consumers can't do shit with their computers then we 'll be able to unveil our new digital music plan . "
Microsoft has denied allegations that future versions of Windows will use the codebase from Windows for Workgroups 3.11 .

The annual surveys Economic Freedom of the World and Index of Economic Freedom are two indices which attempt to measure the degree of economic freedom of a nation .
For years , relatively boring reports have clearly shown a direct correlation between economic freedom and per capita income , growth rates , and life expectancy .
Now the main ranking in the reports have been overlayed on a world map .
The results are compelling :
Comparing a map of economic freedom to nighttime satellite photos reveals that in general the citizens that live in nations which have had economic freedom for a long time , tend to enjoy a far greater degree of electrification .
Japan , Taiwan , South Korea , and Hong Kong vs China , Russia , and North Korea
Europe vs Africa
Israel , the UAE , and Qatar vs the rest of the Arab countries
Puerto Rico and the US vs Cuba and Haiti
Some specific examples are quite stunning : Obviously economic freedom and electrification are not directly correlated in every case , but there 's definitely something to it .

In a case of life imitating art , researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( M.I.T. ) reported today that they had successfully reversed mental retardation in mice , just as scientists did in the classic 1966 novel Flowers for Algernon .
In the book by Daniel Keyes , scientists use experimental surgery — first tested on a mouse named Algernon — to dramatically boost the intelligence of a mentally retarded janitor named Charlie Gordon .
Now M.I.T. scientists report in Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences USA that they ameliorated brain damage in mice caused by a genetic disorder known as fragile X syndrome by blocking an enzyme involved in cellular development .
Fragile X affects one in 4,000 boys and one in 6,000 girls .
It is caused by a mutation in the fragile x mental retardation 1 gene ( FMR1 ) — located on the X sex chromosome — that results in the loss of the fragile x mental retardation protein ( FMRP ) .
The resulting illness is characterized by hyperactivity , attention deficit , repetitive behavior , anxiety and cognitive difficulties ranging from learning disability to mental retardation .
Previous studies of fragile X show that nerve cells in the cortex ( the outermost layer of the brain ) of both patients and knockout mice have dendrites ( rootlike projections that nerve cells use to receive electrical signals from peers ) with a greater number of branches .
These extra shoots are thin , stubby , immature and less functional than normal dendrites , causing poor transmission among neurons across synapses ( the spaces between nerve cells ) .
When studying the formation of dendrites for a 2004 paper , Mansuo Hayashi , a research affiliate in M.I.T.'s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory , discovered that these structures could be strengthened and altered to transmit information more efficiently by inhibiting nerve cell production of the enzyme called p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) .
PAK regulates actin , another protein , which shapes parts of the cell ( including the dendrites ) .
When PAK is inhibited , more actin is manufactured and the dendrites are able to properly mature .
In the current study , Hayashi led a team that worked with " double mutant " mice .
First , the researchers mutated the FMR1 so that the mice would lack FMRP protein and thus show symptoms of fragile X . A second mutation to the gene that codes for PAK caused the mouse 's cells in the forebrain to stop producing the enzyme at three weeks after birth .
" When these two mutants were crossed together , [ the mice ] were normal , " says senior study author Susumu Tonegawa , a professor of neuroscience and biology at Picower .
Not only did the dendrites of the fragile X–afflicted mice become more robust and efficient , but researchers report that several of the behavioral symptoms associated with the disorder also abated : Double mutant mice behaved more like normal mice than like those with fragile X .
William Greenough , a professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , says that the study demonstrates the long - term potential of gene therapy .
" I am impressed by the kinds of different symptoms … that seem to be under [ the ] governance of this single signaling pathway , " he says .
" It seems to affect everything from neuronal morphology ( or shape ) to behavior that may or may not be coupled to that morphology . "
Tonegawa says that the results may pave the way to a possible new molecular target for new drugs .
" If you take a fragile X patient and feed them or inject them with a compound that will inhibit their own endogenous PAK enzyme , " he says , " it may reduce the fragile X symptoms . "
He notes that a significant finding of the study is that the effects of fragile X — which is typically diagnosed only after a child shows marked developmental delays , such as being late to crawl , walk or talk — could be reversed at the onset .
Scores crowd Michael Moore to hear him speak in DC Nick Juliano

They were lined up in droves outside a congressional hearing room as scores more packed the aisles -- women in bright Code Pink T - shirts , interns in suits and ties , jean - clad bloggers , traditional reporters and members of Congress -- all to hear Michael Moore 's solutions to the health - care crisis .
Moore 's new movie , SiCKO , which RAW STORY reviewed Tuesday , profiles Americans who found their lives ruined because insurance companies provided inadequate care .
" There 's a new villain on screens ... but it's not the villain you 'll see in Spider Man or Harry Potter , " Moore told the crowd at a Wednesday press conference .
" The villain is the health insurance industry of America . "
Moore was joined by a handful of lawmakers who are sponsoring legislation aimed at creating a single - payer universal health care system in the US .
Rep. John Conyers , D - Mich. , the legislation 's main sponsor , said Moore 's movie is the most important development in the health care debate since former President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton tried for universal health care legislation in the early 1990s .
Conyers compared his fight to enact universal health care to his efforts in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr. 's death to create a national holiday in honor of the civil rights leader .
In both cases , Conyers said , his colleagues in the House confided privately that they supported his bill but told him , " You know you can't win . "
" I 'm going to take that , ' You know you can't win , ' and turn it into , ' Together we all can win , " Conyers said .
Moore said the key to fixing America 's healthcare crisis is to eliminate health insurance providers who work in favor of maximum profits rather than maximum health .
" They can still have fire insurance and car insurance , there 's still other work they can do , " Moore said .
" But there 's no room for them in healthcare because we 're human beings , not automobiles . "
The press conference was a largely Democratic affair , but California Republican Darrell Issa spoke briefly in favor of healthcare for all Americans , though he did not advocate the same single - payer system advanced by Conyers .
" We can all agree that we need to take steps in the direction of universal access , " said Issa , who received a noticeably more tepid response from the crowd .
Conyers ' bill aims to create universal health care access by expanding Medicare access to all US residents and creating a universal non-profit system over the next 15 years , according to information on the proposal distributed by his office .
The program would eliminate private insurance companies and raise payroll taxes on businesses to pay for expanded public care .
Next year Shirley Temple will reach 80 , always a landmark anniversary but even more so in someone who became significant for being little .
But the heroine of Little Miss Marker and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm receives an unwelcome early present in one of the summer 's big art shows : a painting that resurrects the bizarre effect that the Hollywood child star used to have on middle - aged artistic figures .
The Dali & Film show at Tate Modern includes a picture in which the Spanish artist 's usually timeless surrealism includes a toxic topicality .
His 1939 collage called Shirley Temple , The Youngest , Most Sacred Monster of the Cinema in Her Time imposes the head from a black - and - white newspaper picture of the ringleted movie moppet on the painted body of a heavy - breasted lioness , coloured deep red apart from long white claws .
A vampire bat sits on Temple 's head , while around her lie the stripped bones from her latest kill .
You do n't have to look hard for phallic imagery in Dali and the fact that the skeleton of the predator 's meal has conveniently broken down into single blunt , curved pieces clearly marks her as a maneater .
This erotic demonisation of an 11 - year - old would be startling in any case , but becomes even more so because Salvador Dali 's savage anger at the actress was shared by an artistic contemporary in England : the novelist and critic Graham Greene ( 1904 - 1991 ) .
As the picture of Temple goes on show in London , we are approaching the 70th anniversary of a libel case in which 20th Century Fox sued over a movie review that was a literary equivalent of the case Dali ( 1904 - 1989 ) made in paint .
Writing in the October 1937 edition of the magazine Night and Day , Greene considered the performance of the then nine - year - old Temple in Wee Willie Winkie .
The novelist argued that , though marketed as an innocent kid , the performer had a " more secret and more adult appeal " and was , in truth , a " complete totsy " with a " well - developed rump " .
Although paedophilia was not a term in common use in the 1930s , Greene 's meaning is clear when he suggests that , for her male audience , " the safety curtain of story and dialogue drops between their intelligence and their desire " .
Because we tend to think of moral panic over the sexualisation of children - by advertisers , clothing manufacturers and the music business - as a modern phenomenon , it 's shocking to find these sentiments expressed so strongly seven decades ago .
In both portrait and article , the rage expressed seems strangely disproportionate to her performances .
We may wonder , given the artists concerned , if there was an element of self - disgust in these descriptions .
Apart from being born in the same year , Greene and Dali were both Roman Catholics ( the Spaniard by baptism , the Englishman through conversion ) who were rather more interested in sex than their religion , family or society allowed .
Did they feel , when they contemplated Temple , the stirring of a deviance beyond even their previous dreams ?
It can be argued , though , that Dali and Greene have been vindicated by time .
Fox and Temple won the libel case , leading to the closure of Night and Day .
The fact that , shortly afterwards , Dali , having seen the child star in The Little Princess , was able to paint his savage portrait with impunity merely confirms that artists are safer from the straitjacket of defamation law than writers .
However , the actress , who later became a US diplomat , has subsequently suggested that Greene had a point and that she now realises the studios did impose adult overtones on her costumes , movements and gestures .
Certainly , cinematic history has shown that artist and writer were correct to see something monstrous and improper in the Hollywood child star .
Diana Serra Cary - who , as Baby Peggy , was making silent films as a toddler and was the hit kid-actor before Temple - has written about the exploitation and psychological damage suffered by precocious talent in Hollywood , and now , as she approaches her 90th year , campaigns for laws to protect child performers .
Vindications of her position appear daily in tabloid magazines .
While Temple and Serra Cary have made sense of their adult lives , the careers of Drew Barrymore and Lindsay Lohan show what a destructive kindergarten young cinematic fame can be .
It 's easy to imagine , say , Damien Hirst creating a modern companion piece to Dali's Temple , with Lohan as a wrecked sex - kitten lying amid a litter of empty bottles and white lines .
And looking at Dakota Fanning , the nearest thing to a contemporary Temple , you hope that she has watchful parents and agents , although our culture 's sensitivity to the depiction of children at least means she is dressed and presented more neutrally in movies than little Shirley ever was .
But perhaps , from the millions of dollars she has made , her entourage should buy her the Dali picture as a warning .
