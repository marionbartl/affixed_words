THE Government will begin trawling blog sites as part of a new media monitoring strategy , with documents singling out a website critical of Communications Minister Stephen Conroy for special mention .
Soon after Senator Conroy praised Singapore 's Government for reducing monitoring of blogs , tender documents issued by the Department of Broadband , Communications and the Digital Economy reveal it is looking for a " comprehensive digital monitoring service for print and electronic media " .
The department later attached a clarification confirming the term " electronic media " included " blogs such as Whirlpool " .
Whirlpool , the only blog site mentioned , has criticised Senator Conroy 's plans to filter internet content and his handling of the Government 's $ 15 billion national broadband network .
It is a community - run internet forum devoted to discussing broadband internet access .
Senator Conroy this month told a conference in Germany that it was a " really positive sign " that the Singaporean Government had given up monitoring blogs .
Schools in Manchester may close if more than 40 % of pupils were to be absent on religious festival days .
Pupils being taken out of school to attend non-Christian festivals account for a " sizeable chunk " of absences , according to Manchester City Council .
The council is considering the proposal put forward last month in a report designed to tackle the problem of unauthorised school absences .
Scheduling teacher training days on religious festivals was also suggested .
Manchester City Council wants to tackle religious absenteeism Schools are open for 190 days per year with an extra five days for training .
The council has proposed that statutory teacher training days could be timed to coincide with non-Christian festivals , though they have made clear that no specific religion was mentioned in the report .
John Edwards , the council 's deputy director of children 's services for Manchester City Council , said : " We encourage schools to work with local faith groups to develop guidance and co-ordinate the times taken for religious observance .
" It is about asking schools to plan ahead and to try not to put themselves in the position where they could be asked to allow additional absence . "
The decision would ultimately rest with individual headteachers , and a spokesperson for the council has stressed that the report is for guidance only .
Overall , time off for religious reasons accounted for 3.78 % of absences , compared to illness , which the council says is the reason for more than half of time off outside of school holidays .
But the director of the Centre for Social Cohesion , Douglas Murray , says the proposals could cause division .
" This idea is very regressive because people are being treated according to the background they 're born into .
" This is the opposite of what we want to do , and risks fragmenting society . "
Currently , the Pupil Registration Regulations 2006 state that legitimate absences can only be allowed for religious reasons ' on a day exclusively set apart for religious observance by the religious body to which the parent belongs ' .

( CNN ) --
The Vermont House on Thursday passed a same - sex marriage bill by 95 - 52 , which is not enough of a margin to override a veto promised by the governor .
Republican Gov. Jim Douglas has said he does not support the sam - sex marriage bill .
The vote came late in the day after five hours of debate before a crowded chamber , said the group Vermont Freedom To Marry , in a posting on its Web site .
" It 's a testament to the power of telling our stories , " said Beth Robinson , a spokeswoman for the group .
" We know we 've got more work to do in the run-up to the override vote . "
Last week , the bill passed the Senate 26 - 4 .
A final House vote is slated for Friday , when the bill is to be sent back to the Senate for approval of changes in the legislation sought by the House , and then to the desk of Gov. James Douglas , whose threatened veto could be overridden by a two - thirds vote .
That override vote could take place as soon as Tuesday , Robinson said .
Douglas , a Republican , has left little doubt about where he stands .
" I believe our civil - union law serves Vermont well and I would support congressional action to extend those benefits at the federal level to states that recognize same - sex unions , " he said last week in a written statement .
" But , like President Obama and other leaders on both sides of the aisle , I believe that marriage should remain between a man and woman . "
Vermont Senate President Pro Tem Peter Shumlin , the main sponsor of the bill , has described Douglas ' decision as " cowardly . "
" You can not veto love and commitment between two people , " the Democrat said .
" This is a civil - rights issue .
It is time for the governor to show some courage . "
Massachusetts and Connecticut are the only states that have passed same - sex marriage laws .

Google will add scripting capabilities to Google Docs , allowing organizations to customize its online applications and automate tasks , the company said Wednesday .
Google plans to sign up about 1,000 customers over the next few weeks to test the feature , called Google Apps Script .
It is n't saying yet when Apps Script will be widely available .
Google Docs users can apply here to try it out .
[ Related : " Google finally dropping ' beta ' tag from some apps . " |
Follow the cloud with InfoWorld 's Cloud Computing blog and Cloud Computing Report newsletter . ]
It will be tested initially in Google Spreadsheets and extended to other Google Docs applications over time , said Jonathan Rochelle , product manager for Google Docs , in a press briefing at the Google I /O conference .
The scripting will allow organizations to build custom functions in spreadsheets , like translating figures from inches to millimeters , or translating text from one language to another .
It will also enable applications to be linked together , allowing a user to send an e-mail from within a spreadsheet , for example , or access a calendar from a list of addresses .
The company posted a video and some information about Apps Script in its Enterprise Blog .
The scripting should help Google to compete better with Microsoft 's widely used Excel spreadsheet software , but it will also open a new front for security attacks and other potential issues .
" The nature of scripting is such that it could be easily abused , " Rochelle acknowledged .
" We want to make sure people can't make a mistake [ such as ] they coded something they do n’t know is happening . "
Google will work to make it " bulletproof " before it 's released to the public , he said .
The company described it as " a puppy who 's still in training , " suggesting it has more work to do on it .
Google Apps Script is based on JavaScript , with object - based extensions added by Google , making it easy to learn , according to Rochelle .
" It really is JavaScript , except there are certain things we do n’t let you do , " he said .
There is not currently a way to import Excel macros , he said , but Google is considering that for the future .
It expects Apps Script to appeal especially to systems integrators , who have been asking for it , he said .
Excel still has many more features and capabilities than Google Spreadsheets , but Rochelle argued that " user satisfaction " is a better measure by which to compare the products .
" If 80 percent of people do n't use the features then it does n't matter , " he said .
Several partners are at the show who offer integration services and develop add - on tools for Google Docs .
Ed Laczynski , CTO of LTech , said his company has migrated " hundreds of thousands " of users from on - premise software to Google Apps .
The company just released a tool that lets users download and backup their documents to a local disk .
Oracle is also in on the act .
The company is about to release a beta tool that will let users of its Siebel customer relationship management software import and export data from Google Docs , said Dipock Das , a senior director with Oracle 's CRM group .

US combat troops may stay in northern Iraq after a deadline for them to pull back by the end of June has passed , the top US commander in the area has said .
[ efoods ]
Col Gary Volesky said his soldiers would stay in Mosul and other nearby cities where al - Qaeda remained a threat if the Iraqi government asked them to .
US and Iraqi officials describe Mosul as al - Qaeda in Iraq ’s last major urban stronghold in the country .
Barack Obama has said he wants all US troops out of Iraq by the end of 2011 .
“ If the Iraqi government wants us to stay we will stay , ” said Col Volesky in a teleconference with journalists .

The recipe for this superlube has long been a closely guarded trade secret — until now .
Wired sent a can to the lab and got the ingredients .
Mineral Oil
Seriously .
WD - 40 is mostly a mix of baby oil , Vaseline , and the goop inside homemade lava lamps .
Decane
WD - 40 contains an abundance of alkanes — hydrocarbons that match the formula C x H 2x+2 , usually in a long , zigzagging chain .
This one , C 10 H 22 , which is also a common ingredient of gasoline , helps WD - 40 remain a liquid at cold temperatures .
Decane does n't freeze until around - 21 degrees Fahrenheit .
Nonane
Another alkane .
One reason these molecules are so handy here :
Their hydrogen atoms do n't hold a charge , so they can't connect to the hydrogen or oxygen in water , which makes alkanes water - repellent .
WD - 40 , after all , stands for " water displacement , 40th attempt . "
Our lab analyzed WD - 40 with gas chromatography ( GC ) and mass spectroscopy ( MS ) .
GC separates chemicals based on size , boiling point , and other factors , releasing them one by one over time .
MS then blasts the molecules with an electron beam and tells what 's what by the mass of the ionized fragments .
Tridecane and Undecane
Freeze - resistant ?
Check .
Water - repellent ?
Check .
Contains an alkane that is the major product of the red - banded stinkbug 's scent gland ?
Check !
Many alkanes are naturally produced by living creatures .
Undecane , part of the pheromone trail left by cockroaches and ants , is present .
Tetradecane
Another alkane !
Zzzzzz .
Dimethyl Naphthalene
Here 's the thing :
This stuff ( C 12 H 12 ) comes in 10 forms , called isomers .
One of them is a harmless hormone given off by potatoes .
Another is used in high - performance engineering plastics .
Our analysis can't determine which ones are present here , but if you 're using it as a solvent , as is likely the case with WD - 40 , they all work just fine .
Cyclohexane
That cyclo prefix means that unlike standard alkanes , which come in chains , this one 's a ring .
The shape gives cycloalkanes a higher melting point .
And huffing them will knock you out cold .
( Or so we 're told . )
Carbon Dioxide
The WD - 40 company claims that by using this gas as a propellant , it avoids using smaller gaseous alkanes ( possibly butane and propane ) , which can be hazardous to the environment .
As if CO 2 is n't .

We 've all been anxiously waiting for Kings to pick up the pace and leave its predictable beginnings behind .
With one quick text - message , our cast went from soap stars to believable characters .
Spoilers below .
Last night 's Kings finally stepped up to the plate and matched its over - the - top biblical dialogue with a twisty plot worthy of such lengthy banter and Ian McShane scenery - chewing .

Dirty deeds are being orchestrated behind our noble King Silas ' back .
And while the people of Gilboah yearn for peace with Gath , the price may be too high when Silas asks a small number of farmers ( who , coincidentally , include David 's family ) to part with their land .
Well it just so happens that this land was the territory that David 's Pappy gave his life for in the war , so no one is very happy , and one of David 's many disposable siblings joins the the rebellion and take the pier or port ( some sort of industrial type place ) hostage .
Meanwhile the devious brother - in - law , William Cross , is gathering up suits and military types to stage his little military coup .
Which includes buying up the broadcasting station so he can give it to the less - than - fortunate gay Prince Jack .

Just about every player in this alternate universe is fleshed out from the pilot 's two - dimensional shadows , and makes real steps towards acting less like a stereotype .
Jack starts angling himself , in a fairly smart manner , to crap upon his father 's policies , by gobbling up the formerly Silas - controlled press .
The King reveals he 's smarter than he seemed , the scary guy from The Last of the Mohicans gets a bit more interesting , Tomasina steps up her game and dares to confront the King in her own way .
Even the fresh - faced David learns how to put his morals to one side , and do what 's right ( or wrong ) for his King .
And trust me , after weeks of watching old country mouse do the right thing again and again , it was wonderful to watch him deliver the eviction news to his family , followed by a speech about how it'll " make him love our king even more " - then turn around and ask Silas what more he could possibly give to his leader .
That 's using a character 's flawless perfection to the story 's advantage .

With a few guns , Silas squashed the resistance and opened up a handful of ministry positions at his not - so - round table .
These doors opened up to Jack , and let 's guess Tomasina , the sexy new rich character who 's motivations remain to be seen - but let 's hope the princess is n't included , because frankly she bores me to tears right now .
Still , I 'll keep my mouth halfway shut until we find out what this mysterious " oath " is that she took so many years ago .
Either way , the secret police murders opened up a lot of doors for Kings to start delving into the ugly underside of this monarchy .
This episode , while not the most riveting of the bunch , raised the bar a little plot - wise .

And if this week did n't excite you , wait until William Cross ' evil child shows up next week .
Kamamara Matsuri or the Festival of the Steel Phallus is one of the most unique festivals in not only Japan but in the world .
It is held in Kawasaki and is celebrated annually on the first Sunday of Spring .
It is the most anticipated festival for both locals as well as many tourists from around the world .
The festive is sometimes referred to as “ the Penis Festival ” for obvious reasons , and the people who participate are sometimes known as “ dickheads ” .
They come in search of any and all “ Phallus ” related material whether it be in the form of memorabilia or just a photo opportunity , as shown below .
So , what is the origin of the “ Penis Festival ” ?
I was told my Japanese friend , the festival was originally started as a form of protection against STDs which I guess no condoms back then !
Well , they say a picture is worth a thousand words , so I hope the below photographs will bring you a little closer to understanding this very unique festive 😀

When a sector on a disk gets damaged , it becomes unusable .
Modern disks have spare sectors that are used to replace these bad sectors , so they ’re handled and fixed automatically .
If you ’re young enough , you might never have witnessed these bad sectors , because modern hardware handles them transparently , but there ’ still there .
I ’ll show you how to store data in “ fake ” bad blocks .
This is part 3 in a series on how to hide your data .
Warning :
Do n’t rely on this tutorial actually hiding your data .
This is for academic and experimental purposes only .
Always complement using encryption and plausible deniability methods like TrueCrypt .
When the disk runs out of spare sectors , or never had any in the first place ( like 3.5 ” disks , or very old hard disks ) , the filesystem is the second line of defense .
Inside the filesystem is a list of known bad blocks – blocks on bad sectors .
The filesystem takes care not to use these blocks and just skips them .
We can’t force the disk to remap certain blocks to spare sectors , but we can tell the filesystem which blocks have ( supposedly ) gone bad .
If the blocks are n’t really damaged , any data we put there will never be touched , because the filesystem thinks it ’s garbage anyway .
That , is exactly what we ’re going to do .
Practical
To keep it simple and fast , we ’ll hide a whole partition inside a burst of bad blocks .
The partition we ’ll create has to be small and reside somewhere in the middle of the disk .
We ca n’t put the partition at the beginning or the end of the disk , because most likely the filesystem requires an intact header at the start and end of the partition .
The partition has to be small enough to be able to fit inside the non-secret partition while not arousing suspicion .
Some operating systems mark bad blocks as used blocks , which means if we put a 100 MB partition inside bad blocks , the “ parent ” filesystem will always have at least 100 MB in use .
This could arouse suspicion when there are n’t any files on it .
I ’ll be using my trusty 256MB Compactflash card for this , which is excellent for illustratory purposes .
Here ’s what sfdisk has to say about it :
$ sudo sfdisk - l / dev/sde Disk / dev/sde : 1009 cylinders , 9 heads , 56 sectors / track Units = cylinders of 258048 bytes , blocks of 1024 bytes , counting from 0 Device Boot Start End #cyls #blocks Id System / dev/sde1 0 - 0 0 0 Empty / dev/sde2 0 - 0 0 0 Empty / dev/sde3 0 - 0 0 0 Empty / dev/sde4 0 - 0 0 0 Empty
We can see the card is comprised of 1009 cylinders .
I want to create a partition of about 20 MB , which is about 82 cylinders on this disk ( see the second line of sfdisk - l ) .
Because we ca n’t create the partition at the start of the disk , let ’s put it 214 cylinders in :
$ sudo sfdisk / dev/sde << EOF 214,82,6 EOF
Just like before , put FAT16 on it and transfer your secret data .
$ sudo mkfs.vfat - F16 /dev/sde1 mkfs.vfat 2.11 ( 12 Mar 2005 )
If you want , you can copy the current partition table to the back of the disk for easy restoring , just like in the previous article .
Unmount it , and remove the partition :
$ sudo sfdisk / dev/sde << EOF 0,0,0 EOF
Now create the parent partition .
This should at least encompass the whole secret partition .
If you ’ve copied the partition table to the back of the disk , make sure to leave at least the last cylinder free .
$ sudo sfdisk / dev/sde << EOF ,,6 EOF
Creating Bad Blocks
We need to calculate what blocks our secret partition resides on so we can mark them as bad .
We know it starts at cylinder 214 and is 82 cylinders in size .
Since on this disk , a cylinder is 258048 bytes big , the secret partition starts at byte 55222272 .
Divide this by the size of one block , which is 1024 bytes , and we get block 53928 .
Do the same for the size of the partition , and we find that 82 cylinders equal 20664 blocks .
Now we know our partition starts at block 53928 and ends at block 74592 .
We ’ll use a margin of 10 blocks on each side just in case our calculations are n’t precise .
Since we ’re putting a FAT16 filesystem on it , we need to tell mkfs.vfat what blocks have supposedly gone bad .
This is done by using a bad blocks file , which is a text - file with the address of each bad block on a new line .
Let ’s create our bad blocks file :
$ seq 53918 74602 > /tmp/badblocks
If you open / tmp / badblocks , you should see something like this :
53918 53919 53920 53921 ...
To create the filesystem , we pass the bad blocks file using the -l parameter :
$ sudo mkfs.vfat -n " Camera " -l /tmp/ badblocks /dev/sde1 mkdosfs 2.11 ( 12 Mar 2005 ) 20685 bad blocks
That ’s it !
You can now use your disk to your heart ’s delight , nothing will touch your secret partition .
One awesome way is to put the card in your camera and take some pictures with it .
Your data will remain safe , and there ’ll be nothing suspicious about a 4GB card “ missing ” some megabytes .
Revert
If you ’ve smuggled your secret data across state borders , you ’re ready to recover the secret partition .
Just recreate the partition table to contain the secret partition :
$ sudo sfdisk / dev/sde << EOF 214,82,6 EOF
That ’s it !
You can even reuse the setup : by switching partition tables you ’re effectively changing which partition is “ active ” on your card , and changing data in either partition wo n’t affect the other .
Advantages
Pretty much undetectable
Infinitely reusable
Bad blocks are less suspicious than unallocated space
Disadvantages
Just under two months ago , the Miami Heat were the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs with critics wondering if head coach Erik Spoelstra ’s team would be able to make it out of their first round series .

Goodbye skinny metrosexuals , the beefcake is back
Metrosexual twigmen who admire your shoes are all very well in good times , but when the going gets tough , what you actually want is a REAL man , says Tanya Gold .
As I stick my head out of my window , I smell a change in the evening air .
Everywhere I look big , dark , hairy , slightly fat men are staring at me - from advertising billboards , cinema screens and the pages of glossy magazines .
They growl , they glower , they exude menace and demonic sex appeal .
I wonder , could it be - could it really be - that the beefcake is back ?
Every credit crunch cloud has a silver lining .
We are already saying goodbye to haute cuisine , ugly , overpriced handbags and £ 60 knickers .
Why did we ever pay so much for a bit of ribbon and a label ?
What was wrong with us ?
Were we mad ?
Brawn again : Muscular hunks like model David Gandy ( above ) are back
We are kissing hello to supermarket own brands , holidays in Cornwall , making do and mending , and knitting .
Even Scrabble is making a comeback .
And , best of all things - better than Christmas every day , better than a pay rise , better than me - men who look as if they might actually be men are back .
Goodbye metrosexual twigman with your sad little manbag - you never did it for me - and hello beefcake beast .
Where have you been ?
It should come as no surprise .
Economic depressions have always walked hand in hand with the worship of raw machismo .
That is just the way it goes .
Ask Hollywood , if you do n't believe me .
Who was the No. 1 box office star of the troubled Thirties ?
Fred Astaire with his tiny feet and silly hats ?
Not a chance .
It was dark , dangerous Clark Gable ( he of ' Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn ' ) with rugged Spencer Tracy - a man who looked as if he'd kill anyone who would n't serve him a drink - right behind him .
The next big recession was the Seventies , when Hollywood gave us Robert De Niro , Gene Hackman and Jack Nicholson , none of whom you 'd want to throw a punch at .
The era also produced Burt Reynolds .
He was so masculine he was just testosterone with a face stuck on .
And this time it 's no different .
Leonardo DiCaprio and Ed Norton - chinless drips the both of them - are ebbing away in the popular consciousness .
They have been replaced by Hugh Jackman , the massive Australian with the massive chest , and Clive Owen , the British Sin City star with the nasty growl .
Sylvester Stallone ( right ) has seemingly risen from the dead to make another movie .
Hugh Jackman ( left ) is the massive Australian with the massive chest
We also have Jon Hamm , the gorgeous one from TV show Mad Men , and even Sylvester Stallone as Rambo has seemingly risen from the dead to make another movie .
And this time he has bigger arms than ever .
If Sylvester Stallone is part of the zeitgeist , then the beefcake must be back .
In the fickle fashion industry , things are changing , too .
In the affluent Nineties , the men on the billboards simply shrank .
They were tiny , childlike men with no body hair and spindly legs .
They had concave faces , hollow cheekbones , jutting hips and the open , bewildered expressions of children .
They were the size zero men , men by genitals alone , and to me they were as sexy as toast .
They looked ill .
They looked dead .
By 2005 you could put the average male model in a matchbox and still have room for all his friends .
The king of the twigmen , Russian model Stas Svetlichnyy , was 6ft and weighed 10st .
Ten stone ?
That is disgusting .
Yet , back then , he was so popular that even fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld decided to lose a third of his body weight to get the ' Stas ' size zero look .
In the Nineties we had Jarvis Cocker of Pulp .
Now he just looks like a girl - and not a pretty girl either .
In fact , he looks like a girl on the run from an eating disorder unit .
But how we drooled and screamed and tried to rip his manbag off his scrawny frame .
We also had to put up with James Blunt as the popular icon of manhood in the early Noughties .
I met him a few years ago at a party and I towered over him .
He only came up to my knee .
And what about Michael Jackson ?
First , he decided he wanted a white face , then a woman 's face and , finally , no face at all .
And do n't even get me started on David Beckham .
A man in a skirt ?
What went wrong ?
But that is all over .
Fashion has spun , mutated and spat out beefcake .
Yes , he is back .
Back !
I scream it with joy from the rooftops - back !
Male icons will no longer weigh less than me .
In fashion , twigman has gone , to be replaced by David Gandy , the male model of now .
I find it hard to pay attention to male models - I always forget a pretty face - but even I can see that Gandy , the Dolce & Gabbana model from Essex with the tiny white pants , looks like a Mexican bandit on steroids .
He looks as if he'd cut your throat for 10 p and a packet of crisps and then give the entire female readership of the Daily Mail a fireman 's lift into work .
I have always fancied men like him .
Even when I was a tweenager , I yearned not for Rick Astley , but for Orson Welles as Mr Rochester in the Forties version of Jane Eyre .
Yes , he was fat - he apparently had to take a steam bath every night and wear a corset to squeeze him - self into his costume - but he stomped around Thornfield like a dog with toothache , his cloak flapping in the wind .
A new heart - throb from the world of TV , Mad Men's Jon Hamm
I can't imagine Jarvis Cocker doing anything in the wind , except falling over and getting his mummy to bandage his head .
But why has the beefcake returned ?
Why has Bruce Banner become Hulk again ?
What has brought him back ?
It 's simple .
It 's so simple even David Gandy could understand it .
The ' rise of the drip ' was clearly an expression of our collective affluence .
In the last boom , we had computers , call centres and automation - and money , so much money , to do everything for us .
We lived in a highly sophisticated , fantastical , touch - screen culture where beefcake man was surplus to requirements .
( OK , you might occasionally see one in a garage , stuck under a car , wielding a spanner , but it was rare . )
Everyone seemed to want to be gay and middle class , even the men who were straight and working class .
You could n't squeeze into a bar without being slapped with an over - styled Paul Smith suit and a noxious cloud of girl cologne .
In this sexless world of money and style , beefcake was nowhere .
Because you do n't need a beefcake if you live in a penthouse with blinds that go up and down at the touch of a button .
Beefcake looks weird in such a setting .
Beefcake looks sad .
Beefcake has nothing to do .
He does n't belong and he knows it .
Better to have a girl - man who looks like Keira Knightley and can discuss all your consumerist junk with you .
' Look , ' says the perfect Nineties man .
' Shoes ! '
Ugh .
It was not a good time for dating .
But things have changed .
Our economy is splintering , our seas are rising and house prices are falling .
Look away from the page and look back .
Yes , your house just lost another £ 50 in value .
We are afraid , and we should be .
So what do we do ?
We should choose beefcake .
Fashion has decreed it .
In times of hardship and uncertainty , what sane woman wants to cuddle up to a man she knows she could beat in a fight ?
Who needs a sensitive accountant when all the money is going ?
Who needs a man to talk shoes when all the shoes have gone ?
In times of hardship and uncertainty , what sane woman wants to cuddle up to a man she knows she could beat in a fight ?
( Above Daniel Craig as James Bond )
It is better to have a man who can mend things for you .
And butcher sheep .
And build houses and grow vegetables and make things out of bits of wood .
Wo n't you feel safer ?
Wo n't you feel better , knowing that there is a serious lump of muscle between you and the cold , cruel world outside ?
Then there is sex .
Shopping may be dead , but sex is one of the few commodities that is booming .
All the supermarkets are reporting increased condom sales .
Because sex is a cheap form of entertainment and it is also comforting .
I believe the boom and all the aspirational rubbish that went with it was essentially about denying who we were .
Look , I have a handbag / dress / car / tiara fit for a princess !
Except I was n't a princess , I was a journalist .
And now I am a journalist in a lot of debt .
And now we can't afford to pretend to be other people , we can have better relationships .
A real person with another real person ?
Who could believe it ?
Hardship gives great love , if you let it .
Do you remember the Blitz ?
Everyone had great sex in the Blitz , even my Auntie Marie , who hated men .
And who do you have sex with ?
Big , brawny , hairy men , proper men , that 's who .
When did we start thinking masculinity was threatening ?
Probably when Mummy said we had to marry a lawyer / accountant / doctor to buy us all the rubbish we now can't afford , and we do n't need anyway
Now a sensible Mummy will say : ' Marry a man who is nifty with a drill , darling .
A man who can dig a well .
Because in the dark times coming , you wo n't need someone to do your VAT returns .

So John Calipari is apparently the new head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats .
Let ’s celebrate with some cake !
As you may know , this is what the Kentucky Wildcats logo looks like :
And this is the unfortunate cake that some poor Wildcats fan once received ( via Cake Wrecks ) :
Wow , that thing is a mess , just like Kentucky was this season .
John Calipari is going to have a bit of a cleanup ahead of him .
He can start with the icing .

We have information and reports on members of our community whom been arrested and waiting for execution for the crimes of homosexuality ...
Raids by the Iraqi police and Ministry of Interior forces cost our group [ to the extent of ] disappearing and killing of 17 members working for Iraqi - LGBT since 2005 .
The death penalty has been increasing at an alarming rate in Iraq since the new Iraqi regime reintroduced it in August 2004 .
In 2008 , at least 285 people were sentenced to death , and at least 34 executed .
In 2007 at least 199 people were sentenced to death and 33 were executed , while in 2006 at least 65 people were put to death .
The actual figures could be much higher as there are no official statistics for the number of prisoners facing execution .
Homosexuality is prohibited almost everywhere in the Middle East , but conditions have become especially dangerous for gays and lesbians in Iraq since the rise of religious militias after U.S. - led forces toppled Saddam Hussein six years ago .
" Two young men were killed on Thursday .
They were sexual deviants .
Their tribes killed them to restore their family honour , " a Sadr City official who declined to be named said .
The police source who declined to be named said the bodies of four gay men were unearthed in Sadr City on March 25 , each bearing a sign reading " pervert " in Arabic on their chests .
Sermons condemning homosexuality were read at the last two Friday prayer gatherings in Sadr City , a sprawling Baghdad slum of some 2 million people .
The slum is a bastion of support for fiery Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al - Sadr and his Mehdi Army militia .
I remember when Bush and Cheney were floating plausible excuses for invading Iraq , one that stuck with the media shills and worked for a few undiscerning members of the public was how much better their vision of Iraq would be for women .
Saddam Hussein's Iraq was no paradise , to put it mildly -- especially not for even the mildest of regime opponents -- but it was secular and encouraged women to develop as independent beings rather than as chattel .
The Bush and Cheney crocodile tears for women soon gave way to a search for nuclear weapons and as the lot of women under a more backward theocratically - empowered coalition started to deteriorate , we did n't hear much from Bush or Cheney .
But at least therecrocodile tears for women .
Not even Cheney would have been so transparent as to claim that the invasion of Iraq would improve the lot of gay people .
Nor will he particularly care that their lot has significantly deteriorated under the puppet American regime .
It 's a crime to be gay in Bush 's liberated Iraq .
There are gay people in prison and slated for execution ... this week .
Ali Hili of Iraqi-LGBT , speaking in London , after his civil rights group was banned from Iraqi soil :
The American - trained security forces have not just rounded up gay people , they are also accused of using Bush - condoned " we do not torture " torture techniques .
Amnesty International says there are 128 people on death row and that there is no information on who they are or why they 're facing the death penalty .
Is the Obama administration going to tolerate this ?
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says " no , " at least in theory .
She says the persecution of gays wo n't be ignored by the new administration .
Speaking at the European Parliament she had some very lofty ideals : " Human rights is and always will be one of the pillars of our foreign policy .
And in particular , the persecution and discrimination against gays and lesbians is something that we take very seriously .
It is terribly unfortunate that right now in unfortunately many places in the world violence against gays and lesbians , certainly discrimination and prejudice are not just occurring but condoned and protected .
And we would hope that over the next few years we could have some influence in trying to change those attitudes . ”
In 1936 Spain was overrun by right wing extremists who went on a murderous rampage against , among others , gays .
The greatest poet in Spanish history , Federico García Lorca , was arrested by the fascists and executed on August 19 , 1936 , making the whole world a poorer place .
( His work was banned in his native country by the right - wing government until 1953 . )
Let 's hope civilized nations persuade Iraqi rightists not to murder the next García Lorca .
And let 's hope the Obama Administration helps .
Theydo something in Iraq , even if they can't in Iran .
But whether they do or they do n't , you can ... here PageOneQ reminds us that in the Iraq Bush created it is n't only the government murdering gay people .
Crazed fanatics in the delusional clergy encouraged the faithful to murder gay people -- and they did , at least half a dozen this week .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bank of America Corp CEO Kenneth Lewis testified under oath that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson pressured him to keep quiet about losses at Merrill Lynch & Co , which the bank was buying , the Wall Street Journal reported .
Testifying before New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo in February , Lewis said “ it was n’t up to me ” to reveal Merrill ’s fourth - quarter losses as they were becoming apparent in December , the newspaper said , citing a deposition transcript .
Shareholders of Merrill and Bank of America voted to approve the merger on December 5 , and the transaction closed on January 1 .
Bank of America subsequently reported that Merrill lost $ 15.84 billion in the fourth quarter .
At Bank of America ’s April 29 annual meeting , shareholders will vote on whether to force Lewis to step down as chairman of the largest U.S. bank or leave its board , because of Merrill and a falling share price .
Many critics also want Lewis to give up the chief executive job , which he has held since 2001 .
The Journal said Lewis testified that Bernanke and Paulson told him the merger needed to go through and that any failure would “ impose a big risk to the financial system ” of the United States .
Cuomo ’s office is expected to release the deposition transcript to federal regulators and overseers of bank bailout money today , the newspaper said .
Bank of America shares have lost three - fourths of their value since the Merrill purchase was announced September 15 .
Merrill ’s losses triggered a federal bailout of Bank of America , including $ 20 billion of new capital , in January .
According to the Journal , a person in government familiar with Bernanke ’s talks with Lewis said the Fed chairman did not offer advice on disclosure , suggesting instead that Lewis consult his own counsel .
The newspaper quoted Paulson ’s spokeswoman as saying Paulson repeatedly told Lewis that “ the U.S. government was committed to ensuring that no systemically important financial institution would fail . ”
Bank of America did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
A spokesman told the newspaper that the bank “ had no legal obligation ” to disclose its talks with the government , and that disclosure “ likely would have severely disrupted the global financial markets and damaged the bank . ”

The US and Israel are on parallel paths .
Each is now a base of operations for the Illuminati , and each will be discarded as a nation - state entity once their usefulness to the cause of the New World Disorder has been served , or at least that is the plan .
Our nations have become a den of vipers .
The corruption lies not with the common folk , but with their bought - and - paid - for or compromised leadership , while the common folk are kept in the dark by a corrupt media that is owned and controlled exclusively by the Illuminati .
Both the US and Israel have created the best enemies that money can buy , because the objective is to cause as much bloodshed and destruction as possible , for as long as possible , in order to provide fun and profits for the benefit of their respective military - industrial complexes .
After all , you need a scapegoat on which to blame the destruction and loss of life that is necessary to rake in trillions of dollars in war profits , to implement genocides and population control agendas , to exert your political will , to rob other nations of their resources and to satisfy the limitless bloodlust of the satanic , megalomaniacal , trillionaire sociopaths who run the shadow governments in both the US and Israel .
The Illuminati , however , have conspired to achieve their objectives while simultaneously preventing the US and Israel from becoming too powerful , prosperous and independent to want to surrender their sovereignty in favor of world government .
After all , why would the people of any free and prosperous nation with superior military and economic prowess on a global basis ever succumb to a one - world , Marxist - fascistic , Orwellian police state of feudality ?
That is why our respective militaries have been forced to suffer nothing but losses , stalemates and incomplete victories since the end of WWII .
This process of implementing wars for profit without achieving too much military power and economic independence has been achieved by hamstringing US and Israeli military operations with incomplete or scaled - back objectives , moronic rules of engagement , insufficient manpower and equipment and implementation of defective military strategies which ensure that operations will devolve into a complete cluster - f--k , thus always snatching defeat from the jaws of victory .
Why did Roosevelt provoke the Japanese , and allow them to destroy our battleships in Pearl Harbor , while the carriers were conveniently on maneuvers off shore ?
Was is because he was worried the Japanese might find out we had broken their code , or was it to hamstring our navy to make sure the war would drag on in the Pacific for years to ensure that the Illuminist military - industrial complex made mega-profits and took us out of the Depression which the Illuminists themselves had caused ?
Could n't we have prevented the attack , saved several thousand lives and used the old ships until the new ones were built , and still have beaten the snots out of the Japanese ?
Did Admiral Kimmel have to be disgraced ?
Why did we ship defective weapons to nationalist forces in China , thus allowing the communist forces to take over after WWII ?
Why was General Patton assassinated by our own military when he sought to push the soviets back to their own borders , and why did we then set communist Russia up with a new kingdom in the Yalta sellout of Eastern Europe ?
Why did we abandon the Hungarian freedom fighters at the last second in 1956 and allow the communists in Soviet Russia to slaughter them ?
Why did we not bomb the Chinese troops in North Korea for a sure victory as desired by General MacArthur , who was later disgraced by the evil Illuminist puppet , Harry Truman , instead settling for a division of Korea into North and South sectors by a demilitarized zone which we still occupy to this day ?
Why did we cut short the TET Offensive in Vietnam , which would have brought us to a complete victory according to the leading North Vietnamese General who admitted he and his troops would have been done for , thus settling for a later loss instead after a long , bloody and expensive war ?
Why did we stop short of taking Baghdad in the First Gulf War ?
Was it because we were winning too speedily with too few casualties for the Illuminists to make their usual gargantuan war profits ?
Was there not enough bloodshed to quench their thirst the Illuminati 's thirst for blood ?
Why did we use depleted uranium in both Gulf Wars so as to sicken and kill our own troops ?
Was it to make the medical and pharmaceutical industries flush with cash and to cut pensions short , thus saving hundreds of billions of dollars ?
Was it to reduce the number of patriotic veterans who might violently object to the implementation of world government ?
Why did it take more time to beat a bunch of rag - head terrorists in Iraq and Afghanistan numbering in the mere tens of thousands than it took to win WWII ?
Why did we use a small fraction of the number of troops recommended by our senior military commanders for the so - called War on Terror ?
Why were our troops continually ill - equipped and running excessively long tours of duty ?
Was it because we wanted to extend the war and wear out our military in order to reduce the number of US troops , and the potential for objection to world government by our patriotic veterans , by replacing them with mercenary killers who could care less ?
Why did we cause a civil war on top of the war to remove Saddam , due to the supposed errors in judgment that were made in our strategies for conquest ?
Was it to extend the war while channeling hundreds of billions to Illuminist contractors and mercenaries via no -bid contracts ?
Why did Clinton give our nuclear secrets to the Chinese ?
Are you beginning to get the picture ?
In 1947 to 1948 , Israel was sold out by Britain as it gave up possession of Palestine , which left them with indefensible borders and a country less than ten miles wide in some sections , thereby ensuring continual conflict with the Arabs .
This vicious redrawing of borders to foment conflict is something the British Black Nobility are experts at after centuries of practice .
They thought that the Arabs would destroy Israel which was becoming a thorn in their side because they wanted a piece of the Middle East oil action , and Israel was putting a crimp in their plans .
But then Israel won miraculously in the face of an overwhelming attack by several Arab nations simultaneously , and Truman saw his chance to use Israel to gain a foothold in the Middle East , a base of operations for Illuminists of the US faction .
Incidentally , Britain lost virtually its entire empire after screwing Israel , a nice bit of poetic justice and divine retribution for their treachery .
But Israel did not press its advantage , winning by simply surviving , in its first war with the surrounding Arab states .
Many of the Palestinians left the Palestinian territories bordering on Israel during this conflict , thinking that Israel would be easily defeated and that they would get to take over all the Israeli lands , as well as get their own back .
Their desire to get this abandoned land back is the basis for the so - called " right of return . "
Frankly , in attacking Israel , the Arabs forfeited their rights to their own lands by failing to respect Israel 's borders , as did the Palestinians by cooperating in the war to destroy Israel .
The surrounding Arab states could and should have taken all the displaced Palestinians in , but instead left a good portion of them along Israel 's new occupied lands as a hemorrhoid for Israel to deal with , allowing their Arab brethren to live in poverty and squalor rather than take them in after telling them to leave and then losing the war .
They use the Palestinian territories as a base from which they can terrorize Israel and eventually destroy them .
They have no intention of giving Israel peace , but instead want to take them apart piece by piece via the corrupt Oslo process and the so - called Roadmap to Peace , which should be termed the Roadmap to Israel 's Destruction .
In its 1967 Six Day War , which was a preemptive strike by Israel in an act of self - preservation against Arab states massing troops along its miniscule borders , Israel could have been more aggressive , but they pulled back and started negotiating with the Arabs after less than a week of fighting , when they could have extended their borders and made them more defensible .
Why ?
Was it because the US insisted to protect its US oil interests with the Arabs ?
Was it because , in any case , the US Illuminists did not want Israel to become too powerful and extend their borders too far , because they wanted to destroy Israel when they had finished using it as a base of operations for Middle East conquest ?
Why did the US withhold aid from Israel in the 1973 Yom Kippur War until it was almost too late , thereby almost destroying Israel in the process ?
Was it because Kissinger , Nixon 's Secretary of State , wanted to bloody Israel 's nose to show them who was boss , and that they had better do as they were told , or else ?
Why , after Israel blew through Lebanon in the First Lebanon War and surrounded Arafat and his PLO , did they allow him to escape to Libya ?
Why did they tolerate the PLO for so many years when they could have easily eliminated them ?
Why did they allow Hamas to be eligible for elective office when they are sworn to the destruction of Israel ?
In the second Lebanon War , why did they use a tiny fraction of the forces used in the First Lebanon War against an enemy that was far more entrenched and dug in than in the first war ?
Was it because they were not supposed to win at the insistence of the US ?
Were they told to keep Hezbollah in place to keep fomenting terror and trouble , thus generating profits for the US and Israeli military - industrial complexes ?
Why does the US fund Saudi Arabia which then funds Hamas ' operations ?
Is it not convenient for oil companies to have an excuse to gouge consumers every time the Middle East ignites in conflict ?
Is not the whole peace process just a way to dismantle Israel after US and Israeli Illuminists are finished with it ?
You better believe it !!!
Are you starting to get the picture again ?
The fact that the US is the top - ranked military power in the world , and that the Israeli military is the top - ranked military in the Middle East , is no coincidence .
Israel , of course , derives much of its strength from money and aid provided by the US , and it is , in essence , a satellite base for the Illuminist operation to create a region of oil hegemony in the Middle East where oil is the cheapest , and therefore the most profitable , to extract .
Additionally , the control of this crucial resource provides great political clout and the opportunity for economic extortion in the great play for power .
Russia is currently doing something similar with natural gas .
Once the Illuminati have control of the world 's most prolific and profitable oil supply , they can use it to force other nations , as well as their own people , to accept one - world government by turning off the taps , by driving the price up to extortionate levels or by driving the price down to levels that are economically unsustainable for competing nations who would prefer to pass on a one - world system .
In addition to the manufactured wars for profit and the attempt to put a stranglehold on critical commodities and other resources , is the Illuminist economic destruction agenda which is being played out right before your eyes in the US and around the world .
This destruction was brought about by the intentional creation of a conspiratorial daisy chain of fraud throughout the mortgage and consumer loan industries via derivatives traded in the unregulated OTC derivatives market , accompanied by intentional regulatory failures by the Fed and the elitist bootlickers in our government along with legislative machinations that opened the Pandora 's Box previously closed and locked by Glass - Steagall , AND NOT BY UNINTENTIONAL MISCALCULATIONS OR ERRORS IN JUDGMENT --- THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE DOING !!!
Just in time for Easter , a cracked brown egg , believed to be the last of a batch personally collected and then cackhandedly packed by Charles Darwin during his voyage on the Beagle , has turned up in the collection of Cambridge University 's zoology museum .
The egg was found by a volunteer , Liz Wetton , who has been helping to catalogue the museum 's gigantic collection of birds ' eggs for ten years .
She sorted , labelled and carefully repacked the egg , recording the fact that it bore the handwritten inscription C Darwin , and then moved on to the next drawer .
It was only when collections manager Mathew Lowe was reviewing her work that he realised the specimen was unique .
With Mike Brooke , curator of ornithology , he traced the acquisition of the egg back to the notebook of a late 19th century zoology professor , Alfred Newton , a friend of Darwin and his son Frank .
The notebook also proved , lest anyone doubt her , that Wetton 's handling of the egg was blameless , the damage was done over 150 years earlier .
Newton recorded : " One egg , received through Frank Darwin , having been sent to me by his father who said he got it at Maldonado and that it belonged to the Common Tinamou of those parts . "
" The great man put it into too small a box , and hence its unhappy state . "
Tinamous are related to rheas and ostriches , though they can fly .
They are now more commonly known as Nothura , and one is named in the naturalist 's honour , Nothura darwinii .
Darwin would have stolen his specimens from a male bird , which incubate the eggs and raise the chicks .
It was the extraordinary variety of adaptations of species to their surroundings which fascinated the young naturalist on his five - year journey around the world on the Beagle .
He brooded over his observations for years - until he finally published On The Origin of Species in 1859 .
" To have discovered a Beagle specimen in the 200th year of Darwin 's birth is special enough , but to have evidence that Darwin himself broke it is a wonderful twist , " Lowe said .
So as some of you may know , Digger got nominated for a Hugo award this year , thanks to a whole lot of seriously awesome people who cast nominating ballots , entirely without me knowing it was even eligible .
This was very , very nice of them .
“ But Ursula ! ” you say .
“ The only thing better than a Hugo nomination is an actual Hugo award !
How do I vote for Digger ?
Can I vote for Digger ? ”
I ’m so glad you asked .
Because yes , O reader , you CAN vote for Digger if you so desire — Hugos are a…well , not exactly democratic process , more of a republic , really , because it costs money .
In order to vote for the Hugos , you have to get a supporting membership at Worldcon 2012 ( or have had one for 2011 , or something complicated like that . )
This costs you $ 50 and you get to vote in the Hugos .
Now , if that was all you got , I would say “ Dude , ‘ Hugo - nominated ’ still has the word ‘ Hugo ’ in it , I do n’t need to win that bad , fifty bucks is a lot of money , if it ’s burning a hole in your pocket , please donate it to preserve jumping slug habitat or something . ”
However , you actually get a lot for the money , because they give you the Hugo Voter Packet .
And this includes e-book copies of a whole bunch of the nominees , ( including the whole damn run of Digger , in PDF form , as assembled by my enormously talented publisher Jeff ) so it works out to a lot of books that are currently in hardcover , a slew of novellas and short stories , some comics — in short , a lot more than $ 50 worth of content .
Which means that I can say , without feeling too much guilt , “ Hey , you can vote for Digger if you want to spend $ 50 and it ’s actually really worth it , because you get copies of some of the very best speculative fiction of the year for the money . ”
So , that ’s how you vote for Digger if you are so inclined .
If you ca n’t afford to , please feel absolutely no guilt whatsoever , it does not make you any less dedicated a fan , I am just as happy to have you reading as anybody else , and there were many years when I could n’t have spent fifty CENTS to vote on something , let alone fifty bucks , so believe me , I understand completely and please , please , do n’t apologize .
And if you can afford to , then thank you very much , and if you ’re not interested in the voter packet , then hey , how ’bout those jumping slugs , huh ?
In the Ozark Mountain town of Rogers , Ark. , more than 250 business owners gathered for lunch at a construction company last month to focus on what they saw as a major threat -- a proposal in Congress to make it easier to form labor unions .
At each place setting , attendees found pre-stamped postcards and pre-written letters to be sent to Arkansas ’ U.S. senators , Democrats Mark Pryor and Blanche Lincoln , who had supported the labor bill in the past .
After lunch , the business owners were ushered to computers to send e-mail messages as well .
Five days later came the good news : Two Senate votes had been stripped from the pro-union bill .
Lincoln said she would oppose it outright , while Pryor declared the current version “ dead ” and said he would look for compromises .
Today , thanks to those and other defections , key components of the bill are in serious jeopardy .
And the legislation has produced one of the biggest surprises in Washington since Democrats swept the White House and Congress :
The nation ’s labor unions , which organized so effectively last year to help elect President Obama , have been outmaneuvered so far on their top priority by their opponents in the business community .
Advertisement
“ We were outspent , outhustled and outorganized , ” said one chagrined union advisor who was not authorized to speak by name .
“ The legislation is severely challenged , ” said John Wilhelm , hospitality president of Unite Here -- the textile , hotel and culinary workers ’ union .
“ The unified business community has been so strident about the issue , they have effectively achieved solidarity among Republican senators . ”
The labor movement , somewhat divided , he said , has let Democratic support drift away .
No legislation is more important to the unions than the Employee Free Choice Act , which would ease the rules for forming bargaining units and , union leaders believe , help the depleted labor movement gain new members .
Under its core provisions , unions could start a new bargaining unit at a company if a majority of workers simply signed cards requesting one , a process known as “ card check . ”
Advertisement
The new system would eliminate the company ’s option to call for secret ballot elections , which union officials have long argued give companies the ability to manipulate and intimidate workers before a unionization vote .
Businesses fear that card check would leave workers vulnerable to coercion by union officials .
Organized labor believed it could push card check into law .
In 2007 , the measure passed the House and gained more than 40 cosponsors in the Senate .
Now , with even more Democrats in the Senate and Obama in the White House , the unions saw the odds in their favor .
Obama ’s campaign stump speech last fall included strong support for the legislation .
Advertisement
But once he was elected , labor leaders made a fateful decision .
Originally , they had planned to keep in place their extensive network of field organizers , who had just worked to elect Democratic candidates , and ask them to build pressure on lawmakers to vote for card check .
Instead , they changed course .
The labor groups scaled back , partly to give Obama time to get his bearings amid the deepening economic crisis .
Business groups , meanwhile , had started work well before the election and did not stop .
They feared that card check would lead to new unions and higher labor costs .
Opponents included retailers , such as Bentonville , Ark. - based Wal - Mart , as well as restaurant chains , construction firms and hotels .
More than 500 business and conservative organizations had formed the Coalition for a Democratic Workplace to coordinate an array of trade associations and other groups fighting card check .
Since 2007 , the umbrella group has spent as much as $ 10 million .
Its members include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which on its own earmarked $ 20 million in 2008 and 2009 to defeat card check , on top of $ 35 million to elect business - friendly lawmakers in 2008 .

Half a dozen other groups backed by corporate , GOP or conservative ideological interests have also joined the fray .
Before labor groups had fully engaged this winter , the allied business groups successfully cast the legislation as undemocratic :
How could Congress oppose secret - ballot elections ?
They also hired well - connected lobbyists .
For example , Wal - Mart , one of the nation ’s largest employers and a staunch foe of unionization efforts , deployed Lincoln ’s former chief of staff , as well as Pryor ’s former legislative director .
But the most important part of the business strategy was coaxing thousands of small companies to pressure their lawmakers , particularly moderate Democratic senators such as Lincoln and Pryor .
Soon , Democrats were complaining at their weekly caucus meetings of being whipsawed by the powerful lobbying on both sides .
The issue seemed to be everywhere .
Even at a meeting on agriculture , one Lincoln aide recalled , card check would be raised prominently .
Advertisement
When it came to key senators , business interests outmuscled labor .
Lincoln , for example , reported overwhelmingly more calls and letters from business interests and their supporters than from the union side .
And thanks to “ airlift ” programs run by the Chamber of Commerce and allied groups , some key senators received far more personal visits in Washington from card - check opponents than from supporters .
Ten airlifts came from Arkansas alone -- on top of the 100 Arkansas business officials who arrived in April for an annual dinner with the state ’s delegation .
The unions stepped up their pressure .
On a frigid , blustery day in early April , 100 union members gathered outside Lincoln ’s office in Little Rock and chanted for her to support the legislation .
Advertisement
“ Who can give it to us ? ” a union organizer with a bullhorn asked .
“ Sen. Lincoln ! ” shouted the union members .
But it was too late .
Lincoln , the target of so many personal visits in Washington by business interests , had already decided to oppose the legislation .
Another target for both sides in the debate was Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , who was then a Republican .
Like Lincoln , he had cosponsored the card - check bill in 2007 .
Advertisement
Pressure on him came from groups such as the Pennsylvania Food Merchants Assn. , which represents grocery stores .
In March , it reported to its members that Specter appeared to be “ on the fence . ”
The group urged : “ Your associates , friends , family and neighbors should flood Sen .
Specter ’s office with letters , phone calls and e-mail messages . ”
Later that month , Specter announced that he would oppose the legislation in its current form .
At least a half - dozen senators who supported the legislation in 2007 either opposed the bill this year or expressed reservations .
That left the unions short of the 60 Senate votes they need to overcome a bill - blocking filibuster .
With its chances fading , labor became divided .
Wilhelm complained that another union , the Service Employees International Union , undermined labor unity by signaling openness to a compromise before the rest of the movement was consulted .
The SEIU rejected the criticism , with its president , Andy Stern , saying in an interview that he and other major unions coordinated closely on card check .
Advertisement
The legislation ’s chief sponsor , Sen . Tom Harkin ( D - Iowa ) , is trying to fashion a modified bill that can win the needed 60 votes .
One possible compromise : Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) , a former cosponsor who now has reservations about the bill , would retain the card - signing process for workers to form unions .
But , to ease concerns about coercion , she proposes that workers mail the cards to a third party rather than turn them in at the workplace .

Google will use its surveillance of web surfing habits to figure out which ads are best suited to each individual 's interests - a practice likely to illuminate just how much the internet search leader has been learning about millions of people around the world .
Under the program , someone who frequents sites about dogs might see more ads for flea treatment products even when visiting another web destination that has nothing to do with pets .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The tactic relies on technology that Google got last year in a $ 3.2 billion acquisition of the internet ad service DoubleClick .
Some of the opposition to the deal revolved around potential privacy intrusions , but Google overcame those misgivings during an extensive review to win regulators ' approval for the deal .
The ads , set to debut within the next few weeks , initially will appear on Google 's YouTube and thousands of other sites that belong to Google 's ad network .
Google is following major rivals like Yahoo and Microsoft that have already been customising ads based on the past activities of specific web browsers .
Until now , Google had been tying its ads solely to search requests and the general content on web pages .
Although Yahoo and Microsoft already have been tying ads to people 's presumed interests , Google 's embrace of this " behavioral " targeting is more troubling to privacy watchdogs .
That is because the Mountain View - based company already has used its dominant position in the internet search market to build a huge database of potentially sensitive information about the kinds of things that people are looking for on the web .
Now Google is taking it a step further by tracking people 's favourite websites to divine individual tastes and then package ads falling under the same areas of interest .
The company intensified its monitoring activity in December when it began putting a sliver of DoubleClick 's computer code , called a " cookie , " on its advertising partners ' websites .
" This is a very serious development , " said Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Centre .
" I do n't think the world 's largest search engine should be in the business of profiling people . "
Rotenberg is hoping Google 's embrace of behavioural targeting prompts the Federal Trade Commission to take another look at the DoubleClick acquisition and perhaps mandate privacy safeguards .
Hoping to avoid a backlash and appease regulators , Google has set up its system so individuals can specify their areas of interest or shun certain forms of advertising .
" We are pleased that our launch of interest - based advertising includes innovative , consumer - friendly features to provide meaningful transparency and choice for our users , " Nicole Wong , Google 's deputy general counsel , wrote in a blog posting .
The Progress & Freedom Foundation , a Washington - based think tank , applauded Google for creating a " gold standard " that puts the company 's stamp on behavioural targeting ads and provides clear explanations on how to avoid them .
The group brushed off the criticism of Google 's expansion into behavioural targeting as " paroxysms of privacy hysteria . "
Google is betting most people will enjoy seeing more ads catering to their interests .
In the process , Google is hoping it can boost its revenue , which climbed 31 per cent to nearly $ 22 billion last year despite a recession that hammered many of its customers and partners .
Anyone can also opt out of the targeting program , a choice that Google probably realizes the overwhelming majority of people wo n't take the time to do , said Jeff Chester , executive director of the Centre for Digital Democracy .
Both Yahoo and Microsoft also offer opt - out features .
Echoing a familiar sentiment among consumer activists , Chester believes people should be subjected to behavioural targeting only if they give their explicit permission .
" It would have been nice if Google had taken a stand against behavioural targeting instead of endorsing the model , " Chester said .
" We are now in an arms race of digital data collection where companies are trying to outdo each other in pursuit of the 21st century 's Holy Grail - advertising . "

About an hour 's bus ride northwest of Las Vegas , Area 51 is one of the most famous military bases in the world , in part because the government barely acknowledges its existence .
According to UFO lore , Area 51 , near Nevada State Route 375 , otherwise known as " Extraterrestrial Highway , " is where the Pentagon has , for decades , stored frozen extraterrestrials and recovered alien spacecraft .
In the movie " Independence Day , " it was where the heroes led a final attack against alien invaders .
But now that the CIA has started to declassify top secret programs developed at Area 51 , former military officers and engineers are beginning to shed some light on the enigmatic airfield and give the UFOlogists some new information to consider .
" No one really knew we existed , " said Thornton " T.D. " Barnes , 72 , a former special - projects engineer at Area 51 .
" Even our wives did n't know where we were going when we left Monday morning and came back Friday evening . "
A specialist in advance radar and Soviet MiG fighter aircraft , Barnes said he was tapped by the CIA to join a " cadre " of experts that could handle any kind of military project .
People Reported Seeing Flashes of Light
As an electronics engineer for NASA , he worked on the country 's first rocket plane , the X - 15 , the Apollo space capsule and lunar lander research vehicles .
At Area 51 , he helped develop the A - 12 OXCART , a super - secret spy plane built by the Lockheed Corporation .
Barnes said his colleagues conducted 2,850 test flights of the A - 12 out of Area 51 .
Traveling 2,200 mph at 90,000 feet , nothing could catch the planes .
But , he said , people would see flashes of light .
That , he thinks , is what started the rumors of an extraterrestrial safe haven .
In some ways , Barnes said , the UFO myths actually helped keep the site 's true activities under wraps .
" We considered it to be a bonus , " he said .
" They made it easier to conceal what we were doing . "
No ETs , No Alien Spacecraft , No Underground Tunnels ?
If anything , he emphasized , " We were the UFOs . "
In reality , he said , compared to previous positions with frequent missions , " Area 51 was the most boring place I ever worked . "
No aliens , no spacecraft from far - flung planets , no underground passageways , he said .
The only underground area he recalled was beneath a nuclear testing site at neighboring Jackass Flats .
Now that the OXCART program has been declassified , he and his colleagues are working with universities and government agencies to share their knowledge .
His program was one of the CIA 's better programs , he said , but as they declassified information , they realized just how much they did n't know and could n't share with the engineers working on similar projects today .
" They 're finding that a lot that we did under secrecy , they 're making the same mistakes again , " Barnes said .
Maybe They Just Didn't Know
Harry A. Martin , 77 , who supervised the fueling of the spy planes for four years , said his time at Area 51 was also one of the highlights of his career .
" I was real proud of what we accomplished , " he said .
" I 'd never worked with a group of people who were better than those . "
As for the aliens and UFOs , " people have an imagination , " he said .
" We laughed at it . "
But some UFO experts say the former insiders ' accounts do n't necessarily eliminate the possibility that Area 51 is indeed home to some UFO - related activities .
" Those guys who came forward may very well be telling the truth , with the caveat that they would n't know if there was something going on , " said Stanton T. Friedman , a nuclear physicist , lecturer and top UFO researcher .
Highly classified work is also highly compartmentalized , he said .
And the absence of evidence on their part is n't the same thing as the absence of evidence for such work , he suggested .
Americans Waking Up to the Reality of Government Secrets
Friedman said it 's still conceivable that wreckage from what some people believe was a UFO crash in Roswell , N.M. , could have been transported to Area 51 .
And , he added , " of course " the military has an underground base out there .
But , regardless of whether or not Area 51 is indeed connected to UFO activities , Friedman pointed out that the facility has captured the imagination of Americans for another important reason .
It has become a symbol of government secrets and the universe of information too sensitive for public consumption .
As a scientist for General Electric , Westinghouse , McDonnell Douglas and other high - tech companies , Friedman said he 's worked on a variety of classified projects that have shown him government secrets are a fact of life .
Area 51 is just one example of that .
" National security has a real place in all of this stuff .
There is no way to tell your friends without telling your enemies , " he said .
" A lot of Americans woke up to the fact that there 's a lot going on that they do n't get told about . "

American west threatened by more heatwaves than past models have predicted .
More heatwaves in the western United States ?
Utah Division of Water Resources
Extreme temperatures are expected to become more common in the western United States by 2040 if greenhouse gases continue to rise , researchers say .
Noah Diffenbaugh , a climate scientist at Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana , and his colleagues simulated climate change for the United States in decade - long periods from 2000 to 2039 using a climate model that divided the land into areas just 25 kilometres square .
It is the first time that the region 's temperature extremes have been modelled at such high resolution .
The new projections were reported on 26 May at the joint assembly of the American Geophysical Union in Toronto , Canada .
Some regions where high seasonal temperatures had occurred just once during the second half of the twentieth century are projected to experience extreme temperatures many times in a single decade , according to the model .
" The once - in - 50 - years event becomes the five - times - in - ten - year event , and in the western United States it is much higher than that — up to eight times per decade , " says Diffenbaugh .
Colorado , Arizona , New Mexico and Utah stand to be the most affected .
The new simulation indicates that the western United States will experience more temperature extremes than projected by the global climate models used in the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
Many of those models do not account for the topography of the region — which includes the Sierra Nevada Mountains , for example — in a realistic way , says Diffenbaugh .
Unknown effects
An increase in the frequency of temperature extremes could affect crops , river flow and electricity consumption in the western states .
For example , regions with the climatic conditions suitable for premium wine grape production might shift , shrink or even disappear with rising temperature extremes1 .
" If humans and ecological systems have adapted to the current climate and if they experience temperatures they have never before experienced , it may be a problem for some systems , " says Alan Robock , a climate scientist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , New Jersey .
" But Diffenbaugh does n't say which ones . "

N. Diffenbaugh
Earlier work by Diffenbaugh and his colleagues has projected that extreme heat events will at least triple in the Mediterranean during this century , with the greatest extreme temperature increases occurring in France and the Iberian Peninsula ( see ' Dangerous Hotspots ' ) .
In the new simulation , the increased frequency of extreme events occurs when the global temperature has risen by 1.2 ºC above the 2000 mean .
At the Climate Change Congress that took place in Copenhagen in March , climate scientists and policy - makers agreed a goal of keeping the global mean temperature to less than 2 ºC above that of pre-industrial times .
As the global mean temperature has increased by about 0.7 ºC since 1850 , that would still allow temperatures to rise by around a further 1.3 ºC — enough to trigger the more frequent heat events predicted by Diffenbaugh 's model .

" In terms of the targets that are necessary to avoid dangerous climate change , these results suggest that we may need a re-evaluation of those targets , " says Diffenbaugh .
To test the model , Diffenbaugh compared it with temperature extremes observed between 1951 and 1999 — and found that its predictions matched the occurrence of real temperature extremes more closely than the IPCC 's models .
But the likelihood of these increases in extreme temperatures occurring remains unclear .
High - resolution models that are embedded within global models , such as this one , are sensitive to how well the conditions at the boundaries of the two models are matched , says Gavin Schmidt , a climate modeller at NASA 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City , who did not see the new data that Diffenbaugh presented .
" Increasing resolution does n't necessarily increase predictability at the local scale , " Schmidt adds .
Although the Treasury Dept wo n’t be extending TARP financing to troubled automakers Chrysler and GM because they cannot be certified as “ financially viable , ” a different set of standards appears to apply to life insurance companies at death ’s door .
The life insurance companies ’ troubles do n’t extend from a sudden increase in mortality , but rather a combination of selling annuities with unsustainable rates and excessive bad bets in real estate and the stock market the companies made with premiums .
As their portfolios have plummeted , so too have their credit ratings , in turn making it harder for them to raise further capital .
Since TARP funding is only available to certain types of financial institutions , many insurance companies have been buying up the odd bank here and there in order to qualify .
Although stocks of troubled insurance companies have jumped with this news , it remains far from clear that an infusion of capital will resolve the underlying structural problems .
From the Wall Street Journal :
“ An injection of capital similar to the banks would provide enough capital for even the most thinly capitalized institutions to weather a prolonged and protracted credit cycle , ” Credit Suisse analyst Thomas Gallagher told clients in a note Wednesday .
He added “ one major caveat , ” however : an assumption that the S&P 500 does not drop materially below the 600 level .
Why the largess with insurers but not with carmakers ?
Insurers hold major stakes in bonds , up to 18 % of all outstanding corporate bonds , according to the American Council of Life Insurers .
As insurers have hoarded cash in the wake of the financial meltdown , they have held off buying new bonds .

Hibernate on your non-brandnew Mac
An interesting feature of the newish " hires " ( Double - Layer SD ) powerbooks announced in Oct 2005 is " Safe Sleep " support .
As well as keeping the ram active ( normal sleep ) , Safe Sleep writes the active memory to a file on disk so that even if the battery goes flat or is removed , the system state is preserved ( " hibernate " ) .
As long as the laptop has retained power when sleeping , it will wake up normally .
If you do n't care about how it works , click here to see how to enable it .
This feature is very much a software feature , not hardware — Linux actually calls it " Software Suspend " .
When 10.4.3 came out a few weeks after the PowerBooks , it seemed likely to have some new features ...
All testing was done on an iBook 1 GHz with 1.25 gigs ram , running 10.4.3 .
I assume other macs should work , though maybe only if kextstat shows the AppleKauaiATA driver ...
What makes it tick ?
First stop for 10.4.3 changes is the Darwin sourcecode .
In the xnu package ( the kernel itself ) , grepping for hibernate there 's a few files in the xnu-792.6.22 / iokit / Kernel / dir .
The most prominent is IOHibernateIO.cpp .
After a few failed attempts at getting it to hibernate to a file , it seemed that the ATA driver was missing support for IOPolledInterface .
Eventually , I figured that the AppleKauaiATA driver actually checks for a " has - safe - sleep " property of the " ata " device , and only enables the polled interface if that is set .
( This was confirmed from looking at ioreg - l - w 0 output from a new PowerBook 15 " ) .
Grepping for " has - safe - sleep " in / System / Library / Extensions , the AppleMacRISC2PE " Platform Expert " looks to be a likely candidate .
In there , we find a check :
( from MacRISC2.cpp ) : bool MacRISC2PE::platformAdjustService(IOService * service ) { bool result ; if ( IODTMatchNubWithKeys ( service , " kauai - ata " ) ) { IORegistryEntry * devicetreeRegEntry ; OSData * tmpData ; devicetreeRegEntry = fromPath ( " / " , gIODTPlane ) ; tmpData = OSDynamicCast ( OSData , devicetreeRegEntry ->getProperty ( " has - safe - sleep " ) ) ; if ( tmpData != 0 ) service -> setProperty ( " has - safe - sleep " , ( void *) 0 , ( unsigned int ) 0 ) ; }
In the new PowerBook ioreg output , there is indeed a root level item " has - safe - sleep " .
Faking it
First up , remember that this is n't supported by Apple .
There may be reasons why it 's been supported as a " hardware " feature only in new machines that I do n't know about — be cautious .
It seems to work fine on the majority of G4s , except 12 " 867MHz PowerBooks .
In order to create the " has - safe - sleep " property , we need to run something in Open Firmware at boot .
This is what nvramrc is good for , as used by other great hacks such as the iBook dual - head hack ( see down the bottom of that page ) .
The basic openfirmware command is
" / " select - dev
" something " encode - string " has - safe - sleep " property
meaning " Create a ' has - safe - sleep '= ' something ' property in / of the device - tree " .
I 've made a few scripts to set the relevant variables .
Just extract the scripts and run them from a terminal .
Since the hibernate hack will interfere with the iBook dual - head hack I 've included a variant which 'll set that as well - do n't use that script if you 're not already using that hack , it can be hazardous on some machines .
My version does infinitely less checking than the original .
Wom ....
The remaining step is to enable hibernate mode .
Make sure you have at least as much free disk space as physical memory + 750 MB , then run " sudo pmset - a hibernatemode 3 " at a terminal .
That should create a file / var / vm / sleepimage .
( If you 've got secure virtual memory enabled , you should use 7 rather than 3 so that encrypted hibernation mode is n't used ( yeah , this is n't secure ) .
For some reason encrypted hibernation does n't work , I 'm unsure why ...
Do n't set it to 7 if you do n't have secure virtual memory . )
You can set it to 1 ( or 5 with secure VM ) if you want to hibernate and shut down immediately on sleep without suspending to ram .
0 will disable hibernation .
Reboot ( to set the Open Firmware var ) , and then try shutting the lid and wait for the light to start pulsing .
Do n't try ripping the power out yet , wake it normally and see what it says in / var / log/ system.log .
There should be a line like
Nov 2 14:27:17 computername kernel[0 ] : System SafeSleep
indicating that it worked .
If that seems OK , try it for real .
Sleep it ( make sure that the light starts pulsing ) , remove the power and battery ( wait for the sleep light to stop , might take a while on powerbooks ) , put power back , then boot it with the power button .
It should show a progress thing , then flicker a bit then come back where you left it ( with a fair bit of disk activity ) .
A word of warning — do n't ever use target disk mode on a mac while it is hibernated , since you 'll likely end up with filesystem corruption .
Let me know how it goes , and good luck .
Troubles
I 've now had a bit of feedback from people who 've tried it .
I 've had reports of the following machines working :
iBook G4 — 12 " 1GHz , 14 " 1.2GHz , G4 800MHz
PowerBook — 1.25GHz , 1GHz , 1.5GHz , 15 " 1.67GHz
e Mac — 1GHz ( running 10.4.3 Server )
Mac mini — 1.4GHz
In general , it seems most G4s from September 2003 onwards should work ( all AlBooks , though I 'm unsure about the 12 " 867 Mhz one ) .
If anyone has it working on a G5 , I 'd be interested to hear .
I 've had a report from Peter Steiner that his 12 " 867MHz PowerBook 's fan stopped working with Safe Sleep mode enabled , and that the clock stopped while sleeping .
It seems that a few people have had troubles with the 867MHz 12 " PowerBooks — it 's probably best not to use it on them .
I 've seen a few reports of Bluetooth being enabled and not being able to be turned off , I 've got no idea why that 'd be happening ( informed suggestions welcome :) .
Some people have also found that the clock does n't keep time during sleep — it might be model specific , I 'm not sure .
A couple of people also had problems with bad hibernate images , which would repeatedly kernel panic , but rebooting would just start the bad image again .
This can happen if you do n't set hibernatemode properly with secure virtual memory .
If a bad hibernate image keeps trying to boot then crashing , try the following :
Reboot the mac holding down Command - Option - O - F to get in to Open Firmware .
to get in to Open Firmware .
Type setenv boot - image , press return , then boot .
( If you have an OF password set , you 'll be prompted for it ) .

Mr Buffett has said the US economy will be in a " shambles " during 2009
US financier Warren Buffett 's holding company , Berkshire Hathaway , has lost its top credit rating .
Ratings agency Moody 's cut the debt rating from Aaa , the highest , to Aa2 , meaning that it thinks the company is less likely to pay back its debt .
Mr Buffett admitted last month he made some " dumb " mistakes in 2008 , when Berkshire 's profits fell 62 % - the worst performance in its 44 years .
Berkshire 's range of investments are seen as a bellwether of the US economy .
Stable outlook
The move is all the more noteworthy , as Berkshire is a significant investor in Moody's .
The outlook on Berkshire 's debt is stable , meaning Moody 's does not expect to cut its rating again anytime soon .
In his annual letter to investors , Mr Buffett said his errors included buying stakes in two Irish banks and investing in oil company Conoco Philips when the crude price was at its peak .
He predicted that the US economy would be in a " shambles " throughout 2009 and beyond .
Berkshire 's equity holdings include financial stocks such as Goldman Sachs , American Express Co and Wells Fargo & Co , which have all suffered big declines .
Mr Buffett , ranked as the world 's second - richest man by Forbes magazine , also owns stakes in Coca - Cola , reinsurer Swiss Re and car insurer Geico .
Now , there are only four US companies with Moody 's top Aaa debt rating - Exxon Mobil , Microsoft , Johnson & Johnson and Automatic Data Processing .
Class A shares in Berkshire have dropped by 7.9 % this year , closing on Wednesday at $ 88,960 a share .
Forget companies racking up multi-billion dollar losses and tens of thousands of workers being thrown on the scrap heap .
A sumo wrestler named Wakakirin and 16 grams of cannabis have managed to push the story of Japan 's economic meltdown out of top spot in the national news bulletin .
In a country where marijuana possession can land you in jail for five years , the fall of Wakakirin was raked over in lurid detail .
It was left to the 25 - year - old 's stable master , Oguruma , to front the press and explain why his charge 's career has gone up in smoke .
Wiping tears from his eyes , the stable master explained that if he had to describe Wakakirin 's actions in one word , it would be " idiot " .
" I apologise that it came to this , " he said .
This is n't the first time a sumo wrestler has been arrested on charges of possessing cannabis .
Three Russian wrestlers were thrown out of the sport last year .
But this is the first time a home - grown sumo has been busted and on the streets of Tokyo there is little sympathy for Wakakirin .
" It 's a pity a Japanese wrestler was using marijuana , " one man said .
" It 's a great shame because the majority of wrestlers train very hard , " a woman said .
" A salaried worker would be fired immediately and would lose his retirement money , he deserved his punishment , " a sumo fan said .
Sumo is struggling to shake off the taint of controversy and corruption .
As well as recreational drug scandals , the sport was floored by the killing of a young wrestler by his stablemates .
So among Wakakirin 's fellow sumo there is anger over his stupidity and his tarnishing of the ancient sport .
" Every wrestler , including myself , must be more vigilant and careful and must honour sumo , " top- division wrestler Kisenosato said .
For Wakakirin his career is over and he could even face jail .
So just like tens of thousands of other Japanese , Wakakirin has found himself out a job .
But unlike his unfortunate countrymen , the former sumo has no one to blame for that but himself .
Detroit ’s not the only one reeling from the collapse of General Motors .
There are a few executives bummed out on the Paramount Pictures lot as well .
Eleven weeks before the release of its expensive summer sequel “ Transformers 2 : Revenge of the Fallen , ” the studio ca n’t count on its key promotional partner to support a marketing blitz that helps drive mass awareness of Hollywood ’s big popcorn movies .
The struggling automaker , whose new Chevy Camaro is one of the stars of director Michael Bay ’s action film in which vehicles morph into giant robots , has sharply throttled back its contribution to the advertising campaign tied to the sequel ’s release June 24 .
The reduced spending by GM comes at a tricky time for Paramount , which needs all the promotional backing it can muster for “ Transformers ” in what looks to be one of Hollywood ’s most competitive summers ever .
A dozen big - budget “ event ” films , including “ Star Trek ” and sequels to “ Harry Potter ” and “ X - Men , ” will be elbowing one another into theaters .

“ There ’s so much competition out there for the entertainment dollar that studios and filmmakers really can’t open big , $ 100 - million movies without the assistance of partner alliances that can help generate awareness and sell movie tickets , ” said Norm Marshall , chief executive of NMA Entertainment , a brand marketing firm that ’s been involved in movie “ tie - in ” campaigns for “ Mama Mia ! , ” “ Iron Man ” and “ Matrix Reloaded . ”
For the Hollywood studios , which are under pressure to keep a lid on marketing costs , a promotional tie - in can spell millions of dollars of advertising underwritten by consumer giants like GM or fast - food chains McDonald ’s and Burger King .
The tie-ins take various forms , including advertisements of the company ’s products alongside the movie , in - store promotions , direct mailings , product placement and online campaigns .
“ It can be extremely valuable , ” said Adam Fogelson , president of marketing and distribution for Universal Pictures , whose upcoming June release “ Land of the Lost , ” a sci - fi adventure comedy starring Will Ferrell , has a “ huge ” media and in - store campaign with promotional partner Subway .

Studios can spend more than $ 100 million to market their “ franchise ” movies around the world .
But as the studios try to rein in marketing costs , the tie - in campaigns with big advertisers become more important .
“ Major media promotions can exceed $ 10 million , ” Fogelson said .
“ All of our media budgets are under pressure , and having substantial media money coming from a promotional partner can reduce the sheer amount of dollars you spend . ”
Still , Paramount , which spent some $ 180 million to produce “ Transformers , ” will lay out more than $ 150 million to market and distribute the film .
The studio has other major tie - in deals for the sequel , including Burger King , wireless phone company LG Mobile , retailer Kmart and a yet - to - be - announced candy company and convenience store chain -- all footing extensive media buys .
Advertisement
“ Our marketing partnership campaign on this movie is already bigger than the first ‘ Transformers ’ with or without GM , ” said LeeAnne Stables , Paramount ’s executive vice president of worldwide marketing partnerships .
On the original film , Paramount had five partners : GM , Mountain Dew , Burger King , EBay and Kraft , which collectively spent more than $ 40 million on TV , print , radio and online advertising .
“ The reason we do these partnerships is not to defray our media spending , ” Stables said .
“ It ’s like a delicious gravy on top of the studio ’s marketing campaign that connects us to audiences in places traditional media ca n’t buy -- like inside a car dealership or Burger King . ”
Given the huge success of the first “ Transformers ” -- the sales of $ 708 million in tickets worldwide and 14 million DVDs in the U.S. -- the loss of GM ’s ad dollars may not affect the box - office sales of the sequel because it is largely “ pre-sold ” to audiences .
Nonetheless , the pullback may hurt the studio ’s chances of reaching out to car buffs it might not otherwise reach through ordinary marketing .

In the upcoming DreamWorks - produced film , starring Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox , five of Chevy ’s cars are characters -- including the one known as “ Bumblebee ” -- known as Autobots , which are good robots battling evil Decepticons bent on avenging the universe .
Officials from GM said the company ’s financial crisis prompted a change in plans .
For 2007 ’s “ Transformers , ” GM backed a massive tie - in campaign , which even included TV commercials directed by Bay .
“ We ’ve pulled back on all of our marketing and advertising for obvious reasons , and spending is down dramatically , ” said Terry Rhadigan , communications director for Chevrolet , GM ’s biggest division .
“ It stands to reason that ‘ Transformers ’ would fall under that umbrella . ”
The timing could n’t be worse for the carmaker since its 2010 Camaro is just now rolling off assembly lines and being shipped to dealers .
Rhadigan said although the relaunched Camaro was only a concept car and not available for sale when the first “ Transformers ” opened , its association with the film was highly beneficial .
“ It translated into awareness and boosted the overall image of Chevy , ” he said .
“ It ’s cool to be associated with a hot movie . ”

Hi , Arch Linux users , we are pleased to inform you that the i686 architecture is not going to be dropped from Arch Linux .
It all was part of an April Fools joke , in which all the developers and the forum moderators played a big part .
Interestingly , this joke actually did some good .
Some of our users discovered that they were , in fact , running 64 - bit processors , and many of them switched to the Arch Linux 64 - bit version .
We encourage anyone who already switched to keep using the 64 - bit version , to continue contributing to the architecture and encourage support from other major software vendors .
A prime example of a vendor giving in to the demands of the 64 - bit community is Adobe .
They 've recently added 64 - bit Linux support to the flash plug - in , for which we thank them .
Sorry for any inconvenience this joke may have caused , but how can we resist a prank on the 1st of April ?
Ms Davies had been to the pub with her partner to celebrate his birthday A Tyneside woman deliberately bit off her boyfriend 's tongue during a drunken birthday kiss , a court has heard .
Tracy Davies , 40 , bit a third of Mark Coghill 's tongue off , Newcastle Crown Court was told .
They were celebrating Mr Coghill 's 45th birthday at his Newcastle bedsit in October 2008 , when she grew upset because she was not pregnant .
Ms Davies of Sunderland Road , Gateshead , denies one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent .
The court heard how they went to a supermarket on 10 October , buying two bottles of vodka and food for the evening , before going to a pub together .
They returned to Mr Coghill 's home but Ms Davies grew upset because she wanted a baby but was not yet pregnant .
As Mr Coghill moved to comfort her , she asked him to kiss her , the court heard .
I will never enjoy a curry again - I can't distinguish between cheese and toast , and just toast
Victim Mark Coghill Julian Smith , prosecuting , said : " He did so and within a few seconds , she bit down hard on his tongue .
" Obviously this caused him pain , he pulled back , and the tongue had come clean off in her mouth .
" She had the piece of tongue in her mouth , he saw her take it from her mouth , and it fell to the floor . "
Mr Coghill , a former customer service advisor , told the court he could no longer work , struggled to speak , and had lost many of his taste buds .
" I will never enjoy a curry again , " he said .
" I can't distinguish between certain foods , like the difference between cheese and toast , and just toast .
" I ca n't use my tongue for eating .
Those are things you take for granted . "
' You 're joking '
After the attack Ms Davies called an ambulance and paramedics then alerted police .
Mr Smith added : " She told police , ' We have had a domestic .
I have bitten his tongue off .
Here it is '. "
He added that Ms Davies was surprised when police arrested her , telling officers : " You 're joking " .
Mr Coghill was treated at Newcastle General Hospital , but surgeons decided against trying to re-attach the torn section because of the danger of infection .
The trial continues .

Mind–Altering Vacations
by Barbara Cleveland
It seems like no one is going to let us forget how bad the economy has gotten — not Wall Street , not our daily newspaper ( if it still exists ) , not our unemployed brother , who 's still sleeping on our couch .
Sure , you can escape the stress by taking a vacation , but for some people , the average sun-and –piña colada getaway wo n't do the trick .
That 's why many travelers are opting for the strong stuff : a vacation involving mind - altering substances .
Indeed , the world offers plenty of trippy tutorials on the meaning of this topsy - turvy life , whether it's a cultural immersion where the ceremony is as important as the high — like drinking kava with a local tribe in Fiji — or a beach party in the Caribbean fueled by hallucinogenic tea .
Of course , there 's a big difference between freeing your mind legally while on vacation and doing something that 'll land you in a Burmese prison .
We 've stuck to substances that are currently decriminalized or largely tolerated in their destinations .
But laws can vary over time and within countries , so check before you , um , pack your pipe ( and bring your lawyer 's cell number ) .
It goes without saying , but always use caution : Talk to your doctor , only purchase from legitimate sources , always bring a friend , and register with your local consulate on arrival .
It 's one thing to tune in and turn on , it 's another to completely drop out .
KAVA IN FIJI
The buzz : Traditional kava , a root that 's ground into a powder and then strained through a sock , makes a waxy , pinkish - gray tea .
Sound disgusting ?
That 's because it is — but its potent effects ( lucid , high - def dreams ) have made it a centuries - old favorite among Fijian Islanders .
The earthy - tasting liquid numbs and coats the inside of your mouth and throat , but after two or three cups are passed around the fire , you 're dancing and singing with reckless abandon .
Where to score : Nearly every hotel offers some touristy version of the tea ceremony , complete with watered - down kava .
It 's a great starting point for the weak of stomach or those nervous about taking the plunge .
But to experience the real thing , take a tribal tour into the undergrowth , meet the locals , and get down with the strong stuff .
Where to chill :
Once you 've entered the kava circle , there 's no turning back — you have to sit and drink until the kava is finished ( usually about three cups total shared between participants ) .
The oddly elegant Fijian shuffle dance is usually part of the kava ritual , so give it a shot if you can still stand up .
Otherwise , sing and clap along with your kava kin .
Where to come down :
At your hotel , of course .
The Likuliku Lagoon Resort has the only overwater bungalows in Fiji , where you can stick to the in - house ceremony or trek out with a tour guide .
Relax on your private deck post - ceremony while the waves wash over your feet .
POT IN AMSTERDAM
The buzz : Remember that hazy weekend you spent in the Red Light District back in your Eurail days , hitting a four - foot bong with a couple of patchouli - drenched Australians ?
Well , you may be all grown up and over the natty dreads , but perhaps you 're not above spacing out with a little of Amsterdam 's finest green .
Ultramodern coffee shops , a great music scene , and a new crop of design hotels offer a more mature way to toke .
Where to score : Avoid the touristy Red Light District in favor of vegging out to short films or trip - hop DJs at the New Dampkring coffee shop on Haarlemmerstraat .
For more visual stimulation , check out Green House Namaste on Waterlooplein , an ornate shrine to all the jewels in India .
Most coffeehouses rotate their menus based on what 's fresh , so ask the staff for assistance .
Some words of warning : Marijuana is technically illegal here , but small amounts are tolerated ; the city has been considering further restrictions , so check before you light up .
In any case , smoking wherever and whenever you please is a major tourist faux pas , especially since Dutch authorities banned tobacco smoking in public places in early 2008 .
You might not get ticketed , but you wo n't make any Dutch friends , either .
Where to chill :
It 's always fun to trip out at the teeny - tiny Pianola Museum , where you can listen to over 20,000 player piano songs on several different automatic ivories .
When the sun goes down , keep the tunes going at Melkweg , a music venue housed in a deserted dairy factory that hosts indie acts like Peter Bjorn and John and big -name DJs like Steve Lawler .
Where to come down :
The beloved Cake Under My Pillow hotel is so friendly that they 'll overlook your bloodshot eyes and help you cure your munchies .
It 's situated above the De Taart van m'n Tante cake shop , so a slice of the sweet stuff comes free with your stay .
Still hungry ?
We 'd suggest a cone of frites courtesy of the Vleminckx Sausmeesters on Voetboogstraat ( yeah , do n't even try to pronounce that one ) .
MAGIC MUSHROOMS IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS
The buzz :
If you 've never tried magic mushrooms , here 's the gist :
The good ( sparkly hallucinations and giddiness ) usually outweighs the bad ( occasional nausea and dizziness ) .
And the distinctive , unpleasant taste is easily washed away with a Corona .
But do n't expect to chew on some ' shrooms and suddenly see dead presidents landing in spaceships .
Much like the menu at Taco Bell , there are generally five ingredients to every trip , and visual hallucinations are just one of them .
Body highs , intense emotions , introspectiveness , and a distortion of time round out the experience .
Where to score : On Tortola in the British Virgin Islands , it 's legal to possess and consume psilocybin mushrooms but not to sell them — so the infamous full - moon dance parties at Bomba 's Surf Shack on the beach in Cappoon 's Bay serve mushroom tea instead of straight ' shrooms .
Where to chill : Surf Shack proprietor Bomba 's lunar - based schedule comes straight out of the Farmer 's Almanac , so check his Web site for specific dates .
The dance - party atmosphere can be fun but intense — tons of island expats , Caribbean surf bums , strong rum , and other drugs — so if you start to get stressed , just hop in a cab and head for the pool at your hotel .
The locals are so used to spaced - out tourists that no one will bat an eye .
Where to come down :
The best way to see the BVIs is to charter a catamaran .
The gentle rock of the boat , the gleam of the Milky Way , and the sound of the waves are the perfect backdrop for the earth - loving feeling that mushrooms can bring .
The Moorings has a huge selection of boats available for charter , but do n't ' shroom and sail — make sure there 's a crew to skipper the boat while you trip out .
TEMEZCAL IN MEXICO
The buzz :
You can get just as high from a thorough detox as you can from taking drugs — which is why Mexico 's temezcals , or sweat lodges , are so popular .
In this ancient Mesoamerican ritual , participants lie on the floor of a rounded adobe hut , gazing into a central fire while a shaman creates a steam with medicinal herbs like arnica , chamomile , aloe , and sage .
Expect total euphoria from the one - to - three - hour ritual , where temperatures range from 90 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit .
Where to score : Avoid the ramshackle temezcals that dot Mexico unless you want to hang out with wild - eyed New Agers chatting about the power of crystals .
Instead , go for tried - and - tested local favorites run by trained pros , like the Maya Spa Wellness Center outside of Tulum .
Where to chill : Find a resort that specializes in the ritual .
The ultraluxe Zoëtry Paraiso de la Bonita has a white adobe temezcal on the beach , heated by burning wood from the sapote tree , and an experienced shaman who will lead you through the nearly three - hour ceremony before bringing you to bathe in the ocean .
If authenticity is your aim , opt for the Posada del Tepozteco in Tepoztlán , about 45 minutes outside of Mexico City , which has hosted everyone from Diego Rivera to Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas .
How to come down : Drink water ( bottled — this is Mexico ! ) .
The dehydration from the sweating can leave you with the same kind of shaking hangover you get after an endless night at the bar .
COCA LEAVES IN BOLIVIA
The buzz :
In the major coca-producing countries in South America , only the processed form of the leaf — i.e. , cocaine or crack cocaine — is illegal .
The coca leaf itself , which is held in the side of the cheek ( much like chewing tobacco ) , is a huge part of quotidian life in the Andes .
The mild high you receive is a far cry from the angry jolt of a rail of cocaine ; there 's a pleasant mouth - numbing , a sense of well - being , and a serious buzz that lasts all afternoon .
Plus , it 's a great way to alleviate altitude sickness in the mile - high terrain .
Where to score : Bolivian president Evo Morales is an incredibly vocal supporter of the people 's right to profit from traditional uses of coca leaves , and the tourist - friendly country has largely avoided the violent , high - profile conflicts plaguing other producers like Colombia .
A stroll down the street in the capital of La Paz will take you past numerous coca carts , where you can buy leaves by the handful ( but you 'll only want to put one or two in your mouth at a time ) .
Where to chill :
You 'll be dying to use your brain , so head over to the Museo de la Coca and learn something ( be sure to bring a pen and paper for unexpected strokes of genius ) .
The museum covers the social , economic , and agricultural history of Bolivia 's most ubiquitous plant and is a fascinating window into a culture where coca is found in everything from toothpaste to soda .
Where to come down : Lake Titicaca , the largest freshwater lake in South America and the source of a considerable number of bad jokes , is only a bus ride away from La Paz and has some of the most striking scenery this side of Machu Picchu .
Grab a ride on a minibus from outside the gates of El Viejo Cementerio in La Paz to Copacabana , where you can swim laps in Lake Titicaca until the coca wears off .
Crash in the penthouse suite at the Hotel La Cupula overlooking the oceanlike lake for only $ 36 a night .
HASHISH IN MOROCCO
The buzz :
In Morocco , hashish is to marijuana what jam is to fruit : delicious , concentrated , and readily available no matter what time of year .
Known as kif , this North African delicacy is technically illegal , but as Morocco 's biggest foreign currency earner after tourism , it has been basically decriminalized .
Tokers report that police have little interest in arresting tourists for possessing small amounts ( but it 's up to you whether to test that theory ) .
Where to score :
In nearly every alleyway or village square in Morocco , you 'll hear " Kif for you ! "
This exchange is akin to buying a Rolex in Chinatown .
After making a cursory glance for police officers , smart buyers will step aside and inspect the merchandise to make sure that the kif is squishy and smelly ( old hash is usually hard as a rock , has no smell , and is n't very fun to smoke ) .
The kif can either be sautéed down in butter and baked into food or smoked in a long , thin pipe — it burns at a very high temperature , so the length of the pipe is a key element in cooling the smoke before it hits the throat .
Where to chill : Chefchaouen , a town not far from Tangier , is the unofficial capital of Morocco 's unofficial drug trade — the varieties of kif available here are astonishing , as is the architecture : hundreds of simple Berber dwellings , painted bright shades of blue and white .
It 's about four hours from Fez on a bus , so plan to stay at least a night , though it 's likely you 'll want to chill out even longer .
Where to come down :
If you 're still in Chefchaouen , the cheap and charming Casa Perleta is located just off the main medina .
Ask for room 6 , which has a view of the Rif Mountains .
If you 're heading back to medieval Fez , La Maison Bleue is filled with canopy beds , stained glass windows , and carved cedar doors , a perfect accompaniment to the lush hash high .
BHANG IN INDIA
The buzz : During the annual Holi festival of color in March , people all over India get stoned on bhang , marijuana buds and leaves that are ground into a green paste and cooked with milk , clarified butter , and spices in traditional drinks such as thandai and lassi .
Bhang also gets cooked into pastries and cakes , if you 're not down with drinking butter .
Where to score : Bhang beverages are available at street carts , local shops , and restaurants during the festival .
Marijuana is technically illegal , but because Holi is a religious event , authorities turn a blind eye .
Where to chill :
By far , the best place to bhang is in the town of Barsana , located between New Delhi and Agra .
There , Holi includes a mind - boggling ceremony in which women beat men with sticks and attempt to capture them — and the poor suckers who get caught are forced to dress in drag and dance around .
In retaliation , the men throw buckets of colored paint on the women .
It 's a completely gorgeous , other - worldly , and once - in - a - lifetime experience that goes with bhang like peas go with pods .
Do n't worry — the men wear hockey - like padding , and the women do n't hit very hard .
Where to come down :
There are hundreds of tour operators across India that will take you to experience the festival , but the well - respected Artisans of Leisure wo n't let your bhang - addled head rest on anything less than a four - star pillow in nearby Agra .
They 'll organize a private chauffeur to bring you to and from the festival and a guide to show you all the sights .
PEYOTE IN MEXICO
The buzz : Occasional partiers looking for a carefree weekend tripping in the desert should stop reading now .
Peyote is the final frontier of crazy intense psychotropics :
We 're talking 15 - hour hallucinations and at least one bout of vomiting .
But the hallucinations — which fueled the mad scribblings of Aldous Huxley , Hunter S. Thompson , and William S. Burroughs and has been described by many as " an encounter with God " — can bring you to a place of total harmony with yourself and the world around you .
Or so we hear .
Where to score :
The peyote cactus grows in the deserts and mountains surrounding Real de Catorce , a former silver mining town in central Mexico ( and far from the drug conflicts that have been plaguing Mexican border towns ) .
There are numerous unofficial guides who , for varying fees , will drive you out to the desert and help you find a plant , which is chopped into buttons and eaten .
Workers tending to the numerous peyote - themed craft stalls in the central village square can point you in the direction of a guide .
Be careful , though , and pay due respect :
Even though peyote consumption has been decriminalized , harvesting the cactus is still illegal except for religious purposes .
Make sure your guide is trustworthy and knows how to properly cut the peyote so that it wo n't destroy the plant , which is sacred to the native Huichol Indians .
Where to chill : Channel your inner Beat poet among the Joshua trees , cactus flowers , and gorgeous mountain views of the surrounding desert .
Head east of town to the Cerro Quemado , the holy mountain and annual sacred meeting place of the Huichol Indians .
But be prepared with a GPS and warm clothes to battle the evening chill in case you do n't make it back before sunset .
Where to come down :
The Mesón del Refugio , a boutique hotel housed in an 18th - century mansion in Real , has an enormous glass ceiling above the lounge , where you can soak up the twilight and gleaming stars after a long day in the desert .
COBRA WINE IN VIETNAM
The buzz :
When life gives you lemons , make lemonade .
And when life gives you poisonous snakes , you can apparently make snake wine .
The people of Le Mat , a village in northern Vietnam , have been known historically for their skill at capturing serpents .
Their annual Snake Wine festival in late April / early May is your opportunity to down a few shots of the local aphrodisiac : a glass of super - potent rice moonshine , served with the still beating heart of a cobra .
Where to score :
In Le Mat , an easy day trip from Hanoi , nearly every restaurant serves some kind of snake wine , be it a glass of fermented snake blood , snake liqueur , or rice moonshine with a snake pickled in the bottle .
Velo Asia can organize a private cycling trip to burn off all those insidious serpent calories , or you can ask any of the day - tour operators in Hanoi to take you in a minibus .
Where to chill :
You can get surprisingly drunk on snake wine .
Set your watch so you do n't miss the snake parade , when locals mime snake legends and march down the street in a gigantic cobra costume .
Where to come down :
Sleeping in a town filled with dead snakes is a recipe for bad dreams , so head back to Hanoi for some luxury R&R at the famous Metropole , a post - colonial wonder with period furniture and bamboo - covered walls .
Legendary literary drunkard W. Somerset Maugham paved the pass - out - cold route at the Metropole years ago , so they 're used to guests that smell like the bottom of a wine bottle .
AYAHUASCA IN BRAZIL
The buzz : For more than 3,000 years , Amazonian tribes have been using this tea — brewed from the vine of the ayahuasca plant and the leaves of the chacruna , a member of the coffee family — to cure emotional ailments .
Current practitioners describe it as a confrontation with one 's innermost self .
But this is no sissy sipping experience :
Because the tea contains dimethyltryptamine , or DMT , you 'll have emotional highs similar to what you experience on Ecstasy and hallucinations on par with peyote .
The trip can last from 2 to 5 hours , depending on the amount of tea you drink .
Where to score : Heart of the Initiate , a U.S. - based organization , offers ayahuasca workshops at an eco-resort on the coast of Brazil , where the indigenous , religious , and ritual use of ayahuasca is protected by federal law .
The workshops — either 8 or 17 days — begin with 2 days of decompression , followed by ayahuasca ceremonies every other day , led by an experienced shaman .
The company insists that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug , warning that you should expect to " get comfortable with being uncomfortable . "
Where to chill :
The simple answer ?
You wo n't .
The ceremony itself can get quite intense — there 's chanting , songs in tribal languages , incense , and , of course , drinking the tea .
And you should expect to throw up .
Just as in ayurvedic traditions on the other side of the world , vomiting is an expected and therapeutic part of the process .
Champions claim that ayahuasca purges the digestive , circulatory , and neurological systems , and many participants report a feeling of well - being and internal " cleanliness " that lasts after the ceremony .
How to come down :
Feel free to wander within the bounds of the resort , but do n't give in to the siren song of the beach — the riptides can be extremely dangerous .
Coming down from the experience as a whole , though , is a longer process .
Past trippers talk about sporadic bursts of emotional insights for weeks after the workshops — so you may as well do that on the beach in Rio .
ABSINTHE IN PARIS
The buzz : Absinthe 's Belle Époque heyday — and its popularity with dissolute artistes such as Baudelaire , Van Gogh , and Oscar Wilde — resulted in a bad - boy rep for hallucinations and bizarre behavior .
Suspicions about the drink 's potency led to a ban in France for nearly 100 years until its repeal in 2001 .
The truth is that absinthe wo n't make you see green fairies or cut off your ear — it just adds an up - tempo booze buzz that makes the world a little brighter .
Where to score :
Since the repeal , the anise - flavored beverage has been mixed into overpriced cocktails in models - and - bottles territory .
But there 's only one way to do it right .
Absinthe must be properly " louched " — that is , diluted with a slow drip of ice water , which changes its color and viscosity .
An absinthe fountain is the easiest way to louche your drink , so pick one up at Vert d'Absinthe , an absinthe emporium in the City of Light .
Where to chill :
The best places to drink absinthe are where it flows freely .
Les Caves du Roy in Paris has an enormous selection as well as dark nooks in which to drink yourself silly .
But since you can only sample so many kinds of absinthe before you fall flat on your face , try making a weekend of it .
Each October , nearly a thousand tourists make the four - hour trek from Paris to Pontarlier in eastern France to attend the Absinthiades , a three - day absinthe booze - fest .
How to come down :
With coffee , croissants , and more absinthe , suggests expert Brian Robinson , review editor for the Wormwood Society .
If you can't bear that idea , head to the Hemingway Bar at the Ritz .
Its namesake was an avid consumer of absinthe back in the Lost Generation days , but the bar 's expertly shaken martini will ease you back to equilibrium much more gently .
We did n't believe it for a second .
Despite all the suckers on the interwebs , Beyoncé Knowles has not , in fact , pulled an Enrique Iglesias .
That fingers - in - your - ears singing shrieking Howard Stern played on his radio show , calling it an unedited board mix of the star performing on the Today show last November , is a hoax .
In fact , E !
News tracked down the creator of the video above , who confirmed its lack of authenticity .
" Yes I created them they are fake , " says Matt from Hellohomo.com .
In addition to the wacked - out version of " If I Were a Boy " that made it onto Stern 's show Tuesday , the site also got silly with the star 's performance of " Single Ladies . "
Surely , the small blog — which posted the videos in early January — probably did n't expect it to make its way through major media outlets and straight to Beyoncé 's father , Mathew Knowles .
DALLAS – Internal records detailing fund raising hauls by the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development ( HLF ) indicate that the group took in hundreds of thousands of dollars more than it reported on tax forms , an FBI agent testified Wednesday .
An HLF ledger shows $ 396,000 was collected at various fundraisers in 1990 , Agent Robert Miranda testified .
But HLF 's tax returns reported only $ 88,490 that year .
Entries on the ledger indicate Hamas leaders routinely were part of the fundraisers .
In a comment section next to the donation totals , numerous entries note that the Hamas guest speakers " took it . "
Other notations indicate defendant Mohamed El - Mezain also " took it . "
El Mezain , a former HLF chairman , is among five men on trial , accused of conspiring to provide material support to Hamas .
Prosecutors say HLF illegally channeled more than $ 12 million to the Palestinian terrorist group through donations to a series of charities , or zakat committees .
Miranda 's testimony marked at least the second example in which tens of thousands of dollars in HLF funds go unaccounted for .
Last week , FBI agent Lara Burns described two separate HLF donations of $ 100,000 to an Islamic center but accompanying paperwork accounted for only $ 20,000 in each case , she said .
Miranda 's testimony included a review of a 1990 letter and ledger from the Islamic Association of Palestine ( IAP ) , a charity that teamed with HLF on fundraisers .
As the letter indicates on page 7 of the link , the IAP received a 10 percent cut of HLF 's collections .
The letter was addressed to the Occupied Land Fund ( HLF 's name at the time ) and details money raised from recent events co-sponsored by two groups .
It is signed by " Y. Salah , " identified by Miranda as Yusuf Salah ( a/k / a Ahmed Yusuf ) , President of United Association for Studies and Research ( UASR ) , an organization that was part of a Palestine Committee created by the Muslim Brotherhood to advance Hamas ' agenda in the United States .
The IAP and HLF also were Palestine Committee members .
In addition , Ahmed Yusuf was listed separately as member of the Palestine Committee in the U.S.
He now works in Gaza as a spokesman for deposed Hamas Prime Minister Ismail al - Haniyeh .
The 1990 IAP letter builds on Miranda 's testimony Tuesday , which described the " means and manner " HLF used to raise money .
The group organized conference calls featuring prominent Hamas leaders that were marketed to major mosques and Islamic centers , Miranda said .
Some of these conference calls were picked up by FBI wiretaps .
That surveillance also picked up a fax on HLF letterhead advertising one such conference call in January 1997 .
But the English version of the advertisement differed significantly from the Arabic one , Miranda said .
The speakers listed in English were : Islamic Society of North America ( ISNA ) President Dr. Abdullah Idris and Dr. Kamal al Hilbawi - described in the advertisement as a well known Islamic scholar .
The Arabic version listed Hilbawi and two men Miranda identified as senior Hamas leaders - Hamid al Bitawi and Sheikh Mohamed Siam .
ISNA is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case .
Jurors then listened to the conference call itself , featuring prominent Hamas leaders two years after the group was designated as a terrorist organization by the United States .
A speaker introduced the call by saying " Holy Land Foundation welcomes the honorable guests . "
Later , senior Hamas leader Mohamed Siam paid tribute to three prominent Hamas figures at the time : spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin ; deputy political chief Mousa Abu Marzook ; and bomb - maker Yehia Ayyash ( also known as " The Engineer " ) .
The three are " shining examples " of Palestinian " power and steadfastness , " Siam said .
He also encouraged support for " Islamic movements , " a reference to the Islamic Resistance Movement , or Hamas .
Repeated references to HLF are made throughout the conference call , which concluded with a final solicitation to donate to HLF .
After the tape was played , federal prosecutor James Jacks asked Miranda : " Have you seen any reference to charity in the call ? "
" You have to be creative to find it , " Miranda replied .
Another conference call from February 1996 featured a leader of Jamaat - e - Islami , a radical Islamist party in Pakistan tied to the Muslim Brotherhood .
Qazi Hussein Ahmad told the audience in that call that the British colonizers of Palestine " artificially planted " the state of Israel in the Middle East and that " we in Pakistan stand with the Palestinian people " and " stand with Hamas " and we " will never recognize Israel . "
Jurors were shown a video found buried in the backyard of unindicted co-conspirator Fawaz Mushtaha The 1999 video features senior Hamas leaders Mohamed Siam , Jamil Hamami , and Mahmud Zahar .
Defendant Mufid Abdelqader , a half - brother of Hamas chief Khalid Mishaal and a singer in the Al - Sakrah band that performed at HLF conferences , is seen in the video embracing and welcoming the Hamas leaders .
The video depicts singing , lectures , and sermons in praise of Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin , the military wing of Hamas ( Izz ad - Din al Qassam Brigades ) , and Hassan al - Banna , the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt .
Miranda also discussed a 2003 deposition given by defendant Mohamed El Mezain , in which he was asked whether he knew Nihad Awad .
El Mezain was vague :
He said he knew Awad from Awad 's work with the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) and had met him at conferences .
He mentioned he met Awad at an ISNA conference in Chicago .
Asked whether he had " any personal dealings " with Awad , El Mezain said no .
Awad , who currently serves as CAIR 's executive director , was an IAP officer and was listed with El Mezain as a member of the Muslim Brotherhood 's Palestine Committee in the U.S .
El - Mezain similarly minimized his relationship with Yasser Bushnaq , President of IAP ; Yusuf Salah ( a/k/ a Ahmed Yusuf ) , President of UASR ; and Marzook , a specially designated Hamas terrorist .
He declined having " any personal dealings " with the individuals even though they were key members in the Palestine Committee .
Last week , Agent Burns made similar observations concerning sworn statements given by former HLF executive director Shukri Abu Baker .
Prosecutors have emphasized the defendants ' stated tactic of deceiving people about their activities and objectives .
The trial is in recess until Tuesday , when Miranda 's testimony is expected to continue .

Google wants you to profile yourself and it all sounds so inviting .
A Google profile is simply how you present yourself on Google products to other Google users .
It allows you to control how you appear on Google and tell others a bit more about who you are .
As an extra inducement , they now give you greater control over what people find when they search for your name by showing Google profile results at the bottom of name - query search pages , at least in the U.S. and Canada .
Danny Sullivan has an excellent article on the mechanics of how Google profile results improve people search .
Barry Schwartz has also provided details on the slightly clunky way you can verify your google profile .
Since this is all linked to social networking , you might have thought it would link in with Orkut , their ailing attempt to create a social space .
Not so , in fact it requires you to at least create a profile in their Knol space , even if you do not feel the urge to add to the fund of human knowledge .
I wondered how many people are going along with Google in creating profiles .
It seemed to me that a good test would be to check out some of the 38 leaders in the world of organic search engine optimization that had contributed to the SEOmoz Search Engine Ranking Factors Version 2 study .
This is how they seemed to be working with profiles , at the time this was written .
Clearly results may change over time .
It will be interesting to see how this evolves over time .
As Marshall Kirkpatrick points out You Can Change What Google Says About
You whenever you wish .
Google also offers a way of deleting your Google profile , if you feel that is to your advantage .
However it adds the somewhat ominous Note :
Once you delete your profile , you wo n’t be able to get it back .
Given that it is unclear how Google profiles might be used in the future , that leaves you with a somewhat risky decision .

Use the graphic below to find out how your state performed .
Mouse over a state and a window will pop up showing how common overdue loans were in 2007 and 2008 .
The deeper the shade of red , the more rapidly loan performance has deteriorated .

Oh , hello .
You wanted to see a picture of disgraced Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich standing in a fake forest with Heidi and Spencer from The Hills , right ?
Oh good , because we have one .
Um , yeah .
So ... Blago was going to be on the upcoming season of I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! , which I do n't need to explain because the show is so beautifully described in L'Inferno , but a federal judge said , " Um , actually you 're being indicted on 17 pretty serious charges right now , so no , you ca n't go to Costa Rica to film a fucking reality show . "
So , he 's not doing it , but he is promoting it !
He showed up at a junket to support his would - be costars , a roster of ghouls that ranges from the aforementioned Hills idiots to born - again Baldwin Stephen to Tail Spin character made flesh , American Idol 's Sanjaya .
What did he have to say about the would - be experience ?
I had sold myself on this being a way for me to be a modern - day Teddy Roosevelt .
I basically deluded myself into being that , and then the judge made his decision .
So , that 's a thing that someone said once , whatever in the good Christ it means .
Is Rod Blagojevich about to invade Cuba ?
At least he acknowledged that he 's deluding himself about ... something .
Anyway , this is all to say , here 's a horrible thing , now please look at it .
I mean , just look at it .
Those are people .
Those are people , America .

“ Can I work remote ? ”
I cringe .
It ’s Ian and Ian is a senior engineer .
He ’s a rock .
He gets it done .
I never have to ask him twice and , after six years , Ian has every right to ask to work remote .
But I ’m still freaked because my first thought when anyone asks to work remote is , “ This fine person is a year away from either quitting or being fired . ”
Why ?
Because they ’re asking to leave the Pond .
The Pond
When I think of communication in a large group of people , I imagine a pond .
Small , round , slightly green water .
You can see the edges of this pond and there ’s a willow tree over there looking both informed and sad .
Metaphorically , all the people in the organization are standing somewhere on this pond .
Our positions are based on whom we know and where we are in the organization chart .
When something happens in the company , when something noteworthy is said , a drop falls in the pond and creates a ripple .
The ripple is the piece of information traveling from one person to the others .
Big drop , big ripple … travels further .
With me so far ?
There is a constant flow of information in your company .
That means there are constant drips in the Pond , creating various - sized ripples traveling every which way , bumping into each other , and transforming each other into slightly mutated ripples .
These mutated ripples are the rumor mill , gossip , and all those small pieces of slightly bizarre information that cross your path during the course of the day .
If you ’re in the Pond , you ’re gathering data , whether it ’s intended for you or not .
It ’s inevitable .
It ’s what we do as curious humans ; we receive information , digest it , alter it , and then send it on its way tweaked to our own personal wavelengths .
A remote employee is not in the Pond .
Yes , he ’s on the mailing lists and he aggressively updates the wiki , but the subtle , unintentional , tweaked , quiet information that is transferred throughout the Pond does n’t leave the Pond .
There are those whose jobs it is to look at the Pond and attempt to relay the interesting ripples , but while these program and project managers are well intentioned , they relay poorly because they ’re just single observers of ripples .
Real information is never conveyed by the individual ; we understand by listening as a group .
The group forms a collective picture of the state of the Pond – it ’s a distributed picture understood by everyone , but never completely known by one .
It is the unspoken royal “ we ” and this intricate , immeasurable thing is absolutely essential to how a group gets things done well .
Do you mean it ?
Remote has to work .
It ’s not just Ian .
There are bright people in your building right now who are going to want to return home to Colorado , and you ’re going to let them because losing them is not an option .
Also , there ’s a planet full of talented people who will always be at a distance , but who represent huge , untapped productivity for your team .
Your challenge is how to augment the remote employee ’s absence from the Pond .
This article is about how to decrease the risk that you will have to fire your favorite employee who decides to become remote .
I ’d like to give advice from the other side , on how to work remotely , but I ’ve never done it .
I do n’t have the personality .
My professional satisfaction comes from being able to look those I depend on in the eye and ask , “ Do you mean it ? ”
There is essential content to be discovered in that stare that will never be fully conveyed in an email , IM , or tweet .
My belief is that without deliberate attention , the remote employee slowly becomes irrelevant to the organization .
Through no fault of their own , they can be gradually pushed to the edge of what ’s important .
And when you ’re at the edge , you ’re an organizational shudder from falling over it .
Failure happens at the edges .
Avoiding failure involves asking four questions before they leave :
Do they have the personality ?
Do they have the right job ?
Does the culture support it ?
Do you have a remote friction detection and resolution policy ?
The Personality
Whether the employee has the right personality to be a productive remote worker is a tricky call because most of your data about this person is based on working with them .
What ’s going to happen when you ca n’t see them ?
How are they going to react when you forget to include them in the staff call ?
How are they going to feel when the product launches and they are n’t there to celebrate ?
This is what I consider .
Are they eloquent in email ?
Every bit of communication is more expensive with remote folks , so they ’d better be good at it – no matter the medium .
Can this person construct and convey a complex argument in a single email ?
Can this person make an important point … via iChat ?
Written communication is bereft of much of the intangible value of the Pond .
It lacks the nuance of face - to - face communication , which means the author needs to be painfully explicit about the details .
Can this person do that ?
Are they self - directed ?
How do they deal with ambiguity ?
If you ’ve given them crap direction , do they bump around for a bit before admitting defeat , or do they immediately ask for clarification ?
Many of the subtle ways you check in and error correct co-workers leave when they leave .
If they ’re in the weeds , are they going to ask for help ?
How long until they ask for help ?
How detail - oriented are they ?
If self - direction indicates how they start a thing , their detail orientation is how well they finish .
Is this a person who needs help across the finish line ?
Do they get lost in nonessential details ?
When you ask for a thing , are you getting the end result you expect ?
How well do they know the Pond ?
We ’ll talk about their job in a moment , but whatever that job is , it will have dependencies on people they are leaving behind .
Does this person know how the organization communicates ?
Do they know both the organizational structure as well as the social structure ?
Are they asking you who to follow up with or are you asking them ?
Are they instinctively aware of whom they might piss off and proactively account for this in the first mail rather than after the flame - o - gram ?
Do they need the Pond ?
Knowledge of the Pond is great , but does this person thrive because of the Pond ?
How much of their day are they spending talking with co-workers ?
Is this conversation essential to what they do or purely social ?
Which part of them are you going to socially amputate when they ’re no longer in the building ?
Are they reliable ?
I imply at the beginning of this article that it ’s a senior employee who has a better chance at being successful remotely , but that ’s not true .
The ability to work remotely is not entirely a function of seniority ; it ’s also genetic .
There are those who do it better solo .
Their standard operating procedure is to simply get it done .
Seniority can improve personal efficiency and the quality of the finished product , but I ’ve discovered innate reliability at all levels of experience .
There are people who simply do what they say they ’re going to do .
The Right Job
Typical corporate logic dictates that a remote employee should work on a project that is separable from the rest of the team’s .
The reasoning here is flawed .
The belief is that the inconvenience of communication and decision - making latency around their distance means they should be separated and placed on non-dependent work .
Every part of that reasoning is wrong .
Every part is another reason that remote fails .
My most successful remote employee was a perfect anomaly .
He wrote standards — protocols .
The heart of his job was to define a structured means of communication where the primary goal was the removal of ambiguity .
He was a phenomenal communicator .
He went out of his way to completely and promptly answer every email .
24 hours a day .
When he visited , he took the time to do a complete circumnavigation of the Pond , vetting all the ripples he could find .
He instinctively knew that the skill in defining a protocol is creating a structure that is going to meet the needs of right now , but also the unimagined needs of five years from now .
And he applied that not only to what he wrote , but also to how he worked .
He was a wonderful anomaly and he taught me that a remote job must be perceived , in all ways , as equal to a local one .
There should be absolutely no consideration of a person ’s location on the planet Earth when considering the work you need of them .
Each time the concern “ Well , they ’re remote ” comes up , you need to turn the concern around and ask , “ What about my company , my people , or the work makes remote an issue ? ” because that is what needs to be considered locally .
The Culture
How are those back in the Pond viewing the remote employee ?
The means by which Pond - based employees discriminate varies from the discreet to the direct , from the passive to the aggressive .
The reason for this discrimination always boils down a single , fundamental tension : remote creates productivity friction .
The friction sounds something like this :
“ I do n’t know what the hell this remote person is doing , so I ’m going to assume he ’s stumbling around the house in his underwear . ”
“ This remote person is messing with my deadline or deliverable . ”
“ He does n’t answer his email . ”
How long does it take to build a thing of quality ?
There ’s a cost and the question is how is the remote worker affects this cost .
Anything higher than the cost of a local employee creates friction .
What was a 27 - second walk down the hallway to yell at Bob about his crap code is a now 30 - minutes constructing an email .
Staff meetings start with a wasted 10 minutes trying to get the videoconferencing to connect .
Every single communication with a remote worker costs more and generates more ripples in the Pond , and both their job and yours is to either make this cost go away or justify it .
Respect comes from knowledge and the question is : does your culture support a constant and consistent flow of knowledge to and from the remote worker ?
Let ’s find out :
Have you created or implemented specific communication media for the team ?
Wikis ?
IRC ?
Are they used ?
Do different teams need different media ?
Are there too many and , if so , how are you going to anoint the one true medium ?
Other than the job , how are you encouraging other random interactions between local and remote folks ?
How often are you seeing these remote folks face - to - face ?
My vote is at least monthly .
Friction Detection
Remote friction is going to crop up .
Just like interpersonal tensions randomly appear in the building , so does friction around remote employees .
What are you doing not only to detect these , but also fix them ?
An example .
I hate meetings , but the brilliant thing about a meeting is that it ’s full of people , and in a room full of people you never quite know what the hell is going to happen .
The knee jerk reaction to bridging this meeting gap when there are remote workers is always , “ We need good video conferencing software . ”
After 10 years of hearing this argument , I ’m calling fail .
Video conferencing works when you need to talk to your kids during that trip to Chicago .
It fills that visual gap , but all of the video conferencing solutions I ’ve been a part of relative to a meeting create friction rather than remove it .
Yes , I can see Anne on the screen , but she ’s flat .
She ’s also got this 1/10th of a second lag on the conversation , which does n’t sound like a lot until you ’re in the middle of that strategic rant about design and Anne chimes in , mid-sentence , with a bright thought that completely disturbs the creative cadence of your rant .
That 1/10th of a second .
Her inability to inject her essential thought at precisely the right moment .
These micro-disturbances of the Force are a constant reminder that Anne ’s not there .
She ’s being projected on the conference room wall like a well - intentioned screen saver .
This is n’t just hurting the tempo of the meeting , it ’s eroding her credibility .
In this case , surprisingly , less technology , rather than more , is better .
Skype ’s proximity to my computer and the usual lack of lag is far superior to video conferencing for 1:1s , and spending a little money on a quality Polycom is a fine solution for the staff meeting , but technology is a tool and never the answer .
Friction detection is paying attention to all the ways a remote employee interacts with the group and constantly asking , “ Is this working ? ”
Another Pond
You , as the manager of people , are responsible for making the remote call regarding a person , putting them in the right job , and making sure the culture supports remote people .
But the responsibility of delivering while remote is squarely on the remote employee .
Yes , a remote employee answers to himself .
At four in the afternoon when they run into an impossible problem , it ’s almost entirely up to them to develop their plan of attack .
Working remotely is n’t a privilege ; it ’s work .
And it ’s the same work we ’re all doing back at the mothership … fully clothed … in the Pond .
Dick Cheney , as you know by now , clawed his way out of his coffin and exposed himself to broad daylight long enough to denounce Obama yet again as the friend and abettor of terrorists .
Joe Biden was shoved out before the cameras to smack Dick down .
Whatever .
What I 'm wondering is : how many Americans really care what Dick Cheney thinks right now ?
It can't possibly be more than 15 % , can it ?
If I 'm right , then , it has occurred to me , it is entirely possible and even likely that more Americans care about what Noam Chomsky thinks than what Dick Cheney thinks .
Chomsky 's recent book sales , after all , are quite strong .
He draws thronging crowds wherever he appears .
He is not my cup of tea , so much , because -- well , let 's save the Chomsky debate for another time .
But for now , let me just say that I 'd love to see some kind of honest poll identify a subset of people familiar with both mens ' work and ask them : " In your own view , whose description of the world is closer to reality , Dick Cheney 's or Noam Chomsky's ? "
I think Chomksy just might pull that one out .

The frightening Conficker worm is just getting bigger and meaner all the time .
W32.Downadup .C , a third variant of the Conficker / Downadup worm , is reportedly being pushed out to systems that are already infected .
Analysis of the third variant of the worm by Symantec is still in the early stages , but their initial research found a couple of new attributes -- one of which includes targeting antivirus software and security tools with the intention of disabling them .
( Source : symantec.com )
New Variant Protects itself from AntiVirus Software
The Conficker / Downadup authors moved from a 250 - a - day domain - generation algorithm to a new 50,000 - a- day domain - generation algorithm in response to the security industry 's success in cracking the W32 .
Downadup .
B domain - generation algorithm .

Symantec is not seeing an increase in customer infections for this threat but they are keeping a close eye on it .
Earlier versions of the conficker / downadup worm attempted to disable antivirus software but the newest variant is designed to provide more protective actions to infected PCs so it can better defend itself from antivirus software and other methods of remediation .
A Modular Component For Currently Infected PCs
Vincent Weafer , Vice president of Symantec Security Response , says that W32 .
Downadup .C is a more aggressive modular component for machines currently infected with the Conficker / Downadup worm .
The new version does not attempt to self - replicate and appears to behave more like a Trojan than a worm , noting that it 's more robust in defending itself .

* Protestors march in UK , France , Germany , Italy , Austria
* Action sought on poverty , jobs , climate change
* Protest marks start of action on G20 summit
( Adds Biden , Brown quotes ; updates London details ; adds Vienna )
By Nick Vinocur and Noah Barkin
LONDON / BERLIN , March 28 ( Reuters ) -
Tens of thousands of people marched in capital cities across Europe on Saturday to protest about the economic crisis and urge world leaders to act on poverty , jobs and climate change at a G20 summit next week .
Chanting “ tax the rich , make them pay ” , protesters marched through London waving banners saying “ People before Profit ” , at the start of a week of protests that reflected growing public anger over bankers ’ pay and their role in the crisis .
Leaders from the world ’s 20 biggest economies meet in London on Thursday to discuss how tighter regulation of financial markets , billions of dollars in stimulus measures and credit lines for international trade can help the world economy recover from the deepest recession since the 1930s .
In Britain , trade unions , aid agencies , religious groups and environmentalists joined together under the slogan “ Put People First ” to demand reforms to make the world ’s economy fairer .
One group carried a traditional Chinese dragon with the head of a devil papered with dollar bills , calling it “ The G20 Monster ” .
Others waved signs reading “ Jobs , Justice , Climate ” .
While the atmosphere was generally carnival - like , some marchers jeered when they passed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s Downing Street offices .
Police said up to 35,000 people took part in the march and subsequent rally in Hyde Park .
“ This is going to be a summer of rage for the working class , ” said marcher Bryan Simpson , 20 , a clerk from Glasgow .
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said the protesters should “ give us a chance ” and listen to what politicians plan to do .
“ Hopefully we can make it clear to them we are going to walk away from this G20 meeting with some concrete proposals , ” he told reporters in Chile .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he understood people ’s concerns , adding , “ That is why the action we want to take ( at the G20 ) is designed to answer the questions that the protesters have today . ”
BLACK COFFIN
The British protest was mirrored in other major EU nations .
About 15,000 people marched through Berlin with black - clad protestors throwing rocks and bottles at police , setting off fireworks and smashing a police car window .
Police said several arrests were made .
Up to 14,000 assembled in Germany ’s financial capital Frankfurt , police said , as part of a two - city demonstration .
About 6,000 demonstrators , mostly students and trade union members , marched in Rome to protest about a meeting of G8 labour ministers in the city .
Most of the marchers were peaceful , carrying placards and chanting “ We wo n’t pay for the crisis ” and other slogans , but one small group smashed the glass front of a bank , and daubed “ give us our money back ” on the wall in red paint .
Fire - crackers were let off and banks , insurance companies and estate agents were also covered in paint .
“ There has been a total failure of creative finance and of an economy based on the exploitation of workers , financial speculation and tax evasion , ” said protester Mario Giannini .
In Vienna , police said some 6,500 marched through the Austrian capital under slogans such as “ Make The Rich Pay ” and “ Capitalism Kills ” .
There was no violence .
In central Paris , a few hundred demonstrators gathered in a protest under the slogan “ We will not pay for their crisis ” .
While some G20 protesters in London have adopted slogans such as “ Hang a Banker ” and “ Storm the Banks ” , organisers of the London march said they had wanted a peaceful day .
A London police spokesman said there was only one arrest , for drunken behaviour .
However , police have cancelled leave in the capital to cope with further protests planned by anarchists .

The guitars were made during 1958 - 9 by Jim Burns and Alan Wootton A collection of rare British - made electric guitars has been discovered in the basement of a house in Cheltenham .
The Supersound instruments came out of a brief partnership between Jim Burns and Alan Wootton during 1958 and 1959 .
Guy Mackenzie from West Cornwall , who bought the guitars , described them as " the holy grail " of his collection .
" I do n't actually play , " he said " but I just love them in the same way that people collect old paintings even though they can't paint . "
Mr Mackenzie heard about the find from a friend who knew he collected " weird and unusual " guitars .
" As soon as I tracked down these ultra-rare instruments - apparently some of the very first made by UK legend Jim Burns - I just had to meet the owner , " he said .
They comprise an important , but hitherto virtually unknown chapter in UK guitar - making history
Guitar expert Paul Day " I discovered he'd bought them from Alan Wootton 's son several years ago and had kept them virtually untouched ever since . "
Jim Burns ' guitars have been played by pop groups and stars including The Shadows , The Searchers , Slade and Queen 's Brian May .
" Musicians who play them now include Andy Bell of Oasis , Franz Ferdinand , Kaiser Chiefs and The Kooks , " said Mr Mackenzie .
Paul Day , guitar expert and author of " The Burns Book " on Jim Burns and his guitars said : " In nearly 50 years of playing , working on and writing about the electric guitar , this is the first time I have actually seen one Supersound instrument , let alone 12 .
" These are among the earliest electric guitars and basses from any British builder and therefore comprise an important , but hitherto virtually unknown chapter in UK guitar - making history . "

The Regime has made it official that “ right - wing extremism ” is a threat to Homeland Security .
That political genus is divided into two species — “ white supremacist and anti-government groups ” — with the latter further differentiated into various sub-species , including immigration reform activists , “ disgruntled military veterans , ” gun rights advocates , members of citizen militia groups , anti-globalists , constitutionalists , “ hate groups , ” and others deemed politically unsuitable by the Regime .
Less than two years ago , Congress enacted — by a vote of 404—6 — the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention Act .
Its first offspring was an official commission to examine potential content - based Internet restrictions .
At some point , it also begat a specialized section within the Homeland Security Department called the Extremism and Radicalization Branch ( which we ’ll call the ERB ) .
This means that for the first time in American history , the federal government has a full - time intelligence organ devoted exclusively to scrutinizing the political opinions and affiliations of U.S. citizens .
It is difficult to overstate the importance of this development as a milestone in our nation ’s apostasy from its founding as a constitutional republic .
Earlier this month , the ERB ’s “ Homeland Environment Threat Analysis Division ” issued a nine - page “ Intelligence and Analysis Assessment ” of “ right - wing extremism ” for the supposed benefit of state and local law enforcement agencies .
That document consists of reheated leftovers from several previous “ intelligence analyses ” of the “ radical right , ” including the FBI ’s notorious 1999 Project Megiddo broadside .
The ERB report concludes with the observation that the Department of Homeland Security “ will be working with its state and local partners over the next several months to ascertain with greater regional specificity the rise in rightwing extremist activity in the United States , with a particular emphasis on the political , economic , and social factors that drive rightwing extremist radicalization . ”
This is significant chiefly because it acknowledges that every “ local ” police agency in the United States is now a sensory organ , and enforcement appendage , of the Homeland Security State .
Echoes of a decade ago : A “ terrorist threat ” assessment issued in 1999 by the Phoenix FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force identified “ constitutionalists ” as a potential threat — but did n’t mention the possibility of a backlash from Muslim radicals riled up by Washington ’s foreign policy .
As partners with the Department of Homeland Security , your thoughtful and friendly “ local ” police and state police will be expected to gather intelligence on “ extremists ” within their jurisdictions and provide it to the Feds .
And in the event that they ’re required to do so by their “ partners ” in Washington , those same state and “ local ” police will be expected to question , arrest , or detain those designated to be severe risks to “ homeland security . ”
In this connection it ’s useful to remember that the Obama administration has taken care to preserve all of the necessary Bush - era precedents regarding the summary imprisonment of those designated “ unlawful enemy combatants ” by presidential decree , the suspension of habeas corpus , and even the practice of torture as a means of “ enhanced interrogation . ”
The prospect of the exercise of those powers by the incumbent is causing a loss of bladder control among many of the same GOP - aligned polemicists who insisted that they were perfectly safe when placed at the disposal of his predecessor .
This development was as predictable as the “ plot ” of a porno film .
And as Salon ’s admirable civil libertarian columnist Glen Greenwald emphasizes , the report on the “ radical right ” was actually begun under the Bush administration .
In the institutional memory of the American Right , the early Clinton years were characterized by two entirely unnecessary atrocities involving culturally isolated “ extremists ” :
The attack on the Randy Weaver family at Ruby Ridge , Idaho — which led to the murder of Sammy and Vicki Weaver — and the 51 - day standoff at Mt. Carmel , Texas , which culminated in the holocaust of April 19 , 1993 .
Putting a meme into play :
This magazine cover , which appeared roughly a year ago , anticipated one of the themes of the recent Homeland Security Department assessment of the “ right - wing threat ” — namely , that there may be a violent , racially motivated “ backlash ” against the Obama administration .
The unbearable memory of those episodes , exacerbated by the “ assault weapons ” ban , did much to catalyze resistance to the Clinton administration .
Prior to the Oklahoma City bombing , there was a widespread , and growing , appreciation for the lethal potential of what we could call the federal government ’s “ Waco gene ” — its latent tendency to isolate , dehumanize , criminalize , and even annihilate those considered to be incorrigible internal enemies .
But although this early Clinton - era anti-government backlash was rooted in worthy and entirely justified sentiments , it was poorly focused in one fairly significant respect : Clinton and his properly maligned Attorney General Janet Reno had relatively little to do with the planning and execution of the ATF ’s assault on the Branch Davidians , and nothing at all to do with the criminal assault on the Weaver family .
Those were anti -“ extremist ” initiatives planned and / or carried out by the administration of George Bush the Elder .
( It ’s not my intention to demolish a straw man by mentioning Ruby Ridge in this connection ; on many occasions I ’ve heard that incident paired with Waco when people have recited the litany of the Clinton administration ’s crimes . )
During the reign of Bush the Dumber , the GOP - aligned punditocracy insisted that only “ peace creeps ” and people who perversely sympathize with suicide bombers were outraged over the executive branch ’s assault on the Bill of Rights .
When Bush put the chainsaw to due process guarantees running back to Runnymede and mowed them down like so much overgrowth on his postage - stamp “ ranch , ” some principled voices — with Ron Paul , as always , leading that tiny chorus — took up a refrain similar to that put in the mouth of Sir Thomas More in " A Man for All Seasons " after his son - in - law William Roper urged a similar clear - cutting approach to the law .
More , suspected of disloyalty by King Henry VIII , is approached in his home by Richard Rich , * a contemptible opportunist known to be a royal spy .
Rich fishes for a bribe , baiting More with the implied threat of blackmail , only to be rebuked and sent away .
As Rich leaves , More is urged by his family to place him under arrest .
When More points out that Rich had n’t committed a crime , and that even “ the Devil himself ” is entitled to the protection of the law , Roper angrily exclaims that he would “ cut down every law in England ” to get to the Devil .
“ And when the last law was down and the devil turned round on you , where would you hide , Roper , the laws all being flat ? ”
More inquired .
“ This country ’s planted thick with laws from coast to coast — man ’s laws , and not God ’s — and if you cut them down — and you are just the man to do it — do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then ?
Yes —
I ’d give the Devil benefit of the law for my own safety ’s sake . ”

For years , Daniel Lubiano tended the roses in his front yard while watching the home across 82nd Street in South Los Angeles fall apart .
In foreclosure for nearly a year , the house had been neglected by tenants who refused to pay their rent .
The stucco was chipped and dirty , and the yard was covered in weeds .
The empty carport behind the house became a favorite spot for teenagers trying to hang pairs of tennis shoes from electrical wires overhead .
In all , there were 28 pairs dangling there .
“ We spend a lot of time trying to make our house look nice , ” said Lubiano , a 30 - year - old mechanic .
“ It would be nice if we had people move in who really wanted to take care of the place . ”

That ’s exactly what federal and city officials are hoping .
Newly appointed federal Housing Secretary Shaun Donovan on Wednesday toured the home , and another on 90th Street , to gauge the depth of the housing problem in California , where more than a quarter of the nation ’s foreclosures have occurred .
Donovan was in Los Angeles to tour some of the homes the city is buying with its share of the $ 6 billion in federal money being given to local governments to buy foreclosures under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program .
He was joined by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Los Angeles ) , who wrote the bill that created the program .
The city intends to use its $ 33 - million piece of that money to turn some of the homes into low - income rental housing .
Others it will refurbish and sell to low - income and moderate - income families .

“ We want to bring real families into these neighborhoods , not more investors , ” said Mercedes Marquez , the head of the city ’s housing agency .
Donovan , the former head of New York ’s housing agency , said he believed the city was off to a promising start and that he hoped to change the way the Department of Housing and Urban Development deals with local housing offices .
“ When was the last time you came to HUD and said we have a problem and we want you to help us solve it ? ” Donovan asked .
“ HUD has not been that kind of partner , and we want to do that now . ”
The aim of the federal effort is to reduce blight and add affordable housing .
There has been some grumbling among housing programs about the formula that was used for the funding allocation , with some agencies saying that big cities like Los Angeles and Cleveland gobbled up more than their fair share .
Some real estate brokers and private investors also have been critical of the program , saying it could force prices down even further .

The funding itself is a small dose of medicine for a massive problem .
Los Angeles saw more than 21,000 foreclosures in 2007 and 2008 , and many of them are still on the market .
Even if it spent every cent of its funding on buying homes and bought them at an average price of $ 100,000 , the city would be able to buy only 330 homes .
On 82nd , across the street from Lubiano , the duplex the city is buying went into foreclosure in June 2008 .
Anthony Chatman , the real estate broker hired by the bank , was n’t able to put it on the market , though , because the renters had stopped making payments but refused to leave .
They were evicted in February .
Their landlord bought the home for $ 470,000 in August 2006 with 100 % financing at a variable interest rate from Washington Mutual Inc .
The home had sold just five years earlier for $ 60,000 .
Chatman was planning on listing the home for $ 179,000 in March when he was contacted by the city .
They are still negotiating a sale price , he said .

City officials have been working with Wells Fargo & Co. , which is managing the loan on the house , to find properties and make bids on them , Marquez said .
The homes will be bought through a nonprofit agency the city has set up with Maryland - based Enterprise Community Partners , one of the country ’s largest low - income housing developers .
Inside , the duplex looked as if it had never seen a vacuum cleaner .
In the larger of the two units , the once - aquamarine carpet was now mostly tarry black and brown , covered in part by an equally stained rug showing the signs of the zodiac .
Despite bars on every window and door , the house had been broken into in recent weeks , the heaters ripped from the walls .
Next door , another bank - owned property was covered in gang graffiti .
Up the street , Ana Ruiz , 33 , said she hoped the city would bring in enough new owners to make a difference .
She said she feared for her safety and that of her two daughters because the neighborhood had become a magnet for crime .

“ At night this place is pretty scary , ” Ruiz said in Spanish .
“ We have the police coming and the helicopters coming .
. . .
Unless something changes , I am going to move . ”

Scientists have discovered an exquisitely preserved ancient primate fossil that they believe forms a crucial " missing link " between our own evolutionary branch of life and the rest of the animal kingdom .
The 47 m - year - old primate – named Ida – has been hailed as the fossil equivalent of a " Rosetta Stone " for understanding the critical early stages of primate evolution .
The top - level international research team , who have studied her in secret for the past two years , believe she is the most complete and best preserved primate fossil ever uncovered .
The skeleton is 95 % complete and thanks to the unique location where she died , it is possible to see individual hairs covering her body and even the make - up of her final meal – a last vegetarian snack .
" This little creature is going to show us our connection with the rest of all the mammals ; with cows and sheep , and elephants and anteaters , " said Sir David Attenborough who is narrating a BBC documentary on the find .
" The more you look at Ida , the more you can see , as it were , the primate in embryo . "
" This will be the one pictured in the textbooks for the next hundred years , " said Dr Jørn Hurum , the palaeontologist from Oslo University 's Natural History Museum who assembled the scientific team to study the fossil .
" It tells a part of our evolution that 's been hidden so far .
It 's been hidden because the only [ other ] specimens are so incomplete and so broken there 's nothing almost to study . "
The fossil has been formally named Darwinius masillae in honour of Darwin 's 200th birthday year .
It has been shipped across the Atlantic for an unveiling ceremony hosted by the mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg today .
There is even talk of Ida being the first non-living thing to feature on the front cover of People magazine .
She will then be transported back to Oslo , via a brief stop at the Natural History Museum in London on Tuesday , 26 May , when Attenborough will host a press conference .
Ida was originally discovered by an amateur fossil hunter in the summer of 1983 at Messel pit , a world renowned fossil site near Darmstadt in Germany .
He kept it under wraps for over 20 years before deciding to sell it via a German fossil dealer called Thomas Perner .
It was Perner who approached Hurum two years ago .
" My heart started beating extremely fast , " said Hurum , " I knew that the dealer had a world sensation in his hands .
I could not sleep for 2 nights .
I was just thinking about how to get this to an official museum so that it could be described and published for science . "
Hurum would not reveal what the university museum paid for the fossil , but the original asking price was $ 1 m .
He did not see the fossil before buying it – just three photographs , representing a huge gamble .
But it appears to have paid off .
" You need an icon or two in a museum to drag people in , " said Hurum , " this is our Mona Lisa and it will be our Mona Lisa for the next 100 years . "
Hurum chose Ida 's nickname because the diminutive creature is at the equivalent stage of development as his six - year - old daughter .
Hurum said Ida is very excited about her namesake .
" She says , ' there are two Idas now , there 's me I 'm living and then there 's the dead one . ' "
" It 's caught at a really very interesting moment [ in the animal 's life ] when it fortunately has all its baby teeth and is in the process of forming all its permanent teeth , " said Dr Holly Smith , an expert in primate development at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , who was part of the team .
" So you have more information in it than almost any fossil you could think of . "
The fossil 's amazing preservation means that the scientific team has managed to glean a huge amount of information from it , although this required new X - ray techniques that had not previously been applied to any other specimens .
The researchers believe it comes from the time when the primate lineage , that diversified into monkeys , apes and ultimately humans , split from a separate group that went on to become lemurs and other less well known species .
Crucially though , Ida is not on the lemur line because she lacks two key characteristics shared by lemurs – a grooming claw on her second toe and a fused set of teeth called a tooth comb .
Also , a bone in her ankle called the talus is shaped like members of our branch of the primates .
So the researchers believe she may be on our evolutionary line dating from just after the split with the lemurs .
According to the team 's published description of the skeleton in the journal PLoS ONE , Ida was 53 cm long and a juvenile around six to nine months old .
The team can be sure Ida is a girl because she does not have a penis bone .
" She was at this vulnerable age where you are no longer right with your mother , " said Smith , " Just as you leave weaning you are not full grown , but you are on your own . "
The unprecedented preservation of Ida meant working out how she died was more like a modern day crime scene investigation than the informed guess - work that palaeontologists usually make do with .
The team noticed that she had a broken wrist that had begun to partially heal .
The injury did not kill her , but they speculate that it contributed to her premature demise .
" It might be that her mother dropped her once or that she fell down from a tree earlier in her life , " Smith said .
She survived the accident , but her climbing abilities would have been impaired .
Unable to drink from water trapped by tree leaves , she would have had to venture down to the lake to drink .
This would have proved to be a fateful decision .
The huge range of magnificently preserved fossils at Messel suggest that the volcanic lake was a death trap .
Scientists believe that it sporadically let forth giant belches of poisonous volcanic gases that would have immediately suffocated anything in , around and even over the water .
Ida would then have fallen into the water and been preserved in the sediment deep at the bottom .

CLARE --
Two Clare brothers charged with burning the anus of a 6 - year - old boy with a propane torch could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of first - degree child abuse .
Clare County 80th District Court Magistrate Rick Laboda on Wednesday arraigned Gerald T. Hall , 36 , and Glen Leslee Hall , 43 , for the crime , which caused second - and third - degree burns , state police from the Mount Pleasant post say .
The mother of the child and hospital staff called police when they discovered what had happened .
Police immediately arrested Gerald Hall and later arrested Glen Hall where he works at a construction site , said state police Sgt. Del Putnam .
" They said they were disciplining the child for making a mess in his pants , " Putnam said .
Police say the men took the boy to a shed and took turns burning the child on the buttocks and anus , causing the severe burns .
The men also removed the boy 's clothing and burned them as well .
The child was treated and released at an area hospital after a short hospital stay , police said .
County Prosecutor Michelle Ambrozaitis would not comment on the prior criminal records of the brothers , although police said both had extensive criminal histories .
Laboda set the preliminary examination for the pair for 2 p.m. Tuesday , May 5 , in District Court .
Is hacking a netbook to run Mac OS X really worth the trouble ?
Two tech journalists today expressed grief with their Hackbooks , so I felt like chiming in with my thoughts about my somewhat controversial MSI Wind Hackintosh .
In short , my Hackintosh and I have been pals for six months , but it 's been a pretty bumpy ride .
When I first bought my Wind in October , I was thrilled after successfully hacking it to run Mac OS X Leopard .
I loved the netbook so much , in fact , that I almost stopped using my first - generation MacBook Pro altogether .
To express my delight , I even made a custom wallpaper for my netbook featuring my favorite childhood ice cream flavor ( Superman ) .
The Wind was a great companion device : I use an iMac in the office , so when I got home the dumbed - down , lightweight netbook was perfect for web surfing , chatting and general unwinding .
But over time the problems started surfacing .
Like Wired.com 's Charlie Sorrel , I grew to despise the Wind 's dinky trackpad :
Whoever designed it had in mind an infant 's hands ; navigating became so tiresome that I started carrying around an external mouse to make it tolerable .
Second , the software issues .
Seeing as this netbook was hacked to run OS X , of course it did n't work perfectly .
I accepted that , and with some tweaks I got most software utilities working properly .
But while I was traveling in Europe , my netbook 's Wi-Fi suddenly stopped working .
The Airport utility simply would n't light up , and I discovered a few fixes that worked temporarily , only for the connection to fail again .
As you can imagine , a netbook without the net in a foreign country was a huge drag — a piece of useless plastic added to my luggage .
I ended up barely using my netbook during my trip , and I instead heavily relied on my problem - free iPhone .
When I returned home , I completely reinstalled OS X , and Wi-Fi worked once again .
And then the hardware issues kicked in .
Minor ones , actually : Screws at the bottom of the clamshell kept falling out , even after I screwed them in as tightly as possible .
I inspected the case more closely and realized it no longer clamps all the way shut , which is why the screws are n't staying in .
This issue was probably a result of cheap plastic or shoddy clamshell design .
Unfortunately this created another annoying problem :
The battery kept popping out of the case ever so slightly — just enough to shut off the computer whenever I nudged the netbook .
I eventually resolved the problem with some double - sided tape , but I was n't happy about it .
Given all these issues , I became pretty jaded about my netbook — hence my lack of mentioning it here at Wired.com in recent months .
I ended up selling my MacBook Pro and buying the latest unibody model refurbished , and now I rarely use my netbook .
So unfortunately , I have to agree with Dave " MacSparky " Sparks and The Unofficial Apple Weblog 's Steven Sande , who both grew frustrated with their Dell Mini 9 Hackintoshes .
It 's a fun hacking project , but it 's like the fixed - gear bicycle you built but left sitting in the garage , because over time you realized it was too impractical .

The Motion Picture Association of America ’s “ ‘ no homo ’ rule strikes again , ” said Richard Lawson in Gawker .
“ Sacha Baron Cohen 's new mockumentary , Bruno , in which he terrorizes straight men with flagrant gayness , " has earned an NC - 17 rating .
One reason is clearly that the film includes a scene depicting gay fashionista Bruno having anal sex .
But there 's time before Bruno ’s scheduled July release to chop enough to earn an R rating , said Hilary Lewis in The Business Insider .
That 's something Sacha Baron Cohen can do to be safe while appealing the decision .
Universal “ wo n't release the movie ” if it ’s NC - 17 and “ seems to believe that , with edits , Bruno will get a more acceptable rating . ”
“ Bruno is not to be missed , NC - 17 or not , ” said Stephan Horbelt in Gaywired .
Sure , it has some controversial scenes , but it ’s more than “ simply shock - comedy . ”
The film ’s protagonist , Bruno , “ exposes and challenges ” people ’s “ blatant racism and homophobia ( and often sheer stupidity ) ” in his hilarious encounters with them .
Sacha Baron
Cohen ’s comedy would be more satisfying , said Rod Dreher in BeliefNet , if it were n’t so mean .
The creator of the admittedly hilarious Borat filmed a scene for Bruno in Dallas and “ pulled an ugly stunt tricking a local audience of Christians . ”
Is the film too raunchy ?
Maybe , but the main reason not to watch is Baron Cohen ’s habit of “ taking cheap shots at easy targets . ”

Let ’s say that you ’re a working mom with two kids to send to school , and a husband who also needs to prepare to go to work in the morning .

Chancellor Alistair Darling today gambled on a rapid economic recovery to rebuild Britain 's battered finances as he revealed that borrowing this year would hit a record £ 175 billion .
In a grim Budget statement he outlined the full depth of the economic crisis .
Mr Darling warned that output would shrink by 3.5 per cent this year - more than doubling his previous forecast .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And he revealed that borrowing this year would soar to £ 175 billion - with another £ 173 billion in 2010 - as the country battled with the worst global downturn in 60 years .
He also said deflation would plunge to minus three per cent by September .
Despite the bleak figures , Mr Darling insisted public finances would get back on track with a halving of borrowing within four years as the economy began to recover from the end of the year .
But Tory leader David Cameron launched a scathing attack on the Government 's handling of the economy .
He said : " As of today any claim they have ever made to economic competence is dead , over , finished . "
The Chancellor made clear that his plans depended on a rapid economic bounce - back - with a forecast of 1.25 per cent growth next year rising to 3.5 per cent in 2011 .
Nevertheless , he admitted that the economy would first face of period of deepening deflation with the Retail Price Index falling to a low of minus three per cent by September .
The Chancellor warned that rebuilding the public finances would take " tough decisions "
He said the planned new top income tax rate of 45 per cent on incomes above £ 150,000 will be increased to 50 per cent and take effect from next April - a year earlier than planned .
And from April 2011 , pension tax relief would be restricted for those with incomes over £ 150,000 .

Mr Darling defied calls from transport and motoring groups for another freeze on fuel duty which will rise by 2 p a litre in September and then by 1 p a litre above inflation each April for the next four years .
But he confirmed the Government would attempt to kick - start the ailing motor industry by introducing a car - scrappage scheme .
Anyone with a car registered before 31 July 1999 will get a cash incentive of £ 2,000 to trade in their old vehicle for a brand new one .
A total of £ 1,000 will come from the Government and the remaining £ 1,000 from car companies , with participants being able to buy any new vehicle , including small vans , rather than just low - pollution models .
Around £ 300 million has been put aside by the Government to fund the scheme which is expected to come into effect as early as mid-May and will last until the grant runs out , thus enabling 300,000 consumers to benefit .
Drinkers and smokers will be hit with alcohol duties to go up by 2 per cent from midnight tonight , while there will be an increase in tobacco duty of 2 per cent from 6 pm tonight .

Bloggers are the modern journalists .
This is a freedom of the press issue .
Bloggers are like Ben Franklin and his printing press in 1770 .

More like Thomas Paine .
When Franklin was a printer he was pretty main stream ,
It was not until he violated the terms of his Crown job and was denounced in the well of Parliment , that Franklin went radical .

Bloggers are part of the new , emerging PRESS .
Here is a link to a great article on the difference between real reports and " professional jounalists " .
We Are Change founder Luke Rudkowski was arrested for trying to ask New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg about his refusal to pay for the health care of 9/11 first responders .
The charges ?
" Impersonating a member of the press " and trespassing .
Those from whom our rulers have no fear of tough , dogged , nasty questioning ( ala Tim Russert ) are the only ones guilty of Impersonating members of the press American needs a free press .
Governments though need main stream ( status quo ) medias .
Go Brad !
Go Jeff !

I realized my reference to Franklin may have been too obscure .
Franklin worked to quiet talk of rebellion until 1775 .
His efforts are described in the Declaration of Independence with the paragraph beginning with " Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren .
We have warned them from time ... "
But it was the affair of the Hutchinson Papers that push Franklin firmly out of the Loyalist camp and into the Patriot camp .
Thomas Paine , Sam Adams , and Crispus Attucks were Sons of Liberty from the get go .
They needed no convincing that the Blessings of Liberty were worth pursuing right now .

When Franklin was younger he was full of piss , but when the farmers rebellion against the elite class happened in Mass . in 1787 he was ready to hang them all .
Paine was long gone by then , the only people that saved the farmers ( regulators ) asses from the gallows were Jefferson and Hancock .

This is pretty unbelievable - but not surprising .
The blogging community has brought back accountability to the public discourse after the mainstream pressed relinquished their duties many moons ago .
Those in authority who for so long got away with murder are now being outed - and they 're not used to it .
So , as we see regularly , they react in the most obvious and embarrassing ways , bringing that much more attention to their own mendacity and cover-ups .
Blogging has re-energized our society and we should be thankful to the many talented bloggers who are taking authority to task .

BBC News technology correspondent
The IWF was set up in 1996 to police access to images of child abuse .
The BBC goes behind the scenes at the Internet Watch Foundation to see how its researchers cope with the psychologically demanding job of policing sites peddling images of child abuse .
The watchdog that blocked a Wikipedia page last year over a rock album cover says it still believes that the image at the heart of that controversy was illegal .
But the Internet Watch Foundation ( IWF ) says it has moved on after the row in December 2008 , and claims its quest to eradicate child abuse images from the web is now having real success .
Critics have accused the organisation of being both unaccountable and ineffective .
This week the BBC was given unique access to the work of the IWF , as the watchdog tries to fight back .
It 's in a house in a quiet village north of Cambridge that the Internet Watch Foundation runs a hotline for reports of child abuse images .
It 's a job the self - regulatory body was given in 1996 , as the internet industry sought to avoid direct control by the police or government .
Upstairs at its HQ there is a door marked " IWF staff only - image viewing in progress " .
I was allowed in , to find four analysts at work , sifting through reports that have arrived overnight from members of the public .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The analysts , who mostly have backgrounds in IT , prefer to remain anonymous , but one of them , Karen , agreed to tell me about her work .
She showed me a list of the reports she had to deal with that day , some from members of the public who said they had been looking for adult sites but had been shocked to come across child abuse images .
Some callers fear they may be accused of downloading illegal images .
Her first task is to try to determine whether the images are in fact illegal under UK law .
" My next step would be to chase that image or website to the country where it is located , " she said .
In almost all cases , the offending sites are abroad , and Karen contacts one of the IWF 's 35 sister organisations - if there is one in the country concerned - and informs the UK police .
I put it to Karen that it must be difficult to do such emotionally draining work , especially when some feel that it 's not even worthwhile .
" There are times when I questioned my own sanity for doing this , " she admitted .
" However , I 'm a mother with two children , I feel that it's an important job and someone needs to do it .
That 's how I get through the day . "
Karen sees some sites cropping up time and again , with the criminals moving them from country to country , trying to stay one step ahead .
She said : " We 're also finding a trend towards sexual abuse images of younger and younger children , and more severe forms of abuse . "
She explains that most of the sites operate a pay - per - view system , charging $ 80 - 100 ( £ 55 - 68 ) per month for access to images and videos .
The offending sites are also added to the blacklist compiled by the IWF for internet service providers , which then block access .
There are times when I questioned my own sanity for doing this
Karen , IWF researcher
It was this process which led to the blocking of a Wikipedia page about a 1970s album cover featuring an image of a naked young girl .
That ruling , reversed within days , threw a spotlight on the IWF , and the transparency of its procedures .
David Gerard of the Wikimedia Foundation , which runs Wikipedia and other similar projects , says the incident showed the IWF to be " ham - fisted and incompetent at every level " .
He maintains that there is no way to block illegal content " without massive collateral damage to speech , communication , learning and society " .
Dr Richard Clayton , a computer scientist at Cambridge University , has a different criticism - that the watchdog suffers from confusion about its aims .
His research shows that , while banks manage to get phishing sites taken down within hours , the IWF takes an average of 28 days to get child abuse sites removed .
" ' Are they trying to get sites removed from the internet ? ' he asks , if so they 're doing a poor job .
" Alternatively , if they think their aim is to catch the criminals putting up this material , then they should become part of the police . "
The IWF censored an image that appeared on a Wikipedia page Peter Robbins , chief executive of the IWF , says the various critics are ignoring the fact that the watchdog 's mission is proving a success .
He says the IWF has learned from the Wikipedia controversy , though he still believes the image on the album cover was illegal .
" Was that an image of a pre-pubescent girl ?
Yes .
In our view it 's not OK , " he says .
But he accepts that it was not realistic to ban an image that was widely available in shops and on the internet .
" I do n't want to dwell on this incident .
The fact is that we are dealing with some horrendous content on a daily basis and we 're working really hard with hotlines and law enforcement bodies to try to stop the distributors of these images . "

At first glance , the town of Edwardsville , Ala. , with a population of 194 people , might raise a few eyebrows with its bid to receive $ 375 million from the economic stimulus package being assembled by Barack Obama and lawmakers in Congress .
The tiny town , located near the Georgia border and 26 miles from the nearest " big city " of Anniston ( population : 24,276 ) , added 33 proposals — about two thirds of them related to " green " energy — to the list of " ready - to - go " projects assembled by the U.S. Conference of Mayors .
Total sum : $ 375,076,200 .
That comes out to nearly $ 2 million per Edwardsville resident , although E. D. Phillips , the town 's representative to the U.S. Conference of Mayors , says the projects would affect a wider region that comprises about 80,000 people .
That number includes residents of nearby rural areas that are n't already incorporated into towns , along with the residents of Talladega Springs ( population : 124 ) , which partnered with Edwardsville and local municipal utilities on the projects .
There 's certainly no denying that Edwardsville has big ambitions .
Through the various proposals , which include a renewable energy museum , scenic railroad , and vineyards , these small Alabama communities envision themselves becoming a cutting - edge demonstration project for energy sustainability and a hub for tourism .
" I know we look like some little Podunk town , and by the census , we are , " Phillips says .
" But we really think we 've done some amazingly progressive things in the past two years . "
The town 's proposals began to develop more than two years ago , when Phillips and another town official became intrigued by the argument that renewable energy could create a rural renaissance .
If any community needed economic revival , it was Edwardsville — even before the recession .
At 28.7 percent , the town 's poverty level was nearly equal to that of Nepal and more than twice the national average , according to the 2000 census .
Along with the more traditional proposals to replace streetlights with solar - powered lights ( cost : $ 3,479,200 ) , to install solar panels on the town hall ( cost : $ 77,000 ) , and to build solar - powered recharging stations for electric golf carts and vehicles ( cost : $ 620,000 ) , Edwardsville and Talladega Springs have assembled a set of even more far - reaching projects .
An outlay of $ 50.4 million , for example , would go toward installing water pipelines beneath roads to soak up the sun 's rays , transferring heat .
That technology is currently being used in the Netherlands , which found that while the cost of installation was double that of normal gas heating , the system halved the amount of energy required .
With big dreams , however , come big price tags .
" Do you know how hard it is to fund some of these projects when your tax base is so low ? "
Phillips says .
" So we just breathed this sigh of relief when we found out about the stimulus package . . . especially when it had a focus on renewable energy . "
Not everyone shares the sentiment .
" This really exemplifies the problem .
Why are we buying light bulbs for a local community ? " asks Tom Schatz , president of the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste .
" If a municipality wants to save money , [ it can ] go out and buy the light bulbs .
There is no reason the federal government should buy them . "
One of Edwardsville 's biggest proposed expenditures is for a " renewable energy museum and information dissemination center . "
Phillips envisions exhibits , audio tours , seminars , a research center , and a satellite lab run by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
To fund the museum , Edwardsville is requesting $ 32.1 million .
That makes the facility the fourth most expensive museum proposed on the U.S. Conference of Mayors list — following facilities planned by Miami , Las Vegas , and Scottsdale , Ariz .
( Some of those facilities have drawn their own controversy : Las Vegas 's proposal for a $ 55 million " mob museum , " for example , was used by Sen .
Mitch McConnell this week as a prime example of pork spending . )
Some might wonder how many people a renewable energy museum in rural Alabama could attract .
And there are other routes for museum funding , like the Institute of Museum and Library Services .
If a project can't get funding through competitive grants , Schatz says , perhaps it should n't get funding at all .
" Clearly , no one else has been interested in funding this , so why should we be doing it now ? " he asks , referring to all the projects on the U.S. Conference of Mayors list that are using the stimulus as a last - ditch funding effort .
" Why should the federal government be doing something now that you could n't do yourself ? "
But with city and state budgets tight , says Ford Bell , the president of the American Association of Museums , it 's small wonder that many are turning elsewhere .
And , he adds , just because a museum is rural does n't mean it 's doomed to fail , noting the success of a living history museum in Fishers , Ind .
The energy museum speaks to Edwardsville 's larger hope : becoming a tourist destination .
The town has requested $ 37 million for a solar energy - enhanced " scenic railroad line . "
It 's also asking for $ 9 million to go toward establishing an eventual 640 acres of vineyards , 160 acres of which would be launched first .
Each of the four vineyards would be designed around the theme of a different European country and , in a bid for weddings , dotted with gazebos and chapels .
To some , the vineyards , in particular , seem dubious .
The Southeast is subject to a disease that puts traditional European grape varieties out of reach , usually limiting vineyards to the muscadine grape .
Partly as a result , vineyards have n't exactly been the region 's strong suit .
Georgia has just 1,100 acres of vineyards , while Mississippi has 400 .
( Compare that with California 's 800,000 or even Pennsylvania 's 12,000 . )
The 640 acres for vineyards that Edwardsville ultimately wants to establish would nearly double the vineyard acreage of the entire state of Alabama , which is currently at 650 .
Funding more than " a fraction of the scope " of neighboring states ' vineyards with public money , therefore , would distort the market , says Bill Nelson , president of WineAmerica , the National Association of American Wineries .
It 's not yet known whether Edwardsville will get any money from the stimulus package at all .
There 's no guarantee as to how many projects , if any , on the mayors list will get federal funding .
And although $ 375 million may seem like a lot of money , it 's also a fraction of the $ 96,638,419,313 requested by all the towns on the list .
But for Edwardsville , that money — whether seen as " pork " or not — would make a fantasy come true .
" We would love to be the poster child for rural America , for attempting to change through concern for the environment and clean energy , " says Phillips .
" We think if anyone can do it , we can . "
I had a probationary programmer working for me .
Needless to say , he never got to be permanent .
One day I was inspecting his C code and found this : if ( a = 1 ) {... some code ...} else {... some other code ... I told him the " else " clause will never get executed because of his " if " statement .
I asked him to figure out why .
He said he'd " investigate " it first .
I allowed him to " investigate , " since it had not been a critical task .
A day later , he told me he figured out the problem .
He said he used an incorrect operand in the " if " statement -- it should have been == instead of = , which was absolutely correct .
But then he emailed me his revised code .a = 1 ; if ( a == 1 ) {... some code ...} else {... some other code ... What the ...? I asked him if the " a = 1 " part was necessary and not just a fragment of debug code he forgot to remove .
He said it was necessary .
So I asked him if the " else " statement would ever be executed .
He said yes .
I asked him to give me a situation when such would occur .
He said he'd get back to me with the explanation .
I kicked him out of the project that same afternoon .
On three separate occasions , the White House has asked the public to provide them with feedback on the top public policy questions facing the nation .
And on three separate occasions , the leading question for the new administration — as chosen on and voted by the American public — pertained to the legalization of marijuana .
One might examine these results and conclude that marijuana law reform is an issue that is becoming increasingly popular with America ’s voters .
Of course if you ’re Fox News , you interpret these results another way .
Obama ’s Effort at Online Transparency Stymied by Internet Trolls
via Fox News
“ Three and a half million people participated in the event , but the ‘ trolls ’ had their way : Following a coordinated campaign by marijuana advocates to vote their topic to the top of the list , questions on the future of the U.S. dollar and the rising unemployment rate were superseded by questions about legalizing pot as an economic remedy . ”
Got to hand it to the folks at Fox .
( PS : For the record , Wired makes the same accusation ! )
National polls show that the public ’s support for legalization has never been greater .
Leading political and media pundits are now demanding that we end the criminal prohibition of pot .
Yet despite all evidence to the contrary , the old guard at Fox News cynically clings to the notion that nobody supports taxing and regulating marijuana aside from a handful of “ Internet trolls . ”
We report , you decide , huh ?
Of course , Fox News did n’t come up with this spin on their own .
After all , it was White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs — yes , the same Robert Gibbs who could n’t come up with one valid reason to oppose regulating pot besides “ uh ” — who initially tried to downplay the popularity of marijuana law reform , telling the New York Times that “ advocates for legalizing marijuana , … includ[ing ] NORML , had mounted a drive to rack up votes for the question . ”
So let ’s set the record straight shall we .
On the afternoon of March 25 , with only a few hours left for voting in the White House ’s poll , I posted the following blog to NORML ’s homepage : “ Obama ‘ Open For Questions ’ About The Economy — Ask Him To Support Taxing And Regulating Marijuana . ”
Here ’s what I wrote in my post :
The topic of this week ’s forum is the national economy , and not surprisingly , many of you have already put forward questions to the President regarding the taxation and regulation of cannabis .
For example , the most popular question in the category “ Budget ” is : “ With over 1 out of 30 Americans controlled by the penal system , why not legalize , control , and tax marijuana to change the failed war on drugs into a money making , money saving boost to the economy ? ”
Similarly , under the topic “ Financial Stability , ” most asked question is : “ Would you support the bill currently going through the California legislature to legalize and tax marijuana , boosting the economy and reducing drug cartel related violence ? ”
Marijuana - related questions also top the “ Green Jobs and Energy ” category , and are among the top vote - getters on the site overall .
That ’s right , the questions pertaining to marijuana law reform were already the top vote - getters before NORML ever put pen to paper !
Further , NORML at no time engaged in any sort of “ coordinated campaign ” ( to quote Fox ) to “ rack up votes ” ( to quote the Obama administration ) .
NORML did not list - serv news of the White House poll to our tens of thousands of e-zine subscribers , nor did we publicize the poll to the hundreds of thousands of people that have joined us on Facebook and Myspace .
And to the best of my knowledge , no other marijuana law reform group did so either .
In short , there was no orchestrated “ campaign ” and there is no grand conspiracy .
The simple explanation for the White House poll results is this : Marijuana law reform is immensely popular with the public .
That ’s why we win initiatives — time and time again .
And that ’s why when the public is asked whether they support ending prohibition they say ‘ yes ’ — in overwhelming numbers !
As my colleague Scott Morgan writes at stopthedrugwar.org : “ This is a movement , and it is n’t going away .
Our issue is bigger than the organizations backing it . ”
He ’s right .
Americans are demanding a serious and objective political debate regarding the merits of legalizing marijuana .
They have come to this conclusion on their own — simply by witnessing the failure of the drug war all around them .
President Obama , the time for adolescent jokes and giggles is over .
Fox News , the time for insults has long passed .
The public is serious ; why are n’t you ?

Von Trier : " I am the best film director in the world "
The day after critics and journalists heckled and booed his new film “ Antichrist , ” here at the Cannes Film Festival , director Lars Von Trier stepped into the spotlight to talk about the movie .
A loud boo could be heard as he entered the press conference room , eliciting a faint smile on the filmmaker ’s face .
“ I am the best film director in the world , ” Lars Von Trier proclaimed provocatively today when pressed to defend his Cannes competition entry , a quote that will surely follow him for some time to come .
Later during the discussion , another journalist returned to that statement , asking him to list other filmmakers he also likes .
“ All the others are overrated , so that ’s quite simple , ” Von Trier quipped , stirring laughter from the room .
“ I just met Scorsese [ at the hotel ] and I think it ’s quite easy for all of you educated people [ to see ] where most of these things come from . ”
“ This knowledge I have that I am the best director , I see it as true , ” Von Trier continued , “ I am sure other directors may feel the same , [ but ] maybe they dont say it , ” he said , never raising his voice .
“ I am not sure I am .
I just think I am . ”
The tone of the session was set with the first question from the press .
Journalist Baz Bamigboye from the Daily Mail asked Von Trier to explain his controversial new movie , which features Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg as a couple grieving in the wake of the sudden death of their young child .
The two travel to the woods to get away , but while there they go to extremes .
Set amidst beautiful imagery and a tranquil outdoor landscape , the film includes graphic portrayals of torture and genital mutilation as the grieving couple aggressively confont each other .
Read indieWIRE ’s review of Lars Von Trier ’s “ Antichrist . ”
“ I ca n’t justify myself , ” said Von Trier starting to explain after that first question , before being cut off by Bamigboye .
“ Well , why did you make it then ? ” the journalist shouted back at him .
“ I enjoyed making it , ” Von Trier responded quietly , pausing and seeming just slightly flustered .
“ I do n’t have very much to say , ” Von Trier continued , “ I think its a very strange question that I have to defend myself .
I do n’t feel that .
You are all my guests , it ’s not the other way around , that ’s how I feel . ”
“ I work for myself , ” Von Trier added , “ I have n’t done it for you or for an audience .
I do n’t think I owe anybody an explanation . ”
The genital mutilation scenes in the film are the ones that most who ’ve seen the movie will likely discuss , debate or simply laugh at , as was the case after last night ’s screening .
“ We could only shoot it once , you know , ” Von Trier deadpanned , garnering even more laughs , when asked why he included such graphic imagery .
“ For me , not to show it would be lying as this is a very dark dream about guilt and sex and stuff .
It came in naturally . ”
Von Trier has explained that “ Antichrist ” came out of a two year period of depression that he faced in which everything seemed unimportant to him .
“ Six months later , just as an exercise , I wrote a script , ” Von Trier explained , in a letter that is included in the press kit for the movie ( reprinted on the subsequent page here ) .
“ It was a kind of therapy , but also a search , a test to see if I would ever make another film . ”
“ I would like to invite you for a tiny glimpse behind the curtain , ” he writes in the notes , “ A glimpse into the dark world of my imagination : into the nature of my fears , into the nature of Antichrist . ”
He calls the the movie , “ The most important film of my entire career . ”
Asked later how or if this film brought him harmony , Von Trier seemed a bit confused , but explained , “ Its more the routine of making a film that is therapy , the routine of getting up every day and going to work and that helps . ”
Pressed to react to the journalist ’s negative reactions to his new movie , again Von Trier remained steady .
“ I have been treated badly by the press before , I like that …its a good start for a discussion , you know , that you feel something about the project . ”
And , given the strong reactions to the movie already , how will he distribute it , another journalist answered .
“ That ’s something I have not though about , ” Von Trier replied simply .
“ I dont believe in thinking about audience when you do a film , so maybe it wil be a catastrophe . ”
Lars Von Trier : Director ’s Confession
Two years ago , I suffered from depression .
It was a new experience for me .
Everything , no matter what , seemed unimportant , trivial .
I could n’t work .
Six months later , just as an exercise , I wrote a script .
It was a kind of therapy , but also a search , a test to see if I would ever make another film .
The script was finished and filmed without much enthusiasm , made as it was using about half of my physical and intellectual capacity .
The work on the script did not follow my usual modus operandi .
Scenes were added for no reason .
Images were composed free of logic or dramatic thinking .
They often came from dreams I was having at the time , or dreams I ’d had earlier in my life .
Once again , the subject was “ Nature , ” but in a different and more direct way than before .
In a more personal way .
The film does not contain any specific moral code and only has what some might call ‘ the bare necessities ’ in the way of a plot .
I read Strindberg when I was young .
I read with enthusiasm the things he wrote before he went to Paris to become an alchemist and during his stay there … the period later called his “ inferno crisis ” – was “ Antichrist ” my Inferno Crisis ?
My affinity with Strindberg ?
In any case , I can offer no excuse for “ Antichrist ” .
Other than my absolute belief in the film – the most important film of my entire career !
Lars von Trier , Copenhagen , 25/03/09 .

" Psychedelica " seems the perfect name for a species of fish that is a wild swirl of tan and peach zebra stripes and behaves in ways contrary to its brethren .
So says University of Washington 's Ted Pietsch , who is the first to describe the new species in the scientific literature and thus the one to select the name .
Psychedelica is perhaps even more apt given the cockamamie way the fish swim , some with so little control they look intoxicated and should be cited for DUI .
Members of Histiophryne psychedelica , or H. psychedelica , do n't so much swim as hop .
Each time they strike the seafloor they use their fins to push off and they expel water from tiny gill openings on their sides to jettison themselves forward .
With tails curled tightly to one side – which surely limits their ability to steer – they look like inflated rubber balls bouncing hither and thither .
While other frogfish and similar species are known to jettison themselves up off the bottom before they begin swimming , none have been observed hopping .
It 's just one of the behaviors of H. psychedelica never observed in any other fish , says Pietsch , UW professor of aquatic and fishery sciences and curator of fishes at the UW Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture .
He 's the lead author of a paper about the new species that 's now online at Copeia , the journal of the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists .
His work is funded by the National Science Foundation .
It was little more than a year ago that the fish with rare , forward - facing eyes like humans and a secretive nature was the subject of worldwide news coverage after having been observed in the busy harbor of Ambon Island , Indonesia .
An adult fish was observed in January 2008 by Toby Fadirsyair , a guide , and Buck and Fitrie Randolph , two of the co-owners of Maluku Divers , which is based in Ambon .
They and co-owners Andy and Kerry Shorten eventually found Pietsch to help them identify the fish .
Since the first sighting divers have observed a number of adults and juveniles , now that they know what to look for .
Adults of H. psychedelica are fist - sized with gelatinous bodies covered with thick folds of skin that protect them from sharp - edged corals as they haunt tiny nooks and crannies of the harbor reef .
Fins on either side of their bodies have , as with other frogfish , evolved to be leg - like , and members of H. psychedelica actually prefer crawling to swimming .
The species has a flattened face with eyes directed forward .
It 's something Pietsch , with 40 years of experience studying and classifying fishes , has never seen before in frogfish .
It causes him to speculate that the species may have binocular vision , that is , vision that overlaps in front , like it does in humans .
Most fish , with eyes on either side of their head , do n't have vision that overlaps ; instead they see different things with each eye .

DNA work revealed that H. psychedelica joins two other species in the genus Histiophryne , though the other two are very drably colored in comparison .
The genus is but one of about a dozen in the family Antennariidae , known as frogfish in most places in the world .
The frogfish are , in turn , part of the larger order of Lophiiformes , or anglerfish .
Pietsch is the world 's foremost anglerfish authority and , when sent a photo last year of the newfound fish , he said he'd stake his reputation that it was an anglerfish .
He was right .
But what an unusual member it turned out to be .
Compared to other anglerfish , members of H. psychedelica have no lures .
Most anglerfish have lures growing out of their foreheads .
The other anglerfish sit right out in the open on the seafloor or coral reefs , often adapting their coloring so their bodies are camouflaged , but the lures are meant to be noticed so the fish wave , wiggle and sometimes blink the lures on and off in order to attract pray , Pietsch says .
Instead of all that showiness , members of H. psychedelica are shy and secretive , probably one of the reasons they were n't previously spotted .
When a member of H. psychedelica is uncovered by divers it usually seeks a new place to hide within 10 or 15 minutes .
And while other anglerfish change their coloring depending on the environment , the new species appears to maintain its wild striping no matter the surroundings .
advertisement
The coloring led co-author David Hall , a wildlife photographer and owner of seaphotos.com , to speculate that the fish is mimicking corals .
Indeed ,
Hall produced photos for the new scientific paper showing corals the animals may be mimicking .
The other co-author , Rachel Arnold , who is a UW master 's student in aquatic and fishery sciences , did the DNA work on the new species .
Arnold , who dove in Ambon Harbor last year , said the striping of each fish is distinctive , " like a fingerprint of patterning on their body so from whatever angle you look , you can tell individuals apart . "
The scientists found , however , that the vivid colors faded in a matter of days once a specimen was preserved in ethanol .
The flesh of the preserved specimen looks white , but with a microscope one can still see the striping , Pietsch discovered .
This got him thinking about two specimens sent to him in 1992 that he'd kept as part of the UW 's fish collection .
The Dallas Aquarium had sent him two frogfish , found in a shipment of live fishes from Bali that they said had unusual pigment patterns .
The staff had nicknamed them " paisley frogfish . "
But the photograph Pietsch was sent was of poor quality and the preserved specimens Pietsch received were white , so he did n't give them much thought .
Pietsch retrieved the old specimens from the collection , put them under a microscope and found the striping distinctive to H. psychedelica .
He 'd had two specimen of a new species of fish for 17 years , but did n't know it .

Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) in his recent article calling for a major reform of America ’s prisons in Parade Magazine brought some very disturbing , eye opening , statistics about America ’s prison system to light .
In summary this is some of what he found :
- Since 1984 , America ’s prison population has quadrupled from 580,000 to 2.3 million - Though the U.S. accounts for 5 % of the world ’s population , the U.S. accounts for 25 % of the world ’s reported prisoners - Local , state , and federal spending on corrections costs the U.S. taxpayer about $ 68 billion annually *
( California spent nearly $ 10 million on corrections last year by itself ! ) - 16 % ( 350,000 ) adults in prison or jail are mentally ill - 3/4 of drug offenders in state prisons are non-violent offenders or in prison solely for drug offenses - 47.5 % of all drug arrests in the U.S. were fore marijuana offenses - Despite insignificant statistical differences regarding drug use among races , Blacks ( accounting for 12 % of the U.S. population ) account for 37 % of all drug arrests , 59 % of which are convicted and account for 74 % of all drug offenders sentenced to prison
Perhaps for the “ tough on crime ” types , this is all good news but for anyone else who thinks critically of these statistics , I would expect that most would be concerned if not horrified .
In response to these statistics , Sen .
Webb makes the following observation :
“ With so many of our citizens in prison compared with the rest of the world , there are only two possibilities :
Either we are home to the most evil people on earth or we are doing something different–and vastly counterproductive . ”
For regular consumers of the evening news , it may seem that the first possibility could be true .
Without fail , the evening news reports stories of violence , vandalism , kidnapping , rape , child molestation , and murder both locally and nationally .
There is also no shortage of true crime programs ** detailing the most heinous crimes one could imagine being committed against other human beings ; it ’s all very disturbing .
Our jails and prisons surely must be overflowing from these creeps !
One would think that roving bands of murderous thugs are on every street in America , yet we each almost always make it to and from work , to and from running errands and eating out unmolested .
Our odds of being killed in an auto accident *** are many times greater than being victim to this roving band of murderous thugs .
How can this be ?
In most auto accidents , the victim may try to find an accident attorney to seek legal advice or take legal action .
While we should each be vigilant and aware of our surroundings and always use common sense , the perception that our prisoners are overflowing with mostly violent criminals just is n’t true .
Figure 1 shows the U.S. prison population under the purview of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons .
The BOP population accounts for 202,493 of America ’s 2.3 million prisoners .
Figure 1
As is evident from Figure 1 , our prisons are mostly housing drug offenders ; the most violent criminals “ homicide , aggravated assault , kidnapping ” + “ sex crimes ” ( assuming every “ sex crime ” is a violent act which is not a safe assumption ) accounts for only 6.4 % of the BOP ’s population .
If we want to assume that every weapons , explosives , and arson inmate is a violent offender ( again , not at all a safe assumption ) with 15 % and throw in national security offenses at .1%**** , the maximum violent criminal population stands at roughly 21.5 % ( excluding other violent offenders who may be hidden in the remaining categories ) .
Many in these kinds of situations would probably benefit from talking to your best lawyer to understand legal options to a greater degree .
Figure 2 is based on the same data ; the only difference is I have taken out 3/4 of the drug offenders ( based on Sen .
Webb ’s finding that 3/4 of all drug offenders are non-violent offenders ) .
Figure 2 shows what the prison population might look like if all 50 governors pardoned / commuted sentences for all non-violent state drug offenders and if President Obama did the same at the federal level .
Figure 2
Figure 3 represents a “ libertarian fantasy ” where all drugs are legalized and therefore ; no crime associated with the non-existent war on ( some ) drugs .
The remaining categories have not been altered for simplicity .
Figure 3
If the BOP statistics are an accurate sampling of the entire U.S. prison population , this would mean that with the act of releasing only non-violent drug offenders would reduce the overall population by 30.8 % or roughly 713,000 ( as shown in Figure 2 ) .
This would certainly go a long way toward reforming the prison system but would only be a start .
To better allocate prison resources and to better answer the questions Sen .
Webb wants answered , a philosophical question must be answered :
Who do we want to lock up and for what purpose ?
As someone who is a strong advocate of the rights of life , liberty , and property , it ’s my belief that the only individuals who should ever see the inside of a jail or prison cell are those who have trampled on any of these rights of another individual .
The only legitimate purpose of the government is to help individuals defend these rights , therefore ; if an individual engages in an activity in which s/he does not threaten the rights of another individual then no crime has taken place .
In the real world we also have to realize that limited resources require prioritizing which criminals should be locked up and which should be dealt with differently .
I doubt that many would say that the most violent of criminals should be free to re-offend .
There really is n’t any punishment strong enough for someone who has intentionally taken the life of an innocent person ; life imprisonment with no possibility of parole is as close to justice as the victim and offender can get .
We should also consider that putting an individual in prison should not only be considered punishment but more importantly a way of separating him or her from others s/he may wish to harm .
With this philosophical approach that only individuals who violate the rights of others should be in prison , does this mean that each and every petty criminal should be locked up ?
In a word , the answer is no .
In response to the open thread question I posed to readers , several made a very interesting suggestion : restitution .
Far too often we hear that criminals have some sort of “ debt to society ” which they must pay .
I would argue that when an individual steals from someone else , it ’s the person who was stolen from who the thief owes a debt , not “ society . ”
With crimes with actual victims , why not force the offending party to repay the victim ?
This approach could be used from the lowest level petty criminal to the Bernie Madoffs of the world .
Which would do more to repay the debts of Madoff ’s victims , a lengthy prison sentence or a liquidation of all of his assets seized by the government and given back to those he stole from ?
Of course , not every criminal is as successful at screwing people over as Madoff .
How can a victim be made whole if the individual who victimized him or her has no assets to seize and no wages to garnish ?
In such cases , perhaps imprisonment would be appropriate .
Inmates in this category could work for a wage while in prison and all earnings would be paid directly to the victim .
Once this individual has paid his / her debt to the victim , s/he would be released .
If Sen .
Webb ’s purpose is to establish a committee is to look for innovative solutions in reforming America ’s prison system , restitution is one idea which deserves further study .
Reforming the prison system will be impossible without returning to a philosophy which puts the rights of the individual first .
As long as individuals are being put in prison for personal choices which do not victimize others , the prison population will only grow larger .
In the meantime with the limited prison resources available , law makers need to set priorities and need to allow judges to judge particular circumstances of a case .
This necessarily means scrapping once and for all the mandatory minimum sentencing experiment which has greatly contributed to the U.S. becoming the world ’s largest jailer .

Damian McBride was supposed to disappear last autumn .
Officially , he stood down as Gordon Brown 's political spin doctor , his job split between two former aides to the Cabinet ministers Geoff Hoon and John Hutton .
When Mr Brown reshuffled his Cabinet in October , the small print announced that Mr McBride would be moved to the relative backwater of " strategic planning " .
Cabinet ministers had demanded the removal of the man they referred to as " McPoison " , suspecting that his dark arts and vitriolic briefings had been aimed against some of them – as well as the Tories .
The final straw was his notorious 3 am briefing in a Manchester hotel bar about the impending resignation from the Cabinet of Ruth Kelly , then the Transport Secretary .
From Mr McBride 's point of view , he was defending his master – on this occasion from the explosive suggestion that Ms Kelly 's move was the first in a series of resignations designed to oust Mr Brown in a Cabinet coup .

The Cabinet ministers called off the threat of insurrection and rallied behind Mr Brown under a deal which included the sidelining of McBride and the surprise return of Peter Mandelson , the public symbol of a fresh start , and of Labour 's warring tribes coming together to fight the Tories .
Yet the Prime Minister seemed reluctant to part company with a close ally who first won his admiration with deft handling of the fuel protests in 2000 .
The pair bonded when Mr McBride was his civil service press secretary at the Treasury before becoming his special adviser and party political spokesman for the then - Chancellor .
He carried on spinning for Mr Brown when his boss moved to Downing Street , cementing contacts among a spectrum of reporters .
He was part of Mr Brown 's pack of attack dogs , which includes the Government whip Ian Austin and the chief whip Nick Brown .
After he was moved out of the limelight in October , the naturally gregarious spin doctor kept a low profile among Westminster journalists , declining invitations for lunch and maintaining only occasional contact with most .
But , crucially , he kept his place in the Brown inner circle , symbolised by his place at the top table in Mr Brown 's new " war room " in 12 Downing Street .
Mr Brown , it seems , did not want to sever links with his trusted aide .
" He decided he could n't do without him , and did n't find someone to replace him , " one insider said yesterday .
Inside the Brown circle , there were grave doubts about his continuing presence .
Two Cabinet ministers in the circle , Ed Miliband and Douglas Alexander , did not want him to enjoy as much influence as he continued to wield despite his demotion in 0ctober .
The pair regarded Mr McBride with " a mixture of fear and loathing " and civil servants were also uneasy about his new Cabinet Office role .

But Mr McBride had a trump card : his close axis with Ed Balls , the Schools Secretary , which dates back to their time together at the Treasury .
Mr Balls and Lord Mandelson are seen as the two Cabinet ministers closest to the Prime Minister .
Yesterday some ministers suggested that Mr McBride saw his job as serving Mr Balls , a likely candidate for the Labour leadership when Mr Brown steps down .
" Damian was pretty friendless in No 10 , " one Brown aide said yesterday .
" But he had a powerful champion in Ed Balls .
That made it virtually impossible for anyone to move against him – including Gordon .
It 's astonishing . "
Mr McBride 's retreat into the shadows in October coincided with growing concern among senior ministers about the dominance of the blogosphere by Tory - leaning commentators .
Bloggers such as Paul Staines – aka Guido Fawkes – and the former Conservative candidate Iain Dale have regularly dug under the skin of Labour HQ with their spiky mixture of gossip , commentary and news .
Derek Draper , a former aide to Peter Mandelson who was forced to resign after being caught on tape in 1998 boasting he was " intimate " with the 17 people who really mattered in the Government , returned to the political front line to help beef up the Labour presence on the blogosphere .
Many Labour figures view " Dolly Draper " ( as he is known ) with caution .
One backbencher said yesterday : " You can't fault his enthusiasm or energy .
But there is plenty else about him that 's a bit wild . "
But he rapidly began reactivating the old friendships – and forging for new ones – as he plotted a " virtual revolution " .
Among those that he contacted for help was Damian McBride .
Mr Draper unveiled his Labour List website to middling reviews in the autumn , although it has not captured the irreverent tone of its right - of - centre rivals .
Yesterday , senior party figures tumbled over one another to distance themselves from the site and its co-editor – but it was very different at the official launch just two months ago .
That event took place in Labour HQ and guests included Lord Mandelson , Douglas Alexander , the Cabinet Office minister Tom Watson and the Labour general - secretary Ray Collins .
It is clear now that Mr Draper was toying with the idea of founding a more scurrilous sideline which he proposed calling RedRag .
And who better to discuss the idea with than Labour 's most powerful spinner ?
He may have been out of sight – during Barack Obama 's recent visit he was given the relatively peripheral duty of handling the " Wags briefing " of the media on behalf of Sarah Brown – but Mr McBride 's passion for spreading " the message " remained undimmed .
Mr McBride suggested reviving the allegation that a Tory MP was quietly promoting a gay partner 's business interests in the Commons .
The claims have been in circulation for months and proved to be false .
Pumping such a story – had it been true – could have been justified as in the public interest .
But the other bits of gossip Mr McBride proposed pumping into the political ether were a combination of venom and invention designed to unsettle a Tory opposition riding high in the polls .
Mr McBride 's critics , who believe he was more interested in short - term tactics than long - term strategy , may feel vindicated by the dramatic events of the last 48 hours .
" This was a huge collision waiting to happen , " one Brown adviser admitted .
Ironically for Mr McBride , the episode has dealt a damaging blow to the Prime Minister whose merits he had tirelessly promoted seven days a week – and even while on holiday .
Mr Brown promised to put an era of spin behind him when he succeeded Tony Blair to Downing Street .
It seemed a fanciful claim for the politician who once gave Charlie Whelan an almost free hand to speak for him , but struck a chord among Labour activists sick of a decade of tales of Downing Street media manipulation .
As a senior Labour MP said yesterday : " This is terrible .
It stinks .
It reflects very badly on Gordon and damages him .
He did n't stick to his side of the bargain about Damian .
Now he has paid the price . "

But ... why would a student in the late 1980s black up his face for the amusement of friends in their private college rooms ?

He claims : " I 'm told by a witness that both MPs received a carpeting . "
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
When presidents are new , first impressions really count :
Your demeanor ( shirtsleeves , not jackets , in the Oval Office ) , your stature ( move over , Mr. Sarkozy ) and , of course , your plans for America 's future ( not to mention your plans for our 401 ( k ) s ) .
Former House Speaker used Twitter to share his thoughts on the pirate drama in real time .
Since President Obama 's presidential bid was a very long affair -- and since his predecessor left with a 28 percent approval rating -- he came into office with an advantage .
Americans figured they knew him and they surely liked him better than the previous guy .
And they understood he was persistent :
After all , he was the underdog who beat the once - presumptive nominee , Hillary Clinton .
And , by the way , he also gave great speeches .
But new presidents are always tested , as Joe Biden famously predicted .
But not just on one front , on all fronts .
And Obama has had more than his share , as he likes to remind us -- an economic crisis that threatened to take down the economy ; a North Korean nuclear crisis .
And finally , the pirates of Somalia -- threatening an American crew -- hold an American captain hostage .
A high - stakes , visible , compelling story , with inevitable winners and losers .
That 's when you learn about a president .
The president played it cool -- in fact , pitch - perfect -- as it turns out .
We now know that while he was saying little in public , he was completely engaged .
He sent his secretary of state to warn the pirates publicly -- while the president privately held more than 17 briefings on the matter and made sure the bureaucrats at all agencies were working together ( no small task ) .
And finally , he gave an unambiguous order -- to shoot if the captain 's life was in peril .
And when it was all over , as a top administration official told me , Obama " did n't wrap himself around the bravery of those military seals . "
Indeed , he commended the captain , the SEALs , called for multilateral efforts to stop piracy -- and went on the next day to give an economic speech .
Indeed , this aide adds , " He 's not about to put on a flight suit on an aircraft carrier and declare mission accomplished . "
Not his style , they say .
But what about the style of say , Newt Gingrich ?
The former House Speaker -- often mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2012 -- decided to Twitter his inner thoughts on the pirates in real - time .
Last Saturday : " Obama is making a major mistake in not forcefully outlining the rules of civilization for dealing with pirates .
We look weak . "
By Monday , after the safe rescue of the captain , Gingrich was , er , a tad more laudatory : " The Navy seals did exactly the right thing in rescuing the American captain .
President Obama did the right thing in allowing the Navy to act . "
A grudging kudo , if there ever was one .
Would it have been better if the president of the United States had publicly engaged with a bunch of teenage thug pirates ?
It 's beneath Obama 's pay grade and dignity -- not to mention how it would have added fuel to an already incendiary situation .
So how about just admitting that the administration performed admirably in this crisis ?
Here 's the problem :
If Republicans can't allow that the president did his job well in this unambiguous case , why should we believe their complaints about anything else ?
If they can't pat him on the back for this one , why should we even listen to their arguments about the budget , about health care , about energy ?
If Republicans want Americans to see their arguments as credible -- as they may well be -- they need to present themselves as the credible opposition .
Good first impressions count for them , too .
And so far , Republicans are Twittering them away .

A Victorian aged care home did not pay a volunteer firefighter who battled the Black Saturday bushfires , a union claims .
The Health Services Union ( HSU ) says the frontline firefighter was called to put in containment lines around fires in Gippsland as part of a Country Fire Authority strike team .
The HSU claims the volunteer was unpaid by her employer even though some containment lines she worked on helped protect another of the group 's homes .
Along with stress ( which I ’ve written about elsewhere on Wildmind ) , depression is another deeply unpleasant , and sometimes devastating , experience that motivates people to learn to meditate .
Can meditation be useful for those who have a tendency to feel depressed ?
And can those whose depression is caused by chemical imbalances ( e.g. those who live with bipolar disorder or manic - depression ) usefully meditate ?
I am convinced that meditation can be very helpful for depression , whether the depression is situational ( caused by external events ) or organic ( caused by chemical imbalances in the brain ) .
Research has also shown that learning to meditate can dramatically reduce the chances of relapse into depression for those who have suffered repeated bouts .
I am not a mental health professional , and make no claims for any expertise in the field of mental health in general , or with depression in particular .
However , I know meditators who have struggled with depression , and they have found their practice to be a great support .
I ’ve also experienced periods of depression myself , and mindfulness has been an invaluable tool for emerging from that state .
There may be some kinds of meditation which are not of benefit to those who have a tendency to experience depression , and I will mention those in this section .
The Mindfulness of Breathing and Metta Bhavana practices however , are certainly useful for anyone to practice .
In fact the Metta Bhavana ( development of lovingkindness ) practice is highly recommended for those who experience depression .
However there may also be times when it ’s best for those who are depressed not to meditate — for example when experiencing an extreme bout of depression it is probably not a good idea to try to meditate .
One reason for this are that learning to meditate is a challenging experience , and because when one is very depressed one has few inner resources to fall back on , any difficulties experienced while learning meditation are likely to be taken too seriously and interpreted as a sign of personal failure .
Another reason is that when we ’re depressed we tend to over - indulge in what ’s called “ rumination , ” or the endless turning over in the mind of thoughts about what ’s wrong with our lives .
Because meditation is an inward - turned activity it may actually give people who are experiencing depression yet another opportunity to ruminate .
In cases of milder depression it ’s quite possible to meditate effectively , building on whatever inner resources one has in order to lift oneself into a more positive frame of mind .

Enterprises invest in technology from vendors to help filter out bad Web sites from touching their networks , but the same technology , at least some of it , can be had by consumers for free .
And for networking vendor Blue Coat ( NASDAQ : BCSI ) , the strategy is paying off .
While Blue Coat is best known for Web filtering for enterprise customers , its free , K9 consumer product is making waves , having hit the million - download milestone .
It might not be surprising that K9 is seeing a great deal of traction , considering it uses the same filtering technology as found in Blue Coat 's widely deployed enterprise edition .
The application 's success also may not be surprising considering that the need for Web filtering has become increasingly important lately .
In addition to malware sites , legitimate sites are also being targeted for malware distribution , making it even more critical that users have proactive Web filtering .
" We 've had a million downloads for K9 , so there is quite a large user community using K9 today to protect their computers from malware , and it's used a lot as a parental control tool to keep kids off sites that parents do n't approve of , " Mikko Valimaki , chief scientist at Blue Coat , told InternetNews.com .
With such demand , why give away the technology ?
To Blue Coat , the idea behind K9 is twofold .
The company has an altruistic goal of protecting users , but it also uses the information it learns from consumers and the sites they visit to protect paying enterprise customers .
" We decided that we 're not in the consumer business -- Blue Coat sells to large organizations and that 's where our focus is , " Valimaki said .
" But we figured it was important for us to be part of the community and have visibility into what is going on the Web . "
In so doing , Valimaki argued that Blue Coat is part of the broader solution to help combat malware sites .
Specifically , it can glean additional visibility from consumers that enables it to better identify and fight malware sites .
That makes for a compelling reason for consumers to download K9 , which in turn helps Blue Coat -- even though it 's essentially giving consumers free access to the same anti-malware cloud service that powers its enterprise offering .
" In effect , the free K9 home product is using the same knowledge and intelligence in the cloud as our corporate solution , the Blue Coat Web filter , " Valimaki said .
K9 relies on Blue Coat 's cloud - based WebPulse service to filter site requests based on categories -- like gambling or pornography -- as well as malware site blocking .
WebPulse is also used by Blue Coat 's ProxySG appliance , which also provides Web acceleration capabilities for businesses .
Valimaki claimed that K9 users get the same speed of service that enterprise gets and Blue Coat does not throttle the service .
Valimaki explained that Blue Coat has four datacenters worldwide that receive K9 requests .
When a user hits a new site , K9 triggers a lookup on the WebPulse cloud service about the site 's category , enabling K9 to make a policy decision about whether to block the site .
If a site request is not in the existing WebPulse database , Blue Coat 's technology makes a decision based on what Valimaki described as the site 's " reputation . "
" Consider you have a dot - com domain being a referrer to a domain in China , and it was just recently brought online , and it's hosted on the same IP address that has previously pushed malware , " Valimaki explained .
" We can fairly easily determine if something is suspicious just based on the request . "
K9 also takes something of a unique approach when it runs into legitimate sites that are unwittingly hosting links to malware , blocking just the link instead of blocking access to the entire legitimate site .
Paid competition
Valimaki noted that he is not aware of K9 users migrating up to Blue Coat 's commercial enterprise offerings .
Still , he did say that Blue Coat gets lots of requests from people with small office that wonder about how to buy K9 .
Despite the potential allure of a small - business offering , Blue Coat does not have licensed version of K9 that it sells to small office users .
There are , however , a few different commercially available options for Web filtering that could benefit consumers and small offices .
Symantec offers Norton Safe Web , which provides site reputation and filtering capabilities .
Security vendor Webroot also has filtering technologies for consumers and enterprises , which it extends to consumers through Webroot Parental Controls , and which enables users to set time limits on usage as well as blocking objectionable sites .
Both Symantec and Webroot declined to comment on their offerings ' capabilities .
Challenges of Web filtering
Yet while Blue Coat says it 's seeing K9 pay off , Valimaki said there 's still a number of issues to sort out when it comes to Web filtering .
For instance , the industry has a difficult time getting its arms around what he called " gray " pages on the Internet -- the many marketing sites with links to wares like pharmaceutical products .
Technically speaking , those pages are not malware , so Web filtering companies can't be sure how to categorize them .
However , such link - heavy pages are often hit by users who are lured by search engine results .
The sheer volume of those types of pages is a challenge , Valimaki said , as is the process of determining how they all should be treated .
" Five years ago , if you asked about URL filtering it was typically about blocking pornography from the workplace , " Valimaki said .
" While that remains a key component , blocking malware and suspicious stuff is now the talking point . "
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Eleven - year - old Jaheem Herrera woke up on April 16 acting strangely .
He was n't hungry and he did n't want to go to school .
Jaheem Herrera 's mother thinks he hanged himself because he was perpetually bullied at school .
But the outgoing fifth grader packed his bag and went to school at Dunaire Elementary School in DeKalb County , Georgia .
He came home much happier than when he left in the morning , smiling as he handed his mother , Masika Bermudez , a glowing report card full of A's and B's .
She gave him a high - five and he went upstairs to his room as she prepared dinner .
A little later , when his younger sister called him to come down to eat , Jaheem did n't answer .
So mother and daughter climbed the stairs to Jaheem 's room and opened the door .
Jaheem was hanging by his belt in the closet .
" I always used to see these things on TV , dead people on the news , " says Bermudez .
" I saw somebody die and to see this dead person is your son , hanging there , a young boy .
...
To hang yourself like that , you 've got to really be tired of something . "
Bermudez says bullies at school pushed Jaheem over the edge .
He complained about being called gay , ugly and " the virgin " because he was from the Virgin Islands , she said .

" He used to say Mom they keep telling me this ... this gay word , this gay , gay , gay .
I 'm tired of hearing it , they 're telling me the same thing over and over , " she told CNN , as she wiped away tears from her face .
But while she says her son complained about the bullying , she had no idea how bad it had gotten .
" He told me , but he just got to the point where he did n't want me to get involved anymore because nothing was done , " she said .
Bermudez said she complained to the school about bullying seven or eight times , but it was n't enough to save him .
" It [ apparently ] just got worse and worse and worse until Thursday , " she said .
" Just to walk up to that room and see your baby hanging there .
My daughter saw this , my baby saw this , my kids are traumatized . "
She said Jaheem was a shy boy just trying to get a good education and make friends .

" He was a nice little boy , " Bermudez said through her tears .
" He loved to dance .
He loved to have fun .
He loved to make friends .
And all he made [ at school ] were enemies . "
Bermudez said she thinks her son felt like nobody wanted to help him , that nobody stood up and stopped the bullies .
" Maybe he said ' You know what -- I 'm tired of telling my mom , she 's been trying so hard , but nobody wants to help me , ' " says Bermudez .
After Jaheem 's death , the school board expressed condolences , saying the school staff " works diligently to provide a safe and nurturing environment for all students . "
Trying desperately to understand what went wrong , Bermudez asked her son's best friend to recount what happened on the day Jaheem killed himself .
" He [ said he was ] tired of complaining , tired of these guys messing with him , " Bermudez said , recalling the conversation with Jaheem 's best friend .
" Tired of talking , I think to his teachers , counselors and nobody is doing anything -- and the best way out is death . "

Allegations of such severe bullying surprises experts familiar with the school district .
Its anti-bullying program was considered exemplary and includes programs to raise awareness and a specially trained liaison .
Students are even asked to sign a no- bullying pledge .
But other parents told CNN they have complained about bullying as well .
Despite recent strides towards preventing bullying in schools and increased awareness programs , a Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network study showed that 65 percent of teens are bullied each year and most believe adults can't help them .
Less than a month before Jaheem 's death , a boy in Massachusetts killed himself after being bullied , harassed and called " gay . "
Eliza Byard , executive director of the Gay , Lesbian and Straight Education Network , says to be effective , awareness programs need to include education about the harm that can be done by teasing someone about sexuality or perceived sexuality .
" Anti -gay language is really the ultimate weapon for a bully who wants to degrade his or her peers , " she says .
" And any effective response to bullying has to take that on . "
Bermudez does n't understand why the children at school could n't learn to get along .
Because of it , she 'll never get to see her son grow up .
" My baby , that 's my only boy , and I lost him now , " says Bermudez .
" He was my first child and ... to lose him 11 years after , he did n't live his life . "
She hopes her son's death will result in positive changes that will help other kids being bullied .
" Those that are being bullied -- they need to talk to their parents , they need to not hold back , " she says .
" I lost my son and now something has to be done . "

Imagine this : you wake up on Easter morning and instead of a chocolate bunny in your basket is a six and three quarter inch tall action figure of Jack from MadWorld .
You'd be thanking the Easter Bunny for decades to come .
That is until you realized that to complete the whole MadWorld theme he also covered your entire house in blood and threw your dog into a wood chippper .
Then it would be all about vengeance .
But first you 'd have to play with your awesome new action figure that ebooze over at deviantART made .
Not only does this sucker look like one of the better custom made action figures out there , but it also has an interchangeable chainsaw -- one for when you do n't want blood on it and one for when you do .
Plus , when you are n't in the mood for chainsaws there is an attachment for when the blade is retracted .
Hopefully , some day ebooze will design a stand for it that has button which spits out deep and thoughtful curse words .
Now , back to that bastard bunny .
He 'll pay for what he did .
All I need is a shotgun , a chainsaw and the nerd - balls to go toe - to - toe with toughest rabbit you 've ever seen .

Rishab sez , " India 's election commission has a sense of humour .
It has insisted that when about 500 million Indians vote in the general elections this summer , they will be marked on their middle fingers with indelible ink to prevent double voting .
The photograph shows the Chief Minister of Maharashtra state ( and his wife ) showing their middle fingers to the camera , apparently only realising later what it looked like . "
The Election Commission is ensuring your message goes out loud and clear — they are giving your index finger a go - by , and painting your middle finger with indelible ink instead .
A Commission official said the change was necessitated by the recently - concluded elections to local bodies in some parts of the country .
" Since these voters will still have their index fingers marked , we decided to uniformly mark the middle finger of the left hand , " he said .
Not everyone 's amused , though .
In many places , politicians and celebrities smiled and posed for the cameras after casting their vote , but realisation dawned much later .
A Pune - based Bollywood celebrity said , " I did not realise it when I posed for the cameras .
But when I saw the photo , my pose appeared to be in poor taste . "
This may be some of the funniest shit I 've read in ages .
It goes like this : we are so scared of a couple dozen wingnuts getting together to teabag , that a shadowy conspiracy of saboteurs and billionaires are conspiring to disrupt their kinky sex parties powerful protests .
So we essentially have a bevy of pundit - wannabes courageously spurring brigades of like - minded folks into a new American revolution that will stem back the tides of socialism unleashed by the foreign - born communist and gun-grabber in the White House , all of it in the face of a powerful cabal fearful of what might happen if some people got together to wave tea bags .
Or something like that -- coherence is n't their strongest suit .
Neither is reality .
For the next 9 days , the left - wing blogosphere and left - wing clueless pundits will hammer away with their unreality - based Tea Party smears .
And on the ground , the tax - subsidized and Soros - subsidized troops are going to try and wreak havoc every way they can .
Many readers and fellow bloggers have seen signs that ACORN may send in ringers and saboteurs to usurp the anti-tax , anti-reckless spending , anti-bailout message .
Soros ?
ACORN ?
Huh ?
Thers explains :
Why must [ George Soros ] be constantly spending his vast ill - gotten fortune in a secretive and shadowy fashion in order to spread rumors and lies that there is some shadowy secretive conspiracy behind the actions of political opponents ?
He 's always doing that .
Fortunately Malkin is above such tactics , and duly provides proof of the Soros - ACORN sabotage - scheme , in the form of a link to a blog that links to a message board where a random commenter says that ACORN is up to no good .
CASE CLOSED .
I mean , obviously this is not just paranoid gibberish ; the commenter certainly sounds like she 's very calm , collected , and sensible : Groups like ACORN and CODEPINK are nothing but Anti-American criminal organizations .
BEWARE .
I just stocked up on Pepper spray at http://shop.christmascentral.com/...
JUST IN CASE
And , yes , that is a real link to an online Christmas Ornament shopping site , one that does indeed sell pepper spray , although , regrettably , this pepper spray is not holiday - themed .
Ahh .
Ok .
So the " signs " some people are " seeing " are in reality the paranoid voices in their heads .
Seems pretty airtight a case , no matter how much ACORN 's director says , " huh ? "
Playing dumb would certainly be part of ACORN 's dastardly plan !
And it would similarly be part of the White House 's plan , which according to the delusional wingers , is also in on the plan with Nixonian schemes to disrupt the winger gatherings and deprive the world of fantastic comic relief .
Now if there was truly a nefarious ACORN / Soros plot to disrupt the teabaggers , I 'd be the first to fight back against those efforts .
Why deny ourselves such comedy gold ?
Every time they gather in public places , we get material like this to work with :
So build your papier - mâché tea bags , wingers !
We can never laugh enough at your expense .
Still , there 's something a little bit off kilter about this whole craziness , and I think Atrios figured it out :
I was talking with BooMan tonight about how dumb and empty right wing bloggers are these days .
I suggested that the equivalent on our side would have been if in 2003 left wing bloggers spent all their time talking about their designs for the giant puppets they were going to bring to the anti-war demonstrations .
Yup , that 's it .
Back in our early years , we had better things to do with our time , like organizing for upcoming elections -- the things that actually matter in our modern political system .
But the wingers have never been much for electoral organizing , what with their dreams of becoming the next Rush - Limbaugh style media sensation .
Their single - minded obsession with punditry leaves little room for the hard work of fighting for an electorally viable Republican Party .
And given that it 's their ideology specifically that has made them toxic to the voters , they'd have to come up with ideas and whatnot .
That would n't exactly play to their strengths , know what I 'm saying ?
I mean , their best idea right now is to wave tea bags .
So the poor saps at the Next Right -- the closest thing on the Right they have to what we were doing back in 2002 -- are pretty much ignored and marginalized , while the rest of the conservative netroots is reading from Code Pink 's playbook , working hard to replicate their stunning failure at relevancy .
Bizarre , but hilarious .
In a special session , the Vermont Senate yesterday voted to legalize same - sex marriage .
Later this week , a similar bill is scheduled for a vote in the New Hampshire House of Representatives .
Next month a legislative panel in Maine will hold a hearing on a bill to allow gay couples to marry , just as lawmakers did last month in Rhode Island .

By 2050 , our planet ’s oceans could be too acidic for corals to reproduce or rebuild , and the $ 16 trillion ocean - based economy is in danger of being wiped out if things continue as they are .
The high levels of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere from human activities have a dramatic impact on many of our oceans ’ life forms , and the ramifications of continuing to release CO2 at current amounts will be severe , say scientists .
Ocean acidification is an extremely serious issue right now , and one not often discussed outside of scientific peer groups working in the fields of climate change or ocean - related disciplines .
About one fourth of the CO2 released every year into the atmosphere gets absorbed by the ocean , lowering the pH of the seawater and decreasing the rate at which corals can grow .
Coral reefs are considered the ‘ rain forests ’ of the ocean , sheltering other organisms within their ecosystems and also acting as a bellwether to indicate change in the oceans .
The CO2 absorbed by the ocean slows the rate of climate change effects due to excess atmospheric CO2 , but is causing unforeseen consequences under the waves .
Ocean acidity has increased about 30 % over the last hundred years , and some say that the rate of acidification is increasing , not leveling off .
Other marine animals that have shells are also affected by the higher acidity in the ocean , as the aragonite ( a form of calcium carbonate ) used to build shells and coral structure is not available at levels needed by the organisms .
The CO2 forms carbonic acid when absorbed into the ocean , and with a lower pH comes the possibility of dissolution of structures ( shells , corals ) constructed from calcium carbonate .
Possible cascade effects from ocean acidification are not known , and a domino - like chain of events could cause ripple effects on other ecosystems due to the loss of coral reefs around the world .
A number of other organisms in the ocean dependent on coral reefs could be radically affected by ocean acidification , leading to massive change in the ocean .
Even if we halt all human - cause CO2 emissions today , thousands of years may be necessary to return oceans to pre-industrial levels , so many concerned scientists are calling for a moratorium on CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels and an immediate change to a carbon - neutral energy infrastructure .

This has only been standard operating procedure for about the last 62 years .
Via : Congressional Quarterly Politics :
A former deep - cover CIA operative says the spy agency ’s congressional briefers routinely shade the truth or hide facts altogether from congressional overseers .
“ They mumble , they dissemble , and there ’s a lot of ‘ on the one hand . . .' ” said the retired official , who spent 25 years as a CIA operations officer but now writes blistering , unauthorized critiques of the spy agency using the pen name “ Ishmael Jones . ”
Jones denounced claims by Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the CIA kept her in the dark about water - boarding terrorist suspects , saying the California Democrat “ has been using the interrogation issue as a political tool for years . ”
But he said the spy agency ’s congressional briefers are also experts at camouflaging classified programs .
“ In Mrs. Pelosi ’s defense , CIA managers do not give fist - pounding briefings , ” Jones recently wrote for the conservative National Review in a blog that drew scant media interest .
“ They mumble , they dissemble , and there ’s a lot of ‘ on the one hand …’ , ” Jones declared .
The CIA deploys so many briefers to the Hill it ’s hard for both the agency and intelligence committee members to reconstruct who said what to whom , he added .
“ Its enormous numbers of employees have led to briefings being handled by groups , with vague chains of command , so that it may have been difficult to pin down what was said , when it was said , and who was in charge , ” Jones said of the CIA interrogation briefings .
Jones also charged that , contrary to beliefs that the agency has a political agenda , “ In reality the CIA is loyal only to itself .
As long as Mrs. Pelosi supported its bureaucratic lifestyle , it supported her , but when she attacked it , it fought back .
The CIA may not be able to conduct efficient intelligence operations , but it knows how to survive . ”
Reports that CIA managers were outraged or demoralized by the water - boarding controversy are wrong , Jones also maintained .
To the contrary , he said , they felt that revelations of their interrogators roughing up , or even torturing , detainees made them look tough .
“ The interrogations controversy has served the CIA bureaucracy , ” Jones asserted .
“ A top goal of bureaucracy is to look busy , and whether one agrees with the interrogation methods or not , the impression given is that the CIA is both busy and aggressive . ”
Jones added : “ It relishes this ‘ cowboy ’ image , and its greatest fear is that the taxpayer might figure out how little it actually is doing .
“ Bans or restrictions on interrogations , ” he added , “ would have the constructive effect of removing this smokescreen , this distraction , and redirecting focus to what exactly the CIA is doing to provide the foreign intelligence the president needs . ”
A CIA spokesman said Jones did n’t know what he was talking about .

Nancy Folbre is a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts , Amherst .
What a difference two letters can make .
Temporary Assistance to Needy Families ( TANF ) is our country ’s only direct cash assistance program — the family welfare program that conservatives most love to hate .
The Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) is the cash assistance program for failing banks put in place by the Bush administration and augmented by the Obama administration — a financial welfare program that nobody fully understands .
In 2007 , the latest year for which figures are available , TANF spending on cash assistance ( not including child care or other subsidies ) came to $ 4.5 billion .
Total commitments to TARP since September 2008 come to $ 700 billion .
So one year of TANF spending equals less than 1 percent of TARP .
Citibank alone received $ 25 billion , five times the cash transferred to mothers and children receiving public assistance in 2007 .
Here ’s a more specific comparison .
Top executives of banks bailed out this year — about 600 guys — received an estimated $ 1.6 billion in bonuses in 2007 .
That ’s a little over a third of what 1.6 million families got in cash from TANF in that year .
TANF is n’t the only form of assistance to the poor that we regularly provide and TARP is n’t the only form of assistance to banks and insurance companies delivered this year .
It ’s difficult to figure out exactly what should be added up on both sides to compare welfare to rich and poor .
Robert Rector and Katharine Bradley of the Heritage Foundation , a conservative research organization , estimate that federal welfare spending amounted to $ 491 billion in fiscal 2008 .
( They do n’t explain what specific programs they included in this estimate , and I ’ll try to unpack it in a future post . )
Even their extremely high estimate remains far below estimates of the total of $ 2.5 trillion spent on financial bailouts this year .
The libertarian Cato Institute often emphasizes the issue of corporate welfare , but it ’s remained remarkably quiet so far on the topic of bailouts .
The Welfare Indicators Act of 1994 requires annual reports to Congress on the level of welfare dependence .
Perhaps we should require similar reports for banks and insurance companies .
In the wake of an earlier round of bank bailouts presided over by George H.W. Bush , I published a short piece in Newsweek entitled “ Welfare Bankers ” ( sadly , the magazine ’s digital archives do not extend to October 16 - 17 , 1989 ) .
Protesting the moral double standard applied to bankers and to welfare mothers , I argued that the bankers whose institutions were bailed out at a cost of about $ 156 billion ( what a deal compared to today ’s bailout ! ) could perhaps be retrained as child care workers .
In the decade that followed this financial debacle , we could have gotten banking reform .
Instead , we got welfare reform .
Stricter work requirements and time limits were imposed .
The welfare rolls declined sharply .
Participation in the TANF program has fallen by half since 1996 .
Welfare reform was heralded as a great success because it got so many of our female “ troubled assets ” off the rolls .
But in addition to some unanticipated side effects ( which I ’ll describe in a future post ) , it was premised on the assumption that single mothers would be able to find work if they just tried hard enough .
That assumption no longer holds .
More than one out of 10 single mothers is out of work .
The latest figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics report an unemployment rate for March of 10.8 percent for women who maintain families on their own , significantly higher than the average seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for men ( 9.5 percent ) or women ( 7.5 percent ) the same month .
Unemployed single mothers number about a million , compared with two million unemployed married women .
The recent stimulus package passed by Congress offers some supplementary funds to the states for public assistance .
Conservative groups such as the Heritage Foundation lambasted the stimulus package for “ abolishing welfare reform . ”
That , it does not do .
But if unemployment rates for single mothers remain over 10 percent , welfare reform may indeed need to be reformed .
Would - Be Soldiers Too Fat to Serve Military has had to turn away 48,000 overweight recruits since 2005 .
ANNAPOLIS , Md. , March 22 , 2009  -- Amanda Turcotte wants to be all that she can be , but she 's 25 pounds over the Army 's weight limit .
Her recruiter is sweating her down to regulation size with a grueling daily exercise regimen .
" If you need to puke there 's a garbage can right there , " Army recruiter Sgt. Jessica La Pointe told Turcotte during a recent workout at an Annapolis high school .
" That 's fine .
You can come back and finish up . "
With fast - food diets and couch potato lifestyles expanding the waistlines of the nation 's youth , the former professional kickboxer says she must become personal trainer to many recruits just to get them to boot camp .
" We do get people who come in the office that are overweight by Army standards , " La Pointe told ABC News .
" And then what we do is try to work out a program through nutrition and exercise . "
The standards vary by service .
The Army allows 26 percent body fat for men , and more for women .
When recruits are asked their weight , " everybody lies , " La Pointe said .
Obesity is a national epidemic .
Three in four military - age Americans is unqualified to join the military .
The No. 1 reason : obesity .
One in five military - age Americans is too fat to serve .
The military has turned away 48,000 overweight recruits since 2005 , more than all the American troops fighting in Afghanistan .
Leo Knight - Inglesby was one of them .
Two years ago , when he wanted to join the Air Force , he tipped the scales at 361 pounds -- way over the Air Force limit .
" I was eating everything in the house , " Knight - Inglesby told ABC News during a break from basic training .
He said a recruiter told him , " You need to lose some weight -- a large amount of weight . "
He 's now at Boot Camp at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio , Texas , after dropping a staggering 161 pounds .
He said he did it the old - fashioned way -- exercise , and dropping a daily McDonald 's habit .
Tech .
Sgt. Scot J. Morin , who oversees physical training at Lackland , has seen the slide in fitness .
" Some of them come down here and they 've been on the couch for the past 18 years and have n't run a lick , " he told ABC .
" When I first got down here the trainees that were coming in were in a little more in shape than they are now . "
As the nation 's armed forces are stretched by wars on two fronts , an increasing number of recruits never make it past the recruiting office before they 're told they 're unfit to serve .
Curtis Gilroy , the Pentagon 's accessions chief , said obesity amounts to a national crisis , and it makes a tough job filling the military 's ranks even tougher .
" It 's clearly a problem for the United States military , " Gilroy told ABC News .
" We 're faced with a dwindling pool of the youth population in the 17 - to - 24 - year - old group about which we are very concerned , " he said .
Turcotte hopes to be wearing Army green within the month .
Asked if two - hour - a - day workouts are worth it , she said , " Totally .
Definitely worth it .
...
One more inch off my waist and two more inches off my hips and then I 'll be good to go . "
Dr Abdullah and Ms Blears have been rowing in the Guardian 's letters pages A leading member of the Muslim Council of Britain is suing cabinet minister Hazel Blears for defamation , following a row over the Israeli bombing of Gaza .
Dr Daud Abdullah , who is the MCB deputy secretary - general , is seeking damages .
Ms Blears said a document which Dr Abdullah signed on hostilities in Gaza had advocated attacks on UK military personnel and on Jews around the world .
Ms Blears made the claim in a letter to the Guardian last week , but Dr Abdullah has vehemently denied it .
The document is known as the Istanbul Declaration and was signed by 90 Muslim leaders in response to the three - week Israeli offensive in Gaza , in December and January .
We are concerned with those articles which appear to call for violence and Dr Abdullah 's repeated unwillingness to distance himself from [ them ]
Statement , Department for Communities and Local Government
The minister said the declaration supported violence against foreign troops , including British naval forces and advocated " attacks on Jewish communities all around the world " .
Ms Blears , who is Communities Secretary , said Dr Abdullah needed to make his own position clear .
Dr Abdullah has in turn accused Ms Blears of " crude bullying " .
He said the declaration did not represent an attack on Jewish people and that he did not call for or support attacks on British troops anywhere in the world .
Private dialogue
After the legal action was launched a spokesperson for the Department for Communities and Local Government confirmed it had received correspondence from Dr Daud Abdullah 's solicitors .
" We have been in dialogue with the MCB since 6 March , seeking clarification of the actions taken by Dr Abdullah in relation to the serious issues raised by the articles in the Istanbul Declaration .
What I do advocate is the right of all British citizens to agree or disagree with government policy and to use all lawful means to democratically make their voices heard .
Dr Daud Abdullah
" We are concerned with those articles which appear to call for violence and Dr Abdullah 's repeated unwillingness to distance himself from those articles specifically .
" The legal route that Dr Abdullah has chosen to take despite our offer of further private dialogue with the MCB to resolve the matter means this will now be taken forward by solicitors . "
The UK government has said it is concerned with the following articles of the declaration : • " The obligation of the Islamic Nation to regard everyone standing with the Zionist entity , whether countries , institutions or individuals , as providing a substantial contribution to the crimes and brutality of this entity ; the position towards him is the same as towards this usurping entity . " •
" The obligation of the Islamic Nation to regard the sending of foreign warships into Muslim waters , claiming to control the borders and prevent the smuggling of arms to Gaza , as in effect a declaration of war , a new occupation , sinful aggression , and a clear violation of the sovereignty of the Nation , that must be rejected and fought by all means and ways . "
Responding to Ms Blears with his own letter to the Guardian , Dr Abdullah said : " I do not advocate attacks on any religious community , including Jewish communities , and I do not advocate attacks on British military forces .
" What I do advocate is the right of all British citizens to agree or disagree with government policy and to use all lawful means to democratically make their voices heard .
" A government which tries to suppress discussion of such views by the kind of crude bullying to which Hazel Blears unfortunately stoops will have little moral support , not only in the Muslim community , but in wider society , " he added .
Last week a Labour MP and two of the party 's peers were among co-signatories with Dr Abdullah of a public statement insisting they did not " condone , encourage or support " killing any human beings or attacks on British soldiers .
Ms Blears said at the time that the statement was a " helpful first step " but that " greater clarity " of Dr Abdullah 's views was needed .
She said she stood by what she believed about the declaration .
" Public statements that assert that attacks of this kind are not only acceptable but an ' obligation ' cannot go unchallenged , " she said .
She denied Dr Abdullah 's claims that she was trying to " suppress discussion " .

Pet Shop Boys recently released Yes , their 10th studio album
Pop group Pet Shop Boys have revealed they have turned down a request by animal rights group Peta to rename themselves the Rescue Shelter Boys .
" Peta Europe has written to Pet Shop Boys with a request they are unable to agree to , " reads a post on the band 's official website .
But the band admits the request " raises an issue worth thinking about " .
Peta 's letter requests the name change because of the cruelty it alleges takes place in the pet trade .
If the band were to agree to the name change , it continues , it would " encourage your millions of fans to consider giving a home to an abandoned or unwanted animal from an animal shelter " .
' Bizarre '
In her letter , Peta 's special projects manager Yvonne Taylor admits that her request " may at first seem bizarre " .
It goes on to list a series of criticisms against the way pet shops obtain , maintain and house their animals .
Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe were inspired to call themselves the Pet Shop Boys by friends who worked in a pet shop in west London .
Originally named West End , the electronic pop duo won a Brit award for their outstanding contribution to music earlier this year .
The group - whose hits include West End Girls , Heart and It's A Sin - released Yes , their 10th studio album , last month .
America ’s economy is likely to continue shrinking “ for some time to come ” , Larry Summers , the director of the White House National Economic Council , warned yesterday , predicting further rises in unemployment .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Summers said that while he expected the pace of the collapse of the US economy to slow – and for manufacturing activity , in particular – to pick up eventually , the recovery would not begin to materialise for some time – possibly another six months or so .
" I expect the economy will continue to decline , " Mr Summers said in an interview on Fox News , predicting " sharp declines in employment for quite some time this year . "
He added that the US was now " on a path towards containment and towards building a path toward expansion ” .
“ Even sharp plans take time , " he said , adding that further work on stabilising the global banking system was also necessary .
Today EFF issued a report about the Investigative Data Warehouse , a gigantic billion - document storehouse of information maintained by the FBI .
In addition , EFF wrote to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy and House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , asking Congress to examine the IDW .
In August 2006 , EFF sought documents about the IDW under the Freedom of Information Act .
Three years of litigation later , the FBI has said that no more information will be forthcoming , despite the Obama Administration 's new policies on open government .
This report is based upon the documents provided in the litigation , as well as public information about the huge data warehouse .
The IDW contains at least 53 datasets , and includes more than four times as many unique documents as the Library of Congress .
The report lists 38 of these datasets , which encompass not only information about suspects , but all individuals referenced in FBI investigations .
In
addition , the report discusses the systems architecture and technical features of the IDW .
While the FBI has refused to publicly release any Privacy Impact Assessments about the IDW , the report discusses the FBI 's efforts to avoid " raising congressional consciousness levels and expectations " about PIAs , and to give a “ sense that we really do worry about the privacy interests of uninvolved people whose data we slurp up . "
Finally , the report discusses the future of the IDW .
Moving forward , the FBI has asked for millions of dollars to increase its use of the IDW for “ link analysis ” ( looking for links between suspects and other people – i.e. , the Kevin Bacon game ) and to start “ pattern analysis ” ( defining a “ predictive pattern of behavior ” and searching for that pattern in the IDW ’s datasets before any criminal offense is committed – i.e. , pre-crime ) .
One way to deal with poor communication on a software project is simply to ignore the people around you and do what you wanted to do anyhow .
Of course , this strategy can backfire , especially if you do n’t know what you ’re doing .
But in that case , you probably wo n’t know enough to notice it backfiring , so it will all work out in the end .
That ’s what I did at my first job .
Well , I considered it my first “ real ” job , though it was my second steady job after I quit the grocery store .
And you could have called the IT job I had previously held a “ real ” job , because it did involve some programming .
But I considered this new job the first of my then - yet - to - be career .
( Looking back over the past 20 - something - odd years , I wonder whether I ever had a truly “ real ” job , or whether they were all just time - fillers until I figured out what I really wanted to do with my life . )
This company originally hired me as an electronics lab technician for the summer , after I finished my freshman year of college as an electrical - engineering major .
Because I was only a co-op student , they paid me bargain - basement wages and gave me less than zero respect .
This did n’t bother me , because I was young and impetuous and did n’t care what the old fogies thought .
Still , the job turned out to be wonderful practical experience , and I continued working there part - time even after classes resumed .
And it turned out to be a career - changing opportunity .
At this company , we made centrifuges .
A centrifuge is a finely tuned piece of laboratory equipment , a complex , electromechanical device whose sole purpose is to spin stuff around really , really fast .
You may have seen one in your doctor ’s or vet ’s office , that whirring , little box that spins your blood around at thousands of rotations per minute , until it ’s dizzy enough to be psychoanalyzed .
I started working there just after they began designing centrifuges with computer brains inside them .
( Hereafter , I will use the term “ microcontrollers ” rather than “ computer brains , ” because I want to sound smart . )
In a turn of fate , I designed one of this company ’s most innovative , microcontroller - controlled control systems –which sounds way smarter than “ computer brain ” –and I ended up dropping out of the electrical - engineering biz and taking up software engineering , forever .
It all began when my manager asked me to investigate a new microcontroller , the 68HC11 , or “ HC11 ” for short .
The HC11 was n’t actually new technology , and they actually did n’t want to use the HC11 , but the old microcontroller they had been using was so obsolete , they could n’t get parts anymore .
This company , like many , suffered under a caste hierarchy among engineering disciplines .
The mechanical engineers were in the top caste , and electrical engineers were second - class citizens .
This could n’t have been good for morale .
During the time I was there , everyone in the electrical engineering department quit , one by one , except for the manager , who left soon afterward .
As engineers left for greener pastures , another co-op student and I gradually took on more and more of the responsibility of developing the hardware and software for new products .
And when the software engineer quit to take a better job , I ended up writing all of the the embedded software .
But if electrical engineers were second - class citizens , then what were we , the electrical co-op students ?
I already mentioned that they gave us less than zero respect , and this did n’t change just because we were now doing real engineering .
Even though we were doing much of the design , we were never invited to the project staff meetings .
And we were never consulted on specifications for the products we were designing , even though we understood the designs better than anyone else in the company .
But I found a way to get back at them .
I was tasked with programming the embedded software for the first HC11 product , soup to nuts .
I asked the hardware engineer to make a simple , harmless change to the tachometer circuit , which measures how fast the stuff is spinning in the centrifuge .
This was to make my job easier , or at least that ’s what I told the hardware engineer .
In reality , the change allowed me to measure how fast the rotor was spinning about 100 times more accurately than was ever possible before .
Using the power of the new microcontroller , the HC11 , I designed revolutionary , new tachometer software , coupled with a revolutionary , new motor control , which actually modeled the physics of the centrifuge .
By the time I was finished , the display showed the rotor speed to within 10 RPM , but in reality , the system was controlling it to well within a tenth that .
None of this was in the product specs–which , by the way , I never got to see .
But it was too late , we joked , because the feature was already in code , and I could n’t take it out now .
This was a huge surprise to the marketing guy , and when he found out–or so I was later told , because I still was n’t invited to the project meetings –he stared wide - eyed and exclaimed , “ How long did you plan to keep this a secret ! ? ”
Since then , the company has changed ownership , and the product I worked on has been discontinued .
( Although you can still find it on the used - centrifuge market . )
I do n’t know whether any of the new centrifuges use the same software , or whether it was all too complicated for the programmers who followed me to figure out .
And I also tend to think the marketing guy was probably overreacting , because the centrifuge market does n’t seem to care so much .
Faced with the same situation again , there are some probing questions I would ask first about the true requirements of the project , before I went off half - cocked and designed a whole new , exciting control system .

Fannie Mae loses $ 25.2 billion in one quarter , asks for bailout Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday February 26 , 2009
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP )  Troubled US mortgage finance giant Fannie Mae said Thursday it lost almost 60 billion dollars last year and asked the Treasury Department for a further 15.2 billion dollars in aid .
The US government - controlled Fannie Mae reported a loss of 25.2 billion dollars in the fourth quarter driven mainly by the effects of a prolonged housing slump and a global financial crisis .
It had a third quarter loss of 29.0 billion dollars .
For the full year of 2008 , the company posted a loss of 58.7 billion dollars , almost 27 times higher than the 2007 loss of 2.1 billion dollars .
Fannie Mae said it submitted a request Wednesday for 15.2 billion dollars from the Treasury " in order to eliminate our net worth deficit as of December 31 , 2008 . "

The British Pound has imploded on fears of bank nationalization and Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s plan to give the Bank of England unprecedented powers to buy securities .

Kiss goodbye the idea that the UK would decouple from the US credit crunch .
British Pound vs. US $ Weekly
click on chart for sharper image
The technical picture of the British Pound is weak .
There has been a major trendline break , the 50EMA seems to be rolling over , and there is a big cross under the 50EMA .
A pullback to the 200EMA seems likely .
There is a good chance the entire runup from the April 2006 low is retraced .
Pound At Lowest Level Versus Dollar Since 1985
The pound fell to its weakest level against the dollar since Margaret Thatcher was U.K. prime minister and dropped to a record against the yen for a second day on speculation the government will nationalize banks .
“ The U.K. ’s imploding , ” said Jonathan Gencher , Toronto - based director of currency sales at BMO Capital Markets , a unit of Canada ’s fourth - largest bank .
“ You have all the concern about the financial sector and which banks are going to be nationalized .
You have expectations that the Bank of England is going to be moving toward zero interest rates .
That ’s weighing on the pound . ”
Sterling dropped as much as 2.2 percent to $ 1.3622 , the lowest level since September 1985 , before trading at $ 1.3740 at 1:43 p.m. in New York , Against the yen , the pound fell 2.8 percent to 121.59 after reaching the all - time low of 119.42 .
The pound fell 1.1 percent to 93.61 pence against the euro .
The Bank of England will lower its benchmark rate by a half - percentage point to 1 percent at its Feb. 5 meeting , according to the median forecast of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News .
Bank of England May Start Buying Assets
Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said officials may start buying assets in the next weeks to loosen credit markets as the lowest interest rates since 1694 fail to avert a “ marked ” recession .
The U.K. central bank may acquire securities such as corporate bonds and commercial paper to bolster lending to companies and consumers as banks rebuild balance sheets damaged by the global financial crisis , King said today .
He said interest - rate reductions to the current 1.5 percent wo n’t prevent a contraction in the first half of the year .
“ Despite those big cuts , there remains a risk that inflation will fall below 2 percent , ” the target rate , King said in a speech in Nottingham , England .
“ It is sensible for the Monetary Policy Committee to prepare for the possibility -- and I stress that we are not there yet -- that it may need to move beyond the conventional instrument ” of the bank ’s benchmark interest rate .
King backed Prime Minister Gordon Brown ’s plan to give the Bank of England unprecedented powers to buy securities , unveiled yesterday along with a 100 - billion pound ( $ 140 billion ) bailout for banks .
Those tools may later be expanded to fight deflation as the British economy faces a recession this year that may be the worst since the aftermath of World War II .
“ The bank is almost ready , but very willing , to engage in unconventional monetary policy techniques , ” Philip Shaw , chief economist at Investec Securities in London , said in an interview .
“ There is still some room for interest rates to come down .
But there ’s a good chance they ’ll use this facility . ”
Britain On Edge Of Bankruptcy
Iain Martin says the Prime Minister has n't ' saved the world ' and now faces disgrace in the history books .
They do n't know what they 're doing , do they ?
With every step taken by the Government as it tries frantically to prop up the British banking system , this central truth becomes ever more obvious .
The Government 's bail - out of the banks in October with £ 37 billion of taxpayers ' money was supposed to have " saved the world " , according to the PM , but now it is clear that it has not even saved the banks .
Our money kept the show on the road for only three months .
It is finally dawning on the Government that the liabilities of the British banks grew to be so vast in the boom years that they now eclipse the entire economy .
Unfortunately , the Treasury is pledged to honour those liabilities because it has guaranteed not to let a British bank go down .
RBS has liabilities of £ 1.8 trillion , three times annual UK government spending , against assets of £ 1.9 trillion .
But after the events of the past year , I wager most taxpayers will believe the true picture is worse .
And they come piled on top of the rocketing national debt , charitably put at £ 630 billion , or 43 per cent of GDP .
The true figure is much higher because the Government has used off - balance sheet accounting to hide commitments such as PFI projects .
The PM and the Chancellor , both looking a year older every day , tell us that for their next trick they will buy more bank shares , create a giant insurance scheme for bad debt , pledge to honour liabilities without limit , cross their fingers and hope it all works .
The phrase " bottomless pit " springs to mind for a reason : that is what they have designed .
Gordon Brown 's nightmare , in which we are all trapped , is going to get much worse .

Sex in advertising ?
Women are n't buying it , for the most part .
In fact , past research has shown that the average woman responds negatively to ads with explicit or gratuitous sexual content .
But now , it also looks like women are less offended by these ads if sexual imagery is viewed in the context of a committed relationship .
The study , published this month in Journal of Consumer Research , finds that women respond more favorably to sexual ads when the item in the ad is described as a gift from a man to a woman .
In addition , women have high positive responses to sexual ads that depict a committed and loving man — but not for those depicting a committed and loving woman .
The reason , according to the researchers : sexual economics theory , which states that women have more at risk than men when deciding to have sex .
Therefore , women have more sexual negotiating power and can hold out until their conditions — both financial and emotional — are met .
The financial condition was explored in the first part of the study .
Researchers showed participants two versions of a wristwatch ad that was kind of sexy ; in the second version , a red ribbon was tied around the watch , and the following sentence was included : " This watch is positioned as a gift from a man to the special woman in his life . "
( As a control , participants also viewed non-sexual ads with the same imagery and messaging . )
When viewing the sexual ads , women responded more favorably to the ad with the gift .
However , men preferred the sexual ad without the gift .
" Despite their steadfast support for sex - based advertising , we did find that men reacted negatively to sexually explicit ads when the ads strongly reminded men that they may , at times , devote monetary resources in pursuit of sexual contact , " the authors wrote .
The remainder of the study examined the emotional conditions of sexual economics theory .
In various experiments , participants viewed sexual , non - gift ads after being presented with different commitment scenarios .
In one , the man was the more committed partner ; in another , that role fell to the woman .
In the last scenario , both partners were described as equally committed .
The results found that women reacted most positively to the ads when the men were portrayed as the committed partner .
" We took a cultural approach , which comes more from economics than evolutionary psychology or sociology , " says Kathleen D. Vohs , a University of Minnesota professor and an author of the study .
Men were n't affected in any direction — as long as there was sex in the ad , they reacted positively .
So advertisers , take note : Sex sells .
But for women , commitment has real value .
Ravaged by an escalating armed conflict between its army and five powerful drug gangs , Mexico is at risk of becoming a ‘ failed state , ’ U.S. officials say .
Can the chaos at our border be contained ?
How violent is Mexico ?
Parts of the country have become a war zone , with murders , kidnappings , and armed robberies occurring daily , often in broad daylight .
Some 6,000 Mexicans were killed in drug - related violence in 2008 — double the previous year ’s death toll .
Already this year , more than 1,000 people have been murdered , mostly in the northern cities near the U.S. border .
Authorities say nine of 10 victims are connected to the drug trade , but innocent bystanders are also dying , as are police and other officials who dare to stand up to the cartels .
A Pentagon report in November concluded that the two countries most at risk of “ collapse ” are Pakistan and Mexico .
Few were surprised that Pakistan is considered so precarious , but Mexico boasts the world ’s 12th largest economy and shares a 2,000 - mile border with the U.S.
“ We cannot afford to have a narco - state as a neighbor , ” says retired U.S. Gen .
Barry McCaffrey , a former U.S. drug czar .
Indeed , the Mexican cartels already have begun moving into the U.S. , growing marijuana in rural areas and national parks , sending gang members to U.S. cities , and selling drugs directly to Americans .
What ’s behind the mounting bloodshed ?
Five rival cartels are battling to control production of heroin , cocaine , methamphetamines , and marijuana — along with the drug routes into the United States .
President Felipe Calderón assumed office in December 2006 vowing to take on organized crime , and since then , several cartel leaders have been killed or arrested .
That triggered a full - fledged war between the government and the cartels .
The results have been gruesome .
Just before Christmas , the severed heads of eight soldiers were dumped near a shopping center in Chilpancingo , the capital of the state of Guerrero .
In February , a newly retired general and two bodyguards were tortured , killed , and their bodies dumped near the resort city of Cancún .
Police in Tijuana recently detained a man who confessed to having dissolved in acid the bodies of more than 300 people , on the orders of a drug lord .
Newspapers dubbed him “ the Soupmaker . ”
Who ’s winning the war ?
The government has made inroads , but the cartels still rake in tens of billions of dollars a year .
Gangs have amassed huge arsenals and have branched into other ventures , including extortion and protection rackets .
It ’s not unusual for troops to engage in pitched battles with gangs armed with rocket launchers , machine guns , and armor - piercing sniper rifles .
Corruption is rampant .
The prosecutor in charge of the federal organized - crime unit was recently charged with taking $ 450,000 a month in bribes to pass information to the Sinaloa drug cartel .
Last month , drug traffickers threatened to kill one police officer in Juarez every 48 hours unless Police Chief Roberto Orduña Cruz stepped down .
When he refused , his deputy turned up mutilated and dead , followed by another officer and a jail guard .
Cruz finally resigned his post and fled the city .
Can the gangs get away with that ?
Indeed they can .
More than 450,000 Mexicans work in the drug trade , and in some places , the gangs are the dominant authority .
In Villa Ahumada , about 80 miles south of El Paso , Texas , the entire police force quit last spring after 70 cartel hit men rampaged through town , killing the police chief , two officers , and three residents .
Today , store owners and local officials are expected to pay a kind of tax to the gunslingers , who “ protect ” the town from rival gangs while taking their cut of the drug trade .
“ This was a mellow town where we would walk along Main Street at night , ” says 14 - year - old Zaida de Santiago .
“ But now we ’re too scared to even go out . ”
Is it hopeless ?
President Calderón says he ’s determined to restore order .
He has taken the unprecedented step of deploying 45,000 federal troops and police to Juarez and other hot spots , and thousands of cartel “ soldiers ’ ’ have been arrrested .
So have several major traffickers .
The government has also rescued kidnap victims , seized caches of narcotics and weapons , and given crime - weary residents some relief by re-establishing order in some towns and villages .
But the army has no authority to investigate drug trafficking itself — a task largely left to local police forces , most of which have a long track record of corruption and incompetence .
Concerns have also been raised that poorly paid soldiers are no less vulnerable to bribery than local police .
“ The amount of money is huge , ” says retired Gen. Luis Garfias .
“ You like women ?
You like alcohol ?
It ’s free for you . ”
What ’s the U.S. doing ?
Just last week , the Obama administration said it would send more federal agents and high - tech equipment to the U.S. - Mexican border — the goal being to slow the flow of drugs into this country as well as the flow of guns out .
( See below . )
The move reflects growing concern over the violence that has been spilling into the United States .
Mexican drug gangs have extended their operations to at least 230 U.S. cities , according to the Justice Department , which calls the Mexican cartels “ the biggest organized crime threat to the U.S. ”
In recent weeks , police in Atlanta and Phoenix have blamed a wave of kidnappings and home invasions on the cartels ’ turf war .
“ The situation in Mexico is very , very dangerous for everyone , including the U.S. , ” says former Justice Department official Philip Heymann .
“ The situation has n’t registered in the mind - set of Americans , but it will . ”
Supply and demand
As American officials grow more alarmed about the violence in Mexico , Mexican officials have been pointing the finger right back .
They note that the U.S. not only serves as Mexico ’s largest consumer market for illegal drugs , it also is the source of most of the cartels ’ munitions .
In fact , more than 90 percent of AK - 47s and other guns seized at the border or after raids and shootings in Mexico have been traced to the U.S. — most of them apparently purchased openly and legally by “ straw buyers ” who then sell the weapons to the gangs .
Mexican leaders have called on the U.S. to re-examine its punitive drug policies , to put more emphasis on treatment , and consider legalization of marijuana .
“ The main cause of the problems associated with organized crime , ” said President Felipe Calderón , “ is having the world ’s biggest consumer next to us . ”
Mexican officials also have called for tighter gun control in the U.S. — an unlikely prospect .
Dubbed “ The Prince of Pot ” Emery is a powerful influence in the global ganja culture .
Currently facing extradition to the United States , Emery told MiD DAY in an exclusive online interview from Vancouver , British Columbia , that the Dalai Lama and Martin Luther King
Jr are two of his greatest influences and he seek to emulate them .
Emery who has been twice to India in 1992 and 1997 said he procured marijuana easily in all the places he stayed “ a lovely kilo of cannabis from an Ayurvedic doctor in Trivandrum , ” from the tuk - tuk wallah in Mysore , smoked with the first generation of silicon computer nerds just starting in those days and Mehrangargh Fort in Jodhpur , and in the desert sands beyond Jaisalmer in Rajasthan .
The pot activist says coconut toddy and methylated alcohol would kill more people in India this year than cannabis would over the next century .
According to him Mumbai and Bangalore are the most open and transparent communities in the country and could be considered for legalising marijuana in India .
Excerpts :
Why do you want a contraband substance like cannabis to be legalised ?
Each citizen has autonomy and choice over the use of their own body and their mind .
That is , a free man or woman is not censored , and they are free to act on any peaceful , consenting impulse or decision .
Criminalising any action that is peaceful and consenting is wrong and is an abuse of law .
Even if the argument of medical use of the drug stands , do n’t you think the abuse factor still holds stronger ?
Abuse of cannabis is much less dangerous to the community than abuse of arak , or even coconut toddy ’s , or tobacco , or prescription medicines .
In fact , bad air , bad water , fireworks explosions in Sivakasi ( Tamil Nadu ) , or even badly mixed methylated alcohol ( arak ) during an Onam festival ( in Kerala , say ) will kill many , many more people this year in India than cannabis will over the next century .
Cannabis marijuana is non-toxic , no quantity is fatal .
Almost no other substance on earth is as safe as cannabis is .
Where does India stand on the marijuana map of the world ?
When I lived in India in 1992 and 1997 , I procured marijuana in all places I stayed .
I bought a lovely kilo of cannabis from my Ayurvedic doctor in Trivandrum in 1992 that came from the Western Ghats in Kerala .
In Mysore I bought cannabis from the tuk - tuk wallahs .
In Bangalore , I smoked with the first generation of silicon computer ‘ nerds ’ just starting in those days .
In Rajasthan , I purchased excellent charas from Manali in Pushkar , Jaisalmer , and Jodhpur .
A lot of the enjoyment of cannabis is the setting and the situation .
I loved smoking by the ocean in Kovalam , or at Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur , or in the desert sands beyond Jaisalmer .
You ’ve been to India twice ; do you plan to launch a similar campaign here ?
I have not left Canada since 1998 .
The US government would arrest me anywhere in the world and have me brought to the US in chains .
They are now seeking to extradite me to the US where they want to imprison me for my activism .
I hope one day the US will rescind the indictment against me , so that I may visit and meet the 1,70,000,000 people around the world who are devoted to the cannabis culture .
Which country , according to you , produces the best marijuana ?
The best marijuana is often not the strongest .
I have had excellent cannabis in Kerala , Rajasthan , Sumatra ( Indonesia ) , British Columbia , California , Seattle ( Washington , USA ) , and Amsterdam , Netherlands .
My seed catalogue until 2005 had over 525 varieties of cannabis seeds from almost every country on earth including varieties from Kerala and Manali .
If the Indian government declares that only two or three cities would be identified to legalise marijuana .
Which should they be ?
In the 1990s , it was considered common and virtually legal for a tourist to buy bhang in Jaisalmer , charas in Pushkar and Puri ( Orissa ) and Varanasi .
If it was up to me , I would say make it legal everywhere , but if one were to begin an experiment , I think Mumbai , Bangalore would be the first places because these are the most open and transparent communities in India , the most accepting of new ways .
Is there any celebrity or government official , diplomat supporting your cause ?
I meet many celebrities , most recently the actors John Cusack , Owen Wilson and Woody Harrelson .
I have the support of several Members of Parliament in Canada .
But I have powerful enemies in both the US and Canadian government who want to jail me for life because of my impassioned and persistent freedom campaign .
People who take marijuana are known to indulge in violent sexual activities .
How do you react to that ?
In Indonesia , I was told eating too many mangoes can make a man a sex criminal , but I have never seen a rape case where the perpetrator was smoking cannabis .
Men using alcohol however commit thousands of rapes every day the world over .
Repealing the prohibition against cannabis will reduce alcohol consumption , and thus reduce sex crime and violence .
Do you aim to launch your campaign in India too ?
On May 2 , I will be parade marshall for the largest Global Marijuana March in the world in Toronto , Canada .
Over 20,000 people will convene all day and march through Canada ’s biggest city , smoking marijuana , carrying cannabis plants , cannabis flags and banners high in the air , One day , I hope to lead the same kind of parade of the cannabis culture in India , perhaps in Mumbai , Pune or Bangalore .
What is the inspiration behind Marc Emery ?
Any ideals ?
I began fighting against dominating government policy in 1979 after reading ATLAS SHRUGGED by Ayn Rand .
It is still the most influential book that changed my life completely .
Then in 1980 , I began smoking marijuana , and the enlightenment I received from smoking it , combined with my conversion to the philosophy of freedom and capitalism as articulated by Ayn Rand , I decided my life would be dedicated to liberating the oppressed and persecuted .
Thirty years later , I am very grateful I chose this path , although I have been arrested 23 times for marijuana advocacy , jailed 17 times , raided 6 times .
What made you going despite several police crackdowns ?
I love my work , I love my people , I am never discouraged and I see reason for hope everywhere on earth .
The cannabis culture is active in every nation and through the Internet we are coming together as one of the largest cultures in the history of mankind .
We are meeting online and organizing .
We are participating in elections and we recently made marijuana legalization the number one question for the Obama administration to answer on a television news conference for the president where he promised to answer the question .
What is the strangest thing you ’ve done after taking marijuana ?
I typically do n’t do anything strange after taking marijuana .
I like to work , think and excite my senses while using it .
I use it for relaxation and improved creativity .
What do you see is the problem of people growing cannabis in their houses ?
Even a killer or rapist does not lose their home or property like a person accused of growing these wonderful plants in their homes .
The governments in Canada and the USA can take your children away , force you to lose your job , take your house away , put you in jail , make you pay for expensive lawyers , deny you access to your own children , and many , many punishments .
You have brought a retail revolution to the hemp business in Canada , any plans for expansion ?
Our organisation has a convenience store ( The 420 Convenience ) , two smoking and vaporizing lounges , a retail store , the offices and video studios of POT.TV and Cannabis Culture online , the British Columbia Marijuana Party .
It ’s a busy place bustling with activism .

SKIN DEEP : Dying to be white By Marianne Bray
HONG KONG , China ( CNN ) --
" Flawlessly milky skin is to die for , " says a beauty website for Asian women .
Get - white messages , like this one on the lighten - up page on asiaMs.net , are inescapable in this part of the world .
Pale Asian models peer from the pages of glossy magazines , pout on billboards , ride on white horses in cinema advertisements and jostle for counter space at the local department store .
They tout products such as Blanc Expert , White - Plus , WhiteLight , Future White Day , Blanc Purete , Fine Fairness , Active White , White Perfect and Snow UV .
Spurred on by modern marketing and a cultural history that cherishes fairness , hordes of women across Asia are slapping on whitening lotions , serums , correctors and essences to bleach their skins .
But at what price ?
In what may be the biggest toxic cream outbreak ever , 1,262 people flocked to a hotline set up by Hong Kong 's health department last week , after warnings that two whitener creams -- Rosedew and La Rose Blanche -- had mercury levels between 9,000 and 65,000 times the recommended dose .
Of the 435 callers who were tested for poisoning , one 31 - year - old woman was admitted to Hong Kong 's Tuen Mun Hospital over the weekend , while 13 others were referred to specialists for further check - ups .
Pale preference Skin whitening has a long history in Asia , stemming back to ancient China and Japan , where the saying " one white covers up three ugliness " was passed through the generations .
A white complexion was seen as noble and aristocratic , especially in Southeast Asia , where the sun was always out .
Only those rich enough could afford to stay indoors , while peasants baked in the rice fields .
In their early bid to lighten up , Chinese ground pearl from seashells into powder and swallowed it to whiten their skin , says Chinese University chemical pathology professor Christopher Lam Wai-kei , while across the Yellow Sea , Geisha girls powdered their faces chalk white .
This obsession with whiteness has not faded over time .
A survey by Asia Market Intelligence this year revealed that three quarters of Malaysian men thought their partners would be more attractive with lighter complexions .
In Hong Kong two thirds of men prefer fairer skin , while half the local women wanted their men paler .
Almost half of Asians aged 25 to 34 years used skin whiteners in a business that some analysts have said could be worth billions of dollars .
' Lighten and brighten '
As cosmetic giants around the world jump onto this lucrative Asian obsession , women in the region face an enormous array of ways to brighten , whiten , lighten and illuminate their yellow - toned skins .
( How whiteners work )
But as companies pump money into new skin technology -- touting heat - sealed capsules and triple - action formulas -- they are being joined by less scrupulous players .
In December 2000 , Lam and Prince of Wales Hospital doctor Michael Chan tested 36 creams made by cosmetic makers across the world .
They found eight creams exceeded the U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety limits for mercury .
All eight brands came from China or Taiwan , prompting Lam to predict this could be " the tip of the iceberg " because the creams have been available for several years and widely used .
When Lam phoned one Chinese supplier , he was told : " What is wrong with a little mercury in the cream , as long as it can make ladies beautiful . "
' Mad - as - a hatter '
While mercury was considered a strong and effective whitening agent ten to twenty years ago , in high doses it is lethal .
It is so toxic and dangerous that when workers used mercury to make felt hats in the 1800s , the psychiatric changes it triggered , led observers to call them as " mad-as - a- hatter . "
" Mercury is very harmful to the central nervous system and kidney , particularly the developing brain of a foetus and young child " says Lam .
" It can lead to convulsions , coma and death . "
( More on mercury poisoning ) Used as a skin bleacher for years , it was only when a smattering of toxic cream cases broke out during the 1990s in Australia , America and Saudi Arabia that mercury was put under the spotlight , sparking calls to boost labeling and purity requirements .
" The more effective it is , the less safe it is , and with a strong product the reaction will be expected to be more , " says Dr. Wendy Wong Hok - wai , a Hong Kong dermatologist .
Imperial Palace secret Rosedew was red-flagged and its shop raided by Hong Kong authorities after it came in at a whooping 27,000 to 60,000 times the acceptable dose .
Dubbed the " original Asian beauty secret " its packaging claims to use a " proven Traditional Chinese Imperial Palace secret formula , " made from the " 100 percent natural ingredients . "
Set up five years ago , and selling creams made in southeastern Humen from a store in Hong Kong 's Central district , Rosedew 's owner says that no one knew there was mercury in the creams .
" They have always been safe , " says owner Don Farthing .
" The customs department never had a problem with it in the past . "
Paris - based La Rose Blanche , whose cream came in at 9,100 to 60,000 times the limit , also stands by its claim that it does not use mercury .
The company Web site recently posted a notice on its site saying its beauty creams had passed Hong Kong safety tests .
" Our original formulas should not contain any mercury , " says John Chan , who overseas the range 's distribution in Hong Kong .
" We do n't know what 's wrong .
Right now we are still investigating it . "
( The company explains how their creams work ) Piracy rampant
While piracy is rampant in Asia , and rife in parts of China , it is not yet clear what the status of these products are .
No charges have yet been laid against any of the companies but a probe is underway , according to a spokesperson for Hong Kong 's customs department .
" We wo n't rule out the possibility that they were fake , " said Agnes Law , senior information officer .
Lam for one , says laws should be strengthened to crack down on toxic creams and advises customers to check packaging and buy creams from more developed countries .
In a bid to allay fears in the marketplace , Hong Kong 's consumer council is testing 30 whitening creams for lead and mercury , with the results to be released Wednesday this week , says head of research and surveys , Connie Lau Yin - bing .
Astronaut Mike Massimino ( @Astro_Mike ) to use Twitter during Space Shuttle training .
NASA , which used Twitter to send updates about the Mars Phoenix Lander program , is turning to the micro- blogging service again .
The US space agency announced on Monday that astronaut Mike Massimino would be using Twitter to provide a behind - the - scenes look at his training for an upcoming space shuttle mission .
Massimino will be firing off 140 - character - or - less messages at @ Astro_Mike .
Massimino is to be a mission specialist and spacewalker during the space shuttle Atlantis mission due to launch on 12 May to service the Hubble Space Telescope .
NASA did not say whether the astronaut would be “ tweeting ” from space .
NASA ’s Twitter feed on the Phoenix Lander program earned it praise and more than 38 000 people had signed up to receive “ tweets ” from Mars by the time the mission ended in November .

Madeline Alice Spohr was born at 4:22 p.m. and weighed 3 pounds , 1 ounce .
She came out crying and pink .
. . .
She is responding to treatment for heart and lung problems , but she has a long road ahead .
So began Heather Spohr ’s journey in November 2007 to chronicle the story of her firstborn child on her blog .
Madeline was born early , at 29 weeks , and doctors did not expect her to survive .
But she did .
And over the months , through Spohr ’s blog entries , the little one in Brentwood charmed bloggers and readers from Kentucky to Canada with her fluttery lashes and sassy personality .
Many of her fans were mothers , like Spohr , who turned to the Internet for parenting support or a good laugh after a long day of chasing their own children around the house .
They followed Maddie daily through naps , park strolls , birthday parties and , now and then , bouts of bronchitis and pneumonia .
They suggested home remedies and bathing tricks .
On Tuesday , the “ mommy bloggers , ” as they are commonly known in the blogosphere , were shocked to learn that 17 - month - old Maddie had died unexpectedly after being rushed to the hospital with a cough and congestion .

Maddie and I rode to the hospital with the lights on and the sirens blaring , it was surreal , Spohr wrote in her last entry , a day before a friend logged on to announce Maddie ’s death .
Overnight , the news spread across cyberspace , and hundreds mobilized nationwide , using their blogs and other social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook to help the Spohrs .
Spohr ’s own site , The Spohrs Are Multiplying , crashed because of the outpouring .
Within two days , Maddie ’s Internet followers donated more than $ 20,000 in her name to the March of Dimes , a nonprofit the Spohr family champions .
Through the Web , they organized everything from food deliveries to the Spohrs ’ home to funeral preparations .
Nearly 30 March of Dimes walkathon teams were formed , some in far - flung places such as Spanish Fort , Ala. , and Caledonia , Mich. , to walk on behalf of Maddie .
Some turned their blogs purple -- the signature color of the March of Dimes -- as a tribute ; they organized purple balloon releases and began to sell purple Maddie T - shirts and bracelets .

“ We all put ourselves in Heather ’s shoes , ” said Megan Hook , a blogger from Camarillo and mother of three boys .
“ We all interact daily or several times a day online , through Twitter , through chats , through blogs and comments .
It could have been any one of us . ”
Two thousand miles away in Kentucky , Dawn Schnee , a blogger and mother of one , awoke Wednesday morning to hear the news .
“ I was horrified , ” she said .
“ I remember I sat on my couch and screamed so loud I must have scared my child . ”
After moving to Kentucky as a new mom nearly two years ago , Schnee found solace in reading other mothers ’ ( and sometimes fathers ’ ) blogs .
Spohr ’s sense of humor as a parent stood out and helped Schnee not to feel so alone .
In February , she met Spohr in person at a blogging conference .

“ It was so nice to hear that echo of ‘ I hear you and I understand , ’ ” Schnee said .
On Saturday , Spohr and her husband , Mike , sat on their couch far from the computer .
The home that would come alive daily with Maddie ’s laughter was mostly quiet .
Spohr tightly held one of her daughter ’s favorite dolls and kept a few of her baby clothes by her side , including a bright yellow dress she wore recently to a birthday party .
“ It still smells like her , ” Spohr said .
“ When I feel empty , I like to hold it all in my arms and remember her . ”
The 29 - year - old started her blog to update family and friends through her difficult pregnancy , and ultimately , to show Maddie the entries when she grew old enough to understand her improbable story as a preemie baby .

She says it may be a while before she returns to the blogosphere .
“ When I do , I will have to figure out what my identity is now , ” she said .
Friends and family will gather to pay tribute to Maddie at her funeral service Tuesday at 2:30 p.m. in the Old North Chapel at Forest Lawn Memorial - Park , Hollywood Hills .
Then the couple plan to walk with a team to honor Maddie at the March of Dimes ’ March for Babies walk April 25 at Exposition Park .

Chopping Off Thieves '
Hands " Is Very Rare ; Cases of Qisas [ Executions in Retaliation For Murder ] Are More Common "
Qorban ' Ali Najaf - Abadi : " Chopping off the hands of thieves is very rare .
Cases of qisas [ executions in retaliation for murder ] are more common .
Qisas is the individual prerogative of the victim 's family , and the government does not intervene in this matter .
" One of the issues protested by the West is the qisas .
They confuse qisas with the death penalty .
The qisas is not up to the government .
It is the prerogative of the victim 's family .
For example , if a person is killed , and the [ killer 's ] father requests it , we may ask the victim 's family to absolve ...
Excuse me , the family of ...
This is within my authority , but we have no right to pressure them .
It is up to the family whose member was killed - sometime with extreme brutality .
" The world should know that in the Islamic Republic of Iran , the qisas is the prerogative of the victim 's family .
It is not the prerogative or business of the government , and therefore the government cannot revoke it or refrain from carrying it out .
It is different with regard to the death penalty .
Qisas , as I said , is the prerogative of individuals , and when a person is killed in a qisas execution , it is not called a ' death penalty . '
When it comes to the death penalty - we have judges , and the courts issue a verdict according to the shari 'a . " [...]
" Islam Wants to Abolish the Lack of Financial and Economic Safety , And Therefore It Orders The Chopping Off Of Hands ... "
" As for chopping off hands - these sentences are meant as a deterrent .
Islam wants to abolish the lack of financial and economic safety , and therefore it orders the chopping off of hands .
This prevents the thief form stealing again .
We should not have mercy on someone who steals repeatedly .
[...]
" This punishment is better than prisons , with all their negative effects , especially when prisons like Guantanamo and Abu Ghuraib are concerned .
The [ Americans ] who committed all those crimes in Guantanamo - how come nobody takes a look at their barbaric deeds ?
This torture is hundreds of times worse than the chopping off of hands .
How come they do not face trial ?
It is not that we want to chop off hands , but we do n't say that we wo n't .
If necessary , we will chop off the hands of thieves , just like we carry out death penalties . " [...]
" These Islamic Punishments Are Meant to Warn and Punish ... They Are Better Than " Prison
" Imprisonment and the divine punishments are two different things .
We have , unfortunately , adopted prisons from the West .
Sometimes prisons do not yield positive results .
Quite the opposite .
It is not desirable to impose prison sentences .
There is no such thing in Islam .
" Take , for example , the punishment of flogging .
Since this punishment ruins a person 's reputation , it has a positive effect in terms of deterrence .
These Islamic punishments are meant to warn and punish , not to torture .
They are better than sentencing a person to years in prison , especially considering the corruption and all the bad things he learns there .
In prison , a person learns new crimes .
We see this happening all over the world . "
Apple has sold a total of 17 million iPhones -- including sales of both the original iPhone and iPhone 3G -- since launch , according to the company 's vice president of iPod and iPhone product marketing .
Speaking at the launch of Apple 's iPhone 3.0 software last week , Joswiak said the figure -- which includes 13.7 million iPhones sold in 2008 -- beat Apple 's target of 10 million by a wide margin .
Including sales of the iPod touch , Apple has sold 30 million devices running the iPhone OS .
Other successes including Apple 's iPhone developer programme , which boasts 50,000 members , while the number of applications available via the company 's App Store now exceeds 25,000 .
There have been 800 million total downloads on the App Store so far , Apple said .
This story , " iPhone Sales Hit 17 Million " was originally published by PC Advisor ( UK ) .
Kerstin Sjoden reports .
Activist Christian Engström looks more like a engineer than a buccaneer .
But in June he 'll be one of 20 candidates running for seats in the European Parliament under the skull - and - crossbones flag of the Swedish Pirate Party .
" If politicians want to prevent ordinary citizens from sharing files , they will constantly have to expand their ability to monitor , " Engström said in a telephone interview .
" It 's necessary to reform the copyright legislation to ensure that citizens ' right to privacy is respected . "
Founded by copyright activists in early 2006 , the Pirate Party believes people should be able to freely copy books or music for private use .
The party is dedicated to radical reform of copyright law , abolition of the patent system and guaranteed online privacy rights .
But despite an agenda near and dear to much of Sweden 's youth , the party put in a dismal showing in the Swedish national election in 2006 , winning only 0.63 percent of the votes .
But times have changed , says Engström .
There 's growing outrage in Sweden over draconian new anti-privacy legislation , and the recent trial of The Pirate Bay in Stockholm earned saturation - level media coverage .
The party 's rank - and - file has swelled over the last year , and with 12 ,000 members , the Pirate Party is now larger than the small but well - established Swedish Left Party and the Swedish Green Party .
The party 's youth section , " Young Pirates , " is currently the second biggest political youth group in Sweden .
Engström , a 48 - year - old father living in Nacka , a wealthy suburb of Stockholm , believes that support gives him and his fellow candidates a real shot at the European Parliament .
Elections in EU 's 27 member states will be held between June 4 and June 7 , 2009 .
The European Parliament is the only directly elected body of the European Union and plays an active role in drafting legislation from its headquarters in Brussels .
" Most legislation about information policy comes from Brussels , " says Engström .
" That 's where decisions are made and that 's why we want to be there . "
Engström has worked as an unpaid , full - time activist for five years .
He joined the Pirate Party in 2006 , after lobbying against software patents in Brussels for two years .
Before becoming an activist , he worked as a programmer and vice president of a small company .
" I 've saved enough to be able to work without getting paid , and these issues are of such importance to me , " says Engström .
" But I can't work like this forever .
Eventually , some money would be nice . "
The timing of the EU election is almost perfect for the party .
Last summer , a controversial law that allows the state to wiretap internet traffic that crosses Sweden 's borders was passed by the Swedish parliament , provoking widespread and intense opposition , and putting one of the Pirate Party 's core issues in the map .
Shortly afterward , there was an outcry about the new " Ipred - law " , which gives copyright holders the right to seek a court order identifying people linked to illegal downloading .
Based on the European
Union 's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive , the measure will come into force on April 1 .
In the middle of it all The Pirate Bay trial , which ended March
3 , had everyone voicing an opinion .
The judge is expected to issue a verdict on April 17 , an event likely to raise much media interest again .
To succeed in June 's election , The Pirate Party must keep the online privacy discussion alive and convince voters of a conflict between Sweden 's established parties and the public interest .
Ulf Bjereld , professor of Political Science at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden , thinks that the Pirate Party 's chances to reach the EU Parliament are pretty small .
" They should n't be disregarded though , " he says .
" Small parties can pop up during EU elections , and the Pirate
Party 's campaign issues have been rousing interest all year long , " says
Bjereld .
" But they need to reach outside their own group to mobilize more voters . "
The pirates will still need an estimated 100,000 votes to get a member elected .
In the Swedish national election in 2006 , the Pirate
Party won only 35,000 votes .
According to Engström , this summer 's election is make or break for Sweden 's pirates , because of the party 's shaky financial situation .
The
Pirate Party has no paid employees – operating costs are covered by member donations .
If the party makes it to the EU parliament , it will be able to have a paid employee , and hire two or three assistants .
" If we fail to reach the European parliament , the future of the Pirate
Party looks quite dark , " he says .
" All our planning is based on us going to Brussels . "

* quick note : I do n't have much formal training in PL's , so if I 'm wrong , please correct me .
For reference , I know python , C++ , C , JAVA , OCAML , LISP , prolog ( in that order of familiarity ) .
The quick one liner :
Why are objects that we use in programming so vastly different from real - world objects ?
The slow multi-liner :
Human languages have the ability to talk about the state of the world , and all of them contain nouns , which rather than describing a particular thing , they are supposed to indicate a set of things that contain a certain property .
Cars can be driven ; boxes are containers ; speakers produce sound .
People from different cultures that have different languages , even with a difference in nomenclature , typically have common words that describe sets of things the same way .
In addition , modern science has found mathematical relationships between classes of things with precision .
All this to say there is such a thing as " real - world objects , " it is not arbitrary ( and suggests that there is a right way and wrong way of describing things . )
Most programming languages have a concept of objects , and allow programmers to define them and describe relationships between objects .
The idea of objects helped programming with type - checking , encapsulation , code reduction , etc .
In fact , an argument can be made that the job of the programmer is to figure out a representation ( real - world object -> code -> binary data ) of a problem and a process to solve the said problem .
Yet even with the amount of programs being written and problems about objects being solved , rather than converging on a complete representation of real - world objects , objects in programs seem to diverge , where an object from one project is different from an object from another project and is typically different from how a normal person thinks about the real world object .
When the representation in code is the same as a person 's understanding about a real world object ( " common sense " or common understanding ) , the person can process and reason and be productive with the code with ease ( like .. integer object types ) .
On the other hand , if the representation is not the same ( unintuitive ) , then the person has to go through the documentation / look over each line to match up the person 's internal representation with the representation in code , making programming difficult ( any large scale programming project ) .
Working Definition :
Class of Real World Objects : A set of things that has the same property .
ex : a cardboard box ( made from paper , rectangular , contains stuff )
Relation : A relationship between objects .
A relation between object A and object B describes a constraint on some properties of A and B. ex. a ball is " in a " box ( constraint on the location of the ball )
Inheritance : A particular relation between object A and object B where object A has a subset of the properties of object B. ( an ISA relation ) ex. a paper box " is a " paper object .
a paper object " is a " physical object
Functions : a relationship between the parameter and the return value
Objects in OOPL :
Objects in object - oriented programming languages ( the most straightforward implementation of objects ) are defined by the name of the class , with a list of attributes and functions .
Relationships between objects are implemented through inheritance , templates , functions , or attributes .
Many problems come from the use of inheritance , where the base class has to contain a subset of the derived class , so there is no implicit way of sharing attributes between derived classes if it is n't in the parent class -- unless you restructure the inheritance tree to no longer resemble any real objects ( which require constant refactoring with each additional class ) .
Note , functions in the class definitions are relationships between the parameter , the self object , and the return value .
Objects in logic programming :
Logic programming ( the most straightfoward implementation of relations ) defines objects in terms of relations .
Atoms can be objects , and classes may be declared with single term predicates .
brother ( A , B ) :- is Human( A ) , isHuman ( B ) , father ( C , A ) , father ( C , B ) .
Defines the relationship " brother " for objects of class human
ownsPet ( A , B ) :- is Human( A ) , isAnimal ( B ) , has ( A , B ) .
Another example of a relationship .
you can find who owns a pet named kitty ( ?- ownsPet ( X , kitty ) . ) and you can find the pets that a person John owns ( ?- ownsPet ( john , X ) . ) ( think about how to program this simple relationship in OOPL -- adding owner to class animal and pet to class human would require two fxns and messed up classes ) .
Some logic programming languages are object oriented , and with clear definition of objects and relations , come the closest to the way we think about objects .
However , logic programming is ( typically ) done on horn clauses , and uses backtracking to solve the query ( run the program ) .
Therefore , you can't put all human knowledge into a prolog program , and still expect it to solve your query in a reasonable amount of time .
Conclusion
Object - oriented programming give very good benefits to the programming environment ( encapsulation , abstraction , code reduction , code reusability , type correctness ) , but common approaches limit the definition of objects , creating objects that no longer describe real world objects and sometimes decrease productivity in the process .
Rather than thinking " what objects there are , and how to use the relations between them to solve the problem , " a programmer has to think about " what objects can I implement that will give me all the benefits without any of the problems . "
Logic programming approaches , on the other hand have a particular control process , which make intuitive implementations of real world objects unfeasible to solve .
So here 's the discussion :
How do you improve object and relation definitions in a way that is " natural " and useful to programmers ?
Is there a provable reason why objects in programming languages are so unintuitive ?
will they ever be ?
[ and bonus question : benefits / pitfalls of object - oriented functional langages ? ]
Dan Choi , co-founder of KnightsOut , a group campaigning to repeal Do n’t Ask Do n’t tell ( DADT ) spoke recently to PinkNews.
co.uk on how the firing of gay linguists may have undermined national security in the lead up to 9/11 .
“ On Monday , September 10th 2001 , a message was intercepted by the State Department : tomorrow is zero hour .
Despite its simplicity , nobody was able to translate it .
Any of the dozens of linguists already discharged for being gay at the time would have done so easily . ”
Choi , a former infantry platoon leader for the New York Army National guard , has been outspoken against DADT since coming out of the closet on the Rachel Maddow Show In March :
Since the introduction of DADT in 1994 , over 1200 services members have been ejected from the military , including 60 Arab linguists .

LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - DVD sales dropped 14 percent to $ 2.9 billion in 2008 ’s first quarter compared to last year , an industry group said on Monday , as the key sector of the entertainment business continued a decline that has hurt movie studios and hamstrung film financing .
Overall pre-recorded home entertainment , which includes new DVDs and used DVDs , newer Blu-ray technology and Web downloads declined 5 percent to $ 5.3 billion for the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago , the Digital Entertainment Group ( DEG ) said .
But sales of Blu-ray discs , a newer high definition technology , more than doubled to $ 230 million in the first quarter of this year , DEG said , and digital distribution of content was up 19 percent to $ 487 million for the period .
Hollywood has looked to Blu-ray and digital distribution to help make up for losses in the more mature DVD market , but those industry ’s are still in their infancy while DVDs have been on retail shelves for roughly a decade .
Bob Chapek , president of Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment , said in a statement that he is confident Blu-ray sales will continue to grow .
Movie and television studios in recent years have relied on DVD sales to turn a profit on many titles , and the ongoing decline in that sector has made it harder to finance films .
Last week , Bernstein Research analyst Michael Nathanson reported U.S. consumer spending on home entertainment fell 4 percent in 2008 , in the first decline since the advent of DVD .
In February , Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger described “ secular changes ” to DVD sales that could portend slower growth , even as the recession fades .

I 've been following Seymour Hersh forever , especially lately .
No sense in stopping now .
So .
You want to know what the Nation of Dick has been up to now ?
Yes ?
You may regret it :
He implied that they were still scared of Cheney
“ Are you saying that you think Vice President Cheney is still having a chilling effect on people who might otherwise be coming forward , ” asked [ Terry ] Gross .
“ I ’ll make it worse , ” answered Hersh , adding that he believes Cheney “ put people back ” in government to “ stay behind ” in order to “ tell him what ’s going on ” and perhaps even “ do sabotage ” :
HERSH : I ’ll make it worse .
I think he ’s put people left .
He ’s put people back .
They call it a stay behind .
It ’s sort of an intelligence term of art .
When you leave a country and , you know , you ’ve driven out the , you know , you ’ve lost the war .
You leave people behind .
It ’s a stay behind that you can continue to contacts with , to do sabotage , whatever you want to do .
Cheney ’s left a stay behind .
He ’s got people in a lot of agencies that still tell him what ’s going on .
Particularly in defense , obviously .
Also in the NSA , there ’s still people that talk to him .
He still knows what ’s going on .
Can he still control policy up to a point ?
Probably up to a point , a minor point .
But he ’s still there .
He ’s still a presence .
he put together a “ corps of hard - line acolytes ” that served “
” in the federal bureaucracy .
Former officials called them “ Dick Cheney ’s spies
Additionally , before leaving office , the Bush administration aggressively placed political appointees into permanent civil service positions as part of a process known as “ burrowing . ”
[ Laffy Note : My post on that here ]
Some of the burrowed former political appointees have close ties to Cheney , such as Jeffrey T. Salmon , who was a speechwriter for Cheney when he served as defense secretary .
In July , he was named deputy director for resource management in the Energy Department ’s Office of Science

At the Hollywood premiere of the hit movie “ Monsters vs. Aliens ” , actress Reese Witherspoon graced the red carpet with a very futuristic - inspired minidress .
Although not a conventional look , Reese managed to pull the look off by keeping everything else clean and simple .
What do you think of Reese 's futuristic minidress ?
Love it or Hate it : Reese Witherspoon 's Minidress
For starters , Reese looks good in almost anything so it 's only natural that this minidress also does her justice .
But of course , I do think she could have gone with something different – maybe something a little more earthy ?
Either way , she pulls it off brilliantly due to the fact that she kept everything else simple .
This type of dress should be worn with minimal jewelry and simple shoes , such as Reese's .
The minidress also gives Reese an edge , making her look much younger than she actually is .
All in all , I give Reese an 8 out of 10 style points .

The tea ceremony requires a deal of preparation and skill : the first time you will perform it , you will probably notice how many things must be done and accounted for at the same time .
The tea ceremony also requires guests who can appreciate it to some level : for example , they should not do sudden moves like leaving or answering the phone , which would ruin the whole atmosphere !
Moreover , the person who prepares the tea must always be aware of the guests .
For example , the successive brews of tea should be ready in the same moment the guests have finished drinking the tea they have in their cups : the tea should never become cold , nor the guest should wait long to receive another cup .
Chinese emperors would never allow that to happen when their guests came over for tea !
Introduction
Like many computer enthusiasts , I ’m an early adopter .
At the turn of the millennium , I decided to construct a home theater PC ( HTPC ) -- before Windows Media Center Edition was readily available as a standalone product .
Armed with AMD ’s Remote Wonder , a Radeon 7500 with an S - video output , some game controllers , and a DVD - ROM drive , my HTPC was tasked to play DVDs , music , and PC games on the 27 " TV in my living room .
The experiment technically " worked " –it played movies , music , and games and I could even play the PC version of TOCA race driver in split - screen mode .
However , the system was not very user - friendly and I got tired of explaining and re-explaining how to operate it to my family .
It was also a little buggy and temperamental , while frankly yesteryear ’s CRT televisions were n’t really capable of making even the low 640x480 resolution look readable .
While it was technically an HTPC that could do the job , in reality it was still just a PC attached to my television .
Here we are , almost a decade later , and in the last few years high - resolution LCD and plasma televisions have proliferated extremely quickly .
More and more folks are even running dedicated home - theater rooms with HD projectors .
In addition , Windows Media Center offers the PC a truly user - friendly interface that even my wife –who is not very tech - savvy–and children can use .
Between modern graphics cards being able to offer sublime image quality on HD playback and my desire to try out the latest PC games on my HDTV , I believe the HTPC ’s heyday might have just arrived .
It 's certainly not 2002 anymore , and there are a lot more case options than beige - on - beige .
In fact , there are a seemingly infinite number of unique and interesting HTPC cases available .
Notably , we 've seen a number of cases offering an integrated LCD touch screen that have both user - interface functionality as well as information - delivery .
But are these cases well - optioned , well - built platforms for the serious home enthusiast ?
Are they worth their substantial price premium over an HTPC case without an LCD display ?
Or are they just a flashy case with a pretty face ?
Let ’s find out by taking a hard look at three HTPC cases with integrated LCD touch screens : the Moneual 972 , the SilverStone CW03 , and the Thermaltake DH102 .
All three offer full ATX compatibility , iMedian HD media player software , a handy IR remote , and a 7 " LCD touch screen .
We 'll start in alphabetical order and see what Moneual has to offer , first .
The Kepler Space telescope took its first images of the region of the galaxy where it will hunt for planets .
The full - field view ( below ) contains approximately 4.5 million stars , and astronomers have selected more than 100,000 of them as good candidates for orbiting rocky planets .
" We expect to find hundreds of planets circling those stars " William Borucki , head of the Kepler mission at NASA .
" And for the first time , we can look for Earth - size planets in the habitable zones around other stars like the sun . ”
Kepler is the first space telescope with this capability , thanks to its 95 - megapixel camera , the largest ever sent to space .
The telescope will spend the next 3.5 years taking a closer at the targeted stars , waiting for their light to dim periodically as orbiting planets pass in front of them .
For the next few weeks , NASA will calibrate Kepler 's instruments , and then the hunt will be on .

The ability to correctly diagnose and treat crop diseases such as banana wilt via mobile phone is just one of endless possibilities for smallholder farmers if location - specific ( geospatial ) information were available , according to researchers .
Such a project would , for example , make use of mobile devices equipped with Global Positioning Systems and cameras .
" A trained community worker can input the location coordinates , take a photo of the diseased crop , send it to our database , from which we would forward the image for expert review and feedback , " Whitney Gantt , a project officer with the Grameen Foundation , told IRIN .
" In addition to being able to identify a disease , people will know what to do . "
The Grameen Foundation is conducting a seven - month pilot project in two Ugandan districts , whereby community workers collect and disseminate information on crop acreage and projected harvests through mobile device surveys .
In the scheme , 45 community knowledge workers ( CKWs ) , selected from existing farmers ' groups , are trained in using mobile devices for data collection .
Each has a mobile phone , some of which are equipped with cameras .
From a drop - down menu on the phones , the CKWs are able to enter the required data , which is then transmitted to the foundation 's database for agricultural forecasting .
The phone cost ranges from US $ 30 each to $ 330 .
" It is a cost - effective method and we are also testing the three devices to see which collects better data , " Gantt said .
Challenges
Finding CKWs who are literate and fluent in English is a challenge and it is difficult reaching women farmers as most phone - owners are men .
Network connectivity and lack of electricity in the rural parts are a problem and can delay information transmission .
Ensuring accurate data is also a challenge .
" Getting information that is actionable is very useful ... how do you ensure that the data is accurate ? "
According to Gantt , the goal of the project is to work intensively with the CKWs with a view to a possible scale - up .
From the information collected , the foundation also hopes to link farmers with buyers .
" A lot of providers are without such information , " she said .
In another application , a study in Ethiopia is expected to capture information on rural road types , sea and inland water ports , airports , border crossings , private and community depots and silos and market locations for use by farmers and other service providers , according to Tesfaye Korme of the Regional Center for Mapping of Resources for Development
The use of high - resolution mapping is another possibility .
" High - resolution mapping for fields would not only help with field acreage knowledge but could also be a precursor for sustainable land management , " said Pierre Traore of the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics .
It could also be used to map low fertility areas within farms .
According to researchers , geospatial information on soils and the best crops , appropriate farming techniques and early warning on droughts , floods , diseases and pests , as well as up - to - date market and price information , would not only maximise crop yields and market access but also improve livelihoods and reduce uncertainties in production .
Such information does not reach those who most need it .
" The information is often used by a select group of project farmers yet many such projects do not last beyond project funding , " said Jennifer Barnes of the consulting group CH2M Hill .
" Current data is also not provided in relevant time and map scales yet there is a need for the information to reach farmers rapidly .
" According to Enrica Porcari of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) :
" There is a lot of information at the policy level yet the problems are at the local level ...
Although we have solutions , they often do n't come off the shelf .
" There are challenges in the nodes of the chain from the researchers to the farmers , " Porcari said , adding that the mandate of research institutions did not extend to dissemination of information to the farmers .
CGIAR is holding a meeting in Nairobi on opportunities in geospatial technology and accessing a broader range of users .

Bottom line : Although pricing has yet to be announced , based on operational and usability improvements , Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 will be a major step up from Exchange Server 2007 .
A potential hurdle : Support for Windows Server 2003 is dropped in favor of Windows Server 2008 only .
The last big release of Microsoft Exchange , Exchange Server 2007 , marked a major change from the previous edition .
Exchange 2007 introduced unified messaging , a completely new management client , and improvements to almost every aspect of the mail server , but at the cost of a whopping learning curve for administrators .
Admins will have an easier go of it this time around .
Due the latter half of 2009 , Exchange Server 2010 is light on wholesale changes and heavy on refinements .
On top of noteworthy enhancements for Outlook users , new features also make the operator 's life easier -- without introducing entirely new ways of doing things .
So if the standby continuous replication feature in Exchange 2007 SP1 improved your operations , or you 've been migrating your contractors ' e-mail accounts from in - house Exchange 2007 servers to Exchange Online to reduce costs , you 'll find much to like in Exchange 2010 as well .
[ See our guided visual tour through Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 highlights . ]
The improvements in Exchange 2010 fall into three " pillars , " as they are described in Microsoft marketing - speak : flexibility and reliability , anywhere access , and protection and compliance .
While I 've listed all the new features of Exchange 2010 in the table below , there are a few that stand out , at least in my mind .
Top new Exchange 2010 features
My No. 1 pick is a small thing with a high impact on users : OWA ( Outlook Web Access ) support for Internet Explorer ( IE ) 7 and 8 , Firefox 3 , and Safari 3 .
When I was involved in administering an Exchange server for a client , the most frequent issue to come up had to do with the requirement to use Internet Explorer for OWA .
Users typically ran OWA rather than an Outlook client when they were at home or on the road .
Users with Macs wanted to go with Safari or Firefox , and only reluctantly accepted the need to run IE in a Windows VM .
Users with Linux wanted to Firefox , as did Windows users , because IE did n't have multiple page tabs at the time , only multiple windows .

Today the NY Times ran an article about a school system in Scarsdale , NY , that includes mandatory lessons in “ empathy . ”
The article says that these seventh - and eighth - grade kids are required to do things like interviewing octogenarians and disabled people to learn about their lives and feelings , and to avoid doing things that might leave classmates feeling “ excluded ” from cool social events .
The hope is that this will increase not just empathy for others , but that this kind of training may be instrumental in reducing the amount of bullying , teasing , and other social ills that are common in schools .
Surprisingly , the article cites a number of critics who disagree with this training .
Reasons include the risk of “ empathy training ” crowding out other , more critical academic items , and kids ’ complaints that the schools should n’t try to dictate how they live their personal lives .
These are probably misplaced fears .
In fact , there may be few things that are more useful to a child than to learn some of the critical skills , and incorporating some of the key attitudes , that go along with “ empathy . ”
Because empathy is actually a core component of the broader set of skills that are now called “ social intelligence . ”
What is “ social intelligence , ” then ?
The concept has been around for nearly a century in psychology , though it ’s only really gotten a lot of press in the past few years .
The idea of social intelligence was originally developed as one of several core parts of intelligence , or “ IQ , ” in general .
It was thought that there were several broad types of intellectual ability , such as memory , the ability to manipulate mechanical objects , the ability to understand written / academics , and so on .
“ Social intelligence ” was broadly thought of as the ability to understand and “ manage ” people .
In my book on the topic , I suggest that social intelligence includes four broad categories of ability : self - understanding ( of your emotions / motives ) and emotional self - control ; the ability to have empathy for others ( to understand their emotions , what they want from you , etc. ) ; the ability to connect with / communicate with others ; and genuine caring .
Unlike traditional , academic “ IQ , ” the evidence suggests that emotional intelligence can indeed be improved with training .
So teaching kids about empathy is probably a really good thing .
It may not automatically bring the “ new age of happiness ” to every child , and yes , there will still be bullies .
( There may even be a rare few who , like psychologists who helped the CIA learn to torture better , become better bullies because of their new empathy into “ what would really hurt her . ” )
But for the most part , creating a group of youngsters who have higher empathic quotients is likely , over time , to help them to become both more resilient , more effective ( even in dealing with those new , “ highly trained ” bullies ) , and more successful in life .

I suspect that the markets are about to get volatile , possibly to an extent beyond what we observed in October and November .
As long - term shareholders know , we do n't invest on forecasts , but on the basis of observable measures of valuation and market action .
Not surprisingly , we are positioned in a way that can accommodate a strong advance as well as profound weakness .
Overall , however , our investment stance has to be characterized as defensive .
As always , we have the ability to accept risk by holding a portfolio of stocks having a different composition than the indices we use to hedge .
The difference in performance between our stocks and those indices has been the primary driver of the returns in the Strategic Growth Fund since its inception .
We can certainly accept those risks that we expect to be compensated over time , while still hedging against general market fluctuations .
As for the stock market as a whole , I continue to view the market as undervalued , but not deeply undervalued .
So over the course of a 7 - 10 year holding period , I do expect passive buy - and - hold investors in the S&P 500 to achieve total returns somewhat above 10 % annually .
Shorter - term , however , investors may demand much higher prospective long - term returns in order to accept risk , and that 's a problem , because the only way to price stocks to deliver higher long - term returns is to drive prices lower .
While the stock market is extremely compressed , which invites the typical " fast , furious , prone - to - failure " rallies to clear this condition , my larger concern is that market action and credit spreads are demonstrating very little investor confidence , risk - tolerance or commitment to stocks .
Value investors know that stocks have been much cheaper at the end of lesser crises , and traders are still sellers on advances .
My impression is that only prices that allow no room for error ( what Ben Graham used to call a " margin of safety " ) will be sufficient to prompt robust , committed buying from value investors .
This will be a fine thing for investors who keep their heads , are already defensive , and have the capacity to add to their investment exposure on price weakness , but other investors are likely to be shaken out of long - term investments at awful prices .
This need not happen in one fell swoop , and we need not observe the " final lows " anytime soon .
The problem is that even to get a sustainable " bear market rally , " somebody has to be convinced that stocks are desirable holdings for more than a quick bounce .
When I was working down at the Chicago Board of Trade as an options mathematician in the late 1980's , I learned that the best approach to volatility is to " widen your spread and lower your size . "
For a trader , that means keeping a wide bid -ask spread so you get more " edge " for putting on a trade , and holding the number of contracts you trade to a small number so that your capital can tolerate a whole succession of moves against your position .
As investors , the same advice amounts to establishing exposure to market fluctuations only very gradually , and on significant price weakness .
I 've been asked when we are likely to move to a significantly constructive investment position .
We do have some out - of - the - money call options ( about 1 % of assets ) to slightly anti-hedge our otherwise strongly defensive position , but conditions have deteriorated significantly from even a few months ago .
Late last year , I was far more optimistic that our leaders would respond correctly than I am now .
Unfortunately , the growing revulsion of investors is palpable .
Presently , we do n't observe any " favorable divergences " from market action that would suggest that the under - structure of the market is holding up .
Such divergences would be a sign that investors are becoming less risk averse .
We just do n't see it here .
Moreover , we 've lost the opportunity to address this problem without significant " add on " effects in the form of job losses and economic contraction .
Probably the most important long - term risk to perceived valuations here is that the deleveraging pressure we 're observing is increasingly likely to cap future return - to - equity at a much lower level than was possible with extremely high levels of debt .
This will make historical norms of price - to - book value and price - to - revenues increasingly relevant , while the recent history of peak - earnings ( and perhaps even dividends ) may be misleading because the recent peak in profit margins will be far more difficult to recover compared with past cycles .
Again , I believe that stocks are undervalued , but not extremely so .
Passive , long - term investors in the S&P 500 can reasonably expect average total returns moderately higher than 10 % annually over the next say , 7 - 10 years , but there is a good chance that even these prospective returns are not high enough for value investors to make a firm stand .
The misguided policy response from Washington has focused almost exclusively on squandering public money and burdening our children with indebtedness in order to defend the bondholders of mismanaged financial institutions ( blame Paulson and Geithner - I 've got a lot of respect for our President , but he 's been sold a load of garbage by banking insiders ) .
Meanwhile , I suspect that the little tapes in Bernanke 's head playing " we let the banks fail in the Great Depression " and " we let Lehman fail and look what happened " are so loud that he is making no distinction about the form of those failures .
Simply letting an institution unravel is quite different from taking receivership , protecting the customers , keeping the institution intact , replacing management , properly taking the losses out of stockholder and bondholder capital , and issuing it back into private ownership at a later date .
This is what it would mean for these banks to " fail . "
Nobody is advocating an uncontrolled unraveling of major financial institutions or permanent nationalization as if we 've suddenly become Venezuela .
Make no mistake .
Buying up " troubled assets " will not materially ease this crisis , nor will it even improve the capital position of financial institutions ( see You Can't Rescue the Financial System if You Can't Read a Balance Sheet ) .
Homeowners will continue to default because their payment obligations have not been restructured to any meaningful extent .
We are simply protecting the bondholders of mismanaged financial institutions , even though that bondholder capital is more than sufficient to cover the losses without harm to customers .
Institutions that cannot survive without continual provision of public funds should be taken into receivership , their assets should be restructured to better ensure repayment , their stockholders should be wiped out , bondholders should take a major haircut , customer assets should ( and will ) be fully protected , and these institutions should be re-issued to the markets when the economy stabilizes .
The course of defending the bondholders of insolvent institutions is not sustainable .
Do the math .
The collateral behind private market debt is being marked down by easily 20 - 30 % .
That debt represents about 3.5 times GDP .
That implies collateral losses on the order of 70 - 100 % of GDP , which itself is $ 14 trillion .
This estimate would include not only bank mortgage losses , but also loan losses to insurance companies , pension funds and other institutions that own private debt .
Unless Congress is actually willing to commit that amount of public funds to defend the bondholders of mismanaged financials so they can avoid any loss , this crisis simply cannot be addressed through bailouts .
Bondholders have to take losses .
Debt has to be restructured ( and can be restructured in ways that largely preserve the present value of the obligations ) .
There is no other option - but the markets are going to suffer interminably until our leaders figure that out .
Nearly 5 years ago , in Freight Trains and Steep Curves , I wrote " The major force shaping economic dynamics over the coming decade is likely to be an unwinding of the extreme leverage that individuals , businesses , and the U.S. itself ( via its record current account deficit ) have accumulated ... much of the worst credit risk in the U.S. financial system is actually swapped into instruments that end up being partially backed by the U.S. government .
These are held by investors precisely because they piggyback on the good faith and credit of Uncle Sam . "
Was this really so difficult for Wall Street and our leaders to recognize at the time ?
Is it not clear that if we issue trillions in additional debt to foreigners in order to defend bondholders , it will act as a claim against the future output of the nation , at exactly the time that an aging population will be most dependent on that production ?
For our part , the Strategic Growth Fund is tightly hedged , with a small " anti-hedge ( about 1 % of assets ) in call options simply to allow for the potential for a recovery .
I am increasingly concerned that investor confidence in the U.S. dollar is unjustified , as we are on a track of both long - term monetization and expanding current account deficits .
Aside from credit spreads , the behavior of the U.S. dollar here is of great importance , as a weakening in the dollar may portend a further loss of confidence in the markets more generally .
I would love to set a more optimistic tone , but it is difficult to believe that our policy makers are willing to send America into fiscal chaos in order to protect corporate bondholders .
Yes , some pension funds , insurance companies , mutual funds , and other investors who hold the corporate bonds of mismanaged financial institutions will take a haircut on those investments .
As they should .
But if we ignore the need to restructure debt obligations , we risk allowing this downturn to move aggressively into 2010 .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks was characterized by favorable valuations and unfavorable market action .
We presently do n't observe anything to convey an easing of risk - aversion .
Generally speaking , market troughs are marked by fresh lows in some major indices but with other indices and internals failing to confirm those lows .
In contrast , when the markets break support with broad uniformity and few divergences , it suggests that risk aversion is - if anything - becoming more pointed .
Along with credit spreads and the exchange value of the U.S. dollar , the CBOE volatility index ( VIX ) is worth watching , as a push above about 55 may signal another " cascade " to the downside as we saw in October and November ( as would a burst of say , 700 or more daily new lows on the NYSE ) .
In the Strategic Growth Fund , over 90 % of our stock holdings are hedged with offsetting short sales in the S&P 500 , Russell 2000 , and Nasdaq 100 indices .
Again , the Fund does have about 1 % of assets in call options essentially to " soften " our hedge in the event of a strong market rebound , but that " anti- hedge " is more like insurance than expectation .
In bonds , the Market Climate last week was characterized by relatively neutral yield levels and modestly favorable yield pressures .
The Strategic Total Return Fund continues to be primarily invested in TIPS , with about 30 % of assets allocated across precious metals shares , foreign currencies , and a modest exposure to utility shares .
The Wall Street Journal featured an article about Strategic Growth last Monday , which I thought was nicely done ( apart from an underestimation of how much our stock selection approach has contributed to the Fund 's returns , which is detailed in our latest Semi-Annual Report , along with relevant performance figures ) .
I 'm not sure what to do with " Its manager is a quirky , voluble academic who maintains mild cult status among investing geeks , " except that it 's probably true .
Undoubtedly quirky , and probably voluble too ( " talking easily and at length ; marked by a ready flow of speech " ) .
The dot drawing was a bonus .
And just to let you know , I could n't be writing and investing for a nicer bunch of geeks ...

The bright core of the galaxy M87 is located in the lower left of each of these Hubble Space Telescope images taken from 1999 to 2006 , while the knot called HST - 1 is the bright blob at centre .
The glowing material at far right is part of a stream of particles in the jet that speed up and glow in the ultraviolet ( Image : NASA / ESA /J Madrid / McMaster University )
A knot in a jet of matter streaming out of a nearby galaxy has brightened mysteriously over a period of several years , newly released Hubble Space Telescope images reveal .
The bizarre behaviour may overturn theories of what causes other galaxies – which are too far away to study in such detail – to fluctuate in brightness .
The giant galaxy M87 , which lies 54 million light years away , sports an extensive jet that spews out from its centre .
The jet is made up of matter that was shot outwards by magnetic fields after spiralling towards the supermassive black hole at the galaxy ’s heart .
But the jet is not a smooth stream of matter – bright knots dot its length .
One such knot , dubbed HST - 1 , has changed dramatically in the years since it was first spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999 , at one point brightening by a factor of 90 .
Advertisement
Astronomers regularly observe the knot , which lies about 214 light years from M87 ’s core , at a variety of wavelengths .
Now , Juan Madrid at McMaster University in Canada has analysed seven years ’ worth of near - ultraviolet measurements taken by Hubble .
They dovetail with observations made by other telescopes , such as the Chandra X - ray Observatory , revealing a knot that grew to outshine M87 ’s bright core .
What could be causing this flaring ?
“ We do not know for sure yet , ” says Madrid , adding that there are two broad possibilities .
Flowing stream
One is that material flowing down the jet is ramming into a cloud of dust or gas at the location of HST - 1 and glowing .
The other argues that the magnetic field lines that keep the jet focused in a beam may get squeezed together .
Researchers say that with either explanation , the jet can be thought of as a stream of water – an analogy first suggested by Dan Harris at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
Sometimes the water runs into rocks and sometimes the stream is constricted , creating white water that researchers detect as bright knots .
The white water can churn even more furiously – and the knots glow more brightly – if the stream is swollen after a storm – that is , if more matter is flowing down the jet from the black hole .
Pinched together
If the jet ’s magnetic field lines are getting squeezed together , that would release a lot of energy , mimicking the process that creates solar flares .
“ The magnetic field lines in the sun get separated and then get close together , and when they touch , there ’s a big flare , ” says Madrid .
But what would cause the magnetic field lines to squeeze together at that spot ?
One possibility – previously suggested by Chi Cheung at NASA ’s Goddard Space Flight Center and his colleagues – is that the density of stars and gas within the galaxy changes significantly at that distance , thinning out beyond that point .
So after travelling outwards from the dense inner region of the galaxy , the jet “ hits this discontinuity and it sort of recollimates ; it sort of focuses the beam again , ” Cheung told New Scientist .
More observations at a range of wavelengths may help tease apart exactly what is causing HST - 1 to fluctuate in brightness .
Within a year , for example , Cheung hopes that high - resolution observations taken by an array of radio telescopes will provide a test of his team ’s idea that a change in the galaxy ’s density at HST - 1’s location is the culprit .
‘ Rosetta stone ’
The findings could be a “ Rosetta stone ” to decode the mysteries of more distant galaxies that also fluctuate in brightness , says Cheung .
Many of these galaxies , called blazars , lie too far away for telescopes to resolve knots such as HST - 1 in their jets – flares from any such knots would appear to be coming from the centres of the galaxies instead .
“ If M87 were at a greater distance , then one would be thinking the flaring is happening due to the black hole and not due to the jet , ” Madrid told New Scientist .
Previously , any changes in a blazar ’s brightness have been attributed to a change in how fast matter is falling into the galaxy ’s central black hole , he says .
But since HST - 1 lies more than 200 light years away from M87 ’s black hole , that suggests that some blazar flares may also arise in jets , Madrid says .
Eric Perlman , an astrophysicist at the Florida Institute of Technology who studies M87 ’s jet , agrees : “ This is telling us that some of these flares occur quite far out [ from the black hole ] . ”

Gila River Valley police found an infant 's body inside a partially buried backpack Monday afternoon near State Route 87 outside of Sacaton .
An officer was out on patrol around 12:30 p.m. and was looking through the desert area when he noticed a partially buried bag .
Upon opening the bag he realized there was a baby 's body inside , wrapped in a plastic bed sheet .
The sheet was taped around the infant , said Alia Maisonet , public information officer for police .
The officer immediately called investigators and the baby 's body was sent to the Pima County Medical Examiner 's office .
The gender of the baby is currently unknown .
The officer left the baby wrapped in the sheet .
More information is expected to be available late Tuesday morning , Maisonet said .
Police are seeking help from anyone who may know more about the infant .
The Gila River Valley police can be reached at ( 520 ) 562-4511 .
SAN FRANCISCO —
It sounds like such a simple thing to do : buy some new light bulbs , screw them in , save the planet .
But a lot of people these days are finding the new compact fluorescent bulbs anything but simple .
Consumers who are trying them say they sometimes fail to work , or wear out early .
At best , people discover that using the bulbs requires learning a long list of dos and don’ts .
Take the case of Karen Zuercher and her husband , in San Francisco .
Inspired by watching the movie “ An Inconvenient Truth , ” they decided to swap out nearly every incandescent bulb in their home for energy - saving compact fluorescents .
Instead of having a satisfying green moment , however , they wound up coping with a mess .
“ Here ’s my sad collection of bulbs that did n’t work , ” Ms. Zuercher said the other day as she pulled a cardboard box containing defunct bulbs from her laundry shelf .
When Savana Redding , now 19 , talks of what happened to her in eighth grade , it is clear that the painful memories linger .
She speaks of being embarrassed and fearful and of staying away from school for two months .
And she recalls the “ whispers ” and “ stares ” from others in this small eastern Arizona mining town after she was strip - searched in the nurse ’s office because a vice principal suspected she might be hiding extra-strength ibuprofen in her underwear .
The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear her case .
Its decision , the first to address the issue of strip - searches in schools , will set legal limits , if any , on the authority of school officials to search for drugs or weapons on campus .
If limits on searches are imposed , the school district warns , its ability to keep all drugs out of its schools would be reduced .
Advertisement
In this case , said school district lawyer Matthew Wright , the vice principal was concerned because one student had gotten seriously ill from taking unidentified pills .
“ That was the driving force for him .
If nothing had been done , and this happened to another kid , parents would have been outraged , ” Wright said .
In California and six other states , strip - searches of students are not permitted .
Only once in the past has the high court ruled on a school - search case , and it sounds quaint now .
It arose in 1980 when a New Jersey girl was caught smoking in the bathroom , and the principal searched her purse for cigarettes .
Advertisement
The justices upheld that search because the principal had a specific reason for looking in her purse .
However , they did not say how far officials could go -- and how much of a student ’s privacy could be sacrificed -- to maintain safety at school .
That ’s the issue in Safford Unified School District vs. Redding .
Savana was an honors student , shy and “ nerdy ” when the she began eighth grade at Safford Middle School , she says .
She first learned she was in trouble when Vice Principal Kerry Wilson entered math class one morning and told her to come with him to the office .
Advertisement
He was in search of white pills .
Wilson knew that a boy had gotten sick from pills he obtained at school .
And that morning , another eighth - grader , Marissa Glines , was found with what turned out to be several 400 - milligram ibuprofen pills tucked into a folded school planner .
A few days before , Savana had lent Marissa the folder .
The vice principal also found a small knife , a cigarette and a lighter in it .
When asked where she got the pills , Marissa named Savana Redding .
These “ could only be obtained with a prescription , ” Wilson reported .
Advertisement
Commonly used for headaches or to relieve pain from menstrual cramps , ibuprofen is marketed under brand names including Advil and Motrin with recommend doses of 200 and 400 milligrams .
“ District policy J-3050 strictly prohibits the nonmedical use or possession of any drug on campus , ” Wilson explained later in a sworn statement .
Savana said she knew nothing of the pills in the folder .
“ He asked if he could search my backpack .
I said , ‘ Sure , ’ ” she recalled .
When nothing was found , Wilson sent Savana to the nurse ’s office , where the nurse and an office assistant were told to “ search her clothes ” for the missing pills .
Advertisement
Savana said she kept her head down , embarrassed and afraid she would cry .
After removing her pink T - shirt and black stretch pants , she was told to pull her underwear to the side and to shake so any pills there could be dislodged .
It was “ the most humiliating experience ” of her young life , she said .
“ We did not find any pills during our search of Savana , ” Wilson reported .
When her mother arrived at the school to pick her up , another student called out to her : “ What are you going to do about them strip - searching Savana ? ”

Upset and angry , April Redding said she marched to the principal ’s office , then to the superintendent ’s office nearby .
Both denied at first knowing that a student had been strip - searched .
“ It was wrong .
I did n’t think anything like that could happen to my daughter at school , ” she said , wiping a tear .
She later met with the principal but left , unsatisfied : “ He said you should be happy we did n’t find anything . ”
Contacted at the school recently , Wilson declined to discuss the case , as did other school officials .
Advertisement
When no one apologized , April Redding sued the school district for damages .
Her lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union say the strip - search went far beyond the bounds of reasonableness , especially when there was no imminent danger .
A strip - search can be deeply embarrassing and leave an emotional scar , they add .
So far , however , judges have been almost evenly divided over whether Savana ’s rights were violated .
A federal magistrate in Tucson held that the search was reasonable because the vice principal was relying on the tip from another student .
In a 2 - 1 decision , the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed .
Advertisement
Last year , however , the full 9th Circuit Court took up the case and ruled 6 to 5 for the Reddings .
Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw said the vice principal ’s action defied common sense as well the Constitution .
“ A reasonable school official , seeking to protect the students in his charge , does not subject a 13 - year - old girl to a traumatic search to ‘ protect ’ her from the danger of Advil , ” she wrote .
“ A school is not a prison .
The students are not inmates , ” she added , noting that juvenile prisoners are given more rights than were given Savana .
Advertisement
Two of the dissenters agreed the search was unreasonable , but they said the officials should be shielded from suits because the law has been unclear .
The three other dissenters , including Chief Judge Alex Kozinski , said the search was reasonable based on what Wilson knew at the time .
Last fall , the school district appealed to the Supreme Court , saying it “ finds itself on the front lines of the decades - long war against drug abuse among students . ”
The justices voted in January to hear the case , a good sign for the school district .
In recent years , national school officials say they have heard of only a few instances of strip - searches at schools .

After the search , Savana refused to return to the middle school .
She did not want to be in the presence of the nurse or the office assistant who she said humiliated her .
She went to an alternative high school in Safford but dropped out before graduating .
She is taking psychology classes at nearby Eastern Arizona College .
She and her mother plan to travel to Washington to hear her case argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday .
For Savana , it will be her first trip on an airplane .

SHEIKH JANA , Pakistan —
The Pakistani forces air - dropped commandos into the main town in Buner on Wednesday and quickly retook control of it from Taliban militants who flooded into the area last week , the military said .
But the district was far from recaptured and the military may be in for a hard fight .
Villagers who fled the fighting and made it to this village on the plains said the military was bombing in Buner with fighter jets and firing rockets from helicopter gunships as Pakistani troops battled the Taliban on the ground for a second day .
Despite a curfew imposed by both the Taliban and the army , one villager , Walayat Khan , a cowherd in his 20s who did not know his exact age , said everyone was trying to get out of the district .
Some people were leaving on foot , as few vehicles were available .
Those who left were forced to use back roads since the Taliban and military forces had blocked the main arteries leading into and out of Buner .
Ms Saberi has appealed against her sentence
An American - Iranian reporter jailed by Tehran for eight years on charges of espionage has gone on hunger strike , her father has said .
Reza Saberi said his daughter Roxana told him she had stopped eating five days ago .
" I 'm very worried , " he told Reuters news agency .
Ms Saberi was convicted of being an American spy and sentenced behind closed doors by the Revolutionary Court in Tehran a week ago .
She has become somewhat of a cause celebre , with US President Barack Obama expressing dismay at her conviction and rallies called to demand her release .
Mr Obama and Ms Saberi 's family have insisted she is not a spy .
But Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has refused to intervene , insisting the courts acted independently and that she will be accorded her full rights .
Ms Saberi has lodged an appeal , which Iranian authorities say will be heard fairly and quickly .
Kevin Shutt , 53 , moved into a tent city near St. Petersburg , Fla. , in March .
He was laid off from his job waiting tables and then was kicked out of his apartment .
TENT DWELLERS SPEAK TENT DWELLERS SPEAK Enlarge By Rod E. Millington , for USA TODAY From left , volunteers Jim Butruff , Kevin Clinton and Jimmy Hubert assemble 6 - by - 8 - foot sheds at Pinellas Hope near St. Petersburg , Fla .
PINELLAS COUNTY , Fla .  Jim Marshall recalls everything about that beautiful fall day .
The temperature was about 70 degrees on Nov. 19 , the sky was " totally blue , " and the laughter from a martini bar drifted into the St. Petersburg park where Marshall , 39 , sat contemplating his first day of homelessness .
PHOTOS : Tent cities help victims of a bad economy " I was thinking , ' That was me at one point , ' " he says of the revelers .
" Now I 'm thinking , ' Where am I going to sleep tonight ?
Where do I eat ?
Where do I shower ? ' "
The unemployed Detroit autoworker moved to Florida last year hoping he'd have better luck finding a job .
He did n't , and he spent three months sleeping on sidewalks before landing in a tent city in Pinellas County , north of St. Petersburg , on Feb. 26 .
Marshall is among a growing number of the economic homeless , a term for those newly displaced by layoffs , foreclosures or other financial troubles caused by the recession .
They differ from the chronic homeless , the longtime street residents who often suffer from mental illness , drug abuse or alcoholism .
For the economic homeless , the American ideal that education and hard work lead to a comfortable middle - class life has slipped out of reach .
They 're packing into motels , parking lots and tent cities , alternately distressed and hopeful , searching for work and praying their fortunes will change .
" My parents always taught me to work hard in school , graduate high school , go to college , get a degree and you 'll do fine .
You 'll do better than your parents ' generation , " Marshall says .
" I did all those things . …
For a while , I did have that good life , but nowadays that 's not the reality . "
Tent cities and shelters from California to Massachusetts report growing demand from the newly homeless .
The National Alliance to End Homelessness predicted in January that the recession would force 1.5 million more people into homelessness over the next two years .
Already , " tens of thousands " have lost their homes , Alliance President Nan Roman says .
The $ 1.5 billion in new federal stimulus funds for homelessness prevention will help people pay rent , utility bills , moving costs or security deposits , she says , but it wo n't be enough .
" We 're hearing from shelter providers that the shelters are overflowing , filled to capacity , " says Ellen Bassuk , president of the National Center on Family Homelessness .
" The number of families on the streets has dramatically increased . " ' A change in the population ' Pinellas Hope , the tent city run by Catholic Charities here since December 2007 , has been largely for the chronically homeless , some of whom suffer from mental illness or struggle with drugs or alcohol .
About 20 % of its 240 residents became homeless recently because of the economic downturn , says Frank Murphy , president of Catholic Charities , Diocese of St. Petersburg .
" We 're seeing a change in the population . …
We 're seeing a lot more that are just plain losing their jobs and their homes , " says Sheila Lopez , chief operating officer of the charity .
" A lot are either job - ready or working but have lost their home because they were laid off , or their apartment , and now can't go to work because they 're not shaven , they 're not clean , they 're living in a car , or they 're living on the street . "
The charity plans to expand the tent city and build an encampment in a neighboring county , an idea that has drawn objections from nearby homeowners and businesses .
Communities elsewhere are facing similar pressures : • In Massachusetts , a record number of homeless families need emergency shelter , says Robyn Frost , executive director of the Massachusetts Coalition for the Homeless .
In mid-April , there were 2,763 families in shelters , including 655 in motels because the shelters were full , an increase of 36 % since July , she says .
" We have a high number of foreclosure properties , and many of them are multifamily apartments , " Frost says .
" We were seeing a great number of families being displaced . " •
Reno officials shut down a tent city in October after making more shelter space available , but new encampments are popping up along the Truckee River and elsewhere , says Kelly Marschall of the Reno Area Alliance for the Homeless .
The homeless include " a startling number of first - time homeless , " she says .
" We asked them what industries they were involved in .
The majority were talking about construction , the housing industry , real estate .
There was a direct correlation to the housing market crash . "
• In Santa Barbara , Calif. , 84 men and women sleep in their cars , trucks or recreational vehicles in 17 parking lots around the city , says Jason Johnson with the New Beginnings Counseling Center , which runs the RV Safe Parking Program .
The city , which allows the use of three municipal lots at night , supports the program , says city parking superintendent Victor Garza .
Last May , there were 58 participants and no waiting list .
Now 40 people are waiting .
" People 's last refuge has become their vehicle , " Johnson says .
Objections by residents Pinellas Hope in Florida looks like a cookie - cutter subdivision , except that the orderly rows are of tents , not houses .
Besides 250 tents , all of similar size , shape and color , there are 15 wooden sheds , 6 feet by 8 feet , that Catholic Charities built as shelters .
The charity plans to reduce the number of tents to 150 and erect 100 sheds , which are more durable , and build as many as 80 permanent studio apartments on the property , Murphy says .
His group also wants to open a campground for 240 homeless people in neighboring Hillsborough County , he says , primarily using wooden sheds .
Unlike Pinellas Hope , which does n't border residential neighborhoods , the Hillsborough County parcel is across the street from a tidy 325 - home subdivision called East Lake Park .
There , opponents of the tent city have a website : www.stoptentcity.com.
Hal and Cindy Hart are raising three grandchildren in their home on the lake .
The kids , 4 to 13 , fish for bass , ride their bikes to friends ' houses and attend neighborhood parties .
The Harts fear that large numbers of homeless people , some with addictions and criminal backgrounds , would loiter in the neighborhood .
" We will not be able to let our grandchildren ride their bikes outside without constant supervision , " says Hal Hart , 52 , a paralegal .
The Harts agree that the homeless population needs services , but they think the emphasis should be on programs that will help families , not single adults .
Murphy says the diocese wants to address the neighbors ' concerns and has lowered the number of proposed occupants from 500 .
' A temporary situation ' Pinellas Hope , which has a waiting list of about 150 people , is attracting a growing stream of homeless men , women and couples .
Families with children are sent to area shelters .
New arrivals must agree to rules , such as not using drugs or alcohol , and perform chores , Lopez says .
They get mats , sleeping bags , toiletries , flip - flops for showers and lockable boxes in their tents to store valuables .
Within one week , they must make a plan describing how they will work their way out of homelessness .
Residents are expected to move on within five months , but some stay longer .
Campers have access to trailers with bathrooms , showers , computers , washers and dryers and a room of donated clothes .
They get a free bus pass the first month and advice on writing résumés .
By day , some leave camp to look for work or ride the bus to pass the time .
Others stay , watching TV in large communal tents , doing laundry or playing Monopoly .
At night , an off - duty police officer patrols the camp , which is governed by curfews : 10:30 p.m. on weeknights and midnight Fridays and Saturdays .
The camp bustles at dinnertime , when everyone gathers for a hot meal provided by churches and other organizations .
A year ago , there were 5,500 homeless people in Pinellas County , says St. Petersburg police officer Richard Linkiewicz , a homeless - outreach officer .
This year , there are 7,500 , including 1,300 children in homeless families , he says .
Many of the newly homeless worked in construction , a booming industry in Florida before the economic bust , he says .
David Grondin , 48 , moved in on Feb. 7 and stayed for two months .
A union carpenter , he graduated from the University of South Florida in 1999 with a bachelor 's degree in fine arts .
He struggled as carpentry work and odd jobs disappeared .
When his 1992 Saturn died in August , he could no longer get to jobs far from public transportation routes .
Frustrated by his inability to find a job in Florida , last month Grondin took a bus to Portland , Maine , where he 's staying with friends and looking for carpentry work .
" I was definitely middle class , " he says .
" I had a car .
I got a paycheck every week . "
Kevin Shutt , 53 , moved into Pinellas Hope in March after he was laid off from his job waiting tables because diners " stopped coming through the doors , " he says .
Shutt has decorated his tent with house plants , including a ficus tree his mother gave him nearly 30 years ago , and pinned Tampa Bay Rays and Buccaneers jerseys to the inside walls .
He tearfully recounts how he got kicked out of his apartment by a roommate when he could n't come up with the rent .
A former homeowner who made Caesar salads tableside at restaurants , now he can't get a job at Taco Bell , he says .
" This is the first time in my life I ever dreamed about living in a tent , " he says .
An optimist by nature , Shutt vows that his stay will be short .
He has filled out more than 175 job applications and occasionally works for a friend doing canvas work on boats .
" This is a temporary situation , " he says .
A diminished outlook Marshall , the former autoworker , has an associate 's degree in electronic engineering and is less encouraged .
He remembers a comfortable life in Michigan , where he worked in automotive testing , owned a brick ranch - style home , made up to $ 50,000 a year and played in softball leagues .
Companies he worked for started losing contracts a few years ago , and eventually the work dried up , he says .
He sold his house and moved into an apartment , but by 2007 he could n't pay the rent .
He came to Florida in August , thinking the job market was better .
But he could n't pay the rent here , either .
At Pinellas Hope , Marshall searches online job sites or takes the bus to apply for work at McDonald 's , factories and Wal - Mart .
He gets $ 45 a week selling his blood plasma .
" I have my résumé online .
I go door to door .
I make phone calls , " he says .
" I have not received one phone call , one e-mail .
I thought with my experience and my degree , it would n't be this difficult . "
Marshall feels ill at ease in the camp and has trouble sleeping , and not just because of the armadillos that burrow under his tent .
" I 'm scared , " he says .
" If I ca n't find a job , where do I go next ? "
At this point , he has lowered his expectations .
" I do n't expect ever to make $ 50,000 a year working in the auto industry , but just enough to survive , have my own place , buy my own food , my own clothes , " he says .
" What every American would expect . "

The busy Java developer 's guide to Scala Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
About this series Ted Neward dives into the Scala programming language and takes you along with him .
In this developerWorks series , you 'll learn what all the recent hype is about and see some of Scala 's linguistic capabilities in action .
Scala code and Java ™ code will be shown side by side wherever comparison is relevant , but ( as you 'll discover ) many things in Scala have no direct correlation to anything you 've found in Java — and therein lies much of Scala 's charm !
After all , if Java could do it , why bother learning Scala ?
In the last article , I talked about the importance of building concurrent code ( whether it's in Scala or not ) and some of the problems and issues facing developers in doing so , including not locking too much , not locking too little , avoiding deadlocks , avoiding spinning up too many threads , and so on .
Quite a depressing list .
Not being one to leave things in such a heavy state of despair , I then began to explore with you some of Scala 's concurrency constructs , beginning with the basic use of the Java language 's concurrency libraries directly from within Scala , then moving on to the MailBox type from the Scala API .
And while both approaches are certainly viable , that 's not where the real " hotness " of Scala and concurrency comes from .
Enter Scala actors ... stage left .
What 's an " actor " ?
An " actors " implementation , essentially speaking , is an approach that uses message - passing between executing entities known as actors to coordinate work ( notice the intentional refusal to use words like " process , " " thread , " or " machine " ) .
If this sounds vaguely like an RPC mechanism , it is and it is n't .
Where an RPC call ( like a Java RMI call ) will block at the caller side until the server side has completed its processing and sent back some kind of response ( return value or exception ) , a message - passing approach deliberately does not block the caller , thus neatly avoiding the chance of deadlock .
In and of itself , simply passing messages around does n't avoid all the problems of concurrency - incorrect code .
In addition , this approach also fosters a " share - nothing " style of programming in which different actors have no access to shared data structures ( which incidentally helps promote the encapsulation of whether that actor is local to this JVM or all the way across the world ) — this completely eliminates the need for synchronization .
After all , as we 've seen before , if there is nothing shared , there is nothing we need to synchronize concurrent execution against .
This is hardly a formal description of the actors model and undoubtedly those with a more formal background in computer science will find all kinds of ways that this description fails to capture the full details of actors .
But for the purposes of this article , it serves as a good basis .
More detailed and formal descriptions can be found on the Web , including several academic papers that detail the concepts behind actors ( I 'll leave it to your discretion to catch up on these later ) .
For now , we 're ready to take a look at the Scala actors API .
The Scala actors
Fundamentally , working with actors is not that difficult , the easiest being to simply create an actor using the actor method of the Actor class , as shown in Listing 1 :
Listing 1 . And ... action !
import scala.actors ._ , Actor . _ package com.tedneward.scalaexamples.scala.V4 { object Actor1 { def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) = { val badActor = actor { receive { case msg => System.out.println(msg ) } } badActor !
" Do ya feel lucky , punk ? " } } }
A couple of things are happening here simultaneously .
First , we import the Scala Actors library from its self - named package , and then we import the members of the Actor class from that library directly ; this second step is n't strictly necessary because we could go ahead and use Actor.actor instead of actor in the code later , but doing it this way gives the impression that actor is a built - in construct of the language and ( in some opinions ) makes the code more readable .
The next step is to create the actor itself , using the actor method , which takes a block of code as a parameter .
In this case , the block of code executes a simple receive , which we 'll get to in a second .
The result is an actor , stored into a value reference , ready for use .
Remember that actors do n't use methods for communication , but messages .
It may be a bit counterintuitive when I say that the next line , using the ! , is actually a method ( in reality ) that sends a message ( figuratively ) to the badActor .
Under the hood , buried deeply in the Actor trait , is another of those MailBox elements that we looked at last time ; the !
method takes the passed parameter ( in this case , a String ) , dumps it into the mailbox , and returns immediately .
Once the message has been delivered to the actor , the actor processes the message by invoking its receive method , which does exactly as its name implies — it pulls the first available message from the mailbox and delivers it to an implicit pattern - matching block .
Note that because you do n't specify a type for the pattern - matched case , anything will match and the message is bound to the msg name ( which you need in order to print it ) .
Take careful note of the fact that there is n't any type restrictions on the type that can be sent — you 're not restricted to just strings as the previous example might imply .
In fact , frequently , actors - based designs use Scala case classes to convey the actual message itself , providing both an implicit " command " or " action " to execute based on the type with the parameters / members of the case class acting as the parameters or data to the action .
For example , suppose you want the actor to carry out a couple of different actions in response to messages sent ; the new implementation would look something similar to Listing 2 :
Listing 2 .
Hey , I 'm a director !
object Actor2 { case class Speak ( line : String ) ; case class Gesture ( bodyPart : String , action : String ) ; case class NegotiateNewContract ; def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) = { val badActor = actor { receive { case NegotiateNewContract => System.out.println
( " I wo n't do it for less than $ 1 million ! " ) case Speak ( line ) => System.out.println( line ) case Gesture ( bodyPart , action ) => System.out.println ( " ( " + action + " s " + bodyPart + " ) " ) case _ => System.out.println
( " Huh ?
I 'll be in my trailer . " ) } } badActor !
NegotiateNewContract badActor !
Speak ( " Do ya feel lucky , punk ? " ) badActor !
Gesture ( " face " , " grimaces " ) badActor !
Speak ( " Well , do ya ? " ) } }
So far , all is well and good , but when this runs , only the new contract is negotiated ; after that , the JVM terminates .
At first , it may feel like the spawned thread is n't responding to the messages quickly enough , but remember , in an actors model , you do n't deal with threads , per se , just message passing .
Instead , the problem here is much more straightforward :
One receive begets one message , so the fact that you 've queued up multiple messages does n't matter because there 's only been one receive and only one message delivered , regardless of how many might be queued up waiting for processing .
Fixing this requires the following changes to the code , shown in Listing 3 :
Put the receive block inside of a near - infinite loop .
block inside of a near - infinite loop .
Create a new case class to indicate when the whole thing is done processing .
Listing 3 . Now I 'm a much better director !
object Actor2 { case class Speak ( line : String ) ; case class Gesture ( bodyPart : String , action : String ) ; case class NegotiateNewContract ; case class ThatsAWrap ; def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) = { val badActor = actor { var done = false while (! done ) { receive { case NegotiateNewContract => System.out.println
( " I wo n't do it for less than $ 1 million ! " ) case Speak ( line ) => System.out.println( line ) case Gesture ( bodyPart , action ) => System.out.println ( " ( " + action + " s " + bodyPart + " ) " ) case ThatsAWrap => System.out.println
( " Great cast party , everybody !
See ya ! " ) done = true case _ => System.out.println
( " Huh ?
I 'll be in my trailer . " ) } } } badActor !
NegotiateNewContract badActor !
Speak ( " Do ya feel lucky , punk ? " ) badActor !
Gesture ( " face " , " grimaces " ) badActor !
Speak ( " Well , do ya ? " ) badActor !
ThatsAWrap } }
Whoever said making a movie is hard clearly did n't have Scala actors in the cast .
Acting concurrently
One thing that 's not apparent from this code is where the concurrency ( if any ) is coming from — from what I 've shown you so far , this could very well be another synchronous form of method calls and you would n't be able to tell the difference .
( Technically , you could infer that there 's some concurrency going on from the second example before I put the near - infinite loop in , but that 's more an accidental proof and clearly not an iron - clad one . )
To prove that some threads are underneath all of this , take a deeper look at the earlier example :
Listing 4 . I 'm ready for my close - up , Mr. DeMille
object Actor3 { case class Speak ( line : String ) ; case class Gesture ( bodyPart : String , action : String ) ; case class NegotiateNewContract ; case class ThatsAWrap ; def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) = { def ct = " Thread " + Thread.currentThread ( ) .getName( ) + " : " val badActor = actor { var done = false while (! done ) { receive { case NegotiateNewContract => System.out.println(ct +
" I wo n't do it for less than $ 1 million ! " ) case Speak ( line ) => System.out.println ( ct + line ) case Gesture ( bodyPart , action ) => System.out.println(ct + " ( " + action + " s " + bodyPart + " ) " ) case ThatsAWrap => System.out.println(ct +
" Great cast party , everybody !
See ya ! " ) done = true case _ => System.out.println(ct +
" Huh ?
I 'll be in my trailer . " ) } } } System.out.println(ct + " Negotiating ... " ) badActor !
NegotiateNewContract System.out.println(ct + " Speaking ... " ) badActor !
Speak ( " Do ya feel lucky , punk ? " )
System.out.println(ct + " Gesturing ... " ) badActor !
Gesture ( " face " , " grimaces " ) System.out.println(ct +
" Speaking again ... " ) badActor !
Speak ( " Well , do ya ? " )
System.out.println(ct + " Wrapping up " ) badActor !
ThatsAWrap } }
When this new example runs , it becomes pretty clear that two different threads are involved :
The main thread ( the same one that kicks every Java main off )
thread ( the same one that kicks every Java off )
The Thread - 2 thread , which was spun off by the Scala Actors library under the hood
So yes , fundamentally we have always been doing multithreaded execution when we fired up that first actor .
But getting used to this new model of execution can be a bit awkward , if only because it represents an entirely different way of thinking about concurrency .
For example , consider the Producer / Consumer model from the last article .
There was a fair amount of code there , particularly in the Drop class , leaving us with a pretty clear view of what was going on as the threads interacted with one another and with the monitors required to keep everything in sync .
I repeat the V3 code from last article here for reference :
Listing 5 . ProdConSample , v3 ( Scala )
package com.tedneward.scalaexamples.scala.V3 { import concurrent .MailBox import concurrent.ops ._ object ProdConSample { class Drop { private val m = new MailBox ( ) private case class Empty ( ) private case class Full( x : String ) m send Empty ( ) // initialization def put( msg : String ) : Unit = { m receive { case Empty ( ) => m send Full ( msg ) } } def take ( ) : String = { m receive { case Full ( msg ) => m send Empty ( ) ; msg } } } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { // Create Drop val drop = new Drop ( ) // Spawn Producer spawn { val importantInfo : Array [ String ] = Array ( " Mares eat oats " , " Does eat oats " , " Little lambs eat ivy " , " A kid will eat ivy too " ) ; importantInfo.foreach(( msg ) => drop.put( msg ) ) drop.put ( " DONE " ) } // Spawn Consumer spawn { var message = drop. take ( ) while ( message != " DONE " ) { System.out.format( " MESSAGE RECEIVED : %s%n " , message ) message = drop. take ( ) } } } } }
While it 's interesting to see how Scala has simplified parts of that code , in truth it 's not really all that different conceptually from the original Java version .
But now let 's look at what an actor - based version of the Producer / Consumer example might look like if you pared it down to its barest essentials :
Listing 6 . Take 1 . And ... Action !
Produce !
Consume !
object ProdConSample1 { case class Message ( msg : String ) def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) :
Unit = { val consumer = actor { var done = false while (! done ) { receive { case msg => System.out.println ( " Received message ! -> " + msg ) done = ( msg == " DONE " ) } } } consumer !
" Mares eat oats " consumer !
" Does eat oats " consumer !
" Little lambs eat ivy " consumer !
" Kids eat ivy too " consumer !
" DONE " } }
This first version certainly wins in terms of brevity and in some situations , maybe does all that needs to be done , but running the code and comparing it against the earlier versions reveals an important difference — the actors - based version is a multiplace buffer , not a single - slot drop like we 'd been working with before .
To some , this may seem like an enhancement , not a drawback , but let 's make sure to compare like to like — let 's turn around and create an actors - based version of the Drop in which each call to put ( ) must be balanced by a call to take ( ) .
Fortunately , the Scala Actors library can mimic this functionality pretty easily .
Fundamentally , you want the Producer to block until the Consumer has received the message ; that 's most easily handled by having the Producer block until it receives an acknowledgement from the Consumer that the message has been received .
In one sense , this is what the previous monitor - based code is doing using the monitor around the lock object to do that signaling .
The easiest way to do this in the Scala Actors library is to use the !?
method instead of the !
method ( which blocks until an acknowledgement is received ) .
( In case you 're curious , in the Scala Actors implementation , every Java thread is already an actor so the reply is coming to the mailbox that 's implicitly associated with the main thread . )
This means that the consumer needs to send some kind of acknowledgement ; it does this using the reply method that it implicitly inherits ( along with the receive method ) , as shown in Listing 7 :
Listing 7 . Take 2 ... Action !
object ProdConSample2 { case class Message ( msg : String ) def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) :
Unit = { val consumer = actor { var done = false while (! done ) { receive { case msg => System.out.println ( " Received message ! -> " + msg ) done = ( msg == " DONE " ) reply ( " RECEIVED " ) } } } System.out.println ( " Sending .... " ) consumer !?
" Mares eat oats " System.out.
println ( " Sending .... " ) consumer !?
" Does eat oats " System.out.
println ( " Sending .... " ) consumer !?
" Little lambs eat ivy " System.out.
println ( " Sending .... " ) consumer !?
" Kids eat ivy too " System.out.println ( " Sending .... " ) consumer !?
" DONE " } }
Or , if you prefer the version that uses spawn to kick off the Producer into a separate thread from main ( ) ( which is most closely mirroring the original ) , it might look like Listing 8 :
Listing 8 . Take 4 ... Action !
object ProdConSampleUsingSpawn { import concurrent.ops ._ def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { //
Spawn Consumer val consumer = actor { var done = false while (! done ) { receive { case msg => System.out.println ( " MESSAGE RECEIVED : " + msg ) done = ( msg == " DONE " ) reply ( " RECEIVED " ) } } } // Spawn Producer spawn { val importantInfo : Array [ String ] = Array ( " Mares eat oats " , " Does eat oats " , " Little lambs eat ivy " , " A kid will eat ivy too " , " DONE " ) ; importantInfo.foreach ( ( msg ) => consumer !? msg ) } } }
Whichever way you look at it , the actors - based version is a lot simpler than the original ... as long as the reader can keep the actors and the implicit mailboxes straight .
This is n't a trivial point .
The actors model seriously upends the whole process of thinking about concurrency and thread - safety ; it changes from a model where we focus on the shared data structures ( data concurrency ) to a model where we focus on the structure of the code itself acting on the data ( task concurrency ) and sharing as little of the data as possible .
Notice that inversion in the sample Producer / Consumer in the previous code .
In the previous examples , the concurrency was explicitly written around the Drop class ( the bounded buffer ) .
In this version in this article , the Drop does n't even make an appearance and the focus remains on the two actors ( threads ) and their interaction via shared - nothing messages .
Naturally , it 's still possible to build data - centric concurrency constructs with actors ; you just have to take a slightly different approach to it .
Consider this simple " counter " object that uses actor messages to convey the " increment " and " get " operations , as shown in Listing 9 :
Listing 9 . Take 5 ... Count !
object CountingSample { case class
Incr case class Value ( sender : Actor ) case class Lock ( sender : Actor ) case class UnLock ( value : Int ) class Counter extends Actor { override def act ( ) : Unit = loop ( 0 ) def loop ( value : int ) : Unit = { receive { case Incr ( ) => loop ( value + 1 ) case Value(a ) => a ! value ; loop ( value ) case Lock ( a ) => a ! value receive { case UnLock ( v ) => loop ( v ) } case _ => loop ( value ) } } } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { val counter = new Counter counter. start ( ) counter !
Incr ( ) counter !
Incr ( ) counter !
Incr ( ) counter !
Value ( self ) receive { case cvalue => Console.println( cvalue ) } counter !
Incr ( ) counter !
Incr ( ) counter !
Value ( self ) receive { case cvalue => Console.println( cvalue ) } } }
Or to be more inline with the thrust of the Producer / Consumer example , Listing 10 is a version of Drop that uses actors internally ( probably in order to allow other Java classes to use the Drop without having to worry about how to call the actors methods directly ) :
Listing 10 .
Drop , meet actors
object ActorDropSample { class Drop { private case class Put( x : String ) private case object
Take private case object Stop private val buffer = actor { var data = " " loop { react { case Put( x ) if data == " " => data = x ; reply ( ) case Take if data != " " => val r = data ; data = " " ; reply ( r ) case Stop => reply ( ) ; exit ( " stopped " ) } } } def put( x : String ) { buffer !?
Put ( x ) } def take ( ) : String = ( buffer !? Take ) .asInstanceOf [ String ] def stop ( ) { buffer !?
Stop } } def main ( args : Array [ String ] ) : Unit = { import concurrent.ops ._ // Create Drop val drop = new Drop ( ) // Spawn Producer spawn { val importantInfo : Array [ String ] = Array ( " Mares eat oats " , " Does eat oats " , " Little lambs eat ivy " , " A kid will eat ivy too " ) ; importantInfo.foreach( ( msg ) => { drop.put ( msg ) } ) drop.put ( " DONE " ) } // Spawn Consumer spawn { var message = drop. take ( ) while ( message != " DONE " ) { System.out.format( " MESSAGE RECEIVED : %s%n " , message ) message = drop. take ( ) } drop.stop ( ) } } }
As you can see , it requires more code ( and additional threads because each actor acts inside of a thread pool ) , but this version is API - equivalent to the versions built before , putting all of the concurrency concerns inside of the Drop class where Java developers traditionally expect it to be .
There 's more to actors , too .
In cases such as inside of massively scaled systems , having each actor backed by a Java thread is going to be too heavy and wasteful , particularly if each actor is going to spend more of its time waiting than processing .
In those situations , an event - based actor might be appropriate ; it effectively sits inside of a closure that captures the rest of the actor 's actions .
That is , a block of code ( function ) that now does n't have to be represented via thread state and registers and such .
The closure is fired once a message comes in to the actor ( this obviously requires an active thread ) , so the closure borrows an active thread for the period of its activity , then either terminates or puts itself into another " wait " state by calling back into itself , effectively releasing the thread for other uses .
( See the Haller / Odersky papers in the Related topics . )
Within the Scala Actors library , this is done with the react method instead of receive as I 've shown in this article .
The key to using react is that formally react can't return so that the implementation inside the react has to re-invoke the block of code containing the react block .
This is where the loop construct comes in handy , creating a near - infinite loop ( as its name implies ) .
This means that the Drop implementation in Listing 10 could actually operate purely by borrowing callers ' threads , reducing the number of threads required to carry out all the operations required .
( In practice , I 've never seen this happen with a trivial example so I guess we 'll have to take the Scala designers ' word for it . )
In some cases , you may choose to inherit from the base Actor trait ( in which case the act method has to be defined or the class remains abstract ) in order to create a new class that implicitly acts as an actor .
Having said that , that idea is falling out of favor within the Scala community ; in general , the approach I sketched out ( using the actor method from the Actor object ) is the preferred way to create a new actor .
Conclusion
Because programming in actors demands a slightly different style than programming in " traditional " objects , there are a couple of things to keep in mind when working with actors .
First , remember that much of the power of actors comes from the message - passing style rather than the blocking - invocation style that characterizes the rest of the imperative programming world .
( Interestingly , object - oriented languages that use message passing as a core principle are out there .
Two of the most widely - recognized are Objective - C and Smalltalk , and there is also a newcomer to the block , Ioke , created by fellow ThoughtWorker Ola Bini . )
If you create classes that extend Actor directly or indirectly , try to ensure that all invocations against said objects are done through message passing .
Second , because messages can be delivered at any given point in time ( and more importantly ) may come with considerable delay between sending and receiving , take care to make sure that messages carry all the state they might need in order to be handled correctly .
This approach will result in :
Making the code easier to understand ( because the message will be carrying all the state it needs to process )
Reducing the chance that the actor will be accessing shared state someplace else , thus reducing the chance of deadlock or other concurrency nightmare
Third , although this probably should be somewhat obvious in the context of this conversation , it bears mentioning that actors should n't block .
At its heart , blocking is what causes deadlock ; the more your code can avoid blocking , the more opportunities for deadlock you 'll avoid .
Interestingly enough , if you 're familiar with the Java Message Service ( JMS ) API , you 'll find a strong sense of parallels in these recommendations I 'm making — after all , the actors message - passing style is just messages being passed between entities ( like JMS message passing is just messages being passed between entities ) .
The differences are that JMS messages tend to be larger scale and operate at the level of tiers and processes and actors messages tend to be smaller in scale and operate at the level of objects and threads .
If you get JMS , you 'll get actors .
Actors are n't a panacea to fix every concurrency problem your code might run into , but they definitely present a new way of modeling your application or library code , using constructs that look and act in a fairly simple and straightforward manner .
That does n't mean they 'll always behave the way you expect , but some of that behavior is to be expected — after all , objects probably did n't behave the way you expected the first time you ran into them .
That 's it for this installment ; until next time , enjoy !

My , oh my , where would we be without a free press in Israel ?
Haaretz ’s Aluf Benn today reinforces the case I made earlier for Obama to keep Netanyahu on a tight leash concerning Iran .
First , he reports , Netanyahu continues to talk up a frenzy of public expectation in Israel that leads only to military action .
“ These are not regular times .
The danger is hurtling toward us .
The real danger in underestimating the threat , ” Netanyahu said on Iran .
“ My job is first and foremost to ensure the future of the state of Israel … the leadership ’s job is to eliminate the danger .
Who will eliminate it ?
It is us or no one . ”
In other words , Israel cannot rely on the Obama Administration to bomb Iran ( true ) , so Israel will have to do the job itself .
As I noted in my last piece , Benn has previously pointed out that Netanyahu is creating a massive tide of public hysteria that will demand action in the face of this grave and gathering “ threat ” — bogus as it is .
And he also makes clear , in a second piece , that it ’s not just Netanyahu ; Defense Minister Ehud Barak is with him every step of the way — despite the fact that Barak has made clear he believes that Iran does not pose an existential threat to Israel .
( Then again , as Barak showed over the Camp David debacle in 2000 , his cynicism knows no boundaries … )
But the real gem in Benn ’s comment is his explanation of how Israel will go about launching an attack — and suggests that it wo n’t look anything like the 1981 bombing of Iraq ’s Osirak reactor , when the public wakes up one morning to hear that the job ’s been done .
Instead , writes Benn , Israel might instead seek to provoke a conflict in Lebanon that draws in Iran , perhaps by making “ a strike against a valuable target for the Iranian regime which leads Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and Ahmadinejad to take action against ‘ the Zionist regime . ’
If Iran attacks Israel first , the element of surprise will be lost , but then Israel ’s strike against the nuclear installations will be considered self - defense . ”
So , if we wake up one morning and read , for example , that Israel has assassinated Hizballah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , we ’ll understand just how that particular provocation fits into Israel ’s game plan .
Seems like if the Obama Administration wants to avoid a war , it may have to send Leon Panetta back , this time with a warning to refrain from trying to assassinate Nasrallah .
( Somehow , I ca n’t see that happening … )
On these shores , however , Netanyahu ’s efforts to churn up cataclysmic hysteria are not passing without challenge .
In October 2007 , I saluted Fareed Zakaria for courageously challenging the media ’s hysterical ( although largely unconscious ) stampede to war with Iran .
Back then , I wrote :
Fareed Zakaria deserves a medal for breaking with the mainstream media pack to slap down , with the requisite rudeness , the hysteria over Iran being manufactured by the neocons , opportunist Israeli politicians and the Bush Administration .
Perhaps stung by having participated in a secret Bush Administration policy discussion to help shape the Iraq war policy before the invasion , Zakaria is acting with honor now to prevent another disaster .
This while much of the rest of the media is futzing around asking the wrong questions on Iran and getting the answers that only the wrong questions can produce .
So , I ’m pleased to see Zakaria is at it again .
In his latest Newsweek column , he makes a cool , reasoned case that :
1. Iran is n’t seeking a bomb ; it ’s seeking a civilian nuclear program with the “ breakout capacity ” to build nuclear weapons , which gives it considerable leverage without actually weaponizing nuclear materiel ;
2. Iran is not an apocalyptic regime ; on the contrary , it has behaved in a very rational , national - interests based manner , even aligning with the U.S. where that suited its interests ( Afghanistan and Iraq ) .
Its leaders clearly do n’t believe the world is about to end , and there ’s no reason to believe they ’ll act on that basis .
3. Serious negotiations that seek to accomodate both sides basic interests have yet to be tried , and they ’re a jolly good idea .
Indeed , as Flynt Leverett and Hilary Mann Leverett argue , the Obama Administration ’s diplomatic efforts appear to Iran as if they ’re designed to fail — indeed , they make clear , failure of diplomacy is written into the script of Obama ’s State Department Iran policy director , Dennis Ross .
They write :
Mr. Ross has long been an advocate of what he describes as an “ engagement with pressure ” strategy toward Tehran , meaning that the United States should project a willingness to negotiate with Iran largely to elicit broader regional and international support for intensifying economic pressure on the Islamic Republic .
In conversations with Mr. Ross before Mr. Obama ’s election , we asked him if he really believed that engage - with - pressure would bring concessions from Iran .
He forthrightly acknowledged that this was unlikely .
Why , then , was he advocating a diplomatic course that , in his judgment , would probably fail ?
Because , he told us , if Iran continued to expand its nuclear fuel program , at some point in the next couple of years President Bush ’s successor would need to order military strikes against Iranian nuclear targets .
Citing past “ diplomacy ” would be necessary for that president to claim any military action was legitimate .
Iranian officials are fully aware of Mr. Ross ’s views — and are increasingly suspicious that he is determined that the Obama administration make , as one senior Iranian diplomat said to us , “ an offer we ca n’t accept , ” simply to gain international support for coercive action .
They make clear that many in the Obama Administration are serious about rapprochement with Iran as the path to resolving the nuclear standoff .
But Israel , and its most hawkish ally in the Administration ( Ross ) , may be on course towards a different outcome .

April 22 , 2009 -- Iqbal Bano , the subcontinent ’s beloved ghazal singer , born in India and trained in the Dilli Gharana by the legendary Ustad Chand Khan , passed away on April 21 , 2009 , in Lahore at the age of 74 .
In the hearts of all who knew and loved her music is the memory of that day : when , in protest against the jailing of the subcontinent ’s foremost left poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz by Pakistan 's dictator General Zia-ul Haq , she sang Faiz ’s immortal song ``Hum Dekhenge ' ' ( We shall witness ) at a Lahore stadium full of 50,000 people , wearing a black sari in defiance of Zia ’s ban on the sari .
As her liquid voice reached the crescendo – declaring ``Certainly we , too , shall witness that day ...
When these high mountains / Of tyranny and oppression turn to fluff and evaporate / And we oppressed / Beneath our feet will this earth shiver , shake and beat / And heads of rulers will be struck / With crackling lightening and thunder roars / When crowns will be flung in the air — and thrones will be overturned ... , ” people joined with slogans of ``Inquilab Zindabad '' ( Long live revolution ! ) .
( Hear a recording at http://www.radioreloaded.com/tracks/?11002.)
In future years , Faiz would be requested , “ Please recite that song of Iqbal Bano ’s ” – because she had made it her own .
Smug Indian commentators like to contrast the supposedly superior democratic culture of India ’s people with the supposed passivity of Pakistan ’s people – but it is Pakistan that gave us that immortal moment of democratic culture – where thousands of people sang in defence of a jailed atheist and communist poet – who had drawn upon progressive traditions within Islam to confront the zealot Zia .
Iqbal Bano , as the people of the sub - continent confront the tyrannies of their governments , of imperialism and of jingoistic hate - mongering , yours will be the voice that will reflect their unity , their defiance , their confidence that one day , tyranny will be defeated and the people will triumph ...

Writer are also voracious readers so whenever someone asks me what they have to do to become a successful writers or whenever someone asks me what they should write about , the first thing that I ask them is what do they like to read .
I never realized until recently that I was echoing the very words of one of my favorite authors , Steven Coontz .
Steven Coontz , not to be confused with Dean Koontz , one of today 's best known authors of fast paced horror novels , is one of today 's best selling authors of adventure novels .
Steven , in his blog Tips For Writers : Scribbling for Fun and Profit writes , " Whenever someone tells me they would like to write , my first question is always , What do you read ?
Writing is not for you unless you have spent a lifetime reading , a lifetime savoring stories .
All too often , the answer I receive to my question is , ' Oh , I do n't have time to read .
I watch TV and movies , but I would like to be a writer . '
The conversation usually ends there . "
Your opening paragraph should give your readers the essential information about the book - title of the book , author 's name , publisher , ISBN , price , a general description of the material covered and any special features like maps , tables , graphs , etc .
The general description of the material covered and special feature apply mostly to review of nonfiction books .
If you are submitting the review to an online site , this paragraph , as a rule , can be omitted because the review becomes part of a sales blurb for the book and that data is usually located right above the review for the book .
Whatever you do do not let the book review become a book report .
Never tell the reader so much about the story line that the reader does n't need to read the book to know how the story ended .
Include information about the author , his or her characters , the plot line , etc , but never ever give away the ending .
I know , I 'm being redundant , but never giving away the story 's ending is essential .
The object of book reviews is to promote the author and his or her books .
Review site like Amazon wants to sell the book and if you give away the ending many people will not buy the book to find out why the story ended that way .
Develop your own style , you unique book reviewers voice , so to speak .
Tell the reader how the book affected you .
Did it make you laugh ?
Did the story bring you to tears ?
Did the action keep you on the edge of your seat ?
Did the pace of the action keep you from putting the book down until you finished it ?
Did it bore you to death ?
Write reviews on books that you have purchased and submit those reviews to online writing sites that you already belong to , sites like this one , Factoidz .
Com .
Sign up for writing list .
Topica and Yahoo have a wide variety of writing list that you can sign up for .
Submit your reviews to sites like Amazon , Barnes and Nobles , Authorsden , etc .
Research ezines that publish book reviews , then after reading them for a couple of months , submit to those that interest you .
Reading them first will allow you to determine whether your personal style fits their needs
Many publishers are actively seeking freelance reviewers .
Check the listings in Writer 's Market .
Many authors will pay you to review their books if they like your style .
After having a few reviews that you are really pleased with published send an email to the author with the link to the review .
Send them a short message telling them about yourself and your experience as a writer as well .
Tell the author how much you like his or her books and that you would enjoy reviewing his or her future work for them .
I spend my working hours researching and writing nonfiction articles for publication online and for submission to print publications but in the evening like to relax with a real page turner .
Please do n't ask me who my favorite author is because it would be impossible for me to answer that question because I have dozens .
I read a couple of novels every week , like I said earlier , " writers are voracious readers . "
If you are a serious writer you will also be a voracious reader so why not turn your leisure time reading into another source of income by writing book reviews for publication online as well as in print .
You will never get rich writing book reviews but it can turn into a substantial second income and you can , once you establish yourself , receive all the free books that you can read .
Book reviews are not to be confused with the book reports that we all had to write when we were in school .
Book reviews are short pieces , usually six paragraphs in length , giving your personal evaluation of the book .
It 's your personal reaction to the strengths and weaknesses of the book .
It 's how you felt about the book 's content .
There is no right way and no wrong way to write a book review because they are all personal opinion pieces .
One rule that you have to follow is the one on word count :
If you are writing a book review for an online site like Amazon.com , they have to be concise and to the point but if you are submitting to a print publication they can run 1500 words or more in length .
Here are some general guidelines to follow in writing book reviews .
Ok , I hear you thinking , " great idea but how do I become involved with writing and submitting reviews . "
There are many different paths that you can follow .
Here are just a few suggestions
You wo n't get rich selling book reviews unless you become famous and start writing syndicated review columns but there are other benefits like free books from publishers and authors a like .
Thew books they send you to review are yours to keep and considering the average cost of a full length hardcover novel today is $ 30 or more , that 's a pretty good fringe benefit .

COLUMBIA , S.C. —
Nearly a year after he was laid off from his job as a window installer , Raymond Vaughn is still out of work , still scanning job listings on the computer and still sending résumés into a seemingly indifferent void .
But Mr. Vaughn now has another activity , one aimed at breaking free of his chronically meager financial straits :
He is studying for a career in medical billing through an online course he found on the Internet .
For several hours each morning , Mr. Vaughn , 43 , sits at a desk in the modest rented house he shares with his fiancée , memorizing medical procedures and absorbing detailed drawings of the human anatomy .
“ Medical terminology is kicking my butt , ” he says .
He takes quizzes online , making progress toward the diploma that will , the school promises , set him up to work from home , processing bills for insurance companies while earning as much as $ 50,000 a year .
“ That sounded all right to me , ” he says .
I tried running a set of unit tests from work in the latest version of coverage.py , and was surprised to see that the tests failed .
Digging into it , I found that the value of __file__ was wrong for my main program .
It used that value to find the expected output files to compare results against , and since the value was wrong , it did n’t find any expected output files , so the tests failed .
Consider this main program , myprog.py :
print " __file__ is " , __file__
print " __name__ is " , __name__
When run from the command line as “ python myprog.py ” , it says :
__file__ is myprog.py
__name__ is __main__
The way coverage .py ran the main program could be boiled down to this :
# runmain1.py : run its argument as a Python main program .
import sys
import __main__
mainfile = sys . argv [ 1 ]
execfile ( mainfile , __main__ .
__dict__ )
Running “ python runmain1.py myprog.py ” produces :
__file__ is runmain1.py
__name__ is __main__
Because we imported __main__ , and used its globals as myprog ’s globals , it thinks it is runmain1.py instead of myprog1.py .
That ’s why my unit tests failed : they tried to find data files alongside coverage .py , rather than alongside the unit test files .
This is a better way to do it :
# runmain2.py : run its argument as a Python main program .
import imp , sys
mainfile = sys . argv [ 1 ]
src = open ( mainfile )
try :
imp .
load_module ( ' __main__ ' , src , mainfile , ( " . py " , " r " , imp .
PY_SOURCE ))
finally :
src . close ()
This imports the target file as a real __main__ module , giving it the proper __file__ value .
The old execfile __main__ technique is used in lots of tools that offer to run your python main files for you , and I ’m not sure why more people do n’t have problems with it .
Probably because __file__ manipulation is uncommon .
I ’ve updated coverage .py to use the new technique .
I hope there is n’t a gotcha I ’m overlooking that means it ’s a bad way to do this .
Updated : I found the gotcha : it creates a compiled file .

The new data is pretty disturbing in this article from yesterday , but equally surprising is the Washington Post reporter outright mentioning , and implicitly criticizing , Washington Post opinion writer George Will .
The Arctic sea ice cover continues to shrink and become thinner , according to satellite measurements and other data released yesterday , providing further evidence that the region is warming more rapidly than scientists had expected ….
The new evidence — including satellite data showing that the average multiyear wintertime sea ice cover in the Arctic in 2005 and 2006 was nine feet thick , a significant decline from the 1980s — contradicts data cited in widely circulated reports by Washington Post columnist George F .
Will that sea ice in the Arctic has not significantly declined since 1979 .
Scientists have begun debating how soon the Arctic will lose its summer ice altogether , with some saying it could happen as early as 2015 … .
The loss of sea ice in the Arctic will not directly raise global sea levels , researchers said , but will contribute to an overall ocean warming that could erode the Greenland ice sheet , which would affect sea levels .

International Free Press Society ’s Mohammed Cartoon Fundraiser Succeeds Despite Cyber Attack
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Washington , DC – April 13 , 2009 : Just one day after world media reported that the International Free Press Society ( IFPS ) was raising funds to support its free speech activities by selling prints of the most famous of the Danish Mohammed cartoons , the IFPS website suffered a massive cyber-attack .
In the wake of the attack , which began at 6:30 am on Thursday , April 9 , 2009 , the IFPS created an alternate website which is now in place at https://internationalfreepresssociety.wordpress.com.
The main site will be restored in the near future at http://www.internationalfreepresssociety.org .
Prints of the controversial cartoon can be ordered online at http://freepresssociety.blogspot.com .
Sales for the print of “ Turban Bomb , ” signed and numbered by the Danish artist Kurt Westergaard , continue uninterrupted and indeed , have exceeded expectations , as orders have been processed via more traditional means and email marketing was expanded .
The IFPS was founded in January , 2009 to defend individuals and organizations under assault for exercising their right to free speech .
For taking on this mission , the IFPS is under ongoing cyber -attacks .
This aggression only serves to underscore the urgency with which free people must come together to defend free speech .
While the website was offline , the IFPS main office at the Danish Free Press Society in Copenhagen , Denmark received an unexpected increase of email , phone and fax orders for the prints of the controversial and historic Westergaard “ Turban Bomb ” cartoon , as well as calls of concern about the website outage from across Europe and North American .
Information on how to purchase the original signed prints is provided at the temporary website and below .
Demand for the cartoon have greatly exceeded expectations , with over 300 orders submitted during the website outage and in the immediate days before .
IFPS anticipates that the limited edition of 1000 signed and numbered prints will sell out shortly .
The International Free Press Society provides original research , advocacy and support for authors and artists under attack , and daily news updates on individual cases of repression of free speech particularly in Europe , Canada , and the United States , as well as in India , Africa and Asia .
In February , March and April , IFPS helped sponsor speaking tours of major U.S. cities including New York , Boston , Los Angeles , and Miami for Geert Wilders , Dutch Parliamentarian and producer of the controversial film FITNA .
According to Lars Hedegaard , President of the International Free Press Society , people from around the world appear eager to show public support for artists ’ and authors ’ right to free expression by purchasing copies of the Westergaard signed print .
“ Orders are coming in from all over the world .
Hong Kong , Canada , the US , Bulgaria , Germany , Austria , Norway , Finland , France – you name it . ”
Hedegaard took the temporary outage in stride .
“ This was an attack against IFPS as an organization , and against our mission to support freedom of expression worldwide .
Happily , it had the effect of increasing support for our activities as the word spread that we were being threatened .
We encourage everyone to visit our temporary website at https://internationalfreepresssociety.wordpress.com and soon the restored one at www.internationalfreepresssociety.org , and to help support artists like Kurt Westergaard by purchasing a signed copy of his cartoon .
We have also started a new Phase 2 viral online fundraising campaign , so that bloggers and website owners who want to support free expression can provide links at their own websites to order a print . ”
Diana West , Vice President of the International Free Press Society , added : “ In addition to increasing demand for the cartoon prints , this crude cyber - assault on free speech has boosted people ’s awareness of the urgency of the IFPS mission . ”
Kurt Westergaard , creator of the controversial cartoon , stated “ The contemptible attempts to close us down will not succeed .
The enemies of free speech will soon realize that their hacker attack on the IFPS website has only made us all the more determined to get our messages out .
I take great comfort from the fact that so many people have already bought my cartoon .
It ’s good to know that freedom of expression has defenders all over the world . ”
ABOUT THE “ TURBAN BOMB ” CARTOON BY KURT WESTERGAARD
Remember the Danish cartoon crisis ?
Riots and mayhem , trade boycotts , burnt - down embassies , more than 100 killed in violent demonstrations , death threats against artists and editors .
All of it the result of the Danish daily Jyllands - Posten ’s decision to publish 12 cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammed on 30 September 2005 .
One cartoon in particular stood out as the focus of world - wide Islamic rage and has since acquired the status as the iconic image of our age : Kurt Westergaard ’s drawing of the prophet with a bomb in his turban .
This is the picture that won Kurt Westergaard world fame but also meant that he has been forced to live under constant police protection ever since its publication .
Despite contracts on his head and determined efforts by Islamists to kill him , Kurt Westergaard has never recanted and never apologized for being a free artist .
Now you can own your exclusive reproduction of this icon , which has never been offered for sale before .
In collaboration with the artist , the Free Press Society in Denmark and the International Free Press Society have printed up a limited edition of 1000 copies .
Each copy is individually numbered and signed by Kurt Westergaard .
The picture is printed in durable colors on fine paper 42 by 21.5 centimeters , suitable for framing .
It will be delivered in a solid cardboard tube .
It can be yours for US $ 250 ( 188 Euros ) , postage and handing included , but exclusive of customs dues or VAT where applicable .
The proceeds from this offer will go towards the International Free Press Society ’s continuous campaign for free speech .
Proceeds will support research , public education and legal efforts for individuals and organizations under assault for exercising their right to free expression ; and to support efforts to ban hate speech laws and pass laws protecting freedom of expression .

A gay - rights demonstration was cut short Wednesday in Casa Grande when a police officer threatened participants with arrest for flying a pride flag inside city limits , organizers allege .
The Casa Grande Police Department is investigating the incident .
Police say the officer was called to the area on a report that the group 's flag , which measured 8 feet by 5 feet , was obstructing the view of traffic near an intersection .
Group members say the officer crossed the line .
" I was upset more than anything and confused as to what was the problem , " said Christopher Hall , protest organizer .
" This was wrong .
They 've actually violated , in my opinion , First Amendment rights . "
Hall , a 19 - year - old student at Central Arizona College , is the president and founder of Central Arizona Rainbow Equality , a month - old organization that serves members of the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community in Pinal County .
He said that Casa Grande police have been good partners in the past during pride events .
He and four CARE members were demonstrating in protest of taxation without representation in a dirt field on the northeast corner of Trekell Road and Cottonwood Lane .
Hall said they stood at least 5 feet from the sidewalk , as instructed by a city official when Hall checked to make sure the event would be in compliance .
Someone called 911 at 6:02 p.m .
Police on Thursday said they knew little about what happened when Officer Brian Walsh , a four - year veteran , responded to the scene .
Patrol Commander Scott Sjerven said Walsh 's notes following the incident showed the group was " made to leave ( and ) warned to not obstruct the view of traffic by flying their flag . "
Hall said he and the flag 's owner complied by giving the officer their identification and asked where they might move their demonstration .
That 's when they were told they could n't fly the flag " anywhere " or risk arrest , Hall said .
Alessandra Soler Meetze , executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona , said these incidents can be avoided with adequate training of officers who most often encounter free - speech issues .
Walsh had an obligation to ensure public safety if the protesters were blocking traffic , but she said it appeared he overstepped his bounds .
" That kind of police hostility chills free speech , " Soler Meetze said .
" You simply can't suspend people 's free - speech rights because you disagree with the message . "
Hall 's group reported the incident to the ACLU on Thursday .
An ACLU legal adviser plans to meet with them .
A statement issued Thursday afternoon by Casa Grande police Chief Robert Huddleston said the department is working to determine whether Walsh acted inappropriately and , if so , will take steps to correct issues .
Huddleston said he will meet with Hall and other CARE members Monday .
" The Casa Grande Police Department will continue to work with this and any other citizen group to respect their right to assemble and demonstrate in a safe manner , " Huddleston said .
" We apologize for any inconvenience or misunderstanding , and look forward to the completion of the investigation . "
That guy who gets in the elevator reeking of Drakkar Noir is nothing new - the Ancient Egyptians cherished their fragrant scents , too .
In a new part of its permanent exhibition , Bonn University 's Egyptian Museum has on display a particularly well preserved example of that .
Screening this 3,500 - year - old flacon with a computer tomograph , scientists at the university detected the desiccated residues of a fluid , which they now want to submit to further analysis .
They might even succeed in reconstructing this scent .
Pharaoh Hatshepsut was a power - conscious woman who assumed the reins of government in Egypt around the year 1479 B.C.
She was only supposed to represent her step - son , Thutmose III , age three , until he was old enough to take over but the interregnum lasted 20 years .
Hatshepsut´s perfume is also presumably a demonstration of her power .
" We think it probable that one constituent was incense – the scent of the gods " , says Michael Höveler - Müller , the curator of Bonn University´s Egyptian Museum .
Sound crazy ?
Perhaps not .
It is known that in the course of her regency Haptshepsut undertook an expedition to Punt - modern Eritrea - and the Egyptians had been importing precious goods such as ebony , ivory , gold , and incense from there since the third millennium B.C. Apparently the expedition brought back whole incense plants , which Hatshepsut then had planted in the vicinity of her funerary temple .
Hatshepsut died in 1457 B.C. Analysis of the mummy ascribed to her showed that the ruler was apparently between 45 and 60 years of age at the end of her life ; that she was also overweight , and suffering from diabetes , cancer , osteoporosis and arthritis .
Obviously for reasons of security , she was laid to rest in the tomb of her wet nurse .
In 1903 , over 3,300 years later , the famous Egyptologist Howard Carter stumbled upon the two mummies .
However , more than 100 years were to pass before the Pharaoh´s corpse could be identified using DNA and dental analysis in the year 2007 .
Thutmose III , incidentally , appears not to have shed a single tear for his step - mother , as during his reign he had every image destroyed which showed her as ruler , and which could have belonged to her .
The filigree flacon now under examination by the researchers in Bonn bears an inscription with the name of the Pharaoh .
Hence it was probably once in her possession .
The vessel is exceptionally well preserved .
" So we considered it might be rewarding to have it screened in the University Clinic´s Radiology Department " , Höveler - Müller explains .
" As far as I know this has never been done before " .
This world premier will now in all probability be followed by another one : " The desiccated residues of a fluid can be clearly discerned in the x- ray photographs " , the museum´s curator explains .
" Our pharmacologists are now going to analyse this sediment " .
The results could be available in a good year´s time .
If they are successful , the scientists in Bonn are even hoping to " reconstruct " the perfume so that , 3,500 years after the death of the woman amongst whose possessions it was found , the scent could then be revitalized .
Update ( July 17 ) : Friend - of - the - blog Karen Morenz points me to a piece by Bonny Brooks , articulating a left - wing case against cancel culture .
I read it and found much to agree with .
Mostly , though , I was really happy to spend this week doing some actual research ( nearly the first since the pandemic started ) rather than blogging culture - war stuff !
Speaking of which , please get in any last comments within the next day or so ; then I ’ll close down the thread .
If there were ever a time for liberals and progressives to put aside their internal squabbles , you ’d think it was now .
The President of the United States is a racist gangster , who might not leave if he loses the coming election — all the more reason to ensure he loses in a landslide .
Due in part to that gangster ’s breathtaking incompetence , 130,000 Americans are now dead , and the economy tanked , from a pandemic that the rest of the world has under much better control .
The gangster ’s latest “ response ” to the pandemic has been to disrupt the lives of thousands of foreign scientists — including several of my students — by threatening to cancel their visas .
( American universities will , of course , do whatever they legally can to work around this act of pure spite . )
So how is the left responding to this historic moment ?
This weekend , 536 people did so by … trying to cancel Steven Pinker , stripping him of “ distinguished fellow ” and “ media expert ” status ( whatever those are ) in the Linguistics Society of America for ideological reasons .
Yes , Steven Pinker : the celebrated linguist and cognitive scientist , author of The Language Instinct and How the Mind Works ( which had a massive impact on me as a teenager ) and many other books , and academic torch - bearer for the Enlightenment in our time .
For years , I ’d dreaded the day they ’d finally come for Steve , even while friends assured me my fears must be inflated since , after all , they had n’t come for him yet .
I concede that the cancelers ’ logic is impeccable .
If they can get Pinker , everyone will quickly realize that there ’s no longer any limit to who they can get — including me , including any writer or scientist who crosses them .
If you ’ve ever taken , or aspire to take , any public stand riskier than “ waffles are tasty , ” then do n’t delude yourself that you ’ll be magically spared — certainly not by your own progressive credentials .
I do n’t know if the “ charges ” against Pinker merit a considered response ( Pinker writes that some people wondered if they were satire ) .
For those who care , though , here ’s a detailed and excellent takedown by the biologist and blogger Jerry Coyne , and here ’s another by Barbara Partee .
So , it seems Pinker once used the term “ urban crime , ” which can be a racist dogwhistle — except that in this case , it literally meant “ urban crime . ”
Pinker once referred to Bernie Goetz , whose 1984 shooting of four robbers in the NYC subway polarized the US at the time , as a “ mild - mannered engineer , ” in a sentence whose purpose was to contrast that description with the ferocity of Goetz ’s act .
Pinker “ appropriated ” the work of a Black scholar , Harvard Dean Lawrence Bobo , which apparently meant approvingly citing him in a tweet .
Etc. Ironically , it occurred to me that the would - be Red Guards could ’ve built a much stronger case against Pinker had they seriously engaged with his decades of writing — writing that really does take direct aim at their whole worldview , they are n’t wrong about that — rather than superficially collecting a few tweets .
What Coyne calls the “ Purity Posse ” sleazily gaslights its readers as follows :
We want to note here that we have no desire to judge Dr. Pinker ’s actions in moral terms , or claim to know what his aims are .
Nor do we seek to “ cancel ” Dr. Pinker , or to bar him from participating in the linguistics and LSA communities ( though many of our signatories may well believe that doing so would be the right course of action ) .
In other words : many of us “ may well believe ” that Pinker ’s scientific career should be ended entirely .
But magnanimously , for now , we ’ll settle for a display of our power that leaves the condemned heretic still kicking .
So do n’t accuse us of wanting to “ cancel ” anyone !
In that same generous spirit :
Though no doubt related , we set aside questions of Dr. Pinker ’s tendency to move in the proximity of what The Guardian called a revival of “ scientific racism ” , his public support for David Brooks ( who has been argued to be a proponent of “ gender essentialism ” ) , his expert testimonial in favor of Jeffrey Epstein ( which Dr. Pinker now regrets ) , or his dubious past stances on rape and feminism .
See , even while we make these charges , we disclaim all moral responsibility for making them .
( For the record , Alan Dershowitz asked Pinker for a linguist ’s opinion of a statute , so Pinker provided it ;
Pinker did n’t know at the time that the request had anything to do with Epstein . )
Again and again , spineless institutions have responded to these sorts of ultimatums by capitulating to them .
So I confess that the news about Pinker depressed me all weekend .
The more time passed , though , the more it looked like the Purity Posse might have actually overplayed its hand this time .
Steven Pinker is not weak prey .
Let ’s start with what ’s missing from the petition : Noam Chomsky pointedly refused to sign .
How that must ’ve stung his comrades !
For that matter , virtually all of the world ’s well - known linguists refused to sign .
Ray Jackendoff and Michel DeGraff were originally on the petition , but their names turned out to have been forged ( were others ? ) .
But despite the flimsiness of the petition , suppose the Linguistics Society of America caved .
OK , I mused , how many people have even heard of the Linguistics Society of America , compared to the number who ’ve heard of Pinker or read his books ?
If the LSA expelled Pinker , would n’t they be forever known to the world only as the organization that had done that ?
I ’m tired of the believers in the Enlightenment being constantly on the defensive .
“ No , I ’m not a racist or a misogynist … on the contrary , I ’ve spent decades advocating for … yes , I did say that , but you completely misunderstood my meaning , which in context was … please , I ’m begging you , ca n’t we sit and discuss this like human beings ? ”
It ’s time for more of us to stand up and say : yes , I am a center - left extremist .
Yes , I ’m an Enlightenment fanatic , a radical for liberal moderation and reason .
If liberalism is the vanilla of worldviews , then I aspire to be the most intense vanilla anyone has ever tasted .
I ’m not a closeted fascist .
I ’m not a watered - down leftist .
I ’m something else .
I consider myself ferociously anti-racist and anti-sexist and anti-homophobic and pro-downtrodden , but I do n’t cede to any ideological faction the right to dictate what those terms mean .
The world is too complicated , too full of ironies and surprises , for me to outsource my conscience in that way .
Enlightenment liberalism at least has the virtue that it ’s not some utopian dream : on the contrary , it ’s already led to most of the peace and prosperity that this sorry world has ever known , wherever and whenever it ’s been allowed to operate .
And while “ the death of the Enlightenment ” gets proclaimed every other day , liberal ideals have by now endured for centuries .
They ’ve outlasted kings and dictators , the Holocaust and the gulag .
They certainly have it within them to outlast some online sneerers .
Yes , sometimes martyrdom ( or at least career martyrdom ) is the only honorable course , and yes , the childhood bullies did gift me with a sizeable persecution complex — I ’ll grant the sneerers that .
But on reflection , no , I do n’t want to be a martyr for Enlightenment values .
I want Enlightenment values to win , and not by vanquishing their opponents but by persuading them .
As Pinker writes :
A final comment : I feel sorry for the signatories .
Moralistic dudgeon is a shallow and corrosive indulgence , & policing the norms of your peer group a stunting of the intellect .
Learning new ideas & rethinking conventional wisdom are deeper pleasures … and ultimately better for the world .
Our natural state is ignorance , fallibility , & self - deception .
Progress comes only from broaching & evaluating ideas , including those that feel unfamiliar and uncomfortable .
Spend a lot of time on Twitter and Reddit and news sites , and it feels like the believers in the above sentiment are wildly outnumbered by the self - certain ideologues of all sides .
But just like the vanilla in a cake can be hard to taste , so there are more Enlightenment liberals than it seems , even in academia — especially if we include all those who never explicitly identified that way , because they were too busy building or fixing or discovering or teaching , and because they mistakenly imagined that if they just left the Purity Posse alone then the Posse would do likewise .
If that ’s you , then please ask yourself now : what is my personal break - point for speaking up ?
By Aidan Foster - Carter
Korea analyst
Is Kim Jong - il sending a hard - line message or covering for internal strife ?
Even by its own shrill standards , North Korea 's recent behaviour is hyper-militant .
But why ?
Last month 's launch of a long - range dual - use rocket - maybe a satellite , certainly a potential missile - prompted censure by the UN Security Council .
North Korea must have expected this , having been similarly rebuked twice for missile and nuclear launches in 2006 .
Yet Pyongyang professed high dudgeon at what was in truth mild UN Security Council remonstrance : just a statement , not a full resolution .
On this flimsy pretext , in a fine show of pique it repudiated the six - party talks and said it would resume its nuclear programme .
Monday 's nuclear test showed this to be no idle threat .
But why ?
Why now ?
What is really going on ?
Less well known is that four separate high - level US delegations - nominally private but including Stephen Bosworth , now the Obama administration 's point man on North Korea - visited Pyongyang earlier this year .
All got a frosty reception .
Their hosts professed no interest in full relations with the US , long regarded as the ultimate prize sought by Kim Jong - il .
So how does this latest North Korean jigsaw - with too few and misshapen pieces , as always - fit together ?
Stringing along
There are two broad possibilities and variants within either of those .
What message is Kim Jong - il trying to send , and to whom ?
Getting Obama 's attention is one widely - touted suggestion .
Yet on closer inspection this hardly adds up .
Barking louder than ever may be their way of scaring us off while they effect a delicate transition
Everyone knew , because he told us , that Barack Obama was ready to engage with America 's foes .
He means it , and he is doing it .
With Cuba and others , change is already under way .
So surely this is the US President Kim Jong - il has been waiting for ?
True , Obama is busy with the Middle East and the financial crisis .
But his door , and mind , are open .
It did not need a bomb or rocket to blast a way in and get a hearing in Washington .
To the contrary , these were bound to backfire .
There have to be more Security Council resolutions and maybe sanctions , however ineffectual , when a rogue state makes a mockery of international law .
Kim Jong - il is no fool .
So we must conclude , definitively now , that he has no intention of emulating Libya 's Colonel Gaddafi and ever giving up his weapons of mass destruction .
The six long years of the six - party talks were just stringing us along .
Without nuclear weapons , North Korea would be just another miserable tyranny .
With them , it commands attention - if not respect .
Or maybe Kim Jong - il would have made peace , but hardliners used his illness last year to seize the helm and batten down the hatches .
Yet abandoning diplomacy altogether is hardly a serious long - term option , for a failed state reliant on Chinese aid to feed its hungry people .
Making peace would bring financial rewards to the impoverished state Provoking Beijing is a risky game .
A patient patron hitherto , China may finally snap and pull the plug on so tiresome a client - as Moscow did in 1991 , devastating the North 's economy .
Is the new turn merely tactical ?
If so , it is a dire miscalculation .
Mr Kim 's old game of militant mendicancy - doing bad things , to be paid to stop - will no longer wash .
Everyone is fed up .
More exactly , the Dear Leader could have cleaned up if ( and only if ) he stuck with the six - party talks .
Peace and real disarmament would bring North Korea huge financial rewards : $ 10 bn ( £ 6.3 bn ) for full relations with Japan , and surely much more from a relieved Seoul .
One faint hope is that they may not really mean all this .
That brings us to the second broad hypothesis .
Succession plan ?
Rather than being any kind of odd signal to the wider world , North Korea 's new militancy might be primarily driven by internal events , largely invisible to outside eyes .
Perverse as it sounds , barking louder than ever may be their way of scaring us off while they effect a delicate transition .
This could be a smokescreen behind which , not before time , one of Kim 's mysterious and untried sons is being wheeled into place as his eventual successor .
If so , we may get more sense out of Pyongyang once such internal ructions settle down .
But to speculate thus may be clutching at straws .
The view that North Korea is a rational actor - if only we are patient and avoid upsetting them - looks , let 's face it , increasingly threadbare .
My fear is that defining itself against the world is hardwired into North Korea 's outlook .
For over a decade , Bill Clinton , former South Korean President Kim Dae-jung , China , Russia and others strove to lead this most stubborn and suspicious of mules to water .
But none could make it drink , beyond a few sips .
A toe in the water is as far as Kim Jong - il will ever go , on economic reform and peace alike .
When it comes to the crunch , he refuses the fence .
At the risk of flogging equine metaphors to death , some blame the likes of George W Bush - before his U - turn to engagement - for frightening the horses with " axis of evil " rhetoric , so reinforcing Pyongyang 's paranoia .
But ultimately , the choice and fault is Kim's .
China and Vietnam show there is another way - the only way .
North Korea is on a road to nowhere .

car rolled 17 times before it stoppedboth driver and co driver were uninjured No sound .
Of course , it ’s not unusual for blogs to form the basis of books .
For example , Christian Lander , author of the humor blog Stuff White People Like , wrote scores of blog entries and then reworked them into a popular 2008 book of the same name .
Image Doree Shafrir , right , and Jessica Grose created the book  Love , Mom ,  from a blog that collected humorous e-mail messages between women and their adult children .
Tracking down the owners of user - submitted materials to obtain publishing rights became a nightmarish task .

But the latest frenzy is over books that take the lazy , Tom Sawyer approach to authorship .
The creators come up with a goofy or witty idea , put it up on a simple platform like Twitter and Tumblr , and wait for contributors to provide all of the content .
The authors put their energy into publicizing the sites and compiling the best material .
Agents and publishing houses can’t get seem to get enough of these quickie humor books , which sell for $ 10 to $ 15 in gift shops and hip clothing stores like Urban Outfitters as well as traditional bookstores .
At least eight books created from user - generated content are due out this year , including “ Love , Mom , ” a just - published collection of embarrassing or funny electronic exchanges between mothers and their children .
“ Just about every house in town is paying attention , ” said Patrick Mulligan , a senior editor at Gotham Books who handled a 2008 book of cat photos with bizarre captions called “ I Can Has Cheezburger ? ”
Publishers are hoping that millions of page views on a blog will translate into booming sales on the bookstand , he said .
“ I Can Has Cheezburger ? ” is based on a blog of the same name .
It sold more than 100,000 copies and hovered on The New York Times best - seller list for 13 weeks .

The question of software patents without democracy and the FFII response
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In October 2008 , the President of the European Patent Office ( EPO )
issued a Referral to its Enlarged Board of Appeal ( EBoA ) concerning the
questions as to the examination and granting of software patents in
Europe .
In the absence of European legislative initiatives , the EBoA's
conclusion on this matter is likely to have the same effect as a
software patent directive .
However , since this decision will be based on a purely legal
interpretation of the European Patent Convention ( EPC ) by the EBoA , it
will not be accompanied by more extensive political and economic debate .
As stated by the EPO , third parties may wish to use the opportunity to
file written statements before the end of April
( http://tinyurl.com/chkljo)
We would like to ask you to consider writing a statement in the name of
your company , organisation or as private person , and if possible also to
support the action plan of the FFII ( see below ) .
You can see statements already submited by others at
http://www.epo.org/patents/appeals/eba-decisions/referrals/pending.html
We offer a dedicated mailing list for discussions on the referral at
https://lists.ffii.org/mailman/listinfo/boa
and a petition page against software patents at
http://stopsoftwarepatents.eu/
With our action plan , we are funding two experts to work full - time on
the issue and also produce detailed documentation about software patents
in Europe , to be published in the near future .
We need your
contribution in order to do this .

Background information
----------------------
At present there is no central jurisdiction for European or community
patents .
National court decisions are still not fully aligned with the
European Patent Office 's ( EPO ) granting policy concerning software
patents that has been developed by decisions of the EPO Boards of
Appeal .
The disparity between national patent enforcement courts and the
EPO 's granting practice was one of the reasons why a directive on the
patentability of computer - implemented inventions was proposed .
This
directive , as well as the 2000 attempt to change the European Patent
Convention , was rejected not least because of the larger FFII network's
activities .
Despite the fact that several attempts to formally legalise software
patents in Europe proved unsuccessful , the EPO still has not adapted to
the developments in the political arena .
The EPO still grants software
patents under the application of loopholes created by its Boards
of Appeal decisions .
The EPO 's granting practice gradually gains more acceptance in national
courts thanks to a trickle down effect , while the legal certainty of
national software patents remains to be determined .
Validity rulings and
opposition mostly reject questionable software patents out of novelty
and inventive step considerations , but not on grounds of the substantive
scope of patent law .
On October 22 , 2008 the Enlarged Board of Appeal was asked by the
President of the European Patent Office , Alison Brimelow ( UK ) , for an
opinion concerning the exclusion of computer programs as such according
to Article 112 ( 1 ) b EPC .
She highlights that this matter is of
fundamental importance as it defines the limits of patentability in the
field of computing .
The Referral is divided into four chapters .
The
first chapter describes the background to the Referral , the second
chapter concerns definitions of auxiliary terms such as software , while
part three includes four questions about substantive law interpretation .
Part four describes the legal framework and options for its development .
The President also added background information and an overview of BoA
decisions related to this specific matter .
The FFII has a wiki page where comments on the questions can be added .
https://www.ffii.org/EPOReferral
The EPO Enlarged Board of Appeal decided to allow third parties to make
statements concerning the points of law ( November 11 , 2008 ) .
We will
provide legal considerations which challenge the controversial Boards of
Appeal decisions and thus influence the decision - making process .
In the
absence of legislative clarifications , some courts in the UK recently
accepted EPO ' case law ' .
The opinion of the Extended Boards of Appeal
will create the precedent for all future legislative developments .
As there is no legislative scenario in sight which might overrule the
EBoA in case it permits software patents , this particular Referral needs
our attention .
Other parties interested in software patents are going to
submit comments in favour of software patents .
Philips , in fact , has
already done so .
---------------
Our action plan
---------------
We will submit entries to the Enlarged Board of Appeal in order to bring
about a more balanced assessment , and to help the EBoA arrive at legal
solutions that are closer to our expectations .
Our communication targets
are patent technocrats with a different belief system to which we need
to adapt .
So far we have concluded that several different strategies
can be applied .
We have discussed these extensively with patent
experts .
For strategic reasons we cannot make them public , suffice it to
say that we are currently in the process of finding collaborators in our
attempt to stop software patents .
---------
Challenge
---------
* Recent EPO legal patent literature has done little to challenge or
even criticise the teachings of the EPO .
Patent scholars from other
professions such as political science , economics , etc. are hardly
discussed in the legal literature .
Patent professionals ' task is not
normative legislature , but winning cases and applications .
While there
has been sustained disagreement with software patents in the field of
business , legal literature still hardly reflects this shift .
* Inside the EPO there is no open debate and employees are bound by
strict staff obligations ( cmp. Communique 22 ) .
The EPO aggressively
intervenes in political and scientific debates , while the patent
community 's belief system is still largely determined by an unchallenged
endorsement of software patents .
* The EBoA 's members are not necessarily eligible for judicial office ,
and some of them are merely technically qualified .
The EBoA 's lack of
independence is a known issue and an EPO reform is underway to make
these bodies more independent .
Some patent scholars altogether question
the legal quality of EBoA reasoning .
* The political debate over patent law is largely blocked .
The fact that
no corresponding parliament report was issued in response to an official
communication from the Commission about the future of Industrial
Property policy testifies to this .
* Members of the EBoA will probably only accept legal considerations and
solutions .
* The EPO 's dogmatic language is shielded against public criticism and ,
even for legally trained people , like a net in which one easily gets
caught .
Its reasoning is often based on logical fallacies and hidden
value judgments .
* Patent law interpretation practice is expansive .
In an allegedly unclear situation , the patent community will always
argue against exclusion from patentability .
It lacks a negative
definition of " invention " and a sound basis in legal teaching which
could be used to explain why a field is not to be covered by patent law .
Patent professionals generally do not understand the economic rationale
behind incentive system application , while economists often assume for
their model that the patent system has the claimed effects .
* The EPO and its staff have a strong commercial bias in favour of
granting patents and are hardly ever subjected to public scrutiny and
control .
Patent opposition is less than ideal due to free riding
effects and associated risks and transparency gaps ( cmp. Guellec07 )
* Complicated institutional conflicts between German and UK patent
traditions loom in the background of the Referral .
De facto European
patent policy and litigation is strongly dominated by UK and Germany
stakeholders and traditions .

This blog entry is about one of the most interesting discoveries of the 90’s in Neuroscience — Mirror Neurons — and a recent research paper that adds to their intrigue .
Mirror neurons are found in the premotor cortex , and what has made them so interesting is that they fire both when the individual performs a goal - directed action and when they watch someone else perform the same action .
It is as if the mirror neurons encode an understanding about the intentions of someone else .
For example , when my husband reaches for his coffee cup I understand that he intends to take a drink before he even raises the cup to his lips .
Neuroscientists think it is the mirror neurons that encode the “ understanding ” when we watch what others are doing .
A recent study suggests that mirror neurons may do more than just reflect understanding others .
A group of Neuroscientists in Tubingen Germany and Parma Italy has shown that mirror neurons may contribute to thinking about how to interact .
They ran a clever study to find out if the mirror neurons in the ventral premotor cortex encodes how far away from you someone else is performing an action .
Is it within reach ( peripersonal space ) or just out of reach ( extrapersonal space ) ?
About half of the neurons responded differently depending on whether the action was performed within reach or just beyond .
Some of the mirror neurons fired more if the observed action was within reach , while others fired more when the action was out of reach .
This result shows that some mirror neurons are space - selective and are providing information about understanding and whether the action is occurring close or further away .
The clever twist came when the researchers tested what happens to the response of the space - selective mirror neurons when the action is performed within reach but there is a glass barrier that blocks reaching .
Would the space - selective mirror neurons continue to encode the distance to the action or would they change because the barrier makes it out of reach ?
Surprisingly , the response of some neurons changed .
Some mirror neurons that responded when actions were within reached stopped responding when there was a barrier .
While other neurons that responded to actions out of reach changed and responded to the near actions performed behind the barrier .
As if they “ knew ” that they could not reach the action because of the barrier .
This study adds an intriguing new dimension to the mirror neuron story .
Some mirror neurons are space - selective and encode if an observed action occurs within or outside of reach , like a ruler to measure if the action is close or further away .
And some space - selective mirror neurons change their response when a barrier blocks access .
As the authors suggest , mirror neurons may contribute to understanding “ what others are doing ” and these space - selective properties might help to decide “ how I might interact with them ” .
It is not hard to see that these space - selective properties , and the plasticity of these mirror neurons , may be part of the neural system that controls our social interactions .
But why is it that only some space - selective mirror neurons change their responses to the barrier while others continue responding to the distance ?
Perhaps the neurons that do n’t change simply code that the action is within reach and the neurons that do change their response identify that something needs to be done to be able to interact — move the barrier .
The answer to why there are 2 types of space - selective mirror neurons will have to come from future experiments .
But it is intriguing to consider if comparing their responses is the key to deciding on a plan for interacting .
Are these the neurons that make us think before we act ?
For more information about Dr. Casile ’s research you can look at his website .
For more information about this research paper on mirror neurons you can read the abstract published in the journal Science .

The Guardian
Is it somehow possible – and I know I ’m going out on a limb here – that journalists wilfully misinterpret and ignore scientific evidence , simply in order to generate stories that reflect their own political and cultural prejudices ?
Because my friend Martin , from the excellent layscience blog , has made a pretty excellent discovery .
First we have some inevitable scare headlines from the Daily Mail about the cervical cancer vaccine in the English Edition .
Endure them , the punchline is worth the effort .
“ Revealed :
The serious health concerns about the cervical cancer jab ” “ Alert over jab for girls as two die following cervical cancer vaccination ” “ Twelve - year - old girl paralysed ‘ after being given cervical cancer jab ’ ” “ How safe is the cervical cancer jab ?
Five teenagers reveal their alarming stories ”
That ’s enough .
But get this .
In Ireland , where the government refused to fund the vaccine , the Daily Mail are campaigning – vigorously – for the jab .
Apparently it ’s lifesaving : “ Join the Irish Daily Mail ’s cervical cancer vaccination campaign today ” “ Europe will shame FF into providing Ireland ’s life - saving cervical cancer jabs ” “ Ditching cancer vaccine is a big step back , says expert ” “ Health campaigners in Ireland take fight for cancer jabs to Washington ” “ Cervical cancer vaccine for Ireland ’s girls : online poll slams decision to pull funding ” .
In fact they even have a graphic , with the Daily Mail logo and everything .
Like something from a parallel universe , it reads : “ Daily Mail Campaign : Roll out the vaccine now ! ”
Presumably the reasoning is to attack any government healthcare decision , by pretending it is medically dangerous .
Meanwhile the isolated “ facebook causes cancer ” headline from two months ago has evolved into a small industry .
Many newspapers made huge stories out of the utterly banal survey observation that kids who mess about on the internet with their friends do less schoolwork .
And now science has proven these sites are a moral threat .
“ Facebook and Twitter ‘ make us bad people ’ ” said the Metro .
The Telegraph was graver : “ Twitter and Facebook could harm moral values , scientists warn . ”
“ Twitter can make you immoral , claim scientists ” was the Mail headline .
“ Social networks such as Twitter may blunt people ’s sense of morality , claim brain scientists .
New evidence shows the digital torrent of information from networking sites could have long - term damaging effects on the emotional development of young people ’s brains . ”
Egged on by a rather fanciful press release from the University media office , and a quote from a sociologist , the story was unstoppable .
I got hold of the research paper , with some hassle .
In fact , before we even begin to read it , I do n’t think it ’s very good behaviour to pimp a study to the media before it ’s published , before academics can read it and respond , since the media commentariat have proven themselves to be morons .
Anyway : in a sentence , the study finds that the brain bloodflow changes which are observed when a subject is experiencing compassion for social pain peak , and dissipate , at a slightly slower rate to those seen with compassion for physical pain .
It does not mention Twitter .
It does not mention Facebook .
It does not mention social networking websites .
It makes – and I ’m being generous here – a single , momentary , passing reference to the rapid pace of information in “ the digital age ” in the discussion section , but that is all .
These news stories were bullshit .
Am I a lone , potty - mouthed pedant ?
I emailed Professor Antonio Damasio , the senior academic and “ corresponding author ” on the paper , and one of the “ scientists ” “ warning ” that Twitter and Facebook will make us immoral .
“ Thank you for your inquiry .
As you can see if you read our study , we made no connection whatsoever with Twitter .
Some writers did make that connection but it is not ours .
There is no mention whatsoever of Twitter or of any social network in our study .
We have nothing whatsoever to say about them . ”
Where did it come from , I asked ?
He dug .
“ I found the press release from USC where the writer made , on his own , a connection to social networks .
We , the authors , certainly did n’t and do n’t .
The only connection that could be speculated upon has to do with fast presentation of a story without appropriate context .
The connection to Twitter and other social networks , as far as I can see , makes no sense .
I presume you will reach the same conclusion after reading our article . ”
This is how I think it works .
Journalists have a 1950s B - movie view of science .
To them , it offers a feeling tone of cold , unquestionable truth that can be used to paste a veneer of objectivity over any moral prejudice you might have , and we ’ve seen it a hundred times in this column .
The Independent on Sunday campaigned for a decade to have cannabis legalised : then they changed their minds , but without the strength of character to admit that their moral views had changed , they had to pretend that the cannabis had changed , and was 25 times stronger .
In England the cervical cancer vaccine is about a government promoting promiscuity , therefore it causes paralysis and other symptoms ; in Ireland the vaccine is withheld by penny pinchers , so it is a lifesaver .
And Facebook causes cancer .
It does : it makes you immoral , scientists have warned .

You ca n’t read the study that ’s not about Twitter .
It ’s not out yet .
As I ’m sure you ’re well aware , our minds are amazing tools .
In humans , we ’ve been able to use our minds to understand how earth began millions of years ago , build space shuttles that can take us to the moon and understand the most complex of mathematical problems .
Without our mind we would n’t be able to survive .
However , there are some aspects to our mind that are n’t so beneficial .
As a race , our minds have led to the deaths of millions of people around the world .
And many people are so depressed , and in so much pain , that they feel the only way out is suicide .
Before you think this is going to be a negative post , do n’t worry .
It is n’t .
My aim today is to help you see how our mind is often simply a filter to how we view the world , and that we have the power to change our outlook on all situations .
Hopefully , by the end of this post , you should have a better understand of how this works , and how you can use your own mind to create lasting happiness , positivity and joy inside yourself .
Your Mind is a Filter
Although this may be a tough concept to grasp , everything in the world is actually neutral .
It is our minds that give meaning to certain situations , and it is this filter that causes us to react in certain events .
For example , when I was in on an African Safari last year , all the staff at the lodge I was visiting were praying for rain .
A lot of the animals were dying due to the harsh conditions of the environment .
Thankfully , the rain came .
However , I ’m sure at the same time , there were hundreds if not thousands of men around the world cursing about the weather due to the fact that they could n’t play golf that day .
To some the rain was life saving , to others it ‘ ruined ’ their day .
Our minds filter everything around us on a daily basis , we label , we judge and we go through emotions ranging from total joy to utter depression .
This range of emotions can happen in a 24hr period , and often does .
Once you begin to understand your mind is a filter , you can learn to filter things to your own liking .
You ’ll begin to find that everything really is what we make of it , and you ’ll reap the benefits for doing so .
Using Your Internal Filter
The followings steps are going to help you find the peace , happiness and positivity that I mentioned earlier .
1. Realize that you have a choice
For any of the following points to be effective , you first have to realize that you have a choice .
Right at this moment , you have to decide whether you want to be happy and let go or keep negative emotions held up within you .
“ That ’s stupid , everyone wants to be happy ”
You would be surprised .
Many of us complain about our dead end jobs but never look for alternatives .
We stress about the fact that we live from paycheck to paycheck but we do n’t change our spending habits .
We hold on to situations that happened years ago and still let them emotionally affect us today .
Decide which end of the emotional scale you want to feel .
2. Accept Everything That Is
Based on my example earlier with the golfers hating the fact that there was rain , let me ask you something .
How long do you think it affected them for , or in other words … how long do you think they held negative emotions such as anger or disappointment ?
For some I ’m sure it did n’t last long , for others I ’m sure it turned their entire day into an unproductive , downward spiral .
How easier would it have been for them ( and us ) in any situation , if they just accepted what was .
Just accept that it is raining and get on with their day .
Acceptance is a beautiful thing because it allows you to instantly let go of any unfavorable emotions .
You ca n’t change the fact that it ’s raining , or someone insulted you , or you made a mistake .
Take action where you can , but otherwise just accept what is .
There ’s no reason to let the negativity that exists in your mind affect you for longer than the occurrence of the emotion itself .
The easiest way to start accepting things is to live for the moment , focus on what is around you right now , if you must then focus on the future .
Just do n’t let the past keep a negative emotional hold on you .
3. Flip the Switch , Make Everything Positive
For some , the concept of acceptance is n’t going to be easy .
I agree , accepting certain things can be a challenge , but with practice you can master the art .
If you would like to try a different method , try focusing on making everything negative into a positive .
I once gave a mini-speech like that to an ex colleague who would often let little things get to her .
The next day she came up to me and said “ Guess what , I did it .
I made something positive ” .
“ Awesome ” , I replied ; then she continued .
“ My brother took my car out again and I knew he would be driving it too fast as usual , I was just sitting at home , feeling so angry .
Then I thought about what you said and just thought about the fact that it ’s only a car , he ’s safe and he ’s using it to be able to get things done ” .
After I spoke to her about taking the positive out of everything , she ’s been happier ever since .
4. Use EFT to ‘ Re- program ’ Your Feelings
I ’ve been using EFT a lot recently and I ’ve had some great results .
EFT , which stands for Emotional Freedom Technique , is about tapping certain energy points of your body , while speaking out loud about negative things on your mind .
What this does is start to relax your body and relax your emotions and auto - response over this initially negative feeling .
To ‘ EFT ’ on your negative emotions , first bring one to mind .
Write down a number from 0 to 10 about how negatively this emotion or feeling is affecting you .
Now , you need to start repeating this problem out loud ( I ’m overweight , I ’m shy , I ’m inadequate , etc. ) while tapping on certain points of your body .
Those points are :
Your collar bone
The side of your hand
The top of your head
Your temple
The point between your nose and your top lip
Your Chin
There are others but those are some of the main ones .
For a video demonstration of this click here .
I know it ’s likely that you ’ll be sceptical of this at first if you have n’t used it , but give it a try and I think you ’ll be amazed at the results .
Write down the score again and it ’s likely that your number is going to be lower .
You can repeat the process for more effective results .
If you have any questions about any of the steps here then feel free to ask them in the comments and I ’ll respond as best I can .
Thanks to Peter for the opportunity to guest post ; I hope this post helps your future become something that is filled with a lot more choice , happiness , and acceptance .
France promises to clear ' Jungle ' camp near Calais ... but demands UK open its doors to migrants
The French government yesterday vowed to clear Calais of the shanty town of illegal immigrants waiting to cross to the UK .
Immigration minister Eric Besson told the town 's business leaders he would order the removal of a squatter camp that grew up after the closure of the reception centre at nearby Sangatte .
He wants the shanty town - known as the Jungle - replaced by a series of ' mini ' welcome centres set up along the French coast , offering food , showers , and information about how to claim asylum .
Radical measures :
An armed riot police officer faces immigrants in Calais after a police raid on Tuesday that rounded up nearly 200 migrants
Mr Besson even urged Britain to remove passport controls with France so illegal immigrants do not congregate in Calais but instead are allowed to cross to the UK - although he knows this will cause outrage in Britain .
The French believe Britain 's generous welfare benefits encourages foreigners from all over the world to use their country as a base to get to the UK , where they will claim asylum or else disappear into the black economy .
At present around 800 immigrants are in Calais waiting to board Dover - bound trains and lorries illegally .
Most are sleeping rough .
Earlier this year , Mr Besson visited Calais and vowed to find a solution to the immigrant problem by May 1 .
He was back there yesterday to try to reassure shopkeepers and residents , and challenge the UK to cooperate in stepping up security in Calais , where joint customs and passport checks already exist .
Mr Besson , who favours the use of military force to tear down the squatter camp , said he was determined to return the town to normal .
' Soon the Jungle will no longer exist , ' he added .
He also wants a British contribution to the cost of clearing up the problem in Calais .
Mr Besson denied that the proposed ' mini ' welcome centres will be like the Red Cross Centre at Sangatte , which acted as a magnet to thousands of migrants to the UK before being shut down as part of an Anglo - French agreement in 2002 .
Calais mayor Natacha Bouchard wants Britain to sign up to the Schengen Agreement , which allows anybody to travel between designated EU states - including France - without passports or visas .
She outlined the idea to Mr Besson yesterday and he also urged the UK to sign up to the agreement .
But British Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said : ' The UK policy is to not sign up to the Schengen Agreement .
Free movement is only rightly available to legal entrants .
' Weakening our controls will only play into the hands of the traffickers who profit from human misery . '
Richard Ashworth , Conservative MEP for South East England , said : ' It 's all well and good closing ' the Jungle ' camp but unless the roots of this problem are solved we will just see it spring up elsewhere .
' The British government is not doing nearly enough to prevent and dissuade people from making the often dangerous journey to Europe . '
Earlier this week , French police raided the Jungle and arrested nearly 200 men , in an attempt to break up people smuggling gangs who charge up to £ 1,000 - a- time for illegal passages to England .
Introduction
The Gaza war triggered many expressions of antisemitism ( i.e. , statements against Jews at large ) in the Arab and Muslim world , both by Arab leaders and politicians and by columnists .
In their statements , they evoked antisemitic motifs taken from both traditional Islamic sources and from European ones .
Cartoons featuring similar motifs were published in the Arab media .
The antisemitic motifs taken from the Islamic tradition included allusion to the Jews as " the descendants of apes and pigs , " as dishonest , and as domineering , while the motifs taken from the European tradition included , for example , the claim that the Jews aim to take over the world .
Some of the writers also alluded to the Jewish tradition , stating that Israel ’s policies are based on Jewish religious commandments .
Another recurring motif was a comparison between the Gaza war and the Jewish Holocaust .
The claim that Israel is as bad as , or even worse than , Nazi Germany is frequently made in the Arab press , and is meant to challenge the legitimacy of Israel 's very existence .
This document will focus on two aspects of the recent antisemitic attacks : the demonization of the Jews using motifs from the Islamic tradition , and the comparison between Israel and Nazi Germany . [ 1 ]
Antisemitic Motifs from the Islamic Tradition
In an article in the Saudi daily Al - Watan , journalist Ashraf Al - Faqi claims that the current Israeli policies are based on " the Jewish interpretation of the Torah " : [ 2 ]
" The Jewish interpretation of the Torah is behind all the massacres perpetrated by the Israeli forces in Gaza .
This proves that Israel is a religious state , [ despite ] the claims to the contrary repeatedly made by its politicians …
" To justify their massacres and achieve their aims , the Jews rely on tales of killing and on various ploys described in the Torah ...
They rely , for example , on the story of Dinah , which exposes the extent of their cunning , and their [ method of operation , which consists ] of breaking promises , setting endless conditions , and eventually killing their victim after exhausting him with all these conditions … " [ 3 ]
Writing in the Saudi edition of the daily Al - Hayat , Islamic researcher ' Abd Al - Rahman Al - Khatib describes the Jews as religious fanatics , and claims that their ideology - which is reflected in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion - stems from the Torah and the Talmud , and is currently being implemented in Gaza .
Al - Khatib also cites traditional Muslim sources that promise the Muslims victory over the Jews .
" Many of those who follow the events in Gaza have seen on the satellite channels images of Israeli soldiers wearing a robe - like garment over their uniforms , which goes over their heads and reaches to their waists .
[ While wearing it ] they hold Torah books and read out of them … rapidly moving their bodies back and forth .
To give the reader an idea of the texts [ that appear in these books ] , here are a few of them .
Deuteronomy [ 1:8 ] says : ' See , I have placed the land before you ; go in and possess the land which the Lord swore to give to your fathers , to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob , to them and their descendants after them … '
" Anyone who examines these verses in the Torah can see that they have been put into practice in Palestine in the recent years - for people [ like the Jews , ] who are fanatical about their religion , cannot disregard its commandments …
Jewish ideology has only two sources : the Torah and the Talmud .
This ideology has spawned many secondary texts , including The Protocols of the Elders of Zion by Matvei Golovinski , The Jewish State by [ Theodor ] Herzl and The Prince by [ Niccolo ] Machiavelli ... " [ 4 ]
In an article in the prominent London daily Al - Sharq Al - Awsat , Saudi preacher Dr. ' Aidh Al - Qarni compared the conduct of the Jews to that of tyrants like Pharaoh and Nebuchadnezzar : " The Jews are no better than Pharaoh , and are doing [ to the Palestinians ] exactly what he did to their forefathers ...
One might have expected the Jews to take a lesson from the fate of tyrants [ like ] Nebuchadnezzar , Pharaoh and Hitler .
But sadly , they [ have chosen ] to emulate the tyrants and to be led by hangmen .
[ Consequently ] they have [ themselves ] become terrorists and murderers who want to give others a taste of the torment , abuse , collective extermination , and deportation which was their lot in the past .
They enjoy killing children , murdering elderly people and burning homes .
They specialize in terrorizing peaceful [ civilians ] , torturing prisoners , burning the livers of mothers , and butchering orphans , while the world remains silent ... " [ 5 ]
Zahi Hawwas , head of the Egyptian Antiquities Council , wrote in Al - Sharq Al - Awsat that the " Jews of Palestine " are murderous by nature : " The concept of killing women , children and elderly people ... seems to run in the blood of the Jews of Palestine .
[ In fact , ] it seems to have become part of the false faith of this people , who is tormenting us in our [ own ] homeland .
" When I speak of the Jewish faith , I do not mean their [ original ] faith , but the faith that they forged and contaminated with their poison , which is aimed against all of mankind ...
The only thing that the Jews have learned from history is methods of tyranny and torment - so much so that they have become artists in this field .
They have done to the Palestinians what Pharaoh and Sargon [ of Akkad ] did to the Jews ... " [ 6 ]
Similar remarks are made in an article by columnist ' Ali Balout in the Kuwaiti daily Al - Jarida .
He states that , in attacking Gaza , Israel was implementing directives appearing in the Talmud , and that the ultimate aim of the Jewish people is to take over the world :
" The big question is : why be so cruel and kill innocent civilians , especially children ?
Was it a mistake , or was it an accidental consequence of the fighting ?
[ The answer is ] neither .
[ Their conduct was the reflection of ] an ancient ideology [ that is part of ]
Jewish history and comes from the book that they call the Talmud …
One of the psalms in the Talmud says : ' As for their children , one must focus on killing them and on dashing them against the walls .
Pulverize their skulls until no trace is left of them . '
" The violence in Gaza , which focuses on children , may be anchored in the Talmud … [ Its ] objective is to realize a religious prophecy , which takes the form of a directive .
[ This directive is obeyed by ] Jews who espouse the principles set out in the Talmud and strive to implement them .
" As far as [ the Jews ] are concerned , the occupation of Palestine is [ only ] the first step in a long journey [ whose ultimate goal ] is to take over the entire world and use its resources , according to the right granted to them by the Talmudic authority …
Some might say that this [ belief ] is pure nonsense , and indeed it is .
However , Israel is controlled today by the followers of the Talmud , who wish to realize this fairytale , no matter how long it takes , and who base their behavior upon it , out of a deep conviction in the correctness of their beliefs …
" Israel 's talk about peace is a temporary [ tactic ] that is not to be trusted , because the Talmud instructs the Jews to lie , deceive and use every method that is immoral by the lights of both the ancient world and the modern one .
All this , in order to achieve their goals …
The Talmud also instructs them to corrupt the morals of mankind by every possible means in order to make it easier for the Chosen People to control the world …
If we look closely , we find the Jews ' fingerprints in all the evils that plague mankind : drugs , prostitution , wars …
[ They are also the ones who ] corrupted the monotheistic religions and beliefs by sowing hatred and division between the [ different faiths ] … " [ 7 ]
In a poem he published in the Saudi daily Al - Jazirah , Saudi poet Sa'd Al - Bawardi portrays Hitler as merciful compared to the Jews , who are described as " apes " and " wild pigs . " [ 8 ]
" You were merciful , oh Hitler .
" [ That is my conclusion ] when I see around me " The cruel acts " Of the descendants of apes .
" You were wise , oh Hitler " To rid the world " Of some of these wild pigs .
" [ But ] they have spawned a gang " [ Whose heart ] is filled with blind hatred …
" Oh Hitler , " The descendents of apes - " None are more cruel and horrifying than they are …
" Their wars of destruction " Are worse than the ' Holocaust . '
" Destruction of the world is their motto , " And they are implementing it in practice " In Gaza , in the Golan and in Lebanon .
" The descendents of apes are the cruelest creatures " That mankind has ever known … " [ 9 ]
An Al - Jarida article by columnist Dr. Hassan Hanafi examines the Koran 's attitude towards the Jews , stressing its characterization of them as dishonest and domineering :
" The Koran uses three terms to refer to the Jews : ' Jews , ' ' those who are Jews , ' and ' the Children of Israel ' …
[ The second term appears six times in the Koran ] .
Five of these [ verses describe the Jews ] negatively … while the sixth is positive [ but ] refers only to a minority amongst them .
" The first of these verses [ says ] : ' Some of those who are Jews change words from their context [ Koran 4:46 ] . '
[ The Jews indeed ] distort treaties and interpret them in a way that benefits them .
Of the Torah , they understand only that Allah has chosen them , while disregarding [ the fact that ]
Allah has cursed them for disobeying the directives of the prophets , renouncing them and [ even ] killing some of them .
[ The Jews ] do the same thing with the U.N. conventions , interpreting them [ in a way that allows them to ] perpetrate genocide , and to kill innocent women , children and elderly people ... "
" The second of the verses [ also ] concerns lies : ' Some of those who are Jews listen to every lie [ Koran 5:41 ] . '
[ This means that ] they know what is true , but do not acknowledge it publicly , and say other [ things instead ] .
They know that they are aggressors , robbers and bloodthirsty murderers , but say that they are acting in self - defense ...
" The third verse refers to the prohibition against eating certain animals : ' Unto those who are Jews we forbade every animal with claws [ Koran 6:146 ] '...
But they do the opposite , bringing destruction upon animals , plants and people ... "
" The fourth verse refers to [ the Jews ' ] false claim that they , and none but they , are Allah 's chosen : ' If you think that you are the favorites of Allah to the exclusion of other people , then invoke death [ Koran 62:6 ] ...'
[ They believe that ] all others are their servants and slaves .
They plunder the treasures and property of others , and control almost all the world 's resources and capital .
" The fifth verse refers to the fact that [ the Jews ] think they are always right while others are wrong ... and that anyone who is not with them is against them : ' [ And they say : ] none shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian [ Koran 2:111 ] '... " [ 10 ]
Arab Leaders and Dailies : " Israel Is Worse than the Nazis "
In addition to describing Israel 's offensive in Gaza as a war crime and a crime against humanity , [ 11 ] some Arab leaders also described it as worse than the Nazi Holocaust .
In his January 16 , 2009 speech at the Doha summit , Syrian President Bashar Al - Assad stated that the Gaza war was part of a conspiracy to turn Israel into a purely Jewish state , and described this as " the most dangerous brand of Nazism in the modern era " :
" At previous summits , we spoke about [ Israel ’s ] plans , but today we are talking about their implementation …
Today , the holocaust has not only begun , it is about to enter its next stages , which will include all the Arabs , unless we stop it right now …
" The starting point of our decisions today will be our support for the people of Gaza in the face of the new Nazi holocaust [ perpetrated by ] Israel ...
The spilling of Arab blood since Israel 's establishment is regarded by Israel 's leaders as the fuel needed to [ power ] the machine [ designed ] to create a purely Jewish state .
[ This state ] will become possible only after the non-Jews are expelled from Palestine and those remaining are exterminated .
It follows that the [ current ]
Gaza events are not merely a response to the missiles [ fired at Israel ] - [ because ] had missiles not existed , the [ Israelis ] would have invented them and fired them [ themselves ] as an excuse [ to kill and deport the Arabs ] ...
There must be legal measures so that Israel stands trial ... so that it will be written in the annals of history that [ the Israelis ] are not only racists but [ represent ] the most dangerous brand of Nazism in the modern era … " [ 12 ]
Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Muhammad Al - Salem Al - Sabbah compared Israel 's leaders to the Nazis , and the Palestinian muqawama to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising : " When the Israelis see their leaders waging [ such an ] intensive war on refugee camps in Gaza and bombarding them in such a manner , they must be reminded of the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland ... [ and of ] the ' Jewish intifada ' that took place there , [ which prompted ] the Nazis to enter the Ghetto and burn the Jews .
What is happening in Gaza is the same thing : an intifada in a refugee camp , which has been burned down in the same way ... " [ 13 ]
Egyptian Chief Mufti Dr. ' Ali Gum 'a described the attack on Gaza as the blackest episode in the history of mankind , and as " a new holocaust , worse than the Nazi massacre of the Jews that was condemned by all of humanity . " [ 14 ]
An editorial in the Egyptian government daily Al - Gumhouriyya , titled " The Nazis Deserve an International Apology , " stated that Israel 's crimes are worse than those of the Nazis : " The international community … should apologize today to the Nazis for opposing their evil agents by waging a destructive war against them , and for punishing them for their crimes during World War II - since what they did pales beside the ruthless crimes against women and children perpetrated by Israel on a daily basis ...
" The Nazis , who were condemned with good reason throughout the 20th century , never bombed hospitals , schools , mosques , shelters and compounds of international organizations , as the Israeli terrorists have done .
The Nazis never targeted peaceful citizens in their homes using phosphorus bombs , as the murderous descendants of the so - called Jewish Holocaust [ survivors ] have done in the besieged towns of the Gaza strip .
The Nazis , for all their cruelty , never executed prisoners - men and women - by shooting them , and never targeted ambulance drivers carrying the injured and killed , as is being done by the evil agents of Barak , Olmert , Livni , Peres , Bush , Cheney and the other bloodsuckers ... " [ 15 ]
An editorial by columnist Amin Lutfi , published in the Algerian daily Al - Watan , stated : " What is happening in Gaza is similar , in many respects , to the Final Solution .
The systematic murder of children , women and elderly people is reminiscent of certain events that the world had reason to believe would never happen again .
How can human conscience fail to be outraged by [ the events in Gaza ] , which are reminiscent of the atrocities of World War II ?
Has fate decreed that the children of Gaza must suffer a new holocaust , which will supplant the memory of the victims of the German Third Reich ... ? " [ 16 ]
Columnist Jihad Al - Khazen wrote in the daily Al - Hayat : " ... Six million Jews were exterminated in the Nazi Holocaust .
It is difficult to conceive of a greater crime , but today I would nevertheless like to compare [ the Nazi Holocaust to the one perpetrated by Israel ] , and let the reader [ judge for himself ] ...
" After the Nazi concentration camps were liberated , we saw photos , which are still being circulated [ today ] , of Jews so emaciated that their ribs almost broke out through their skin ...
What is missing from the text that accompanies these pictures is [ the fact ] that the Germans also went hungry during the last year of the war , since they were besieged from every side and were under constant fire - so the Jews starved along with the Germans .
" In the war against Gaza , Israel , which has plenty of food , lets the women , children and the elderly of Gaza starve , which is something [ even ] the Nazis did not do ...
This leads me to conclude that Israel is worse than the Nazis , even though it seems impossible for anyone to be worse than the Nazis .
If the reader accepts this conclusion , he may also accept that those who are waging the Israeli war against Gaza are party to a new Nazi crime ... " [ 17 ]
Columnist Nasser Al - Umair wrote in Al - Hayat : " ... The Jewish Holocaust , which [ the Jews constantly ] harp about to the world , started in 1933 and ended with the fall of the Nazis [ in 1945 ] ...
According to Jewish historians , the collective [ extermination ] of the Jews in the crematoria was [ actually ]
Hitler 's second choice .
[ His first choice was ] to deport [ them ] to Palestine , Eastern Europe or Madagascar .
Today , if anyone denies the Holocaust , the Jews have the temerity to accuse him of supporting it .
However , they themselves have been waging a war of extermination against the Palestinians for the last 60 years , and deporting them by force .
Is this not enough to turn the Holocaust into a mere joke in comparison to what the Palestinians have suffered at the hands of several consecutive generations of Jews ?... " [ 18 ]
In his daily column in the Egyptian daily Al - Akhbar , journalist Ahmad Rajab wrote that , when Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak looks in the mirror , the face he sees is the face of Hitler :
" General Ehud Barak , imagine that Gaza is a town in Nazi Germany and that Hitler is exterminating its women and children using unconventional weapons .
Imagine that you appeal to the gang called the U.N. trying to find recourse , but it replies that Hitler is [ merely ] defending himself , so you no longer know who to turn to .
Suddenly the despicable Hitler appears before you , and you burst out and call him ' bloodthirsty [ murderer ] ' !
' Enemy of Allah and mankind '!
' Villain ' !
[ If you do that , ] Mr. General , you will feel better as you turn away from the mirror in which you saw Hitler . " [ 19 ]
Columnist Muhammad Kishk of the Syrian government daily Teshreen wrote that , when Israel 's Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi visited the Warsaw Ghetto in 2008 , his aim was to study the Nazis ' tactics in order to use them against the Palestinians .
Kishk wrote that Ashkenazi , accompanied by " special units of the Israeli occupation army , " came to study " the tactics that Adolf Hitler 's special army forces ... [ employed ] in the Ghetto in 1943 - [ tactics ] that are similar to those that were used and are still being used [ by the Israelis ] in Gaza ... " [ 20 ]
In a section devoted to comments on current affairs , the independent Sudanese daily Al - Sahafa published a short report containing a quote by Hitler .
The report said : " The media is re-publishing [ the following ] quote by Adolf Hitler : ' I could have killed all the Jews in the world , but I spared some of them so that you understand why I killed them . " [ 21 ]
Antisemitic Cartoons
Following the Gaza war , the Arab press published cartoons that demonize and dehumanize the Jews and / or present them as attempting to take over the world , as well as cartoons that present the war as genocide or as a second holocaust and the Jews as neo -Nazis .

It should be noted that the Arab media does not always distinguish between Jews and Zionists .
Al - Hayat columnist ' Abd Al - ' Aziz Al - Sweid argued explicitly against making this distinction : " Though reason compels us to distinguish between Jews and Zionists , [ there is no real cause to do so ] .
The latter term refers to the state of Israel and its leadership , [ while the former ] refers to [ the Jews ] who carry out influential economic , financial and media activities in the global arena , and who have not voiced any convincing opposition to [ what is happening in Gaza ] .
In fact , they seem to be doing the opposite .
They are extending media and economic support [ to Israel ] and creating lobbies to reinforce this support [ even further ] .
Al - Hayat ( London ) , January 12 , 2009 .
Indeed , alongside the articles comparing the Jews to the Nazis , there were articles that equated Zionism with Nazism .
For example , columnist Marwan Darraj wrote in the Syrian government daily Al - Thawra : " Some of the voices [ condemning the Gaza offensive ] displayed [ a new feature ] this time : they called a spade a spade .
[ Israel 's ] massacres in Gaza were referred to as a ' holocaust ' and as ' Nazi and fascist crimes . '
I think these are the mildest terms that European public opinion could have used .
The equation of Zionism with Nazism is not groundless ; it is based on , and perpetuated by , the terrorist acts that [ the Zionists have been committing ] for over 60 years .
Hitler 's fascism , as everyone knows , went to insane extremes with the [ idea ] of the Final Solution .
The Zionist movement also endorses [ this idea ] , including [ the notion ] of executing its rivals without a trial . ”
Al - Thawra ( Syria ) , December 31 , 2008 .
Columnist ' Abd Al - Rahman Al - Wabili wrote in the Saudi daily Al - Watan : " What makes the Zionist army unique in our era in terms of its unrestrained and criminal [ brutality ] is the cruel Zionist culture that is deeply rooted in the Zionist [ psyche ] and which motivates them …
One of the tenets of the Zionist faith is that the Jews are the Chosen People , and that God created the universe for their sake … while the non-Jews were created in order to serve the Jews …
[ According to this outlook ] , the extermination of the Palestinians is , in its entirety , a sacred act , which comes to rectify an anomalous situation and make it correlate with the divine will … "

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
After promising the American people his team has already found $ 2 trillion in budget savings by scouring the federal budget , President Obama laid out some of the potential spending cuts in great detail when he unveiled his first blueprint on Thursday .
President Obama told Congress on Tuesday that his administration had found $ 2 trillion in cuts in the federal budget .
" My administration has also begun to go line by line through the federal budget in order to eliminate wasteful and ineffective programs , " Obama said Tuesday in a speech to a joint session of Congress .
" We have already identified $ 2 trillion in savings over the next decade . "
A list of some of the proposed spending cuts shows that the programs on the chopping block range from outdated farm subsidy programs to pricey Pentagon weapons programs and the so - called " carried - interest " loophole on Wall Street .
Each program , however , has political patrons on Capitol Hill who will fight to save the budget items , setting the stage for major political battles as the details of the budget are debated by lawmakers in the months ahead .
One high - profile proposal involves closing the loophole that has allowed some Wall Street investment managers to pay lower tax rates than their low - paid assistants .
Wall Street lobbyists have fought such changes in the past and won , but the current political environment is so sour on financial executives that the proposal could garner more support now .
Watch Obama talk about ending " tax breaks for the rich " »
For many years , most hedge funds have operated on a " 2 - and - 20 " basis , meaning they charged 2 percent of the amount they were managing and also received 20 percent of whatever profits the hedge fund made in a year .
However , they pay a much lower capital gains tax rate on that 20 percent or profits -- or " carried interest " -- even though they are not risking their own money .
Some say the hedge fund managers are risking their own money and deserve to pay the lower capital gains tax rates on the profits .
But others say hedge fund managers are not risking their own money to get that 20 percent of profits , and that the 20 percent going to the fund managers is just a fee and should be taxed as ordinary income .
This 20 percent gain will be taxed as ordinary income under the Obama plan beginning with income earned in 2011 .

Meanwhile , an antiquated navigation system President George W. Bush saved from death last year is back on the chopping block .
Obama says he will kill the LORAN - C long - range navigation and timing system , saving the government $ 190 million over five years .
Just one year ago , the Bush administration announced it would keep the ground - based LORAN system operational to serve as a backup for the satellite - based global positioning systems , which are becoming ubiquitous in cars , planes and ships .
Supporters of LORAN say the nation 's increasing reliance on GPS has ironically increased the importance of maintaining LORAN as a backup .
Having LORAN in reserve makes the GPS satellite system a less attractive target for terrorists , they say .
GPS systems now are used not only for navigation , but also to provide precise timing for ATM machines , cell phone towers , water plants and other enterprises , and positioning information for the military 's precision - guided weapons .
GPS disruptions can be costly to business , unsafe for travelers , and debilitating to the military .
Watch Senators talk about cutting defense spending »
Of the approximately 950 people who commented in the Federal Register about the future of LORAN as the Bush administration 's decision was being made , the vast majority favored saving and improving LORAN , said Bob Lilley , secretary of the International Loran Association .
The supporters said the system is a near - perfect backup because it provides information similar to that provided by GPS , but has a dissimilar infrastructure .
GPS is based on a constellation of at least 25 satellites ; LORAN is based on about 25 ground stations in the United States , and others elsewhere .
GPS transmits a very faint signal ; LORAN has a very strong signal , making it harder to interrupt .
GPS is powered by solar panels ; LORAN is tied to ground power .
And while GPS satellites are unprotected , LORAN operates inside controlled perimeters in the United States , the supporters said .
On defense , the administration 's list suggests it will target expensive weapons systems but does not specify which programs will be cut or how much money will be saved .
White House officials said they are letting Defense Secretary Robert Gates take the lead on specific announcements Thursday .
The list did contend the Pentagon 's new weapons programs are " among the largest , most expensive , and technically difficult that the Department has ever tried to develop .
Consequently , they carry a high risk of performance failure , cost increases and schedule delays . "
On agriculture , wealthy farmers would get less money from the federal government -- and none , three years down the line -- under proposals in Obama 's first budget .
Obama 's proposed fiscal year 2010 budget " phases out direct payments over three years to farmers with sales revenue of more than $ 500,000 annually , " according to the list .
At present , " direct payments are made to even large producers regardless of crop prices , losses or whether the land is still under production . "
But according to the list , " Large farmers are well - positioned to replace those payments with alternative sources of income from emerging markets for environmental services , such as carbon sequestration , renewable energy production , and providing clean air , clean water , and wildlife habitat . "
The new proposed budget cuts the Market Access Program which provides " funding for overseas brand promotion . "
It cuts cotton subsidies and " proposes to eliminate the requirement for the government to pay the storage costs of cotton that is put under loan by the USDA .
Cotton is the only commodity for which this assistance is provided . "
On transportation , a fee charged to every airline passenger to help pay for security would go up an undisclosed amount in 2012 if Obama 's proposed budget is approved .
Currently , passengers pay $ 2.50 for every leg of a trip , with a maximum of $ 5 .
But the Obama administration said the fee captures only 36 percent of the cost of providing aviation security , and said the increased fee will result in passengers paying " a majority " of the estimated cost of passenger and baggage screening .
The airline industry has fought fee increases in the past and is likely to fight this one .
" We believe that aviation security is a U.S. government responsibility , " said David Castelveter of the Air Transport Association of America , which represents most major airlines .
" These costs should not be on the backs of airlines and their customers . "

WEAPONRY
In keeping with the static effect nature of 4CS , weapons do their max dice number in damage .
1d2 = 2 points
1d3 = 3 points
1d4 = 4 points
1d4+1 = 5 points
1d6 = 6 points
1d6+1 = 7 points
2d4 = 8 points
1d8 = 8 points
1d8+1 = 9 points
2d4+1 = 9 points
1d10 = 10 points
1d12 = 12 points
2d6 = 12 points
2d8 = 16 points
3d6 = 18 points
etc .
Unless otherwise stated it should be assumed that attack results use the Edged / Slashing column for results unless specifically going for flat of the blade / axe head type non-lethal options .
Non-proficiency penalties and usage as per OSRIC , each - 1 is - 1 Row Shift .
ABILITY ADJUSTMENTS
HTH To Hit Adjustment for Strength : Excellent +1 , Excellent ( 20 ) +2 , Remarkable +3
HTH Damage Adjust for Strength : Good ( 14 ) +1 , Excellent +2 , Excellent ( 18 ) +3 , Excellent ( 22 ) +4 , Excellent ( 24 ) + 5 , Remarkable +6
Because you are more 4CS heroic , forcing doors needs a G Strength Roll and bending bars or lifting Gates needs a Yellow Strength Roll .
Missile / Surprise Adjustment for Operate : Good ( 14 ) +1 , Good ( 15 ) +2 , Excellent +3 ,
AC Adjustment for Operate : Good ( 13 ) - 1 , Good ( 14 ) - 2 , Good ( 15 ) - 3 , Excellent - 4 ,
Endurance Adjustment to Fighter Rank Number per level : Good ( 14 ) +1 , Good ( 15 ) +2 , Excellent + 3 . Double this for Fighter Classes .

For every rank under Excellent there is a five Row Shift penalty .
Reason points over 8 give you the ability to learn an additional language each .
An Intuition of Good gives you +1 Row Shift on Mental Saving Throws .
Excellent is +2 .
A Popularity of Good gives you +2 Row Shifts to Reactions and Loyalty .
Excellent is +4 .
OSERIP is going for a slightly more heroic flavour , so there are no penalties listed .
If you would like a quick and dirty way to make things tougher , give a - 1 Penalty for a Poor Rank and a - 2 for a Feeble rank in the areas given above .
ARMOUR
To go with the old - fashioned OSRIC flavour , armour gives Row Shift penalties to attack rolls .
So as per the OSRIC Effect on AC , Banded / Split is a 6 Row Shift penalty , Leather is a 2 Row Shift penalty , Plate is a 7 Row Shift penalty , etc . A Shield is a 1 Row Shift penalty .
HIT DICE
Give a monster 8 Hit Points per hit die listed .
If 1d4 e.g a Kobold , give them 4 Hit Points .
If 1 - 1 then 7 .
If 1+1 then 9 . 7+7 is 63 .

Notes
One star , its fourth planet , and a lot of buzz .
That 's what 's happening as planet - hunters digest the news that European astronomers have detected planet No. 4 orbiting a star with the imaginative moniker : Gliese 581 .
The new planet has 1.9 times Earth 's mass , making it the tiniest exoplanet astronomers have bagged to date .
The golden Easter egg in this hunt , of course , is the elusive Earthlike planet orbiting a star in its habitable zone .
There , it 's not too hot and not too cold , but just right for liquid water to gather and persist on the planet 's surface .
To spot a planet this small , and use an Earth - based telescope to do it , is a big deal .
" This is really the most exciting new discovery in the field of exoplanets , " enthused Debra Fischer , an astronomer at San Francisco State University and an active planet hunter , in an e-mail exchange .
It 's an impressive achievement , she continues , in no small part because the planet 's tell - tale signature is tiny compared with larger planets astronomers have found using the same detection technique .
Looking for stars that wobble
The approach detects the presence of a planet through the tiny tug its gravity imparts on its host star .
This appears as a periodic wobble in the star 's spectrum .
The tool in this case was a sensitive planet - hunting spectrograph called HARPS bolted to the back end of the European Southern Observatory 's 3.6 - meter telescope at La Silla , Chile .
In the process of nabbing this new planet , the European team also refined estimates of the orbits of three other planets in the system – a revision that pulled a planet with seven times Earth 's mass more securely into Gliese 581 's narrow habitable zone .
That planet , Gliese 581d , was discovered in 2007 , and orbits the star once every 66.8 days .
Gliese 581d " is probably too massive to be made only of rocky material , but we can speculate that it is an icy planet that has migrated closer to the star , " according to Stephane Udry , an astronomer with the University of Geneva 's Geneva Observatory and a member of the research team .
This would make it " the first serious water - world candidate , " she noted in a prepared statement .
The results were unveiled on Monday at a conference at the University of Hertfordshire in Britain .
The work has been submitted to the journal Astronomy & Astophysics for formal publication .
You can download a pdf " preprint " of the paper here .
Gliese 581 is 20.5 light - years from Earth , in the constellation Libra .
As stars go , it 's a munchkin .
It has roughly one - third of the sun 's mass and is only about one - third as large as the sun .
It 's an M - dwarf star .
But by some estimates , M- dwarfs account for 70 percent of the stars in our galaxy .
Happy hunting grounds
This small size – and ubiquity – makes these stars tempting hunting grounds for astronomers searching for other worlds .
The stars ' smaller mass , and hence weaker gravity , means that any Earth - sized planets will be orbiting an M - dwarf more closely than they might a larger star .
In essence , an Earthlike planet 's gravitational tug on an M - dwarf would be more noticeable than it would if a more massive star was involved .
That does n't mean detection is a cakewalk .
It 's just relatively easier than spotting an Earth - size planet around a larger star with a more - distant habitable zone .
In the case of the new planet , dubbed Gliese 581e , it 's circling the star once every 3 to 15 days .
And it 's doing so at a distance of just under 3 million miles .
The researchers say it 's very likely to be a rocky orb .
And so close to its star that it would be inhospitable to the max .
Or would it ?
A habitat on the dark side ?
M-dwarf planets are notorious for launching enormous flares into space , Dr. Fischer explains .
Gliese 581e is so close that it 's likely to be locked to the star in such a way that it has a permanent day and permanent night side – no rotation .
Especially during flares , the day side would become the fried side .
Even without flares , the day side would be bathed in ultraviolet radiation and assaulted by the " wind " of charged particles streaming from Gliese 581 .
The back side , however , would be shielded from such events .
If the planet has a magnetic field , possible given its mass , that field could protect the surface from the star 's charged - particle wind , which would otherwise strip away an atmosphere .
So one key question , she says , is whether the planet has a substantial atmosphere – which it may not , given its mass .
If it does , however , and it has sufficient protection from the star 's wind , atmospheric circulation potentially could redistribute heat to the dark side .
There , " one could imagine that liquid water could accumulate , " she adds .
" While this planet does n't fall into the classical habitable zone , I would n't discount it as an interesting environment for life . "
Update 4/23/09 :
It turns out the water - world candidate may not fit into the habitable zone either .
You can read about that here .
QUESTION : what do you get when you cross moral snobbery with a lack of taste ?
Answer : a vegan .
This may be tough on a group of people who want nothing more than to live a life free of cruelty .
But , while there are many things in the world that are worse than evangelical vegetarianism  pre-season football and question time spring to mind  there are few that are more joyless and depressing .
Vegans , you see , exist so that others may feel guilt about something completely normal : the desire to eat food that is tasty , nourishing and appropriate to our physical specifications .
Humans require certain basic nutrients to function , and to be vegan is to spend your life thinking about where you 're going to get your next fix of vitamin B12 .
Not that they 'll admit it .
The vegans who write letters to newspapers and ring talkback radio rhapsodise about the culinary options available to them , and many of them seem to believe it .
Perhaps their brains are so starved of essential trace minerals that they really think that spurning all animal - based products improves the range and quality of their diet .
There are still days when I stop dead in my tracks and think to myself : My God George W. Bush was an idiot .
Did we really let that happen … not once but twice ?
Margaret , do you ever have thoughts like that ?
I mean it ’s not like we did n’t know it .
We watched it happen .
Had we really become so disconnected from our government or otherwise unable to control our elected officials ?
George Bush did n’t even have the simple command of the English language that we would expect from a high school graduate much less a Yale scholar .
Misunderestimated ?
The human being and fish can coexist peacefully ?
Put food on your family ?
Is our children learning ?
But maybe I ’m being too hard on the guy .
After all , he did have his hands full with taking us to war and all .
And understanding the subtle relationship between nouns and verbs – not to mention the complex differences between lungs and gills – really is a lot to ask from a Yale graduate .
But now we have a smart , well spoken , well intentioned statesman in the oval office and you would think someone – to use a phrase from my son - in - law – “ found a turd in the punch bowl ” .
Rush and company actually think it is a bad thing that he is so popular around the nation and around the world .
They make fun by calling him the Messiah and a Rock Star .
The very idea of a nation united behind its leader is just more than they can stand .
Margaret , I know you hate that part about a turd in the punch bowl , but even you have to admit someone really needs to light a match in the Republican cloakroom .
The smell is getting to be too much .
Under Bush we became a nation that condoned torture .
America .
Pro-torture .
It really happened .
But now the United States is seeking a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council .
This is a departure from the Bush administration , which was often critical of the group .
Did you know that ?
I did n’t .
Never in my life did I imagine that we did n’t have a seat at that table much less a President who was evidently proud of that accomplishment .
Susan Rice , Obama ’s pick for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , says the council needs to be “ balanced and credible ” to help people suffering from abuse and oppression around the world .
“ The U.S. is seeking election to the council because we believe that working from within , we can make the council a more effective forum to promote and protect human rights , ” she said in a state department release .
Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell recently told a reporter that he did n’t think Americans really wanted Obama to shut down Guantanamo .
Rush Limbaugh is still saying if Obama fails , America wins .
Honestly folks , it really is time to start paying attention again .
We elected Obama and that was a very good thing , but I am only now just fully realizing how bad it had gotten in this country .
Roll up your sleeves because President Obama is going to need all the help he can get .
When Rush Limbaugh stands up , we need to insist that he sit down .
When Ann Coulter writes a book , we need to let it collect dust on the shelf .
When Mitch McConnell tells us that torture is still needed , we need not be shocked – we need to be outraged .
And when Cheney offers an opinion we need to hide the punch bowl and direct him to the nearest men ’s room .
Actually Mitch , now that I think of it , you ’re right .
We ’d like to keep Guantanamo open , but we would like to replace its current occupants with you , Cheney , Rush and that Cantor kid from Virginia .
An America for human rights and a President who prefers to take the time to know what he is talking about before he speaks …
I just hope I do n’t wake up from this marvelous dream .
Sleep well Margaret .
Tomorrow we have a lot of work to do .
Really .
I mean it .
Tearful Allen Stanford threatens to punch a reporter in the face David Edwards and Stephen C. Webster
Published : Tuesday April 7 , 2009
Print This Email This R. Allen Stanford thinks the charges against him are " bologna . "
And if pushed , he might just punch a reporter in the face .
Speaking with ABC's Brian Ross , Stanford gave a tearful , occasionally angry rebuttal to allegations that his business was a fraudulent Ponzi investment scheme and that he'd worked with Mexican drug cartels .
Strangely enough , Stanford did not respond to a question by Ross about alleged involvement with the CIA .
" I would die and go to hell if its a Ponzi scheme , " Stanford said .
" It 's not a Ponzi scheme .
If it was a Ponzi scheme , why are they finding billions and billions of dollars all over the place ? "
" The SEC says it has frozen all of Stanford 's assets it has found , including $ 4.6 billion which a federal judge recently ' unfroze ' so it could be distributed to his depositors and customers , " reported ABC .
" According to SEC officials , only $ 500 million connected to the alleged fraud has been recovered so far . "
While Stanford said he expects to be indicted within a couple weeks , he told Ross , " I 'm going to fight this with everything in me . "
" You know the allegation , " said Ross .
" They say that you promised more than you can possibly deliver with your CDs . "
" Bologna , " said Stanford .
" Authorities tell ABC News that as part of the investigation , which has been ongoing since last year , Mexican authorities detained one of Stanford 's private planes , " the network reported in February .
" According to officials , checks found inside the plane were believed to be connected to the Gulf cartel , reputed to be Mexico 's most violent gang .
Authorities say Stanford could potentially face criminal charges of money laundering and bribery of foreign officials . "
" [ L ] ast year , Stanford 's Venezuelan offices were raided on suspicion that the billionaire was a US government tool , involved in spying , " reported Business Insider .
The publication openly speculated whether a 2006 SEC investigation into Stanford that was " waived off " was actually quashed by the CIA .
During the interview , Stanford himself mentioned the allegation of his involvement with the CIA , to which Ross asked , " Are you ? "
" Have never and would never , " Stanford told Ross , addressing merely the charge of working with drug cartels .
" That is something that is absolutely foreign to everything in my body .
...
That is something , if someone put a gun to my head , I would not do . "
" Something like that , in terms of an allegation is , if you say it to my face again I 'll punch you in the mouth . "
Taken aback , Ross asked with a chuckle , " Are you gonna punch me in the mouth ? "
" No , I 'm not going to punch you in the mouth , " said Stanford .
" But I 'm just saying , that is an absolutely ludicrous thing to say . "
He did not answer as to whether he had been involved with the CIA .

Contrary to what viewers of “ CSI ” might believe , not every criminal case can be resolved by DNA evidence .
Even so , DNA testing has exonerated more than 200 convicted defendants .
This week , the Supreme Court was asked to rule that access to DNA information is a constitutional right .
The court must say yes .
Sixteen years ago , William Osborne was convicted in an Alaska court of raping a prostitute .
In oral arguments Monday , Alaska defended its decision to deny Osborne an advanced DNA test , which could establish his innocence or his guilt .
Alaska is one of six states that do n’t provide convicted defendants access to DNA evidence , although Kenneth Rosenstein , Alaska ’s lawyer , said Osborne might be able to obtain such evidence if he insisted in advance that he is innocent -- something he has n’t done .
Osborne is , to put it mildly , an unsympathetic representative of prisoners seeking access to DNA information .
He filed his claim under a civil rights law that seems only tenuously linked to his situation .
He declined a sophisticated DNA test during his trial -- leading Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. to suggest that he was “ gaming the system . ”
He also confessed to the crime in parole hearings .
Still , he is entitled to the evidence he seeks .
Alaska ’s argument that there is no constitutional right to DNA evidence was supported by the Obama administration .
Deputy Solicitor General Neal Katyal noted that federal law requires that a defendant seeking DNA evidence swear that he is innocent .
Besides , Katyal said , the Supreme Court never has said explicitly that a defendant convicted after a fair trial has a constitutional right to challenge that conviction on the grounds that he is innocent .
In this or some other case , the court should rule that convicted defendants should be allowed to show that new evidence proves their innocence .
But even if it does n’t go that far , it should recognize that DNA evidence is uniquely capable of establishing guilt or innocence , a fact reflected in the abundance of state laws on the subject , including one in California .
States would still be free to establish rules to prevent gaming the system , such as a requirement that a convicted defendant swear under oath that the evidence will exonerate him .
That would minimize the danger of what Alaska ’s lawyer called “ fishing for evidence . ”
The alternative is to say that a state may withhold evidence that could free a wrongly convicted person .
That ’s an inconceivable interpretation of the Constitution ’s guarantee of due process of law .
It is difficult to think of a more perfect testament to New ­Labour 's intellectual shallows .
On the eve of the most deadly serious budget in decades , ­Gordon Brown posts a YouTube video in which he announces he has scheduled some ­inquiry - ­pre-empting debate about MPs ' ­expenses .
It might as well have been captioned " I can haz bathplug ? " .
There are those who have judged that the next day 's introduction of a 50 % tax rate marked the end of New Labour .
But for many students of the movement , that video seemed part of an absolute continuum with the past , combining an excruciating attempt to manipulate the news agenda with a helpful reminder of the petty chiselling of the Blair - Brown years .
Think of it as expense fiddling while Rome burns .
MPs ' expenses are a cross-party blight , of course .
But when historians come to assess this edifying period for our democracy , they may well remark upon what a pity it was that certain members who were so fastidious about their personal outgoings were so ­profligate and laissez - faire with the ­public purse .
Olympic overspends , a couple of wars – they waved through the lot while perusing the John Lewis ­electricals catalogue .
Doubtless historians will also note how pathetically in thrall the administration was to the very people out of whom it has taken such an ill - conceived bite this week .
The cabal of very senior ministers and unelected advisers , to which we were obliged to refer as " the government " , contrived to be both desperately impressed by the rich , and hopelessly out of its depth when dealing with them .
One could never help but be reminded of Basil Fawlty in A Touch of Class , the Fawlty Towers pilot episode , in which Basil devotes himself to the most obsequious fawning before a ­conman calling himself Lord Melbury .
Enormous cash advances , meticulous service to the exclusion of all other guests – there is simply nothing Basil can't do for his lordship , and the discovery that he has been made a mug of sends him predictably round the bend .
And so with our serially fawning government , which might be lashing out now , but whose forelock - tugging inferiority complex has been a defining characteristic .
It was n't just our special give - and - take relationship with George Bush 's government ( we gave , they took ) .
Rather , it runs like a brown thread through the years since 1997 .
It was there in Peter Mandelson 's famous ­declaration that New Labour was " intensely relaxed about people ­becoming filthy rich " – a styling meant to radiate progressive sophistication but which came off sounding like a fifth - former trying to look worldly .
It was there when Labour accepted a donation of a mere £ 100,000 from Richard Desmond – just days after it had waved through his £ 125 m purchase of Express Newspapers .
" I gave a cheque for £ 100,000 and they spent £ 113,000 or £ 114,000 on ­advertising , " Desmond crowed later .
" So I made money on the deal . "
This morally bankrupt deference was there at every turn , from the piddling sum the party took from gazillionaire Lakshmi Mittal before sealing a £ 300 m
Romanian steel deal for him , to the fire - sale discounts at which one appeared able to land a peerage .
New Labour 's attempt to come across as market - savvy had all the mockney authenticity of a Guy Ritchie movie .
They did n't ­understand their own market worth ; they were hardly likely to start ­regulating those they clearly regarded as their betters .
Think of the Blairs , and their endless freebie holidays with everyone from Robin Gibb to Silvio Berlusconi .
There go Tony and Cherie , you 'd think , ­grinning out of the holiday photos like a pair of competition winners .
New Labour just looked like … well , small - time crooks is the ­expression , though of course there is n't the ­remotest suggestion that anyone did anything illegal .
As has become painfully clear , the gravest error was to assume that Brown was somehow divorced from this tendency , as opposed to echoing it in his own furtive way with his borrowing habit .
And in the end , it 's the smallness of these people that you can't get away from – the knowledge that Darling will be much more comfortable next week defending his use of second - home allowances than he will his budget .
A rather less comfortable public now feel that the chancellor 's inability to even say the word " cuts " has moved way past being an insult to their intelligence .
Any fool can see that savage slashing must lie ahead , and describing it as " efficiency savings " is a bit like describing Stalingrad as an argument in a car park .
One pettish little tax hike is n't really going to cover it , and we can only leave the last word on the monumental inconsistency to Sybil Fawlty .
" I have had it up to here with you .
You never get it right .
You 're either crawling all over them , licking their boots , or spitting poison at them like some ­Benzedrine puff adder … "
Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in the web interface plugin for the KDE BitTorrent client , KTorrent .
A malicious attacker sending specially crafted parameters to the interface could enable both remote code execution and arbitrary torrent uploads .
Distributed under a GNU General Public license , KTorrent is a torrent client written in C++ for KDE .
Feature wise , the client can compete with other popular clients , supporting protocol encryption , UDP trackers and web - seeding to name a few .
One feature , however , is posing a security threat to the user .
According to a security alert , multiple serious vulnerabilities have been found in the client .
With a severity rated as ‘ High ’ , the vulnerabilities are to be found in the client ’s web interface plugin .
Since the plugin does not successfully restrict access to the clients torrent upload functionality and fails to sanitize request parameters , it is vulnerable to exploitation .
The flaws can allow a malicious remote attacker to send specially crafted parameters to the web interface .
This could enable remote arbitrary torrent uploads along with the possibility of remote code execution , within the same privileges as the KTorrent process itself .
A temporary workaround solution is to disable the web interface plugin .
This can be achieved by clicking “ plugins ” in the config menu and unchecking the “ Web Interface ” checkbox .
Versions affected by this issue are 2.2.8 and earlier , so users updating to the latest version are protected from these security vulnerabilities .
Google does n't talk about its server operations very often ; most of what we know boils down to one word : " big . "
The company lifted the lid ever - so - slightly yesterday ( no April Fool ) , and gave the world a peek inside a data center that 's normally locked up tighter than Fort Knox .
The results ( and the company 's focus ) might surprise you .
Each Google server is hooked to an independent 12V battery to keep the units running in the event of a power outage .
Data centers themselves are built and housed in shipping containers ( we 've seen Sun pushing this trend as well ) , a practice that went into effect after the brownouts of 2005 .
Each container holds a total of 1,160 servers and can theoretically draw up to 250kW .
Those numbers might seem a bit high for a data center optimized for energy efficiency — it breaks down to around 216W per system — but there are added cooling costs to be considered in any type of server deployment .
These sorts of units were built for parking under trees ( or at sea , per Google 's patent application ) .
By using individual batteries hooked to each server ( instead of a UPS ) , the company is able to use the available energy much more efficiently ( 99.9 percent efficiency vs. 92-95 percent efficiency for a typical battery ) and the rack - mounted servers are 2U with 8 DIMM slots .
Ironically , for a company talking about power efficiency , the server box in question is scarcely a power sipper .
The GA - 9IVDP is a custom - built motherboard — I could n't find any information about it in Gigabyte 's website — but online research and a scan of Gigabyte 's similarly named products implies that this is a Socket 604 dual - Xeon board running dual Nocono ( Prescott ) P4 processors .
Consider the board in question : ( you can view a larger version of it here ) .
It 's not officially listed as a Gigabyte product in the company 's database , but there are images of what we might call cousins : the GA - 9ILDR and GA - 9ILDTH .
Based on the shape , socket layout , board component design , and overall characteristics , it seems a safe bet that Google is still using at least some older Nocona Intel hardware in their servers
No offense to Google intended — it 's possible that Prescott - flavored Netburst delivered a unique and significant performance advantage over any other type of server hardware — but color me dubious on that particular proposition .
There are any number of modern server combinations from both Intel and AMD that would offer a higher number of cores - per - socket and better performance - per-watt .
Google is n't saying much about its own upgrade cycle or how long it expects a server to last once purchased , but if the company is serious about offering power - efficient , on - location types of servers , it needs to move away from what was once Intel 's most notorious power - sucking platform .
CNET has additional information on how Google calculates and maintains energy efficiency ; anyone interested in how the company evaluates and ranks these sorts of numbers should definitely have a look .
When the concept of using shipping containers as data centers was first floated , most pundits laughed it off ( save for those who saw the potential of using such centers in disaster - struck areas ) .
With Google and Sun both on board with the idea , it 's a lot less funny , and as existing server storage areas hit max capacity , a lot more practical .
You want to back up your brain and upload it to a cylon body , just the way they will in Battlestar Galactica spinoff Caprica .
Luckily , brains in the Caprica universe are pretty small .
Spoilers !

Here 's a bit of the Caprica script , capturing a dialogue between Joseph Adama ( Admiral Adama 's dad ) and Daniel Graystone ( inventor of the cylons ) which was recently posted in the Syfy forums :
INT .
GRAYSTONE ESTATE - NIGHT
Joesph is sitting at a work table while Daniel carefully takes a SMALL ELECTRONIC DEVICE out of a durable , shock - proof case .
He 's treating the device like it 's extremely fragile .
DANIEL
Gotta hand it to Vergis ... it 's an elegant design .
Fortunately , it 's close enough to our preliminary work that it should n't be too hard for Cyrus to construct a convincing paper trail ...
He barely breathes as he carries the MCP and sets it into a small CRADLE on the table .
Then he seals it behind a GLASS CASE .
Once it 's sealed , Daniel lets out a long breath .
Joseph is unmoved .
DANIEL
You know this has more raw computing power than the three supercomputers at Apollo university combined ?
JOSEPH
( flat ) Does it work ?
DANIEL
I wo n't know that until I try to put it into a robotic body and try to download Zoe - A into it .
JOSEPH
How long ?
DANIEL
Couple days .
Got a surprise for you , though .
Daniel gestures to the FLASH stick over on the work bench , where it 's enmeshed in a maze of circuitry and connections .
DANIEL
Tamara - A is ready to go .
JOSEPH
What .....?
DANIEL
I used Zoe 's original avatar program to search and download any data on Tamara Adams — school records , medical , DNA — well , you 've heard the list .
About 300 megabytes worth .
JOSEPH
( shocked ) You mean ... she 's ... in there ?
DANIEL
( barely hearing him )
You know , the more I work with Zoe 's code , the more I realize she was nothing short of a computer genius ... can't believe I never noticed ...
JOSEPH
I want to see her .
He gestures to a Holoband .
DANIEL
I thought you would .
Go through the yellow door .
Joseph looks over at the Holoband like it suddenly turned into a snake that might bite him .
He gingerly picks it up and puts it on ...

After this , we see that Daniel has created an entire human personality out of that 300 mb of data .
So basically what that means is an entire human consciousness can fit into 300 megabytes .
( Also , apparently , it can be cobbled together out of Google searches and DNA information . )
So the real question is , what does this say about how easy it would be to carry around a human brain or two in your pocket ?
Just to give you some perspective , you can easily buy a 1 gigabyte USB drive for under $ 25 .
A gigabyte is 1000 megabytes , so that means you 've got three brains right there .
Now consider this : A sweet little external hard drive can give you an entire terabyte of memory for about $ 150 bucks .
That 's 1000 gigabytes , and roughly 3333 human brains .
So for $ 150 bucks , you could store 3333 people 's brains in your backpack .
Nice !
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 " 8 K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Also , consider this : A typical 3 - minute song takes up about 5 megabytes of space .
So that means your brain , according to Caprica , can hold about 60 songs .
You are therefore suckier than almost every iPod in the universe .
NEW YORK — George Paz , head of pharmacy - benefits manager Express Scripts Inc. , received compensation worth $ 13.8 million in 2008 , according to an Associated Press analysis of a regulatory filing -- a 19 percent increase from 2007 .
Paz , who is Express Scripts ' president , chief executive and chairman , received a salary of about $ 942,000 and $ 2.5 million in performance - based cash bonuses .
His salary rose 7 percent for the year , and his bonuses increased by 15 percent .
The value of Paz 's stock and options on the dates they were granted rose 21 percent , to $ 10.2 million from $ 8.4 million .
The exercise price for the options is $ 63.84 , but Express Scripts shares finished at $ 60.26 on Thursday .
The stock has not traded at $ 63.84 or higher since Nov. 5 .
Shares of the St. Louis company fell almost 25 percent in 2008 .
However its annual profit grew 37 percent .
Express Scripts is the nation 's third largest pharmacy - benefits manager , but is poised to become the second - largest after agreeing to buy part of WellPoint Inc .
The value of Paz 's other compensation , including a company credit contribution and a contribution to his 401 ( k ) , grew 70 percent , to about $ 195,000 .
His compensation was valued at $ 11.6 million in 2007 .
Paz , who is 53 years old , joined Express Scripts in 1998 , and became president in 2003 .
The Associated Press formula is designed to isolate the value the company 's board placed on the executive 's total compensation package during the last fiscal year .
It includes salary , bonus , performance - related bonuses , perks , above - market returns on deferred compensation and the estimated value of stock options and awards granted during the year .
The calculations do n't include changes in the present value of pension benefits , and they sometimes differ from the totals companies list in the summary compensation table of proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission , which reflect the size of the accounting charge taken for the executive 's compensation in the previous fiscal year .

The Pre is widely seen as a rival to other popular smartphones The Palm Pre will go on sale on 6 June in the US and will only be available on the Sprint network .
The much - anticipated handset will cost $ 199.99 ( £ 129 ) , after a rebate , and buyers must take out a two - year contract when signing up .
Palm said it expected the phone to be available nationwide at launch and has signed up four stores to put the gadget on their shelves .
No date has been given for when the handset will launch in the UK .
Data share First announced at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2009 , the Pre has generated a huge amount of interest largely thanks to Palm 's long history in personal data devices .
The Pre impressed many with its operating system , which is geared towards working with the websites , such as social networks and e-mail services , people use when out and about .
The phone automatically recognises when owners connect to social or e-mail services and builds up a global list of contacts and login details as it is used .
Unlike many other phones , the handset also allows owners to have several different applications running at the same time .
The phone also has an innovative interface based around its touch screen and a " gesture area " below the display .
The phone will use Sprint 's 3G network and buyers are recommended to take out an unlimited data plan as the phone swaps a lot of information back and forth as it is being used .
The phone is widely seen as a rival to other smartphones such as Apple 's iPhone , Android handsets and RIM's Blackberry .
Also on sale at launch will be the wireless charging system .
This will not be included in the basic bundle for the phone but will cost an additional $ 69.99 ( £ 45 ) for the Touchstone dock and cover for the Pre .

An unlikely brew of seaweed and glow - in - the - dark biochemical agents may hold the key to the safe use of transplanted stem cells to treat patients with severe peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) , according to a team of veterinarians , basic scientists and interventional radiologists at Johns Hopkins .
In a preliminary " proof of concept " study in rabbits , Johns Hopkins scientists safely and successfully delivered therapeutic stem cells via intramuscular injections and then monitored the stem cells ' viability once they reached their targets .
A report of the study by Johns Hopkins radiologists is scheduled for presentation at the Society of Interventional Radiology 's 34th annual scientific meeting March 10 .
Stem cells hold promise in treating PAD by reconstituting or increasing the number of blood vessels to replace or augment those choked off by plaque buildup .
A chronic condition that can lead to amputations and even death , PAD is marked by vastly reduced circulation of blood in vessels feeding the legs and other " peripheral " body parts , and affects as many as 10 million Americans .
Many cases can be treated with angioplasty or stents , similar to approaches used in coronary artery disease , but for some patients with extensive disease conventional treatment is not feasible , researchers say .
Among the technical hurdles to improving blood flow in such patients , according to Dara L. Kraitchman , V.M.D. , Ph.D. , associate professor of radiology at Johns Hopkins , is a means of telling doctors whether injected stem cells are staying alive and reaching the right targets to grow and develop into the needed new tissue .
This is critical , Kraitchman says , because the body 's own immune defenses may recognize the potentially helpful donor stem cells as foreign invaders and try to destroy them , and also because traditional radioactive labeling agents , or tracers , which are normally used to track cells , can be toxic to stem cells .
To overcome rejection of the stem cells by the body 's immune system — in this case , rabbit immune systems — they first created a novel " capsule " derived from seaweed , which was used to surround and protect the rabbit stem cells from attack by the host 's immune system .
Within the seaweed capsule , they added X - ray contrast agents to allow the capsules to be seen on X - ray angiography .
Next , they engineered the stem cells within the capsules to produce luciferase , the same bioluminescent chemical produced by fireflies , which is highly visible under bioluminescence imaging .
" Once we were able to trick the immune system into not attacking the cells , we had to know they arrived at their destination and were living , " says Kraitchman .
" We could use standard X - ray angiography of blood vessels to see the transplanted cells .
When they lit up like fireflies at night , we knew they were still alive . "
" Hopefully , this new technology will one day pave the way for treating humans , " says Frank Wacker , M.D. , director of vascular interventional radiology at Hopkins and visiting professor of radiology .
" We look to the day when we will be able to perform targeted delivery of stem cell to treat PAD in patients who may be facing amputation or death . "
It ’s just another post to show how creative Russian person can be while spending time at job .
He makes those things without any glue to amuse coleagues and other local office workers – they do n’t fall down placed like this on the edge of the table .

Belleville - About 60 people attended a panel discussion on resolving marijuana prohibition at the Organic Underground in Belleville last week .
Led by Marc - Boris St. Maurice of NORML Canada ( The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ) , the Thursday night panel featured four speakers : Craig Jones , executive director of the John Howard Society ; Lynne Belle - Isle of the Canadian AIDS Society ; Al Graham of Marijuana Awareness ; and Gary Magwood , local co-ordinator and public relations officer for the Green Party of Canada .
They discussed four areas relating to lifting the prohibition on cannabis .
Panelists expressed mixed views on whether legalization would boost the economy .
St. Maurice pointed out that the prohibition of alcohol was lifted in the 1930s during the Great Depression and initially he believed the answer to the economic downturn would be the legalization of marijuana .
However , through research and discussions , he has come to believe that might not be the case , especially if people were allowed to grow their own plants .
He does , however , believe the money and resources being used on enforcement of the laws could be diverted elsewhere .
Jones agreed , saying reducing the scale of criminality and the rate of conviction would result in a cost saving .
" If the cost goes down people spending money on marijuana will have more money in their pockets to spend elsewhere , " he added .
In discussing the health and medicinal properties of the drug , St. Maurice pointed out the " hypocrisy " of medical marijuana being restricted because recreational use is prohibited .
Cannabis is beneficial in the treatment of a number of conditions including epilepsy , multiple sclerosis , and aiding digestion .
The seeds also contain protein and the oil contains essential fatty acids .
Belle - Isle , who was part of the committee that developed Health Canada 's Medical Marijauna Program , said the program came about because of a court decision making it a constitutional right after people said it was their medicine of choice .
She said the plant has been used medicinally for millennia .
Currently the stigma and lack of knowledge creates barriers even for those people licensed by Health Canada to use the drug .
Belle - Isle said there is even a lack of scientific knowledge as there is only one source of the plant available for research through Health Canada , although there are different varieties grown elsewhere .
" Prohibition is slowing down research , " she said .
In a show of hands more than 10 people at the session indicated they were medicinal marijuana users .
One woman who revealed she was an addict said cannabis provides an alternative to the methadone and morphine used to treat her drug habit .
Jones said it is difficult to study the health benefits as the drug is " psychoactive across a range of conditions . "
He said when this type of medicine is brought into the picture many people in the medical community " get freaked out . "
Belle - Isle said there is no known toxic doses of cannabis and it is safe compared to even table salt , one reason she is comfortable advocating for the plant to be viewed as a natural health product rather than a pharmaceutical .
" Theoretically you would have to have 1,500 pounds in 15 minutes to kill yourself , " Belle - Isle said .
She also said HIV studies have shown that cannabis has very little interaction with other medications .
Graham , a Campbellford resident who has Crohn 's disease , said he uses medicinal marijuana to help with pain , appetite , sleep , and for the calming affect , as stress is a big part of the disease .
He said even for someone with a licence it can be difficult to get a doctor to agree to prescribe cannabis and there is still the stigma of using it .
Magwood mentioned what he called a " really interesting dichotomy " - Veterans Affairs Canada has begun to cover the costs of medicinal marijuana for some veterans and soldiers coming back from war .
As for evidence that people with existing mental health issues can have those exacerbated by cannabis , Jones said the same is true of alcohol .
" All drugs are harmful to some people , in some doses in some circumstances , " Jones said , adding cannabis is one of the safest .
" If cannabis caused psychosis we would see a lot more . "
He said the longer use of cannabis if put off , until late teens or early twenties , the less risk there is of developing problems .
St. Maurice said he thinks the government is scared to research cannabis because it will find positive aspects to something it has been against for 75 years or so .
In a discussion on social justice and marijuana use , St. Maurice said prohibition exercises a negative affect on society by labelling millions of cannabis users as criminals .
As a political scientist and democrat , Jones said he believes the government needs to find a way to " re-regulate " illicit drugs , saying the most harm they cause arises through prohibition .
" Organized crime and organized repression are the two most anti-democratic things , " Jones said .
St. Maurice said harsher penalties around cannabis discourage small growers and result in more hardcore use and criminal activity .
Jones said Canadians are more fortunate than people in some other countries as there are millions of users but only tens of thousands of arrests and even fewer convictions .
In order to enact policy change St. Maurice believes conversations need to take place and language needs to be developed to approach and convince those who do n't understand the issue .
Belle - Isle said when she discusses her work at social gatherings people show a " thirst for knowledge . "
She said people need to be able to talk about the issue .
" I'm a strong believer in social norms and I do n't think the model now is good for our children , " Belle - Isle said .
She said being introduced to alcohol at home as a teenager by having a glass of wine with dinner and having her first beer with her dad did n't create a need to go out and get drunk when she reached legal age .
Jones said the John Howard Society does not want to encourage more cannabis use , rather moderate and safe use .
He also does not want to see cannabis or any other drug fall into the private sector .
He said he favours a regulated supply of some kind .
" In my opinion the most important thing with re-regulation would be to take it out of the hands of criminals and out of the hands of police , " Jones said .
Using the analogy of gay rights , Magwood encouraged people to " come out " about cannabis use .
" Make it part of everyday conversation , make it normal , " he said .
He also advocated for people to lobby politicians at every level .
Jones said the letter that goes to the top of the pile is one to your MP indicating you are thinking of changing your vote .

Q From Benjamin Weatherston :
How does the term three sheets to the wind denote drunkenness ?
A It ’s a sailor ’s expression , from the days of sailing ships .
The terminology of sailing ships is excessively complicated and every time I refer to it people write in to say I ’ve got it wrong , usually contradicting each other .
So treat what follows as a broad - brush treatment , open to dispute on fine points .
We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail , but it ’s actually a rope ( always called a line in sailing terminology ) , or sometimes on really big ships a chain , which is attached to the bottom corner of a sail .
The word actually comes from an Old English term for the corner of a sail .
The sheets were as vital in the days of three - masted square - rigged sea-going ships as they are today , since they trim the sail to the wind .
If they run loose , the sail flutters about in the wind and the ship wallows off its course out of control .
Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave , staggering back to the ship after a good night on the town , well tanked up .
The irregular and uncertain locomotion of these jolly tars must have reminded onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose .
Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image across , so the speakers borrowed the idea of a three - masted sailing ship with three sheets loose , so the saying became three sheets in the wind .
Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life , Pierce Egan , in his Real life in London of 1821 .
But it must surely be much older .
The version you give , incidentally , is comparatively recent , since the older one ( the only one given in the big Oxford English Dictionary ) is three sheets in the wind .
However , online searches show that your version is now much more as common than the one containing in , so it may be that some day soon it will be the only one around .
The version with to seems to be gaining ground because so many people think that a sheet is a sail .
SAN DIEGO — Lenders filed a record number of mortgage default notices against California homeowners during the past quarter , a real estate tracking firm said today .
A total of 135,431 default notices were sent out during the quarter ending March 31 , an 80 percent jump from 75,230 for the prior quarter and up 19 percent from 113,809 in the year - ago period , according to MDA DataQuick .
Recorded default notices previously peaked in the second quarter of 2008 at nearly 122,000 , according to DataQuick statistics , which go back to 1992 .
Default notices are the first step in the formal foreclosure process .
The firm said the increase in the most recent quarter was likely due to the ongoing recession and to lenders playing catch - up after a temporary lull in foreclosure activity .
“ The nastiest batch of California home loans appears to have been made in mid- to late 2006 , and the foreclosure process is working its way through those , ” said John Walsh , DataQuick president .
Of the 3 million home loans made in 2006 , 8.5 percent have so far resulted in default .
There were 94,240 default notices in the third quarter of 2008 , when a new state law took effect requiring lenders to take added steps aimed at keeping troubled borrowers in their homes .
DataQuick said the number of homes lost to foreclosure was 43,620 during the first quarter of this year .
That was down 5.5 percent from 46,183 for the prior quarter , and down 7.6 percent from 47,221 for first - quarter of 2008 .
The figure hit 79,511 during the third quarter of 2008 before dropping due to temporary policy changes by lenders .
Foreclosure resales have become a significant factor in the housing market , accounting for 58.1 percent of all California resale activity last quarter .
A year ago it was 33.1 percent .
You 'll know about Ikea .
It 's the place you drive to on a Saturday to fill your house with bits of wood from foreign lands .
This week , they played a little April Fool 's joke , with some viral marketing about launching a new " Leko flatpack car " .
When unveiled it turned out to be a computerised car - sharing scheme in France .
Not a new one , but a special customised service from an established car - sharing service designed to get more customers to Ikea stores .
Now , I am in favour of car - sharing .
Anything to keep down the number of cars clogging up Ikea car parks must be good .
But this story is a bit like the one I did on Disney theme parks a couple of weeks ago .
It is green tinsel on a business model that is all about persuading people to make long carbon - intense journeys to buy their products .
The telling statistic was at the back end of the company press release : " 5.8 % of Ikea France 's customers already used a shared form of transport to get to their preferred store . "
So 94.2 % do n't .
Allowing for the odd walker and cyclist , that must mean around 90 % drive .
That 's the problem , Ikea .
You build your stores in places out of town that are ill - served by public transport .
You slap a big delivery charge on any who do n't want to take their own furniture home ( £ 60 in my case , I notice ) .
And then you try and get greenie points for making it slightly less hard to reach them in an environmentally acceptable manner .
It wo n't wash .
The car - sharing scheme is part of a rather haphazard greenwash strategy that has been going on at Ikea for a while .
Last week its website announced that " Ikea has signed up to WWF 's Earth Hour 2009 . "
Earth
Hour is an annual event promoted by the environment group WWF in which we are all encouraged to turn off our lights for an hour as an expression of support for cutting greenhouse gas emissions and halting climate change .
This year that hour was from 8.30 pm on 28 March .
Ikea did n't turn all its store lights out .
It might have been bad for business .
Instead it " turned all lighting in - store to minimum levels consistent while maintaining a safe working environment for co-workers and customers . "
Should n't they do that all the time ?
Or , since only half of their UK stores stay open that late on a Saturday , they could have shut the rest , allowing all the lights to go out .
Just a thought .
In any event , I am not quite sure why WWF allowed lights - on Ikea to use its logo to promote how it had " signed up to " ( but not obeyed , obviously ) the Earth Hour .
Nor why it gave Ikea gratuitous publicity on its own site for half - heartedly complying with the Earth Hour .
Well , actually I am fairly sure .
Ikea and WWF have a long - term " business relationship " .
Ikea gives cash and a few environmental initiatives , while WWF gives green kudos and some environmental advice .
The panda logo is all over the Ikea website .
Ikea is all over WWF 's website .
There have been some hard questions asked about this relationship among other green groups .
The Environmental Investigation Agency , for instance , recently pointed out that Ikea has not even managed to stamp out the use of illegally logged timber in its furniture , especially all those flat - packs supplied from China .
Worse , the company has been actively opposing US laws set to come into force in July aimed at banning imports of illegally logged timber .
Unless the company gets it overturned , every piece of furniture sold in an Ikea store in the US will be required to have a paper trail showing where the wood came from .
Even though other companies claim to be able to meet the rules , Ikea told federal regulators that " trying to trace this information to certify compliance all the way through the supply chain to the harvesting of each and every tree is unrealistic . "
For unrealistic , read expensive .
Perhaps WWF should give back that sponsorship money and ask Ikea to spend it checking its supply chains .
Or is that " unrealistic " too ?
Who are the real greenwashers this week ?
Well , I think WWF should share the accolade with Ikea , for services rendered .

Until recently , Emmanuel Rodriguez worked on a stage , under bright lights , amid intense competition and before cheering fans .
He was a professional video - game player , and a world champion .
Now he works at the customer service desk of a Sam ’s Club in Dallas .
Rodriguez , a brash 23 - year - old whose nickname in the gaming community is Master , dominated an international field in July in Dead or Alive 4 , a popular fighting game , on the Microsoft Xbox 360 .
He picked up $ 5,000 and a trophy for the victory .
The competition , held in Los Angeles , was part of the world individual finals of the Championship Gaming Series , a league started two years earlier by News Corporation and DirecTV .
And Rodriguez , given his success and his swagger , was a star .
As a designated franchise player , he received a base salary of $ 30,000 .
During the regular season , he lost only one match , good enough to be named North American most valuable player .
For Rodriguez and others like him around the world , playing video games had become a career .
That , however , has changed for many players .
Video games may be as popular as ever  people in more than 65 percent of American households play , according to the Entertainment Software Association  but the professional sport of gaming has nearly collapsed .
Why does the media abort adult stem cell success stories ?
Just days after President Obama was sworn into office , biotech company Geron received FDA permission to conduct clinical trials to see if embryonic stem cells can treat spinal - cord injuries .
The media covered this story extensively , but completely ignored an earlier announcement that American and Ecuadorian researchers have discovered a way to treat similar spinal - cord injuries using adult stem cells harvested from bone marrow .
Critics , of course , say that harvesting embryonic stem cells requires the destruction of human life .
“ Geron ’s future human trial made huge news , ” said Wesley Smith , senior fellow at the Discovery Institute .
“ But a successful human treatment for the same condition has been ignored by the mainstream media .
Why the news blockade ?
Wrong kind of stem cells , apparently . ”
“ This is just further evidence , ” said Dawn Vargo , bioethics analyst for Focus On the Family , “ that some members of the media continue to promote the agenda of embryonic stem cell research – at the cost of young human lives and at the cost , and even detriment , of helping patients . ”
Is it true that numerous breakthroughs have been made with adult stem cells , and that zero breakthroughs have been made with embryonic stem cells ?
The media might not want to know , but we do .

Sayonara , Sanjay : CNN's Dr. Gupta will not be Surgeon General Agence France - Presse
Published : Thursday March 5 , 2009
Print This Email
This CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta withdrew his name from consideration to be president - elect Barack Obama 's surgeon general and serve as chief overseer of Americans ' health , according to reports Thursday .
Two months after CNN first announced that Gupta was in the running for the high - profile post , the news network cited an administration official as saying Gupta had bowed out .
" Sanjay Gupta was under serious consideration for the job of surgeon general , " the unnamed official was quoted as saying via email to CNN .
" He has removed himself from consideration to focus more on his medical career and his family .
We know he will continue to serve and educate the public through his work with media and in the medical arena . "
Gupta , a neurosurgeon who is well known from his television and print reporting on medical matters , was said to have caught the administration 's eye with his communications skills and his past experience in government as a White House adviser during the 1990s .
As head of the 6,000 - member Public Health Service Commissioned Corps , the surgeon general acts as the government 's chief spokesperson to educate the public on health issues , but has little direct role in policy - making .
The position is perhaps best known to Americans through the surgeon general 's health warnings printed on all cigarette packets sold in the country .

Neat Tips and Tricks
When you export an image , illustrator will calculate the bounding box of the whole area taken up by your image including the clipping mask and set that as the image area .
This normally leaves a lot of white spacing around the image .
The solution to this problem is simple .
Draw a box in the canvas and define it as the crop area by going to Object > Crop Area >
Make .
This will define the crop area .
So when you export our the image will show only the crop area .

Last night , I had one of the coolest / geekiest experiences of my career , as I got to attend a panel discussion on
" Battlestar Galactica "
at the United Nations ' Economic and Social Council Chamber , featuring Edward James Olmos , Mary McDonnell and producers Ron Moore and David Eick and several UN reps , moderated by Whoopi Goldberg .
After the jump , a breakdown of how the evening went ...
Sci Fi Channel went to the trouble of dressing up every seat in the room with placards designating the 12 Colonies .
Caprica , naturally , was the primo seating area .
I wound up getting a very good view but a very uninspiring colony by sitting in the Leonis section .
At first , we wondered if they were maybe pre-existing props from the series ( maybe from season one 's " Colonial Day " ) , but the corners were n't cropped , and a friend who used to work on the show pointed out that for that to be true , someone would have needed to know this event would be happening before production wrapped almost a year ago , so they could be saved , and that 's unlikely .
By the end of the evening , a lot of the placards had disappeared into people 's bags .
Three things to keep in mind before I get to summarizing the event :
1 . The evening was as much about the UN as about " Battlestar Galactica , " if not moreso .
There were four segments , devoted to issues like human rights , terrorism , and children and armed conflict .
After a clip reel illustrating how the series at one point or another tackled that issue , the UN rep gave a long speech discussing the current state of that problem in our world , often making a token attempt at best to connect their subject to the show .
Then Whoopi tried her best to balance discussing the issue currently and discussing it in the context of " BSG . "
Some of the panelists admittedly had never watched the show before they were invited to do the event , and some of the subjects had only a tangential connection at best ( " BSG " really only dealt with kids and human trafficking in " Black Market " ) , and it felt like a lot of the night was an attempt to introduce " BSG " fans to issues that the UN deals with as opposed to introducing the geo-politically - inclined to " BSG . "
2. Eddie Olmos likes to talk .
The guy 's opinionated , and he 's passionate , and he 'll go on a while .
( Whoopi had to cut him off a few times . )
But he also has a sense of self - deprecation about it .
" You should 've never invited me here , " he admitted , right before he went on a rant about his hatred of the concept of referring to different ethnic groups as " races . "
( Said rant climaxed with him leading the crowd in a call - and - response of " So say we all ! " )
3. Considering 1 & 2 , Whoopi did a very good job .
Obviously , part of her job on " The View " is to try to maintain control of a chaotic discussion among strong personalities , and she 's an unabashed sci - fi fangirl , so she was well - suited to keeping the conversation moving and trying to find a balance between " BSG " talk and UN talk .
Now , onto the four segments :
Human Rights
We started off with clips of Kara torturing Leoben in " Flesh and Bone , " then The Circle conducting their executions in " Collaborators , " and then Lee 's speech in " Crossroads , Part 2 " about how they 've become a gang .
Craig Mokhiber , Deputy Director of the New York office of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights , seemed the most plugged - in to the show of all the UN reps , making several references to the show -- " We are all Cylons , " he said at one point , while discussing the idea that we dehumanize our enemies to allow ourselves to do horrible things to them , " Every one of us is a Cylon , and every one of us is a Colonial . "
Moore and Eick talked a lot about Leoben getting waterboarded , and Eick noted that they went out of their way to make it ambiguous whether he actually had the nuke Kara was looking for , which made it even harder to get on her side as she tortured him .
This segment is when Eddie 's rant about race happened , because Mokhiber quoted the founding documents of the human rights office in his speech , and it contained references to different races .
When the mic got turned back to Mokhiber a few minutes later , he seemed mortified and went out of his way to explain that the document he was quoting was 60 years old , and featured other outmoded terminology like referring to the two " sexes . "
And he said he would support any effort to get that language changed .
" When a bug does n't like you , " Eddie said in response to the offer , " that 's racism . "
" That is so deep , I 'm going to take a question ( from the audience ) now , " Whoopie interjected .
There were a few hundred NYC high school students in the crowd , and they were occasionally allowed to ask questions , starting with one about whether our current obsession with technology could lead to the creation of actual Cylons .
Moore cleverly brought this back on topic by noting that we 're a few years away from actual artificial intelligence , and that there 's going to come a point where we have to decide whether to extend human rights to artifical but self - aware creations .
Children and Armed Conflict
Again , this one had very little connection to the show , and the UN rep , Radhika Coomerswamy , admitted she had only watched a couple of episodes to prep for the panel , and was pleasantly surprised to find it was " a deeply moral show " and not just a showcase for special effects .
Whoopi adroitly picked up on some of Coomerswamy 's stories about horrific things done to young girls in war - torn countries and used that to spin the discussion around to gender on " Galactica . "
Moore and Eick talked for a while about how , once they made Starbuck a woman , they decided they wanted her to not be the first female Viper jock , but one of many , in a gender - neutral society , in which all the female officers were called " sir , " and in which gender - related epithets were never used .
( The closest they came , they admitted , was whenever someone would dismiss Laura Roslin as " a schoolteacher . " )
One of the student questions went back to the human rights discussion , asking Mary whether she thought that Roslin was committing crimes when she threw people out of airlocks .
Mary said she did , and that it troubled her personally , but that in character , she was absolutely committed to the belief that it was necessary .
" Mary can say she was haunted by airlocking , " said Eick , " But she was the one who made it a verb . "
Eddie noted that they had deliberately made Laura " the 214th person in line to get this job , " and Mary , mock indignant , interrupted to check with Moore that she was , in fact , the 43rd person in line for it .
After another monologue about whether the UN should intercede with the problems in Mexico , Eddie talked about how he as Adama never listened to Roslin on military - related decisions , " And that was a mistake . "
Moore said they wanted to explore how fragile the law is at times of war , and Eick noted , " You get a brief glimpse into the dynamics of the set when you hear Mary refer to the President as ' Laura , ' and Eddie refers to the Admiral as ' I . ' "
Terrorism
Whoopi noted that we were running way behind at this point , so the last two segments were briefer than the first two .
The clip reel , not surprisingly , focused on the New Caprica arc and Roslin and Saul Tigh 's debate about suicide bombing .
Moore said he wanted Tigh to have a strategic rationale for ordering the bombings , that it would be much more frightening if he was logical than if he was crazy .
Reconciliation and Dialogue Among Civilizations and Faiths
There was a lot of talk here about the decision to make the Cylons ( the ostensible villains ) the monotheists and the humans the polytheists .
Moore said it happened almost by accident .
He was writing a Caprica Six scene in the miniseries and , on a whim , had her say , " God is love , " and a Sci Fi Channel executive liked the line and told him to run with it .
" The network wanted more religious tension , " said Eick .
" How often do you hear that ? "
" Other than on my show , " said Whoopi .
They started wrapping up .
Moore said that he wanted the show to entertain , but also to make people think -- that even if people came out of episodes like " Flesh and Bone " or " Occupation " with the same beliefs they had when they went in , " at least you thought about it . "
Eddie talked about the incredible journey , how they made 84 hours of television .
There are some shows or movies that you spend time watching , or working on , where you might regret those lost hours when you 're on your deathbed , and he did n't think either those who watched or worked on this show would feel that way .
Mary said she felt " honored to have participated in such profound simplicity , " and she and Eddie both expressed their gratitude for being able to participate in an event like this .
And on a lighter closing note , Whoopie said , " I thank God for the word ' Frak , ' " which she 's used a few times on " The View , " to the confusion of her co-stars .
Finally , let me remind you once again that this is not a political blog , and any comment by someone who jumps on here to complain about the UN , or US foreign policy , or anything else unrelated to " BSG " itself will be deleted .
Period .
I 'm halfway tempted to just turn off comments for this post , as I 'm afraid the political talk will be unavoidable , so just know I 'm going to have a quick trigger finger today .
You thought Fox News was Bad
Americans are the most informed people in the world .
If they are not on the internet , they are watching tv , and if they ’re not watching tv or on the internet they ’re listening to the radio driving their SUV that is stuck in traffic .
Americans are the most uninformed people in the world .
The average fat and lazy American sits around and takes in multiple forms of media .
On the television they watch American news stations which broadcast all the happenings from the skewed perspective of Jewish owned news media .
On the radio they listen to social outcasts on NPR who talk about everything under the sun which matters to other social outcasts .
On the internet with regards to news , there are 2 types of Americans .
1 . Americans who visit the websites of the Jewish owned news media stations and 2 .
Americans who view Digg , Reddit and other social websites such as facebook , technorati , etc. etc .
There is no other way to put it , people who use Digg and Reddit which are the largest bookmarking sites are complete and total losers !
These people have no motivation to find the meaning of life so they find the most insignificant stories about some complete hogwash and then comment about it .
These immature comments from immature idiots are then rated by other complete morons until there is a giant pile of E - fecal matter piled up in cyberspace .
What happens is these Diggers and Reddit Retards start looking for different versions of the same story and try to make smart allec comments to get thumbs up from other losers that thing their comment is witty .
The E - fecal matter which is the result of these American “ social bookmarking sites ” is becoming some crude form of reality for these people who could n’t function in a functioning society .
Lucky America is not a functioning society so Digg and Reddit and all other social websites are one of 58 reasons to hate America .

St. John :
If you could just hire anybody from the 3D world , who would you hire ?
Carmack :
Well there 's a big difference between who I consider the most talented and who I would necessarily hire , because you have to hire people that fit right .
If I had to pick who I think is just the most talented , it would probably be Ken Silverman , the guy that did the BUILD engine .
He does engines and tools .
He 's great as an editor .
He writes all the code for everything , and he 's just extremely talented .
I think it was 3D Realms ' worst decisions not to coddle him , or whatever it took , to keep him on board .
I think if he was still working directly for 3D Realms , they would have a Quake - type game shipped by now , just because he 's extraordinarily good .
There 's maybe a half dozen people that are top - notch A - level 3D programmers .
I 'm not going to give you a list because I 'd leave somebody off and they'd be all pissed off at me .
St. John :
You 've already left off 90 % of them by naming Ken Silverman .
Carmack :
All the people doing things that people are talking about now are pretty talented .
The Epic people have been working on it for a long time .
They 've gone through a big learning process , but they 've got the issues under control and they 're going to ship a product .
St. John :
So you think one day Tim Sweeney might grow to be as successful as you .
Carmack :
It 's hard to become successful by following in footsteps .
This is probably going to come out sounding demeaning , but Epic wants Unreal to be Quake .
Everything they did with Unreal , they did because they wanted it to be like what Quake turned out to be .
And they 're going to achieve a lot of that , because they 're doing a lot of things well , but you 're just never as big when you 're second in line .
Hook : Just like Dark Forces and Duke were both phenomenal games , they still definitely did n't have the impact of Doom simply because they just were n't first out the gate .
Carmack : Like Prey , there 's a lesson to be learned , something a lot of companies do n't really ever learn .
You hear it from the fan base a lot .
" Do it right .
We 'll still be here .
We 'll wait , " and it 's tempting to just let things slip .
But that 's really not OK .
If you 're doing something cutting edge , you 're making fundamental decisions about your architecture , and if you let it slide for a year or two , then it 's just not the right decision anymore .
Even if you pile on all these extras , it 's not optimal .
It 's not targeted at what you 're doing .
So I have some concerns about Prey coming out this late .

Language is lethal .
The Bush administration ’s legal memos opening the way to torture are a reminder of the intimate link between a bureaucrat ’s lawyerly subordinate clause and a man ’s near drowning .
Now we all know what “ interrogation with enhanced techniques ” means : an insect in a human cage .
Do n’t say what you mean when you mean to do the unspeakable .
That ’s an old rule .
It was perfected in the 20th century from Moscow to Buenos Aires .
Opacity is the refuge of the faceless tormentor .
The constitutions of totalitarian states are always unreadable , impenetrable — and very long .
In a thicket of words lies plausible deniability when the time for horror ’s accounting arrives .
That hour always comes around .
I keep re-reading some of the sentences in the memos from the dark side .
Like a labyrinth , they lead back in on themselves : “ You have , however , informed us that you expect these techniques to be used in some sort of escalating fashion , culminating with the waterboard , though not necessarily ending with this technique . ”
MILWAUKEE - MillerCoors said Wednesday that growing its premium light brands , including slumping flagship brew Miller Lite , will be key to its success .
MillerCoors Chief Executive Leo Kiely told a gathering of analysts that MillerCoors , a joint operation between Molson Coors Brewing Co. and SABMiller 's U.S. unit , is cutting costs despite high input costs and a weak economy .
MillerCoors , which started operating in July , is on track to meet its target of saving $ 500 million in costs by 2011 .
But key to the company 's long - term growth , he said in comments webcast from New York , will be expanding its top - selling light brands like Coors Light and Miller Lite , which compete in the light beer segment that dominates the U.S. market .
Coors Light has been growing steadily , while Miller Lite sales have been falling .
Miller Lite sales to retailers dropped 7.5 percent in the three - month period ending in December , while Coors Light sales grew 1 percent .
Kiely said Miller Lite slumped because it relies heavily on sales in restaurants and bars - where recession - weary consumers are cutting their spending .
He said Miller Lite 's so - called on - premise business is one - third larger than Coors Light's .
" When that channel gets hit , Miller Lite gets hit , " he said .
The company also shed unprofitable business with that brand and raised pricing , a move that costs volume but will strengthen the business in the long - term , he said .
MillerCoors shared its new Miller Lite ad campaign with investors , saying it will focus on the brand 's taste to woo new consumers .
One ad played for analysts touted the fact that brewers add hops to Miller Lite three times while it is being made .
It also used a slogan familiar with its fans : " Great taste , less filling . "
The company plans to show distributors at a meeting later this month how the taste message will affect every aspect of Miller Lite 's marketing , Kiely said .
" Our long - term success depends on growing this great brand , " he said .
Other executives spoke about growing Molson Coors business in Canada and Britain , two strongholds for the Denver - based brewer that are both hurting .
In Britain , where the company 's Carling brand is the market leader , business is also slumping due to excise taxes and a ban on smoking in pubs , which has been keeping customers away .
Last month Molson Coors reported a lower profit for its fourth quarter , saying higher beer prices were n't enough to safeguard it from the stronger dollar , high commodity costs and declining sales volumes .
But analysts have a favorable view of the company .
They say consumers in general may be cutting their spending , but alcohol shoppers are trading down to less expensive options like beer , over pricier wine and spirits , which will benefit Molson Coors .
Chief Executive Peter Swinburn told analysts Wednesday the company has a solid foundation and is generating free cash , seeing savings from MillerCoors and building its branding around the world .
That will make it easier to push through price increases to offset high input costs , he said .
" Pricing is not done in isolation , " he said .
" It can only be taken if you 've got strong brands , and you only get strong brands if you invest in them in the long term . "
A " TO eat humble pie " , meaning to admit a mistake , comes from the old English words " numbles " or " umbles " , which refer to the innards or offal of animals , particularly of deer .
They studied the bezoar stones in the numbles of oxen and preached cracked doctrines which , unchecked , might unleash mischief in the world .
Internet traffic dropped sharply in Sweden last week after a new law cracking down on online copyright violation went into force , experts said .
Based on the European Union 's Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Directive , the new law makes it easier to prosecute file - sharers because it requires Internet Service Providers to disclose the Internet Protocol - addresses of suspected violators to copyright owners .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Statistics from the Netnod Internet Exchange , an organisation measuring internet traffic , suggest that daily online activity dropped more than 40 per cent after the law took effect last Wednesday .
Henrik Ponten of the Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau welcomed the plunge in internet traffic as a sign that file - swappers are reducing their activity for fear of getting caught .
" There 's no other explanation for it , " he said .
Some criticised the new law as overzealous and said it puts as risk Sweden 's position as a leader in online technologies .
" Half the internet is gone .
If this pattern keeps up , it means the extensive broadband network we 've built will lose its significance , " said Jon Karlung , chief executive of Banhof , a Swedish ISP .
Sweden has one of the highest internet penetration rates in Europe but has also made a name for itself as a hub of illegal file - sharing .
Twelve hours after the law came into force , five Swedish audio book publishers representing 15 authors filed a request to find out details of a server suspected of containing more than 2,000 illegally downloaded works .
In a separate case , four Swedes linked to one of the world 's most popular file - sharing sites - The Pirate Bay - are on trial on copyright charges .
A verdict is expected this month .
The V8 engine , a symbol of power and prestige for more than a century , is looking more and more like an endangered species .
A panel of powertrain experts speaking on Tuesday at the 2009 SAE World Congress painted a bleak picture for big engines in this era of tightening emission standards and volatile fuel prices .
But smaller engines will not mean drivers have to give up performance .
By combining advanced engine technology , lower vehicle weight , sleeker aerodynamics and more efficient transmissions , smaller engines can replace bigger ones without affecting acceleration and towing performance .
Mary Ann Wright , CEO of the Johnson Controls - Saft joint venture battery company , said the United States has started to move closer to other countries ' emission regulations since the Obama administration took over in January .
She said last week 's proposed EPA finding that greenhouse gases are harmful to humans lays the groundwork for legislation that will see the U.S. reduce carbon dioxide emissions in step with other countries .
" You are going to see the discussion starting to shift to not only reducing fuel consumption but CO2 , " Wright said .
The trend of replacing big engines with smaller ones is under way and presents the best near - term solution for automakers to reduce CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy , SAE several panelists said .
" The cornerstone of our sustainability strategy is EcoBoost , " said Dan Kapp , Ford Motor Co. 's director of powertrain research and advanced engineering .
EcoBoost debuts this spring on the Lincoln MKS luxury sedan .
In that car , the 3.7 - liter engine is replaced by a 3.5 - liter engine equipped with twin turbochargers and direct fuel injection .
Horsepower is rated at 355 - - about the same as a V8 - - but the EcoBoost engine has better fuel economy .
General Motors already has launched vehicles such as the Pontiac Solstice GXP with smaller turbocharged engines .
But Ford plans to make EcoBoost available on 90 percent of its nameplates by 2012 and wants to sell 500,000 EcoBoost vehicles a year in the United States and 750,000 globally by 2014 , Kapp said .
Minoru Shinohara , a senior vice president at Nissan Motor Co. , said technology alone wo n't deliver all that is needed to meet global emissions standards .
A large contributor , he said , can be driver behavior .
Nissan is developing several in - car technologies that warn , prompt or help a driver consume less fuel .
One is a touch pad on the accelerator pedal that pushes back slightly if the driver increases speed too much .
Nissan also has installed in several models a device called an Ecometer that keeps the driver informed about the vehicle 's performance and of road conditions .
" A customer can check his fuel economy performance against other drivers on the Internet , just like a video game , " Shinohara said .
He also described a driver information system called Carwings that Nissan is testing in Los Angeles and Yokohama , Japan .
The system alerts drivers to traffic backups and routes them away from them .
Shinohara said early results show that avoiding congestion delivers an 18 percent fuel economy gain .
Suppliers such as BorgWarner Inc. are working on more efficient turbochargers and transmissions to help vehicles use less fuel .
One system BorgWarner is developing is a chain - driven starter - alternator that could eliminate the old - fashioned rubber fan belt , said Roger Wood , BorgWarner 's executive vice president of turbo and emissions systems .
He also predicted that the application rate of turbochargers on gasoline engines would grow 135 percent by 2014 .
" Turbocharged engines offer 15 percent to 30 percent better fuel economy and as much as 20 percent reduction in CO2 emissions , " Wood said .
Smaller turbocharged engines could account for as much as 20 percent of the market by 2014 , said Uwe Grebe , GM 's executive director for advanced engineering .

Did this question ever occur to you ?
Have you ever been to places that you did n’t know you do not have access to ?
By subscribing to this page , you would be more aware .
We are concerned with giving you the most up - to - date news when it comes to things you could and could n’t visit all over the world .
What is the significance of this ?
Simple .
You wo n’t feel hassled when you are not granted entry to your chosen destination .
You can prevent being stuck in a clash or in a skirmish just in case this is the reason for the holdout of entry to the country of destination .
You can save money , effort and time in making arrangements to that country of destination that is closed to outsiders and driving out of your garage doors in Tulsa .
There are many reasons why a country closes its borders to outsiders .
One , they want to preserve their culture and heritage .
They think that by having outsiders coming in and out of their borders , their culture will be contaminated by others .
They prevent others from having free access to their country so as for them to not easily be influenced .
There are countries that go as far as even restricting the access of their people to the outside world just for the same reason .
Another reason for restricting the entry of outsiders in a country is the existing danger in there .
Not only do these countries want to protect the people from other nations , they also want to contain the danger .
This is to prevent the potential disagreement between countries and the possible negotiations just in case a problem like hostage - taking in a country where there is terrorism arises .
There are instances when a nation only closes their doors to a particular country .
In this case , specific nationality is not allowed due to the misunderstanding between the country of their origin and the country of their destination .
This is not settled easily unless these two countries come to an understanding .
Most often than not , this takes years .
As a consequence , that is how long would the entry restriction also last .
Awareness of the areas that are in ‘ closed zone ’ not only would lead you away from harm , this would also enable you to find an alternative especially if you are going on a vacation or planning to move into this place .
Being in the know about the happenings around the world would also invoke a movement to help those people who live in those areas if necessary .
You can easily send help if you can , or encourage other people to do the same .
By knowing this , you can also know about the dangers that may come to your country .
How near is it to the place of danger ?
What is the extent of the damage that can come to your nation ?
How affected are you in terms of trade ?
Is it possible that your country would become a refuge ?
You ’d know that and more if you stay tuned with Closed Zone .
Paybacks are , well , you know how it goes .
Some of the EU countries may have to explain their own role in the Bush - era rendition policies but demanding that the US lives by the rule of law is what we should expect whether at home or abroad .
Washington Post :
European prosecutors are likely to investigate CIA and Bush administration officials on suspicion of violating an international ban on torture if they are not held legally accountable at home , according to U.N. officials and human rights lawyers .
Many European officials and civil liberties groups said they were disappointed by President Obama ’s opposition to trials of CIA interrogators who subjected terrorism suspects to waterboarding and other harsh tactics .
They said the release last week of secret U.S. Justice Department memos authorizing the techniques will make it easier for foreign prosecutors to open probes if U.S. officials do not .
April 2 , 2009  -- Eric Mohat , 17 , was harassed so mercilessly in high school that when one bully said publicly in class , " Why do n't you go home and shoot yourself , no one will miss you , " he did .
Now his parents , William and Janis Mohat of Mentor , Ohio , have filed a lawsuit in federal court , saying that their son endured name - calling , teasing , constant pushing and shoving and hitting in front of school officials who should have protected him .
The lawsuit -- filed March 27 , alleges that the quiet but likable boy , who was involved in theater and music , was called " gay , " " fag , " " queer " and " homo " and often in front of his teachers .
Most of the harassment took place in math class and the teacher -- an athletic coach -- was accused of failing to protect the boy .
" When you lose a child like this it destroys you in ways you can't even describe , " Eric Mohat 's father told ABCNews.com .
The parents are n't seeking any compensation ; rather , they are asking that Mentor High School recognize their son's death as a " bullicide " and put in place what they believe is a badly needed anti-bullying program .
The lawsuit , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio , names school administrators Jacqueline A. Hoynes and Joseph Spiccia , as well as math teacher Thomas M. Horvath .
None would comment on the allegations .
Parents Say Three Other Students Killed Themselves
The Mohats also claim that bullying was a " significant factor " in the deaths of three other students in Eric Mohat 's class in 2007 .
Mentor high school officials confirmed that a girl and two other boys in Eric 's class had killed themselves in 2007 .
According to Janet Klee , a counselor at Chrysalis , a suicide survivors support group , who counseled two of the surviving families , the suicides were connected to bullying .
" These kids , " said Klee , " were extremely bright , and [ the bullies ] thought they were nerds .
I say that not in a derogative but in a good sense .
These were good kids who were easy targets for bullying . "
Dan Hughes , whose son Brandon was a friend of Eric's , said he had withdrawn his son from Mentor High School after he was relentlessly bullied .
Brandon , now 19 and working , wrote a suicide note , citing the taunts , two weeks after Eric Mohat 's death .
" What it boils down to is the football players , cheerleaders and kids with money have a different set of rules than everybody else , " Hughes told ABCNews.com .
" It 's not that much out of the ordinary , and the disturbing part is the school is more concerned about sweeping it under the rug than getting to the bottom of what 's going on , " he said .
Suicide - Bullying Connection
The National Youth Violence Prevention Resource Center estimates that nearly 30 percent of American youth are either a bully or a target of bullying .
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , which established the resource center after the Columbine shootings in 1999 , every day an estimated 160,000 kids nationwide stay home from school because they are afraid of being bullied .
In addition , researchers at the Yale School of Medicine , in a new review of studies from 13 countries , have found signs of an apparent connection between bullying , being bullied and suicide .
Almost all found connections between being bullied and suicidal thoughts among children .
Five reported that bullying victims were two to nine times more likely to report suicidal thoughts than were other children .
In October , 14 - year - old Jeremiah Lasater , who had been taunted and even had food thrown at him during lunch , locked himself in his Acton , Calif. , high school bathroom and shot himself in the head .
In 2006 , a St. Louis 13 - year - old killed herself in a cyberbullying case .
After she was taunted over the Internet , Megan Meier hanged herself in the closet of her family 's home .
Friends later said the suicide was triggered by a message , " The world would be a better place without you . "
' Twiggy ' Teased With Gay Slurs
Eric Mohat -- whose friends knew him as " Twiggy " for his lean , 6 - foot - 1 - inch , 112 - pound physique -- had a dry wit and musical talent , according to his mother , Jan Mohat .
He had played piano for 13 years , enjoyed video games , anime , Harry Potter books and " cracking puzzles . "
" By all indications he was a very nice , typical high school kid , kind of quiet and shy , but outgoing with his little group of friends , " said the family 's lawyer Ken Myers .
" He seemed to have a quirky sense of humor and was also very sensitive . "
The bullying " accumulated over time , " Myers told ABCNews.com .
" In math class , two or three picked on him constantly and mercilessly .
Most of it was verbal , but they did some things like sitting behind him and flicking him in the ear , sticking stuff in his hoodie and putting eraser shavings on his head .
Out of class they would shove him in lockers . "
Much of the taunting was related to him being considered gay , though Eric Mohat 's parents said the teen " did n't identify himself that way , " Myers said .
" He may have looked effeminate , was in theater and would wear bright clothes , " said Myers .
" He was a skinny kid , and so the kids found something that bothered him and went for that . "
The parents say Eric Mohat routinely ignored the teasing but complained to the teacher , who responded by moving the bullies ' desks .
" The next day , they were back and it made it worse , " said Myers .
" They may have thought he was a snitch and the parents did n't know how bad it was . "
Bullies Showed No Remorse
But March 29 , 2007 , one bully pushed Eric Mohat too far with a remark about killing himself , the lawsuit alleges .
The teen took a legally registered gun from his father 's bureau drawer , locked himself in his room and shot himself in the head .
At the time , Eric Mohat 's older sister , Erin , was on a treadmill exercising .
His after - school employer called their home to find out why he had not shown up at work .
Erin Mohat found her brother 's body in his bedroom and called 911 .
Now 21 , his sister is studying to be a school psychologist , something Jan Mohat said is now " a calling . "
" My sister is my hero , " Eric Mohat had written on his MySpace page , though she was too late to save him .
Later authorities found a story Eric Mohat had begun to write about bullying .
Days before , he had told his mother about the nonstop taunts in both class and in the hallways of the high school .
The family said school officials had been resistant to cooperate in the investigation and had insisted bullying was not a problem ; the bullies never showed remorse .
" This is the first we heard that a suit was filed , " said Justin Maynor , communications director for the Mentor Public School District .
" We had a hunch it was coming . "
Mentor High School , with 2,900 students , is one of the largest high schools in Ohio .
It sits in a predominantly white , upper middle - class community surrounded by malls , 30 miles east of Cleveland .
In February 2008 , the school beefed up security after a threat of violence , according to a report in the Cleveland Plain Dealer .
One commenter on the newspaper 's Web site responded , " Well , in my opinion , Mentor High is entirely too large and too crowded .
... With all those kids crammed in there , there 's bound to be some fights . "
But school officials said that was an isolated incident .
" Generally , there is a very low incidence of violence at the school , " said Maynor .
" Considering its population , it 's a relatively serene place . "
Maynor confirmed that there had been " several " student suicides in the " last couple of years , " but he said that they had no connection to bullying .
He said the school had " come a long way " in combating bullying and addressing " social sensitivities . "
School Says No Bully Problem
" We do n't believe it 's a problem , " Maynor told ABCNews.com .
" We have a program of anti-bullying education to raise awareness for students about what constitutes bullying and differences among students . "
The school uses the Olweus Anti-bullying program , but the Mohats said the program is ineffective for high school students .
According to Olweus , which is based at Clemson University in Georgia , the program is designed for elementary and middle school children .
" The basic idea of Olweus is that a lot of kids are acting as bullies because they feel bad about themselves and it raises self - esteem , " Mohat said .
" But when a 200 - pound linebacker hits a 100 - pound kid , how can it help ?
He 's already the alpha male in building . "
A 2007 review of the Olweus program in the Journal of Adolsecent Health concludes that it " had some mixed positive effects varying by gender , ethnicity / race and grade but no overall effect . "
The Mohats allege that school officials urged students not to cooperate with the police investigation .
" Nobody would take this seriously , " said Myers .
" We saw this horrendous bullying and no one could stop it . "
The family was " trying to pick up the pieces and move on " when they learned there were other suicides in Eric Mohat 's class that year , according to Myers .
After the police investigation , the family wanted to " hold school officials accountable . "
With the second anniversary of Eric Mohat 's death and what would have been his 19th birthday this month , Jan Mohat said , " You could accept it if it were an accident , but the way he went is just not right . "
" According to the kids who talked to us , his class was hell on earth , " she said .
But school officials took the attitude that " they are just being kids , boys are just being boys . "
" When he came on and told us about what going on , I said I need to be involved , but he said , ' No , it 's under control , ' that the teacher had caught them and handled it , " said his mother .
But days before the suicide , Eric Mohat told his mother , " I get picked on every day and I 've got a whole nine weeks left .
I can't do this anymore . "
" We never had a chance to help him , " she said , choking back tears .
" It should n't require legal action to get the school system to pay more attention to bullying than they do to their sports programs , " said his father .
" How many suicides is enough ? "

The internet is abuzz with talk of Khamisa Sawadi , a 75 - year - old Syrian widow living in Saudi Arabia who was sentenced to 40 lashes and 4 months in jail for the crime of khalwa , being alone with a man who is not her relative .
The verdict , issued on March 3rd , also demands that Sawadi be deported after serving her sentence .
Sawadi ’s husband was Saudi Arabian .
According to Arab News :
The elderly woman met the men [ … ] after she asked one of them to bring her five loaves of bread . [ … ]
The men — [ her late husband ’s ] nephew , Fahd Al - Anzi , and his friend and business partner , Hadiyan bin Zein [ both aged 24 ] — went to Sawadi ’s home in the town of Al - Shamli .
Suleiman Al - Radhiman , director of the Hail office of the commission , told Al - Watan that his officials detained the woman after receiving a written message that two men had entered her house .
He pointed out that police had arrested the woman on two previous occasions .
Bin Zein said the commission officials arrested them about 200 meters from the woman ’s house .
“ There were six commission members who all had their faces covered . ”
The widely read CNN article ( which made the top 10 most dugg stories yesterday ) says the men were caught inside the house by one policeman , which does n’t really make sense .
Why would a member of the virtue police suddenly enter an old woman ’s house ?
The answer : they did n’t .
A little more research would be helpful CNN .
And who exactly wrote the message ?
And Sawadi was arrested twice before ?
Why ?
What makes the situation worse is the fact that Sawadi insists that Al - Anzi is her son , since she breastfed him as a child and in Islam breastfeeding gives a degree of maternal relation .
But since she has no ‘ proof , ’ she can not claim he is a relative .
( Interestingly , the court ca n’t have evidence that she did n’t ) .
So - called “ Islamic ” law was enough to charge her , but not to clear her name ?
According to Yahoo !
News , the court based it ’s verdict on “ citizen information ” and testimony from Al - Anzi ’s father , her late husband ’s brother (! ) , who accused her of “ corruption . ”
Maybe he just did n’t realize his son would also get sentenced to 40 lashes and 4 months in jail ?
( The business partner got 60 lashes and 6 months ) .
Sawadi ’s verdict read :
Because she said she does n’t have a husband and because she is not a Saudi* , conviction of the defendants of illegal mingling has been confirmed .
So if she was married and a Saudi Arabian it would have been okay ?
Her birth place and marital status make her guilty ?
I ca n’t help but wonder at Saudi Arabia ’s continued attempts at shooting itself in the foot .
The Saudi Arabian judiciary and the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice ( CPVPV ) have once again come under fire .
Al - Watan , the Saudi paper which first covered the issue , actually interviewed Sawadi back in June 2008 , who has not spoken to the press since her verdict was handed down .
They quote her as saying the CPVPV entered her house under false pretences to investigate her :
They used deceit and explotation of my old age and poverty by saying they were from a charity organization .
One was short and one was tall .
They said they were there to see if I needed any financial or in - kind donations .
I had called my son Fahd to get me bread and he did .
I am a poor woman without air conditioning in my house and I only have my son from breastfeeding .
When they left they were arrested for helping out an old woman .
Laila Ahmed al - Ahdab , a columnist in the paper , wrote :
How can a verdict be issued based on suspicion ?
A group of people are misusing religion to serve their own interests .
Media reports covering Sawadi ’s case are varied .
One article comments :
It is not known if the religious police really believed the men were behaving improperly with a woman old enough to be their grandmother or if the prosecutions were just a matter of principle .
Some articles blur the line between Saudi Arabia ’s interpretation of Islam with Islam , calling Sawadi ’s punishment “ Shari ’a law , ” and not a country ’s interpretation of what Shari ’a law would look like .
Almost all the articles make sure to mention that in Saudi Arabia women can’t drive , need a male relative ’s permission to travel , etc .
Others make sure to mention some or all of the most recent ( negative ) stories in Saudi Arabia featuring women , including the Qatif girl rape case who was sentenced for gang rape , the case of two novelists last week who were questioned for wanting to get a female writer ’s autograph , the 8 - year - old married to a 58 - year - old man who was denied divorce until she reaches puberty etc .
Others still mention several unrelated stories about Saudi Arabia , such as Saudi Sheik Saleh Lihedan who condoned killing TV channel owners that broadcast “ immoral ” content , just to plug in how “ crazy ” the country is .
An interesting thing I ’ve noticed when reading blog posts about the issue is the degree to which Sawadi’s age affects people ’s impressions of the charge .
A story published today in the Al - Watan newspaper reports that a Saudi woman and man were arrested yesterday for being alone together in a car ( car chase and accident ensued ) , and many of the commentators accepted this , saying the man and woman deserved to be punished because they were being ‘ sinful . ’
But Sawadi’s age makes a huge difference , say some bloggers .
If it was a young woman alone with two men in an apartment , the situation might be different .
If the men had spent a long time in the apartment , it would be different , and so on .
I have n’t come across one post that heavily critiques the punishment for khalwa , especially when nothing was going on !
The only article I read about the Sawadi case which was somewhat balanced , trying to show that it ’s all not doom and gloom in Saudi Arabia was in the LA Times , by Raed Rafei , specifically stating that :
A handful of changes in the past two months suggests an increase of freedoms for women , activists say .
It linked to an interesting article in the Middle East Online talking about Saudi women activists in Saudi Arabia .
Rafei goes on to mention the fact that :
King Abdullah appointed last month the first woman to a ministerial post . [… ]
He recently dismissed a leading fundamentalist cleric and the head of the kingdom ’s religious police , Sheik Ibrahim Ghaith .
The monarch also removed Sheik Saleh Lihedan as chief of the country ’s highest religious tribunal .
The man issued a fatwa in September saying it was permissible to kill TV executives for broadcasting “ evil ” and immoral programs .
The latter fact being one other articles opted to ignore when they mentioned Sheik Saleh Lihedan .
It ’s still not enough , as Sabria Jawhar , the once Jeddah bureau chief of the Saudi Gazette and leading Saudi Arabian columnist , writes :
For every [ one success story ] there are 100 Khamisa Sawadis .
For every female Saudi graduate student studying abroad , there are 100 other Saudi women denied their right to divorce abusive husbands or to gain custody of their children .
A Saudi delegation can stand before the United Nation ’s Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and provide a laundry list of all the good things the Saudi government has done for their women .
But closer scrutiny of Khamisa Sawadi , the Qatif Girl , forced divorces and the countless 13 - year - old brides married off to men four times their age tarnishes the appointments of Saudi women to high places .
While we have seen remarkable changes recently in the general presidency of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice and a new chief justice of the Supreme Judicial Council , it ’s the judges in court that seem to have lost sight of their religious and social obligations and revert to tribal customs . *
There is no religious prohibition preventing women from driving yet we are forced to mingle with unrelated men who are employed as our drivers .
If Sawadi is guilty of mingling with men who are not her close relatives , then 95 percent of the Saudi women are guilty of the same thing .
Imagine if the laws , as interpreted by the Saudi courts , were administered in an equitable manner .
[ Some ] judges [ parse ] every word of a Hadith to reach a verdict [ they ] had already decided on or [ are those ] who will succumb to tribal pressures .
But they ’re still steps on the road to reform .
Let ’s hope King Abdullah steps in and overrules Sawadi ’s sentence , and that of the men who were only running her an errand .
* emphasis mine .
“ I ca n’t remember having had a positive wine - by - the - glass experience unless the bottle was freshly opened , ” he said .
“ As an owner , you also come to realize how wasteful wine by the glass becomes .
As a result your pricing has to reflect that waste , so most places serve cheap wine with big markups for glass pours , which equals bad value for consumers . ”
Then it hit him .
“ Why ca n’t we just serve good wine out of a keg like we do with beer ? ” he said .
In kegs , which keep out the air , wine could stay perfectly fresh for months , he reasoned .
Mr. Yoon found a restaurant in Atlanta that was serving wine from modified beer kegs , and , with an energy borne of obsession , he set out to perfect the system .
He found a treasure - trove of five - gallon soda kegs , big enough to hold about 25 bottles of wine each , no longer used by the bottlers , who had turned to bag - in - box containers .
He worked to persuade wineries to fill the stainless steel kegs for him .
And he custom - designed coolers for the wine kegs , separate from the cooling system he used for the 36 beers he offers on tap .
“ Whites are kept at 46 degrees , and reds 55 degrees , ” he said .
“ Once the wines hit the glass , the temperature rises about two degrees , thus bringing the actual service temperature to 48 and 57 respectively .
I did a lot of testing . ”
Mr. Yoon now offers eight wines on tap , including wines from Brewer - Clifton , Melville , Stephen Ross and Flowers , and with the reusable kegs he estimates he saves having to dispose of 10,000 bottles and related packaging a year .
It was on a scouting trip to Los Angeles last year that Mr. Alevras of DBGB visited Father ’s Office to look at Mr. Yoon ’s beer system .
He came away fascinated by wines in kegs .
“ It ’s beautiful in its simplicity , ” he said .
“ Gas goes in as wine goes out . ”
Gas ?
Well , of course .
That ’s how a beer keg works .
Except beer systems generally use a high - pressure carbon dioxide system , which carbonates the beer .
Wine simply needs a low - pressure system in which gas pushes the wine from keg to tap and occupies the empty space in the keg , preventing oxidation .
Mr. Yoon uses nitrogen , which the restaurant produces itself with a reverse osmosis generator .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Lt. Col. Greg Gadson is not a bionic man , but he does have a new set of powerful knees .
Iraq war veteran Lt. Col. Greg Gadson shows off his new knees at Walter Reed Army Medical Center .
Gadson , an Iraq War veteran , was wounded in 2007 by a roadside bomb and lost both legs above the knees .
This week , he became the first person to receive the latest version of battery - powered prosthetic knees .
Gadson demonstrated his new knees during a news conference Thursday at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington .
It 's " as if you were driving a school bus and then someone put you in a sports car -- you still know how to drive .
There 's quite a different feeling , " he said .
The Power Knee uses sensors ( in contact with the thigh muscle , for example ) to anticipate how the user will move , and then shifts itself into position .
" This is the second generation Power Knee , " says Tabi King , a spokesperson for Ossur Americas , the manufacturer .
" It uses the same type of technology , but it 's half the size , makes half the noise , is half the weight and is much more intelligent . "
King says the knee is learning in real time to react to a patient so the patient does n't have to think about walking .
" There are sensors and artificial intelligence in the prosthetic that are watching what the body is doing .
The biggest benefit is by doing so much work on its own , the amputee does n't have to think about movement . "
Gadson , who had an older model of the powered knees , praised the latest ones .
" These knees are a lot lighter .
They 're quieter and they have significantly longer battery life , " he said , adding that the batteries can last up to 16 hours .
Gadson said he hopes his pioneering efforts will help others .
" If this proves to open a door for other people , that 's a tremendous feeling , a tremendous reward .
I 'm not doing it for that , but I hope that this is a path for people to really expand their lives , " he said .
Michael Corcoran , a prosthetist who has been working with Gadson , said he thinks prosthetics of the future will be more powerful .
The first Power Knee appeared in 2006 .
Corcoran expects the improved version to reach the general population in 2010 .
" It was n't designed for military use ; it was designed as a knee for everybody , " Corcoran said .
" We 're fortunate enough here to be able to put this technology to its test here at Walter Reed , but as a broader application .
You know , a year would be great to see these legs on vascular amputees , because it does improve mobility . "
The goal is to come up with technology that adapts to all situations , according to Col. Paul F. Pasquina , one of Gadson 's doctors .
" We try to challenge each one of our members into real - life situations where they have to use their prostheses not to just walk in straight directions , but to move in an environment that would be simulations of his home -- going up and down stairs , up and down curbs -- so we try to challenge the technology as much as possible . "
Gadson is getting used to the new knees and wears them a few hours daily for now .
But he has long - term goals for his new limbs .
" My expectations are that I can do whatever it is I used to do , maybe a little bit different .
I have some other considerations , and if I can do those things , then I think that 's success . "

Cliff Mass says this weekend is going to be gorgeous .
Add sunshiny weather to the pillowy puffs of blossoming trees on the Hill and the equation becomes intoxicating .
We dare you not to loll this weekend .
My favorite stretch of blossoms is 21st Ave , just off Aloha across from Holy Names — where this first picture was taken yesterday afternoon .
The trees form a mini-canopy of pink as little swirls of breeze sprinkle petals on the sidewalks .
It is about as pleasant as it gets .
There are many pleasant pockets of spring on the Hill .
Here ’s a selection of images capturing some of them from the CHS flickr pool .
Where are your favorite blossom streets on Capitol Hill ?

In fact , among all 1,901 Norway - based study participants ( all of whom were over the age of 15 ) , it was found that those who downloaded " free " music were 10 x more likely to download pay music .
In other words , music pirates are the music industry 's largest online consumers .

Note : " Free " music obviously implies pirated music , but it also encompasses legitimate free music download services .
The findings also included that , in the 15 - 20 age range , 50 % of participants had bought a CD in the last six months .

There they go again .
This time , it ’s a Mormon state senator in Utah who compared gays to Islamic terrorists , and who said that gays pose the greatest threat to the world today .
Sen .
Chris Buttars considers the gay - rights movement — nationally and in Utah — “ probably the greatest threat to America . ”
In an interview with documentary filmmaker Reed Cowan , released by KTVX Ch. 4 on Tuesday night , Buttars said the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) community does n’t want “ equality , they want superiority . ”
“ It ’s the beginning of the end .
Oh , it ’s worse than that .
Sure .
Sodom and Gomorrah was localized .
This is worldwide , ” the West Jordan Republican said in the interview .
On Wednesday , gay - rights activist Jacob Whipple , founder of the All For One Initiative , called for Buttars ’ resignation from the Utah Senate , urging supporters of the LGBT community to e-mail Buttars and Senate President Michael Waddoups , R- Taylorsville .
“ He basically labeled my community as virtually the devil incarnate , ” Whipple said .
“ I do n’t think that he represents Utah any more .
…
Saying something so hurtful has no place on the hill . ”
Buttars also compared gay activists to Muslim terrorists .
Mind you , he is n’t just some run -of - the - mill Mormon .
He was important enough to be trusted with running what some call the Mormon version of a gulag .
Oh , you have n’t heard about those ?
I researched one for a feature story I was writing for TALK magazine right before September 11 .
I interviewed a young man who was in hiding after his Mormon parents had him kidnapped and sent to a Mormon “ reeducation / work ” camp for troubled kids .
Yes , they were going to work and beat the gay out of him .
Between the forced marches , the lack of food , the appalling living conditions – all meant to cure his homosexuality – and the multiple tropical diseases he came down with , he says they nearly killed him .
( The kid told me that they shipped him off to another camp they run , out of the country , so that they would n’t have to follow US child - protection laws - it ’s the Mormon version of extraordinary rendition , but applied to underage children .
Oh let ’s do have a discussion about who has better morals and values – the gays , or the Mormons who torture children , that is when they ’re not trying to steal Anne Frank ’s soul . )
I ’ll find my old notes and share some stories of exactly what this poor kid says the Mormons did to him .
It seems that our good Mormon senator ran one of these Mormon “ tough love ” camps before he went into the Utah Senate .
The Mormons trusted him with straightening out their most troubled children – he ’s not just anybody .
The more we peel back the layers of the Mormon onion – such as their ongoing efforts to steal the souls of dead Jewish Holocaust victims – the more it ’s clear that Mormons ought to be the last ones judging others .
But they arrogantly , and bullishly , invited the scrutiny – so now they ’re going to get it .
In spades .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Washington ’s visiting Middle East envoy vowed on Thursday to vigorously pursue the creation of a Palestinian state , setting the stage for possible conflict with Israel ’s new right - leaning government .
Israel 's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ( R ) meets U.S. President Barack Obama 's Middle East envoy George Mitchell in Tel Aviv April 16 , 2009 in this picture released by the U.S. Embassy .
Netanyahu told Mitchell on Thursday that his government would condition talks over Palestinian statehood on the Palestinians first recognising Israel as a Jewish state .
REUTERS / Matty Stern / U.S. Embassy / Handout
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has so far refused to commit Israel to restarting statehood talks and told President Barack Obama ’s envoy George Mitchell his government wanted the Palestinians to first recognize Israel as a Jewish state .
“ Israel expects the Palestinians to first recognize Israel as a Jewish state before talking about two states for two peoples , ” a senior official in Netanyahu ’s office quoted the prime minister as telling Mitchell at a meeting in Tel Aviv .
Another Israeli official said Netanyahu saw Palestinian acceptance of Israel as a Jewish state as “ a crucial element in moving forward with the political dialogue . ”
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat dismissed Netanyahu ’s demands as part of an effort by the two - week - old government to dodge commitments made by its predecessor to negotiate thorny issues such as borders , the future of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees .
Palestinians have long rejected such explicit recognition of the Jewish nature of a state where one in five people is Arab .
In back - to - back meetings with Israeli leaders , Mitchell stressed Obama ’s commitment to the goal of a two - state solution , “ in which a Palestinian state is living in peace alongside the Jewish state of Israel , ” to end the decades - old conflict .
“ That is our objective .
That is what we will pursue vigorously in the coming months , ” Mitchell said .
Netanyahu has been vague about any future peacemaking with the Palestinians , but ultranationalist Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman , who met Mitchell earlier in the day , has described negotiations launched at a 2007 conference in Annapolis , Maryland as at a “ dead end . ”
Slideshow ( 2 images )
Netanyahu ’s call for the Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state threw yet another hurdle in the way of U.S. efforts to revive Israeli - Palestinian peacemaking .
Mitchell , a former U.S. senator who mediated in the Northern Ireland peace process , planned to hold talks on Friday with Western - backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
LIEBERMAN , WILD CARD
At a brief public appearance alongside Mitchell , Lieberman made no mention of a Palestinian state , saying only that his meeting with the U.S. envoy was “ a great opportunity to exchange some ideas , and we spoke about really close cooperation . ”
Mitchell said that Lieberman told him about Israel ’s desire to “ make economic improvements ” in the West Bank .
Palestinian leaders have rejected any notion of an “ economic peace ” and have said U.S. - backed talks with Israel cannot resume until Netanyahu makes a commitment to statehood .
Lieberman has stirred controversy in the Arab world with his hawkish rhetoric and Egypt said this week it would not deal with the Israeli foreign minister as long as his positions remained unchanged .
But Lieberman ’s deputy Danny Ayalon told Israel ’s Channel Two television on Thursday : “ I promise you that not only will there be a visitby minister Lieberman in Egypt , but he will also host senior Egyptians here , and soon . ”
In addition to pressing Netanyahu to accept a two - state solution , the Obama administration has urged the government to ease its blockade of the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip .
For the first time in over a month , Israel launched an air strike in the Palestinian enclave on Thursday , blowing up what it said was a booby - trapped building near the border fence .
Local residents said no one was hurt in the blast .

VIENNA
For Mohamed ElBaradei , the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , “ a combination of ignorance and arrogance ” under the Bush administration squandered countless diplomatic opportunities with Iran and so allowed it to forge ahead with its nuclear program .
Referring twice to Dick Cheney as “ Darth Vader , ” ElBaradei told me in an interview that “ U.S. policy consisted of two mantras 
Iran should not have the knowledge and should not spin one single centrifuge .
They kept saying , wait , Iran is not North Korea , it will buckle .
That was absolutely a mistake . ”
Instead of building on Iran ’s Afghan help in 2001 , exploring an Iranian “ grand bargain ” offer in 2003 , or backing 2005 European mediation that hinged on the U.S. agreeing to sale of a French nuclear power reactor , “ We got Darth Vader and company saying Iran was in the axis of evil and we have to change this regime . ”
The result , ElBaradei said , was that instead of containing the program at a few dozen centrifuges , “ Iran now has close to 5,500 centrifuges , and they have 1,000 kilos of low enriched uranium , and they have the know - how . ”
Still , he dismissed the notion that Iran “ could go to a weapon tomorrow ” as “ hype , ” putting the time frame for that at two to five years .

Hi , I ’m Eric Meier .
I build bowed psalteries , and I thought I would share some of my building experience with you .
I ’ve designed an online project which walks you through the entire process of building this musical instrument — from start to finish .
Why am I sharing all of this online with you ?
Because you ’ve got to hear this wonderful instrument in person !
It seems that many musical instrument plans consist of an eclectic mix of cardboard , Styrofoam , and celery (? ) – but not this one !
When you are done , you will have a real , enjoyable , playable , and amazing musical instrument .
( And your repertoire will not be limited to the four notes of ‘ Mary Had a Little Lamb ’ either … )
Let me show you what this instrument looks like :
What ’s not to like about the bowed psaltery ?
They have the most wonderful ringing sound of any musical instrument that I ’ve ever heard , with a haunting sustain that makes the music seemingly float in midair and tingle in your ears .
They are easy to play , and in their most basic form are fairly simple to build .
So …
WELCOME
… to the wonderful of bowed psalteries , that is !
That little phrase in the above paragraph sums up the foundation of this online project : simple to build .
As with any instrument , the bowed psaltery can be as simple or extravagant as you want to make it .
While the instruments that I build for Phantasy Psalteries are a bit more involved , on this website I ’ve created a plan for a simple psaltery .
By changing the layout and the shape to a basic triangle , and eliminating some of the more intricate steps – along with giving in - depth and thorough directions – I hope to make bowed psalteries available for just about everyone to build .
And as an encouragement , you can even view a gallery of finished psalteries made by others using the instructions given on this website .
Everything you need to know to build a bowed psaltery can be found here !

It 's not often that I get to write about recent work .
Most of the techniques in this series were implemented at IMVU years ago .
A few weeks ago , however , a common C++ exception ( tr1 : : bad_weak_ptr ) starting intermittently causing crashes in the wild .
This exception can be thrown in a variety of circumstances , so we had no clue which code was problematic .
We could have modified tr1 : : bad_weak_ptr so its constructor fetched a CallStack and returned it from tr1:: bad_weak_ptr :: what( ) , but fetching a CallStack is not terribly cheap , especially in such a frequently - thrown - and - caught exception .
Ideally , we 'd only grab a stack after we 've determined it 's a crash ( in the top - level crash handler ) .
Allow me to illustrate :
void main_function (/* arguments */) { try { try { //
We do n't want to grab the call stack here , because // we 'll catch the exception soon .
this_could_fail(/*arguments*/) ; } catch ( const std:: exception & e ) { //
Yup , exception is fine .
Just swallow and // do something else .
fallback_algorithm(/*arguments */ ) ; } } catch ( const std:: exception & e ) { // Oh no! fallback_algorithm ( ) failed .
// Grab a stack trace now . report_crash ( CallStack : : here ( ) ) ; } }
Almost !
Unfortunately , the call stack generated in the catch clause does n't contain fallback_algorithm .
It starts with main_function , because the stack has already been unwound by the time the catch clause runs .
Remember the structure of the stack :
We can use the ebp register , which points to the current stack frame , to walk and record the current call stack .
[ ebp+4 ] is the caller 's address , [ [ ebp ] + 4 ] is the caller 's caller , [ [ [ ebp ] ] + 4 ] is the caller 's caller 's caller , and so on .
What can we do with this information ?
Slava Oks at Microsoft gives the clues we need .
When you type throw MyException ( ) , a temporary MyException object is constructed at the bottom of the stack and passed into the catch clause by reference or by value ( as a copy deeper on the stack ) .
Before the catch clause runs , objects on the stack between the thrower and the catcher are destructed , and ebp is pointed at the catcher 's stack frame ( so the catch clause can access parameters and local variables ) .
From within the outer catch block , here is the stack , ebp , and esp :
Notice that , every time an exception is caught the linked list of stack frames is truncated .
When an exception is caught , ebp is reset to the stack frame of the catcher , destroying our link to the thrower 's stack .
But there 's useful information between ebp and esp !
We just need to search for it .
We can find who threw the exception with this simple algorithm :
For every possible pointer between ebp and esp , find the deepest pointer p , where p might be a frame pointer .
( That is , where walking p eventually leads to ebp . )
Or you can just use our implementation .
With this in mind , let 's rewrite our example 's error handling :
void main_function (/* arguments */) { try { try { this_could_fail ( /* arguments */) ; } catch ( const std:: exception & e ) { // that 's okay , just swallow and // do something else .
fallback_algorithm(/*arguments */ ) ; } } catch ( const std:: exception& e ) { // oh no! fallback_algorithm ( ) failed .
// grab a stack trace - including thrower !
Context ctx ; getCurrentContext( ctx ) ; ctx.ebp = findDeepestFrame( ctx.ebp , ctx.esp ) ; report_crash ( CallStack ( ctx ) ) ; } }
Bingo , fallback_algorithm appears in the stack :
main_function fallback_algorithm __CxxThrowException@8 _KiUserExceptionDispatcher@8 ExecuteHandler@20 ExecuteHandler2@20 ___CxxFrameHandler ___InternalCxxFrameHandler ___CxxExceptionFilter ___CxxExceptionFilter ?_is_exception_typeof@@YAHABVtype_info@@PAU_EXCEPTION_POINTERS@@@Z ?_CallCatchBlock2@@YAPAXPAUEHRegistrationNode@@PBU_s_FuncInfo@@PAXHK@Z
Now we 'll have no problems finding the source of C++ exceptions !
( Reuters ) - North Korean leader Kim Jong - il turns 67 on Monday , described by his official media as a “ peerlessly great man ” whose accomplishments can defy logic and weather patterns .
The following are North Korean accounts of Kim ’s life :
THE START
Although analysts say Kim was born in the Soviet Union , his media says he was born at a secret revolutionary camp on Mount Paektu , a northern mountain on the Korean peninsula that many Koreans considered sacred .
A double rainbow appeared over the mountain when he was born .
NATURE BENDS IN HIS GREATNESS
When Kim Jong - il officially took control of the state , pear and apricot trees mysteriously and spontaneously came into bloom across the country attracting butterflies and bees .
Fisherman caught a rare white sea cucumber , which led Koreans to say “ Kim Jong-il is indeed the greatest of great men produced by heaven . ”
NO WEATHERMAN COULD HAVE FORESEEN THIS
For previous birthdays , North Korean media reported on the “ Wonders of the February holiday ” that included sunrises so brilliant that frost exploded with the sound of firecrackers , rainbows appeared and frozen lakes thawed with such a noise that it caused mountains to shake .
This year , skies over Kim Jong - il peak , “ unfolded ( with ) such mysterious ecstasy ” that a halo was seen around a moon so bright it illuminated the secret guerrilla camp where Kim was born with the brilliant light of day .
ACCOMPLISHED YOUNG MAN
According to his official biography , Kim helped develop North Korea ’s TV broadcasting industry .
He repaired auto engines .
He found ways for farmers and steel workers to produce goods more efficiently and avoid back - breaking labour .
He wrote a thesis on Korean history .
He penned operas and plays -- all before turning 23 .
THE ARTIST
Kim was responsible for placing museums in all corners of the country .
He developed an actors ’ studio .
In 1967 , he brought the feature film “ Five Guerrilla Brothers ” to the screen .
That movie was followed by “ The Sea of Blood ” and other movies , including several local award - winning films .
After building a strong North Korean film industry , Kim created a new revolutionary opera and adapted some of his films into operas .
Then he developed a new type of literature .
PILOT , GOLFER AND GOOD WITH PHONE NUMBERS
Kim , who avoids travelling on airplanes for his rare trips overseas , did learn to be a crack fighter pilot .
He goes through intensive memory training every day and can remember the phone numbers of workers , lines of computer code and the personal biographies of cadres .
And legend has it that the first time Kim played golf , he shot 11 holes - in - one and carded a score about 20 strokes lower than the best round ever for a professional event over 18 holes .

The US treasury market came under intense pressure yesterday .
Even with MoodyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s confirming the USÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Aaa debt rating , despite a higher debt load .
Investors are skeptical on who is capable to take down this record amount of issues .
It seems that too much debt is being issued by various G7 governments as a result of dramatically wider budget deficits - the US alone has a deficit of 12 % of GDP !
The race is on to see whose auction will fail first .
Perhaps these higher yields will provide support for the greenback now !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Yesterday , US existing home sales showed that it is aimlessly contained in a trendless range ( +4.68 m vs. +4.66 m ) .
Sales were up + 2.9 % last month , including minor revisions , sales were down - 3.4 % in Mar. , up +4.9 % in Feb. , down - 5.3 % in Jan . and so on .
There are probably two ways to interpret the results , an optimist would say the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœbottom is inÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , while the pessimist could conclude the data dismisses the fact that falling house prices and low mortgage rates are attracting buyers .
In reality depressed sales occur because of wealth erosion and tighter mortgage terms or the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœhouse price deflationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ mindset has kicked in with potential buyers unwilling to take the plunge just yet because they expect cheaper houses in the future .
Imagine , no - one has even mentioned job - security that would finance these purchases !
Digging deeper , the sales gain was seen mostly in condos ( +6.4 % ) .
A bit of an eye sore was that listings grew + 8.8 % !
Thus , driving inventoryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s at current selling rates up to +10.2 - months vs. +9.6 in Mar.
Perhaps this is a seasonal impact ?
It probably more prudent to believe itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s due to increased foreclosures because of job - losses .
Once again , expect inventory levels to be the scourge of this ongoing recession no matter the product .
ECB governing council member and Finnish Cbank head Liikanen said yesterday that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œthe ECB ’s interest rate level is appropriate , taking into account the additional innovative measures soon to be deployed by policy makersÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
He believes that the worst may be over for the Euro- zone , but reiterated that Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœrealities cannot be talked away with soft indicatorsÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ .
These realities include Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdeclining global trade and a contraction in production in the industrialized worldÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
His comments are Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœdovishÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ , confirming the marked differences of opinions between ECB policymakers .
His comments and innuendos is leaving the door open for further rate cuts .
The USD $ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.14 % , GBP - 0.46 % , CHF - 0.19 % and JPY - 1.48 % .
The commodity currencies are mixed this morning , CAD - 0.08 % and AUD +0.31 % .
The loonie accompanied most other major currencies and appreciated against its southern and largest trading neighbor again yesterday .
However , most pairs have managed to give up some of this weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s gains in the O/N session .
All of the gains were on the back of stronger commodities and global equities .
There is nothing fundamentally supporting the currency , even the Canadian finance minister this week said that the proposed national deficit will balloon to $ 50 b from the $ 34b announced in Jan .
The longer term fundamentals certainly support a much stronger CAD , however investors have plenty of time to add to their positions at more favorable levels .
Look for the USD to rally from these here , it has appreciated too far too quickly .
The AUD and NZD are the best performers vs. the USD this month , supported by 10 - year government bonds that offer premiums of +1.65 % and +2.3 % vs. Treasuries .
The AUD continues to rise on speculation that investors will buy the nationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s higher - yielding assets on optimism that the global economy is improving .
The countryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s fundamentals remain strong and with commodities nudging forward , one should expect buying on pull backs ( ( 0.7812 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 63.13 down - 32 c ) .
Crude prices renewed its upward trajectory yesterday as the USD Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœwaffledÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ and the Saudi oil minister saying that oil is likely to touch $ 75 by the end of the year .
Dealers also expect todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s weekly EIA report to print another decline for inventories .
Technical analysts say that with oil rising above its 200 - day moving average for the 1st- time in 8 - months is a signal that prices will rally even further .
Capital markets believe that OPEC will not adjust any production quotas at todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s meeting , because the global recession is curbing fuel consumption .
It is anticipated that they will likely keep daily output quotas unchanged at 24.845 m barrels .
Some OPEC members believe that fundamentals are strengthening and it does not warrant a cut to production .
To date , they have probably collectively complied with 77 % of the agreed upon cuts implemented last Sept .
If they ever fully complete the cut - backs then perhaps the black stuff will manage to achieve OPECÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s desired target level by year end .
Algerian oil - minister , Khelil said Ã¢â‚ ¬Ë œthe group will be careful about harming the global economic recovery Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Some analysts believe that with record 19 - year high inventory levels combined with the contraction in activity in advanced economies , the market should expect another large correction from these elevated pricesÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
Last weekÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s EIA report showed that US inventories declined more than forecasted .
The 4 - week monthly demand is averaging at +18.3 m barrels a day , that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s down 8 % y/y .
Gold has not swayed too far from yesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s prices as the uncertainty of the USD continue to influence direction flow .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not inflation , nor a technical or fundamental reason that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s influencing prices , but the value of the USD ( $ 951 ) .
The Nikkei closed 9,451 up +12 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,940 down - 60 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 4,367 down - 50 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is lower .
The 10 - year Treasury backed up 23 bp yesterday ( 3.68 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
With the US treasury having just one more auction left this week ( todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s 7Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s - $ 26 b ) and no other buy - backs , dealers will be expected to keep the curve cheap to absorb this entire record product .
Yesterday the Fed bought - back $ 6 b of 2012 - 2013 , and issued $ 35 b 5 Ã ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s with a strong foreign Cbank demand .
Sooner or later , with record issues no - one will be able to own any more of this product !
Be aware of strong month - end demand over the next few days .

Air strikes and artillery barrages have taken a heavy toll among the most vulnerable of the Iraqi people , with children and women forming a disproportionate number of the dead .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Analysis carried out for the research group Iraq Body Count ( IBC ) found that 39 per cent of those killed in air raids by the US - led coalition were children and 46 per cent were women .
Fatalities caused by mortars , used by American and Iraqi government forces as well as insurgents , were 42 per cent children and 44 per cent women .
Twelve per cent of those killed by suicide bombings , mainly the tool of militant Sunni groups , were children and 16 per cent were females .
One in five ( 21 per cent ) of those killed by car bombs , used by both Shia and Sunni fighters , was a child ; one in four ( 28 per cent ) was a woman .
The figures , compiled by academics at King ’s College and Royal Holloway , University of London , show that hi-tech weaponry has caused lethal damage to those in the population who would be furthest away from the conflict .
The victims of one of the most brutal and common types of killings in the war – abduction and execution by death squad – were 95 per cent men , many of them bearing marks of torture .
The report , The Weapons That Kill Civilians , Deaths of Children and Noncombatants in Iraq , was compiled from a sample of 60,481 deaths in 14,196 events over a five - year period since the 2003 invasion .
Civilian casualties from concentrated bouts of violence , such as the two sieges of Fallujah , were excluded .
IBC estimates that the total deaths in the conflict so far number 99,774 .
The medical journal The Lancet has maintained in another study that more than 600,000 people were killed in the first three years of the war .
IBC holds that the indiscriminate nature of the fatalities caused by air strikes shows they should not be used in urban areas .
Growing anger over civilian casualties caused by air raids in another front of the “ war on terror ” , Afghanistan , has led to the US , UK and their Nato partners reviewing their policy of using warplanes .
Hamid Karzai , the Afghan President , recently said this had become the most contentious issue between him and Western powers .
From 2004 to 2007 , the overall tonnage of munition dropped from planes in the Afghan conflict rose from 163 tonnes a year to 1,956 tonnes , an increase of 1,100 per cent .
Since 2001 the US air force has dropped 14,049 tonnes of bombs in Afghanistan and 18,858 in Iraq .
Professor John Sloboda , of Royal Holloway , co-author of the report , said : “ Our weapon - specific findings have implications for a wide range of conflicts , because the patterns found in this study are likely to be replicated for these weapons whenever they are used .

American 17 - year - olds are n't performing any better in reading and math than their bell - bottom - clad counterparts in the early 1970s .
That 's one conclusion from the latest round of a national test tracking long - term educational trends .
On the positive side , the test shows that younger students – 9 - and 13 - year - olds – are making significant gains .
In addition , racial differences in scores have narrowed for all three age groups over the past 30 - plus years .
But overall , the mixed results parallel other indicators of how challenging it is to raise academic achievement .
The flat - line trend for 17 - year - olds should sound an alarm , say advocates of high school reform .
" If high schools were cellphones , they'd be considered in a dead zone , " says Bob Wise , president of the Alliance for Excellent Education , a Washington advocacy group .
" We 've got to finally start addressing high schools in the same way that we addressed elementary schools ....
This is the jumping - off place for college or the modern workplace , and our kids unfortunately are performing at [ 1970s ] levels . "
More than 26,000 students took the tests for the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ) – a project overseen by the research wing of the US Department of Education .
The results were released Tuesday .
As part of the NAEP project , reading scores have been tracked since 1971 and math since 1973 .
In the new report , long - term improvements were largest for younger age groups in math .
Nine - year - olds gained 24 points since 1973 , and 13 - year - olds gained 15 points .
In reading , the gains were 12 points and 4 points respectively since 1971 .
That 's on a 500 - point scale , which NAEP breaks into 50 - point intervals to describe the corresponding skill level .
African - American and Hispanic students have improved at greater rates than white students since the 1970s , but since 2004 , they 've made little progress in narrowing these so - called achievement gaps .
In 2008 , for instance , the average reading score for white 9 - year - olds was 228 – 24 points ahead of African - Americans and 21 points ahead of Hispanics .
The report card comes at a time when discussion is building in policy circles about whether there should be national education standards – or whether the multiple standards used by states under the No Child Left Behind law ( NCLB ) should be benchmarked to something common , such as NAEP .
" State tests are in many ways useless for making any kind of state - to - state comparison , " says Frederick Hess , director of education - policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington .
" Whatever one thinks of national standards , it 's imperative that we find a way to use NAEP as a backstop to let parents and voters know how to interpret state assessments . "
NCLB critics point to various NAEP results since 2004 as an indicator of the policy 's failure to bring about real improvements and close gaps .
Some observers , however , look at the fact that the younger grades have made gains , and they say it 's the outcome of a variety of policies , including NCLB , that have emphasized reading and math at those levels .
NAEP administrators caution against attributing good or bad results to any particular policy , given how many factors affect learning and how much school demographics have changed over the past few decades .
The stagnation of high school scores seems to draw the most concern with the new set of results .
" It puts the lie to the idea [ that if ] you prepare them better in elementary school , they 'll just move through the system and be better prepared high - schoolers , " says Amy Wilkins , vice president for government affairs at The Education Trust , a Washington nonprofit .
" We 've got to get better high schools to get better high school outcomes . "
The flat math scores among 17 - year - olds happened despite the fact that larger percentages have taken higher - level math courses than in previous decades .
That raises questions about whether such courses are really offering higher - level curriculum , whether the students bring the necessary math background to be successful , and whether the teaching is effective , Ms. Wilkins and others say .
In considering why 2008 NAEP reading gains were n't as strong as math gains , educational consultant Susan Pimentel says that most state standards have emphasized reading strategies but not high - level reading content .
" In talking to countless employers and postsecondary faculty from across the nation , they tell us they do n't want students to just be able to summarize , analyze , identify , and locate [ information in a text ] ; they want students to be able to [ do so ] in particular types of rigorous texts ... [ such as ] scientific journals , memos from employers , rich fiction , and biography , " Ms. Pimentel said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday .
She is a member of the National Assessment Governing Board , the independent bipartisan group that sets NAEP policy .
" Too few of our students are being challenged with rich , complex texts as we move up in the age groups , " Pimentel added .
The new NAEP study is titled " The Nation 's Report Card : NAEP 2008 Trends in Academic Progress . "
This kind of NAEP test was last administered in 2004 .
The results can't be directly compared with a separate set of NAEP tests , which take a snapshot of various subjects every few years and change over time with curriculum .
If this tech has been in use for 7 years , what far more sophisticated stuff has been developed since then by more secret groups like NSA and others ?
The depth that CIPAV goes indicates sophisticated users are kidding themselves that they can protect their identities and activities online .
As first reported by Wired.com , the software , called a “ computer and internet protocol address verifier , ” or CIPAV , is designed to infiltrate a target ’s computer and gather a wide range of information , which it secretly sends to an FBI server in eastern Virginia .
The FBI ’s use of the spyware surfaced in 2007 when the bureau used it to track e-mailed bomb threats against a Washington state high school to a 15 - year - old student .
[…]
“ While the technique is of indisputable value in certain kinds of cases , we are seeing indications that it is being used needlessly by some agencies , unnecessarily raising difficult legal questions ( and a risk of suppression ) without any countervailing benefit , ” reads a formerly - classified March 7 , 2002 memo from the Justice Department ’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section .
The documents , which are heavily redacted , do not detail the CIPAV ’s capabilities , but an FBI affidavit in the 2007 case indicate it gathers and reports a computer ’s IP address ; MAC address ; open ports ; a list of running programs ; the operating system type , version and serial number ; preferred internet browser and version ; the computer ’s registered owner and registered company name ; the current logged - in user name and the last - visited URL .
After sending the information to the FBI , the CIPAV settles into a silent “ pen register ” mode , in which it lurks on the target computer and monitors its internet use , logging the IP address of every server to which the machine connects .
The documents shed some light on how the FBI sneaks the CIPAV onto a target ’s machine , hinting that the bureau may be using one or more web browser vulnerabilities .
In several of the cases outlined , the FBI hosted the CIPAV on a website , and tricked the target into clicking on a link .
As a heavily tattooed girlie , I always welcome questions about my ink .
I have found that people are both curious and confused about aspects of my tattoo art and I try not to shy away from the inquiries .
While I have heard some doozies , I must say that the MOST commonly asked question of them all is , " Did it hurt to get your head tattooed ? "
I understand being inquisitive about this .
Really , I do .
But the short and honest answer is , ummm , YES !
Tattoo collectors have various levels of pain tolerance .
In a room full of tattooed peeps , asking " which spot hurt the worst " will most likely get you a variety of places cited .
There really is n't a " rule " or " gauge " to be able to give prospective tattoo recipients when they ask " how much will it hurt ? "
If honest , even the toughest - of - the - tough have got to admit that EVERY PLACE hurts , to some degree ; unless they have CIPA , have been drinking excessively , or come from another planet .
I have been told by artists who have tattooed me that I handle the pain well .
I can sit and chat , eat , laugh , etc .
Over the last four years of my eight year tattoo journey , I have acquired 14 full - color portraits from Mike DeVries alone ; each one averaging 8 - 9 hours per portrait ( Cyndi Lauper took 16 hours / broken into two sessions ; the octopus took 26 hours / broken into six sessions ) and I can sit for an eight hour ink showdown , gabbing away throughout ; I just hobble away and cry all the way home ( I kid , I kid ) .
But I must say , that for me personally , the head project was a whole other ball game .
It may have been amplified by the fact that I had TWO Mikes ( Mike DeVries and Mike DeMasi ) tattooing simulaneously ; one on each side .
There is just something about the sensitivity and pressure applied to the noggin that does n't quite compare to any other place I have been inked ( yet ) .
Though the " head tattoo project " is still in progress ( I had to go and be a girl and look for a change by growing hair for awhile ) , I thought I would share some of the photos from the first and second sessions with The Mikes .

* 23 - month - old child dies in Texas of swine flu
A worker disinfects a bathroom inside the Golden Rule Charter School after a suspected case of swine flu caused the school to close in Dallas , Texas , April 29 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Jessica Rinaldi
* Death is first outside Mexico and first in U.S .
* Official says child was in Houston for treatment
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A 23 - month - old child has died in Texas from the new H1N1 swine flu , becoming the first death in the United States from the virus , a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said on Wednesday .
A Houston health official said the child was a Mexican who traveled to the city for medical treatment .
It is the first death from swine flu reported outside Mexico , the country hardest hit by this influenza outbreak .
U.S. officials have confirmed 65 cases of swine flu , most of them mild but with five hospitalizations in California and Texas .
“ Unfortunately , this morning I do have to confirm that we have the first death of a child from H1N1 flu virus .
And this is in Texas , a 23 - month - old child , ” Dr. Richard Besser , acting head of the CDC , told the CBS “ Early Show . ”
“ The child came to Houston for medical treatment .
The family had traveled to South Texas .
The child became ill and they transported the child to Houston for medical care , ” Houston health department spokeswoman Kathy Barton told CNN by telephone .
She said she did not know which part of Mexico the child came from .
President Barack Obama , speaking at the White House before a one - day visit to Missouri , said the confirmed death underscored the urgency of taking steps against the disease .
“ This is obviously a serious situation .
Serious enough to take the utmost precautions , ” Obama said , urging state and local authorities to increase their vigilance .
“ Every American should know that the federal government is prepared to do whatever is necessary to control the impact of this virus , ” he said .

MORE DEATHS EXPECTED
Besser of the CDC had predicted that as they searched for cases , CDC experts would find severe infections and deaths in the United States , even though most of the patients had mild illness .
“ As we look , we ’re going to find more cases .
We ’re going to find more severe cases and I expect that we ’ll continue to see additional deaths , ” Besser told NBC ’s “ Today ” show .
He said additional details would be released by Texas authorities .
Mexico previously had reported the only deaths -- 159 , based on symptoms and initial tests , with seven deaths so far confirmed by additional laboratory analysis at the World Health Organization .
Influenza regularly kills people around the world , with an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 deaths from the seasonal virus every year .
Every year at least a few perfectly healthy children die from seasonal influenza in the United States .
WHO and CDC officials have been trying to assess just how serious the new H1N1 swine influenza strain is .
It has been found globally , with cases across North America , Europe and New Zealand .
“ We have about 100 cases outside Mexico , and now you have one death .
That is very significant , ” said Lo Wing Lok , an infectious disease expert in Hong Kong .
The CDC recommends frequent hand - washing to avoid infection with the new flu virus .
It also recommends that people who are sick stay home , cover sneezes and coughs , and avoid unnecessary travel to Mexico until more is known .

About 20 % of households cut back on giving to their churches when the economy started to sink last year , according to the Barna Group , which tracks religious statistics .
The California - based organization found that overall donations decreased by 4 % to 6 % — about $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion .
At the same time , churches are facing increasing demands from people in their communities for food and shelter .
To make ends meet , church leaders are cutting staff and putting programs on hold .
The federal government has stepped in to help .
Last month , the Department of Homeland Security announced that $ 100 million from the economic - recovery package will go to emergency food and shelter programs , including those run by religious organizations .
Billions of dollars more have been set aside for education , neighborhood - stabilization programs , and affordable
child care — all services offered by many churches and other places of worship .
“ The need for assistance is staggering , ” says Candy Hill of Catholic Charities USA .
“ This will provide some relief . ”
But some believe that such government aid violates the constitutional requirement to maintain separation of church and state .
The Rev. Barry Lynn of the nonprofit Americans United for Separation of Church and State says there are no effective regulations in place to prevent churches from engaging in religious discrimination when hiring or to stop them from using government money to promote their religion through soup kitchens or shelters .
During his campaign , Barack Obama pledged to end both practices .
But his administration has yet to follow through .
“ If basic civil - rights protections are not in place , then religious charities should not be getting money , ” Lynn says .

Microsoft has extended their three year warranty to E74 errors , further refunding those who have previously had to pay for a repair related to the error .
The Red Rings of Death ( RRoD ) , which represents a general hardware failure , was rumoured to affect 30 % of Xbox 360 ’s sold .
The controversy led to Microsoft announcing an extended three year warranty in 2006 that would see the company repairing all Xbox 360 ’s affected by RRoD free of charge .
However , the E74 error has been gaining as much attention this year , being called “ the new RRoD . ”
Instead of displaying three red lights , the console would display an E74 error on - screen , which is also said to relate to some kind of system failure .
Reportedly the error is either related to the AV cable , or the more fatal occurrence of a burnt out scaler chip or even the death of the console ’s GPU .
The increased reports of the E74 error has resulted in Microsoft issuing an extended warranty to include the fault :
“ While the majority of Xbox 360 owners continue to have a great experience with their console , we are aware that a very small percentage of our customers have reported receiving an error that displays “ E74 ″ on their screen , ” Microsoft ’s release reads .
“ After investigating the issue , we have determined that the E74 error message can indicate the general hardware failure that is associated with three flashing red lights error on the console .
As a result , we have decided to cover repairs related to the E74 error message under our three - year warranty program for certain general hardware failures that was announced in July 2007 . ”
As well as an extended three year warranty , within the next 4 - 12 weeks Microsoft will refund those who have already paid for an E74 repair :
“ Microsoft will refund to customers the amount paid for an out of warranty repair due to a general hardware failure associated with the e74 error message .
Those customers should automatically receive the refund within 4 - 12 weeks , and no additional action by customers should be necessary .
If you do n’t receive a refund by July 1st you must visit www.xbox.com/support before November to find out more information on how to place a claim .
Make sure you receive your refund before November 1st , otherwise you just wo n’t get one .
At this moment the announcement only covers Xbox 360 ’s in the US , but we expect the warranty and refund to be rolled out around the world and to the UK specifically .
Have you been plagued by E74 or RRoD ?

To hear former President Bush tell it , you would think the United States only turned to the techniques in desperation .
When Bush announced the existence of the CIA ’s interrogation program in September 2006 , for example , he argued that suspected al - Qaida operative Abu Zubaydah stopped cooperating with interrogators after his capture on March 28 , 2002 , forcing the agency to get rough .
“ We knew that Zubaydah had more information that could save innocent lives , ” Bush said .
“ But he stopped talking .
As his questioning proceeded , it became clear that he had received training on how to resist interrogation , ” the president said .
“ And so , the CIA used an alternative set of procedures . ”
Not to worry , the president explained .
“ The Department of Justice reviewed the authorized methods extensively , and determined them to be lawful . ”
But that ’s not how it happened .
Staff reporting to Chairman Sen. Carl Levin , D - Mich. , pored over 200,000 pages of documents and interviewed more than 70 people .
After months going through the declassification process , their report is a stunningly frank tick - tock of the development of torture policy under the Bush administration .
The sequence of events shows the early genesis of torture and also exposes repeated , vivid warnings — falling on deaf ears — that torture is a clumsy , wrongheaded and ineffective way to gather intelligence .
The report details how abusive interrogations began .
“ In December 2001 , ” the report says , “ the DOD General Counsel ’s office contacted the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency ( JPRA ) headquartered at Fort Belvoir , Virginia , for information about detainee ‘ exploitation . ’ ”

YET AGAIN , French president Nicolas Sarkozy has proven to be his own worst enemy , shooting himself in the foot by insulting three of his closest allies .
France ’s “ little big man ” should have known that his remarks , delivered at a bipartisan lunch this week , would be leaked to the press .
But he could n’t resist accusing Barack Obama of inexperience , Angela Merkel of copying himself , Nicolas Sarkozy , and José Luis Zapatero of being a bit dim .
Mr Sarkozy initially praised Mr Obama , calling him “ a subtle mind , very intelligent and very charismatic . ”
Then came the “ but ” : “ He was elected only two months ago and he ’s never run a ministry in his life . . . ”
The US leader “ is not always up to scratch on decision - making and efficiency ” .
Fortunately , Mr Sarkozy was there to show Mr Obama the way .
“ I told him : ‘ I think you have n’t really understood what we did on carbon dioxide .
You made a speech ; you ’ll have to act ’ . ”
Courrier International magazine cruelly sums up the way Mr Sarkozy has been overshadowed by the new US president .
“ The Hyperpresident [ the real one ] ” says the front - page headline over a photograph of Mr Obama looking handsome and visionary .
As for German chancellor Angela Merkel : “ When she realised the state of her banks and her automobile industry , she had no choice but to rally to my position , ” Mr Sarkozy told two dozen French parliamentarians .
Mr Sarkozy ’s remarks about the Spanish prime minister José Luis Zapatero provoked the strongest reaction .
Over dessert , Mr Sarkozy noted with satisfaction that the Spanish government has just banned advertising on public television stations , like he did .
A socialist deputy made an ambiguous comment about Mr Zapatero and Mr Sarkozy followed up , comparing the Spaniard to the former French socialist leader Lionel Jospin .
“ He may not be very intelligent , ” Mr Sarkozy allegedly said of Mr Zapatero .
“ Me , I know people who were very intelligent and who did n’t make it to the second round of the presidential election . ”
When Libération newspaper published an account of the lunch , the Élysée and luncheon participants were inundated with phone calls from French and international media .
Mr Sarkozy ’s office denied the comment about Mr Zapatero , but not those about Mr Obama and Dr Merkel .
Several parliamentarians confirmed they had heard them , although some said they were taken out of context .
In Spain , the quotes nearly created a diplomatic incident .
Mariano Rajoy , the leader of the right - wing Popular Party , said : “ Sarkozy may be right . ”
But , added a lower - ranking party official : “ Zapatero is our president and whatever happens , if he ’s attacked from abroad , we should defend him . ”
Imagine the ambiance during Mr Sarkozy ’s official visit to Madrid on April 27th - 28th !
Mr Sarkozy ’s luncheon indiscretions are only the most recent manifestation of his superiority complex .
In recent days he called two officials from his right - wing UMP “ amateurs ” when a draft law on internet piracy failed to pass at its first reading .
He threw a temper tantrum at this week ’s cabinet meeting because several government ministers had spoken to journalists of posts they hope to obtain in the next cabinet reshuffle .
Despite his best efforts to cajole , intimidate or muzzle the press , Mr Sarkozy has an image problem .
The British Daily Mail humiliated him by posting on its website a series of photographs of the vertically - challenged French leader standing on his tippy - toes beside Mr Obama at the Nato summit .
The satirical Canard Enchaîné put one on its front page , with the presidential feet encircled .
Thanks to the Canard , we know what the French president thinks of journalists .
French media last month reported that a banker who had hosted the French first couple in Mexico was suspected of laundering drug money .
“ Journalists are zeros , ” an enraged Mr Sarkozy reportedly said .
“ You have to spit in their faces , walk on them , crush them .
They are bandits .
“ Worse than bandits .
Bandits at least have some morality . ”
I have zero sympathy for the kvetching over the banks ’ complaints over the supposedly onerous terms for repayment of TARP funds .
Let ’s review some of the claims :
1 . “ It was forced on us . ”
Um , the only time that was arguably true was when Hank Paulson got nine banks together and made a great show of making them take TARP funds , in essence to disguise the fact that some desperately needed the money ( Citi in particular ) while other just badly needed it .
And were smaller banks forced ?
Please .
2 . “ This terms are really unfair ! ” Despite Paulson ’s show of coercion was in fact a great deal .
Lest we all forget , the TARP funds were at terms more favorable than the best of the bunch , Goldman , had just extracted from Warren Buffet .
Similarly , the smaller banks were delighted to take the money .
From the New York Times in December :
Most of the banks that received the money are far smaller than behemoths like Citigroup or Bank of America .
A review of investor presentations and conference calls by executives of some two dozen banks around the country found that few cited lending as a priority .
An overwhelming majority saw the bailout program as a no-strings - attached windfall that could be used to pay down debt , acquire other businesses or invest for the future .
Nothing beats revisionist history .
So what is really causing the consternation ?
It is that the banks suddenly want to give the money back now to escape the executive comp provisions .
But the TARP funds had warrants attached , and Uncle Sam wants to exercise the warrants as part of any repayment .
Think of it as a fund exit fee .
You get into a fund that otherwise looks phenomenal but has an exit fee .
Suddenly you have an emergency and you need the dough , and instead of amortizing that exit fee over the , say , minimum 5 years you expected to be in the fund , you are amortizing it over two months .
What looked like no big deal suddenly is a big deal .
But what is particularly ugly is the banks trying to welsh on the terms with rubbish arguments like the ones above .
If you have been on the receiving end of a conversation with a particularly unpleasant bank customer service rep regarding some gotcha fees , I ’m sure you relish the spectacle of the banks hoist on their own petard .
Funny how contracts are sacred until they are the ones you want to get out of .
From the New York Times :
As the Obama administration completes its examinations of the nation ’s largest banks , industry executives are bracing for fights with the government over repayment of bailout money and forced sales of bad mortgages .
President Obama emerged from a meeting with his senior economic advisers on Friday to say “ what you ’re starting to see is glimmers of hope across the economy . ”
But there were also signs of growing tensions between the White House and the nation ’s banks over the next phase of the financial rescue .
Some of the healthier banks want to pay back their bailout loans to avoid executive pay and other restrictions that come with the money .
But the banks are balking at the hefty premium they agreed to pay when they took the money .
Jamie Dimon , the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase , and two other executives of large banks raised the issue with Mr. Obama and the Treasury secretary , Timothy F. Geithner , at a meeting two weeks ago .
“ This is a source of considerable consternation , ” said Camden R. Fine , who attended the White House meeting as president of the Independent Community Bankers , a trade group of 5,000 mostly smaller institutions , many of which are complaining about the repayment requirements …..
Both large and small banks have pressed the Obama administration to make it less costly for them to exit the bailout program by waiving the right to exercise stock warrants the banks had to grant the government in exchange for the loans .
At a meeting last month , the chiefs of three of the largest banks separately asked Mr. Obama to direct the Treasury not to exercise the warrants , Mr. Fine said .
Douglas Leech , the founder and chief executive of Centra Bank , a small West Virginia bank that participated in the capital assistance program but returned the money after the government imposed new conditions , said he complained strongly about the Treasury Department ’s decision to demand repayment of the warrants .
That effectively raised the interest rate he paid on a $ 15 million loan to an annual rate of about 60 percent , he said .
“ What they did is wrong and fundamentally un-American , ” he said .
“ Even though the government told us to take this money to increase our lending , the extra charge meant we had less money to lend .
It was the equivalent of a penalty for early withdrawal . ”
Exactly ,
The sort you impose on consumers with no inhibition .
This was in the TARP rules , sorry you did n’t read your customer agreement closely enough .
Oh , but I forgot .
Some animals are more equal than others .
The article pointed to a second area of friction between banks and regulators , one we had warned of earlier .
With mortgages in particular ( unlike some of the complex MBS ) , coming up with valuations of pools is not horribly arcane and investors can make reasonable estimates of value .
Given how far over any real economic value ( whether mark to market or hold to maturity ) the prices at which some banks are carrying mortgages on their books are , we did n’t see how the government , even with all its smoke and mirrors , could entice investors to overpay for impaired assets .
Even with non-recourse financing of anything less than 100 % , it does n’t make sense to pay 90 cents for something you expect to be worth 60 to 70 cents .
Again from the Times :
This month , the nation ’s largest banks began announcing their latest quarterly earnings .
Some , like Wells Fargo , have released results early to trumpet their profitable first quarter — and possibly to give them leverage in coming negotiations with their regulator .
The immediate concern for the administration is how to get the weaker banks to relieve their books of deteriorating mortgages and mortgage - backed securities .
Industry analysts estimate that United States banks alone have more than $ 1 trillion of such mortgages on their books but have recognized only a small share of the likely losses .
Economists at Goldman Sachs estimated recently that banks were valuing their mortgages at about 91 cents on the dollar , far more than investors are willing to pay for them .
Even though the Treasury Department plans to subsidize the purchases of toxic assets by giving buyers low - cost loans to cover most of their upfront cost , a growing number of analysts warn that many if not most banks will remain reluctant to sell .
“ The gap is still very wide , ” said Frank Pallotta , a former mortgage trader at Morgan Stanley , now a consultant to institutional investors .
“ If every bank was forced to sell at the market - clearing price , you ’d have only five banks left in the market . ”
A final observation : the Times headline , clearly reflecting industry views , points to something seriously amiss : “ Showdown Seen Between Banks and Regulators . ”
Regulators hold the power of life or death over their charges .
They can yank their license and put them out of business .
The idea that there could be a “ showdown ” says the two parties have equal bargaining power .
Here we have an industry with its big players and quite a few small fry on life support , and the bystanders benefitting hugely from rock bottom short interest rates , and they act as if they can make demands ?
Unfortunately , with the government looking as if it is owned by the banksters , the answer is probably yes .
Can a little promotional gift like a pen or a coffee mug inscribed with a drug ’s name really make a difference in a doctor ’s prescription patterns ?
It can , researchers say .
A study reports that students from a medical school where such gifts are allowed had a more favorable attitude toward a cholesterol drug than did students from a school where they are banned .
Although hospitals have long discussed what restrictions to place on the more valuable offerings lavished by drug companies , the researchers , whose study appears in The Archives of Internal Medicine , suggest that no gift is too small .
The researchers worked with 352 third - and fourth - year students at Penn , which bans most gifts , samples and meals from drug companies , and the University of Miami , which allows them .
A real - world test performed by the Dutch province of Zeeland ( a very windy place ) confirms our earlier analysis that small windmills are a fundamentally flawed technology ( test results here , pdf in Dutch ) .
Twelve of these much hyped machines were placed in a row on an open plain ( picture above ) .
Their energy yield was measured over a period of one year ( April 1 , 2008 - March 31 , 2009 ) , the average wind velocity during these 12 months was 3.8 meters per second ( note : update on the wind speed ) .
Three windmills broke .
Find the disappointing results of the others below .
Picture : Jeroen Haringman .
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Small Wind Turbines
- Energy Ball v100 ( 4,304 euro ) : 73 kWh per year , corresponding to an average output of 8.3 watts
- Ampair 600 ( 8,925 euro ) : 245 kWh per year or an average output of 28 watts
- Turby ( 21,350 euro ) : 247 kWh per year or an average output of 28.1 watts
- Airdolphin ( 17,548 euro ) : 393 kWh per year or an average output of 44.8 watts
- WRE 030 ( 29,512 euro ) : 404 kWh per year or an average output of 46 watts
- WRE 060 ( 37,187 euro ) : 485 kWh per year or an average output of 55.4 watts
- Passaat ( 9,239 euro ) : 578 kWh per year or an average output of 66 watts
- Skystream ( 10,742 euro ) : 2,109 kWh per year or an average power output of 240.7 watts
- Montana ( 18,508 euro ) : 2,691 kWh per year or an average power output of 307 watts .
Keep in mind that these windmills would perform considerably worse in a built - up area .
47 windmills to power a household
An average Dutch household consumes 3,400 kWh / year .
Listed below is the amount of windmills required , and their total cost , to power a Dutch household entirely using wind energy :
- Energy Ball : 47 windmills ( 202,288 euro )
- Ampair : 14 windmills ( 124,950 euro )
- Turby : 14 windmills ( 298,900 euro )
- Airdolphin : 9 windmills ( 157,932 euro )
- WRE 030 : 9 windmills ( 265,608 euro )
- WRE 060 : 7 windmills ( 260,309 euro )
- Passaat : 6 windmills ( 55,434 euro )
- Skystream : 2 windmills ( 21,484 euro )
- Montana : 2 windmills ( 37,016 euro )
An average American household consumes almost 3 times more electricity than a Dutch household .
Simply multiply the above figures by three .
Rotor diameter
At first sight , the results seem to indicate that the design of the windmill matters .
However , if you combine these figures with the rotor diameter , it becomes clear that the concept of small windmills is fundamentally flawed .
The turbines that score best , are simply the largest ones :
- Energy Ball : 1 meter
- Ampair : 1.7 meter
- Turby : 2 meter
- Airdolphin : 1.8 meter
- WRE 030 : 2.5 meter
- WRE 060 : 3.3 meter
- Passaat : 3.12 meter
- Skystream : 3.7 meter
- Montana : 5 meters
Windmills with a rotor diameter of 4 or 5 meters do not fit on most roofs , and are not easy to integrate in a built - up environment .
Size matters
Close to the test site stands a ( relatively ) large windmill with a rotor diameter of 18 meters .
It delivers 143,000 kWh per year , or an average power output of 16,324 watts .
It can power 42 Dutch households .
This large windmill costs only slightly more than all small windmills combined ( 17 percent more , to be exact , or 190,000 euro ) , but it delivers almost 20 times more energy .
This comes down to 4,523 euro per household .
Wind power rules , but small windmills are a swindle .
Bigger is , in this case , better .

Race tech : Paris- Roubaix , April 11 , 2009
An early look at the bikes of Paris - Roubaix
By James Huang in Compi�gne , France
Subtle tweaks for Rabobank Giants
Giant have provided Rabobank riders with slightly modified versions

Giant have adopted a familiar formula for the team 's TCR Advanced SL ISP bikes at this year 's Paris - Roubaix .
Special aluminum dropouts extend the effective chain stay length by 7 mm for additional tire clearance and more stability while new alloy fork tips with an extra 7 mm of rake do the same up front .
The forks themselves also have a slightly altered shape to confer a smoother ride while on the pave .
Most of the team will use Shimano Dura - Ace 7900 components though Sebastian Langeveld and Joost Posthuma will set off on the electronic Di2 version .
On those bikes , the wires are routed internally through the frame courtesy of a pair of team - only access holes and the battery is mounted to two dedicated rivnuts on the non-driveside chain stay .
There are few surprises when it comes to the rest of the team 's gear .
Standard 32 - hole Dura - Ace hubs are laced with Sapim butted stainless steel spokes and brass nipples to Ambrosio Nemesis aluminum box -section rims for a lightweight yet durable set of wheels that also yield more predictable braking performance than carbon .
Wrapped around them are Vittoria 's popular Pav� EVO - CG tubulars with a fat 27 mm casing and slight file tread .
All of the team bikes we spotted were fitted with 53/44T chainrings and 11 - 23T cassettes to suit Paris - Roubaix 's flat and fast course .
Total weight for Langeveld 's bike is 7.58 kg ( 16.71lb ) .
BBOX Bouygues Telecom expecting bad weather ?
TRP EuroX Carbon cantilever brakes provide the stopping power

While most of the teams seem to be pulling out only slightly modified road bikes � or even just their standard rigs with cobble - specific wheels and tires �
BBOX Bouygues Telecom riders were preparing to attack the course on full - blown mud machines .
We noted ample tire clearance throughout on the team 's carbon framesets along with significantly extended chain stay , seat stay and fork lengths as compared to their usual road bikes .
TRP EuroX Carbon cantilevers with carbon - specific pads were fitted at either end along with supplemental top - mount brake levers while top tube - routed cables keep control lines relatively safe from contamination .
Gearing is of the usual Paris - Roubaix variety with leg - busting 53/48T chainrings and 11 - 23T cassettes .
Interestingly , team bikes were equipped with 10 - speed Campagnolo Record , not the latest 11 - speed stuff .
The roughly 25 mm - wide ' Michelin ' Pro2 Race tubulars ( Michelin does n't actually make tubulars so these obviously come from elsewhere ) continue the worst case scenario theme but interestingly , they were mounted to standard Campagnolo Bora Ultra wheels complete with deep - section carbon tubular rims .
Fran�aise des Jeux goes tubeless
Team mechanics were fitting 28 mm - wide Hutchinson Intensive Road Tubeless tires
Photo © : James Huang
We 've long thought that Hutchinson 's Road Tubeless technology was an ideal technology for Paris - Roubaix 's tire - eating cobbles but it is only now that one team , Fran�aise des Jeux , has decided to use them across the board on race day .
Team mechanics were seen replacing the team 's usual 23 mm - wide Hutchinson Fusion 2 Road Tubeless tires with massive 28 mm - wide Hutchinson Intensive Road Tubeless tires the Saturday before the race .
The design is already inherently more resistant to catastrophic punctures than traditional clinchers � and nearly as safe as tubulars if a rider does completely lose pressure � and the team went one step further by adding in some latex sealant .
Most of the team will opt for Lapierre S - Lite frameset with its more generous chain stay length , fork rake and wheelbase for a more subdued handling and flattened chain stays and curved seat stays for additional flex over the cobbles .
Additional tweaks include a higher rear brake bridge and longer fork blades for additional tire clearance , thus requiring long - reach brake calipers .
Shimano Dura - Ace 7900 componentry � and just a smattering of select 7800 bits � will be used throughout save for Matthieu Ladagnous who will use Di2 .
53/44T chainrings and 11 - 23T cassettes will be the theme for the day .
Silence - Lotto's Canyon Ultimate Al Pav�
Canyon Bicycles have supplied their Silence - Lotto riders

Not that the riders will have time to look at this

Silence - Lotto bicycle sponsor Canyon have released some preview information on the bikes their riders will use at this Sunday 's Paris - Roubaix .
Leif Hoste and his teammates will use a modified version of Canyon 's Ultimate AL frameset , suitably dubbed the Ultimate AL Pav� .
Paris - Roubaix - specific tweaks will include a 10 mm - longer top tube for a longer and more stable wheelbase , extra clearance on the driveside chain stay to accommodate the riders ' preferred 46T inner chainring , a lighter and softer - riding One - One - Four SLX carbon fork borrowed from their Ultimate CF SLX frameset , and extra clearance between the chain stays to allow for cushy 28 mm - wide tires .
Otherwise , the special Ultimate AL Pav� will reportedly use the standard version 's 7005 - series shaped and butted aluminum tubeset , including for the asymmetrical ' Maximus ' seat tube which flares out further on the non-driveside for additional drivetrain rigidity while still leaving enough room on the other side for a front derailleur .
Canyon will also give the bikes a special graphics package .
A large decal on the top tube lays out each section of pav� while the underside of the down tube creates a virtual reflection of the cobbles below .
" Since I was a young racer I was always fascinated by Paris - Roubaix , with the incredible racing of Francesco Moser and Roger De Vlaeminck , " said Canyon founder Roman Arnold in a press release .
" We are proud to have Canyon in Paris - Roubaix and wish the riders of Silence - Lotto , and the rest of the racers a safe and successful 106th Paris - Roubaix . "
BMC to utilize two - platform approach for Paris - Roubaix
BMC will field both Pro Machine SLC01 frames
Photo © : James Huang
Wild card Pro Continental team BMC will outfit their riders with two different modfied framesets for Paris - Roubaix : the traditional Pro Machine SLC01 carbon fiber flagship plus the newer aluminum - and - carbon Racemaster SLX01 .
Team riders will be evenly split between the two .
A team press release makes no mention of specific frame modifications though all of the bikes will reportedly be fitted with special forks provided by team sponsor Easton .
The carbon forks feature wider crowns for extra tire clearance and the lay - up has been modified to yield a softer ride .
Team media official Georges Leuchinger says the team first tested the forks at KBC - Driedaagse De Panne - Koksijde early last month and were satisfied enough to run them at Roubaix .
Other Paris - Roubaix - specific gear will include new 11 spd - compatible 44T inner chainrings from Campagnolo and new 25 mm - wide tubular tires from Continental .

Walk into any bookshop this year and you wo n’t fail to notice that a big armful of books are being published to mark the 200th anniversary of Darwin ’s birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of Darwin ’s seminal The Origin of Species .
We ( editors and our reviewers ) have done the hard work for you [… ]
I ’ve continued to help Firefox users to get to the pages they want faster with features like multi- word search ( just press space — great for matching titles ) and adaptive learning ( you ’ll only need to type a single letter to get what you want ) .
I even wrote an add - on that takes you to the top listed site by just pressing enter 🙂 , so now you just need to type 1 letter , and hit enter , and you ’re where you want to be ( no need to press down first ) !
So in Firefox 3.5 , there ’s some new ways to change what shows up in the Smart Location Bar such as restricting results to show only your history ( and not your unvisited bookmarks ) or matching only in the URL instead of also in the title .
Additionally , you can see your Smart Keywords queries show up in the drop down .
You can restrict the search to your history by typing “ ^ ” , or bookmarks with “ * ” , or tagged pages with “ + ” .
To make what you ’ve typed match only in the URL type “ @ ” , and for title / tags only use “ # ” .
You can first start typing something you want to find like “ mozilla ” ..
All results that match " mozilla "
Then realize that there ’s too many results and you know it ’s a page that you ’ve tagged , so you restrict the results with “ + ”..
Restricting " mozilla " to tagged pages
Then continue narrowing the results by typing more words ..
Quickly finding pages out of thousands
If you prefer the results to always restrict to history and match only in the URL , you can go to about : config and change the corresponding preferences to nothing ( edit the value and delete the special character ) .
This way you can always be only searching your visited history and not worry about matching in the title .
If you ’ve installed Hide Unvisited [ ed.agadak.net ] , you can uninstall it and just change browser.urlbar.restrict.history to “ ” ( nothing ) .
Preferences to change default restrict / match behavior
As with the Hide Unvisited add - on , restricting to history will only show pages that you have visited and are stored in your history .
This means if you visit a bookmark , it will still show up even when restricting to history .
However , you can select the entry from the location bar and hit Delete , or delete pages from the History Panel , or just Clear History to make them disappear .
If you do n’t like the standard characters to enable restrict / match , you can modify the values from about : config to be whatever you want .
They can be single characters , whole words , even words in other languages .
One last thing about Keywords is that you can now see what you ’re going to search with a Smart Keyword Bookmark .
You can even assign multiple bookmarks the same keyword so one can be the default Wikipedia search and another can use I ’m Feeling Lucky [ google.com ] .
You can uninstall Show Keywords [ addons.mozilla.org ] if you ’re using that for Firefox 3 .

A collective shudder rippled through Silicon Valley on Wednesday morning , as Rackable Systems announced its purchase of Silicon Graphics Inc. for just $ 25 million in cash .
If you travel all the way back to 1997 , SGI was pulling in close to $ 4 billion in revenue a year .
The company produced some of the flashiest computers on the planet for handling tough graphics jobs .
SGI was the next big thing in Silicon Valley , and people adored the company .
For some perspective , consider this sentence from a 1998 story in The Times .
Although Silicon Graphics is not considered a technology bellwether like Intel or Compaq , it was once one of the nation ’s fastest - growing companies , best known for building extraordinary computers that helped create special effects for the “ Jurassic Park ” films .
Ah , those were the days .
Terms like “ bellwether ” and “ fastest - growing ” have n’t been used anywhere near the SGI name for years .
The company used to thrive by selling computers based on its own chips and operating system .
Such technology , however , was undercut by cheaper graphics products from companies like Nvidia and cheaper mainstream chips from Intel .
In addition , SGI made a blunder by opting to move all of its computers over to Intel ’s lackluster Itanium chip .
SGI was forced into bankruptcy a couple of years back and has been struggling ever since .
( The company announced that it had filed for bankruptcy once again on Wednesday morning just before revealing the Rackable deal . )
Rackable sort of resembles SGI , in that it used to be the next big thing in corporate hardware as well .
As I reported earlier this week , Rackable was a shining star in 2006 before Dell started putting serious pricing pressure on the upstart , fighting it for customers like Facebook , Microsoft and Yahoo .
By buying SGI , Rackable takes on some engineers with expertise in building large , complex systems as well as some intellectual property around graphics and server technology .
( Regrettably for SGI , the company sold off some its key 3 - D graphics technology to Microsoft earlier this decade . )
While SGI has met with an unceremonious end , one of its founders has a new beginning .
The company was started in 1982 by former Stanford University professor James Clark , who went on to found Netscape Communications ( since we ’re going down memory lane ) .
Last month , Mr. Clark , 65 , married the Australian swimsuit model Kristy Hinze , 29 .
A senior bikie has warned Sydney 's escalating feud between rival motorcycle gangs is set to explode , as clubs fly in reinforcements from overseas and stockpile weapons .
The source , who has a long history with bikie gangs and wants to remain anonymous , is predicting more killings after months of rising unrest , shootings and fatal assaults .
The man , who also has a criminal history , has rejected police suspicions that he could be linked to the recent violence .
He says other senior bikies have scoffed at a recent peace overture made by Comanchero president Mick Hawi , and he is predicting further killings .
Mr Hawi has ordered his members not to wear club insignia or ride their bikes , and is calling for a meeting of senior bikies to sort out problems following the fatal bashing of a Hells Angels associate at Sydney Airport on Sunday .
New South Wales Police and politicians have expressed scepticism but Mr Hawi's lawyer , Lesly Randle , says it is a genuine offer .
" The course taken by the police to criticise genuine efforts by other persons of influence are unnecessary and unhelpful , " she said .
But the source , who travels with six bodyguards in two cars and would not do an interview on tape for AM , says Sydney 's bikie war is far from over .
He has laughed at the Comancheros ' olive branch , saying other bikie clubs are also cynical about the prospect of peace and are describing the offer as a " ruse " .
Stockpiling weapons
The source also describes chilling details about clubs ' gathering strength .
He says reinforcements from interstate and overseas have already arrived in Sydney and are preparing for war .
He adds clubs are amassing a significant stockpile of firearms and explosives .
The bikie has told AM the recent bombing of a Hell 's Angels Club in Sydney was just a test of bomb - making capacity .
He says bikies have also been stealing cars to use in the city 's spate of drive - by shootings .
Canadian - based international bikie expert William Marsden says it is not uncommon for clubs to call for backup from their overseas affiliates .
" That can be likely , " he said .
" It was known that the Bandidos , for instance , came to Canada to try and organise and strengthen their associate clubs against the Hell 's Angels .
" They lost out in the end but absolutely that 's been known .
" But generally speaking , it 's up to the individual clubs to strengthen themselves , to keep themselves going , to organise whatever retribution or war they 're going to indulge in . "
Hard to pass up a bargain like that .

Less than a month till BSX 2009 !
I can already taste the pizza !
This is partially due to the fact that I am eating pizza right now , but on top of that there is also the taste of future pizza .
Hit up the forums to join in on BSX Pinole or another BSX in your area– there seem to be a number that are shaping up nicely !

The world of banking , it ’s becoming clear , operates according to different norms from those of the rest of the business world .
Take the offsite corporate weekend .
Normal behavior on these occasions consists of punishing the minibar and nursing consequent hangovers , hitting on long - fancied colleagues , and putting embarrassing items , ideally pornographic videos , on one another ’s hotel bills .
For form ’s sake , a few new ideas are cooked up , and then gradually allowed to die a natural death when everyone is back at work and liver - function levels have stabilized .
In June , 1994 , when a team from J. P. Morgan went on an off - site weekend to Boca Raton , they conformed to normative behavior in certain respects .
Binge drinking occurred ; a senior colleague ’s nose was broken ; somebody charged a trashed Jet Ski and many cheeseburgers to somebody else ’s account .
Where the J. P. Morgan team broke with tradition was in coming up with a real idea — an idea that changed the entire nature of modern banking , with consequences that are currently rocking the planet .
Complex risk engineering ignored emotions like avarice and envy .
Illustration by Seymour Chwast
The new idea was based on an old one , that of the swap .
Say you ’re in the grocery business , and feel gloomy about your prospects .
Your immediate neighbor is in the stationery business , and he feels gloomy about his prospects , less so about yours .
You get to talking , and one of you hits on a brilliant idea : why not just swap revenues ?
You take his earnings for the year , and he takes yours .
The actual business does n’t change hands , making the swap , in banking terminology , “ synthetic . ”
The first currency swap took place in 1981 , and allowed I.B.M. to trade surplus Swiss francs and Deutsche marks for dollars held by the World Bank .
The two institutions exchanged their obligations to bondholders and their bond earnings without actually exchanging the bonds .
The deal , brokered by Salomon Brothers , was worth two hundred and ten million dollars over ten years and ushered in a whole new field of finance .
As Gillian
Tett tells it in her book “ Fool ’s Gold ” ( Free Press ; $ 26 ) , by the time of the Boca Raton off - site , swaps had become a roaringly successful feature of the banking world : the volume of such interest - rate and currency derivatives was worth twelve trillion dollars , more than the entire U.S. economy .
But competition was making those swap deals less profitable .
The quest was for a new , and therefore newly lucrative , product to sell .
What got the J. P. Morgan team rolling was this thought : instead of swapping bonds or currency or interest rates , why not swap the risk of default ?
In effect , it could sell the risk that a borrower wo n’t be able to pay back his debt .
Since banking is based on making loans to customers , the risk of default by those customers is a crucial part of the business .
A product that made it possible to reduce that risk — by selling it to somebody else — had the potential to create a gigantic new market .
The broad outline of the financial crash is becoming well known .
The value of Gillian Tett ’s book is in the level of detail with which she tells the story , concentrating on the specific sequence of inventions and innovations that made it possible .
Tett , a Financial Times reporter who covered the credit markets , was one of the few people to have seen the implosion coming .
A critical factor was that she has a Ph.D. in social anthropology — a “ hippie ” background , as one banker told her , intending no compliment .
It helped her focus on what she calls “ social silences ” in the world of banking .
It ’s not always what people say that contains the most important information ; often , it ’s what they take for granted .
To Tett , it was obvious that the banking sector was running irresponsibly large risks in the overexpansion of credit and the overingenuity of its financial engineering .
So she was perfectly placed to follow the story as it happened , and to pull together the story of how we got here .
There are a number of different ways of peeling this particular onion ;
Tett does so through the J. P. Morgan team that helped create the new credit derivatives .
These lie at the heart of the current crisis , and Tett ’s account of their invention and dispersal makes “ Fool ’s Gold ” a gripping and indispensable book .
The Boca Raton meeting first bore fruit when Exxon needed to open a line of credit to cover potential damages of five billion dollars resulting from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill .
J. P. Morgan was reluctant to turn down Exxon , which was an old client , but the deal would tie up a lot of reserve cash to provide for the risk of the loans going bad .
The so - called Basel rules , named for the town in Switzerland where they were formulated , required that the banks hold eight per cent of their capital in reserve against the risk of outstanding loans .
That limited the amount of lending bankers could do , the amount of risk they could take on , and therefore the amount of profit they could make .
But , if the risk of the loans could be sold , it logically followed that the loans were now risk - free ; and , if that were the case , what would have been the reserve cash could now be freely loaned out .
No need to suck up useful capital .
In late 1994 , Blythe Masters , a member of the J. P. Morgan swaps team , pitched the idea of selling the credit risk to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development .
So , if Exxon defaulted , the E.B.R.D. would be on the hook for it — and , in return for taking on the risk , would receive a fee from J. P. Morgan .
Exxon would get its credit line , and J. P. Morgan would get to honor its client relationship but also to keep its credit lines intact for sexier activities .
The deal was so new that it did n’t even have a name : eventually , the one settled on was “ credit - default swap . ”
So far , so good for J. P. Morgan .
But the deal had been laborious and time - consuming , and the bank would n’t be able to make real money out of credit - default swaps until the process became streamlined and industrialized .
The invention that allowed all this to happen was securitization .
Traditionally , banking involves a case - by - case assessment of the risk of every loan , and it ’s hard to industrialize that process .
What securitization did was bundle together a package of these loans , and then rely on safety in numbers and the law of averages : even if some loans did default , the others would n’t , and would keep the stream of revenue going , thereby diffusing and minimizing the risk of default .
So there would be two sources of revenue : one from the sale of the loans , and another from the steady flow of repayments .
Then someone had the idea of dividing up the securities into different levels of risk — a technique called tranching — and selling them off accordingly , so that riskier tranches of debt would pay a higher rate of interest than safer ones .
Bill Demchak , a “ structured finance ” star at J. P. Morgan , took the lead in creating bundles of credit - default swaps — insurance against default — and selling them to investors .
The investors would get the streams of revenue , according to the risk - and - reward level they chose ; the bank would get insurance against its loans , and fees for setting up the deal .
There was one final component to the J. P. Morgan team ’s invention .
The team set up a kind of offshore shell company , called a Special Purpose Vehicle , to fulfill the role supplied by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in the first credit - default swap .
The shell company would assume $ 9.7 billion of J. P. Morgan ’s risk ( in this case , outstanding loans that the bank had made to some three hundred companies ) and sell off that risk to investors , in the form of securities paying differing rates of interest .
According to J. P. Morgan ’s calculations , the underlying loans were so safe that it needed to collect only seven hundred million dollars in order to cover the $ 9.7 - billion debt .
In 1997 , the credit agency Moodys agreed , and a whole new era in banking dawned .
J. P. Morgan had found a way to shift risk off its books while simultaneously generating income from that risk , and freeing up capital to lend elsewhere .
It was magic .
The only thing wrong with it was the name , BISTRO , for Broad Index Secured Trust Offering , which made the new rocket - science financial instrument sound like a place you went to for steak frites .
The market came to prefer a different term : “ synthetic collateralized debt obligations . ”
Inevitably , J. P. Morgan ’s innovation was taken up by more aggressive and less cautious banks .
Mortgage - based versions of collateralized debt obligations were especially profitable .
These C.D.O.s involved the techniques that the J. P. Morgan team had developed , but their underlying assets were pools of mortgages — many of them based on the most lucrative mortgages , the now notorious subprime loans , which paid higher than usual rates of interest .
( These new instruments could be pretty exotic : some consisted of C.D.O.s of C.D.O.s , pools of pools of debt . )
J. P. Morgan was wary of them , as it happens , because it did n’t see how the risks were being engineered down to a safe level .
But institutions like Citigroup , U.B.S. , and Merrill Lynch plunged in .
The new financial instruments , as clever as they were , had an unfortunate side effect : they broke banking .
At its heart , banking is a simple business .
Customers deposit money at a bank , in return for interest ; the bank lends that money to other people , at a higher rate of interest .
This is n’t glamorous or interesting , but banking is not supposed to resemble skydiving or hip - hop ; what recommends it is that it ’s a good way of making steady money ( and of creating credit in the economy ) , as long as the bank is careful about whom it lends money to .
The quality of the loans is critical , because those loans are the bank ’s earning assets .
This is n’t some incidental issue ; it ’s the very core of what banking is .
But the model of packaging plus securitization spurned the principle that a bank had to individually assess and monitor every loan .
The mathematics of valuation models — horrendously complex equations to assess probabilities and correlations , cooked up in mad- scientist style by the firms ’ “ quants ” — took on the burden of assessing statistical risk .
The idea that a banker looks a borrower in the eye and takes a view on whether he can trust him came to seem laughably nineteenth - century .
As for the risks ?
Well , as Lawrence Summers said when he was Deputy Secretary of the Treasury , “ The parties to these kinds of contract are largely sophisticated financial institutions that would appear to be eminently capable of protecting themselves from fraud and counterparty insolvencies . ”
Alas , Richard A. Posner , a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , observes with pointed restraint , “ That turned out not to be true . ”
The result has been , in the title phrase of Posner ’s new book , “ A Failure of Capitalism ” ( Harvard ; $ 23.95 ) .
He argues that we are now in a bona - fide depression , which he defines as “ a steep reduction in output that causes or threatens to cause deflation and creates widespread public anxiety and , among the political and economic elites , a sense of crisis that evokes extremely costly efforts at remediation . ”
His book is an attempt to write “ a concise , constructive , jargon - and acronym - free , non-technical , unsensational , light - on - anecdote , analytical examination of the major facets of the biggest U.S. economic disaster in my lifetime and that of most people living today . ”
Accounts of the banking - and - credit crisis tend to focus their explanations , which usually also means their blame , on one or more of the following four factors : greed , stupidity , government , and the banks .
The process resembles a children ’s game in which you spin an arrow and it lands on a word .
Tett spins twice , and lands on greed and the banks ;
Posner suggests that he does n’t know what the word “ greed ” means , and his spin lands firmly on government .
“ We are learning from it that we need a more active and intelligent government to keep our model of a capitalist economy from running off the rails , ” he writes .
“ The movement to deregulate the financial industry went too far by exaggerating the resilience — the self - healing powers — of laissez - faire capitalism . ”
This is n’t an original conclusion , but the way Posner arrives at it is new and bracing .
His first claim to fame was as one of the founders of a school of thought that takes economic ideas and techniques and applies them to the law , as well as to life more generally .
He has published nearly twenty books in just the past decade , a superhuman rate of productivity , bearing in mind that Posner is also a practicing judge , a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago , and an energetic blogger ( in association with the Nobel Prize - winning economist Gary Becker ) .
He has the rare kind of mind that is a pure pleasure to watch in action , regardless of the subject and the argument being made .
“ A Failure of Capitalism ” argues that the risks taken by the banks were rational , for two main reasons .
First , it ’s only with the benefit of hindsight that we can know that a bubble in prices was taking place .
Bankers had to assign a probability to the prospect that there was a bubble , and , second , to the prospect that , if there was a bubble and it burst , house prices would fall by twenty per cent or more — this being the decline that precipitated the general crisis of bank insolvency .
Now , suppose that the risk of both things happening was one per cent .
Whether an event with that likelihood is worth worrying about depends on what its consequences will be .
From the larger point of view , the consequences included systemic meltdown ; but Posner invites us to focus our attention on what they looked like for individual bankers .
They had strong incentives for taking the maximum amount of risks in their lending , since risks are correlated with rewards , and the bankers were so well paid that they did n’t really have to worry about being laid off .
“ The greater the gains are from taking risks that enable very high short - term profits , and the better cushioned the executive is by his severance package against the cost of losing his job , the more risks he rationally will take , ” Posner notes .
Besides , if a bank avoids these risks , and its competitors do n’t and therefore make more money during the boom , the cautious bank risks going out of business anyway , because its clients will walk away .
People taking out what now look like crazily risky mortgage loans were being rational , too , because they were acting on the widespread assumption that house prices would continue rising .
If house prices fell , well , tough luck , they ’d walk away from the loan and go bankrupt — but they probably had lousy credit ratings anyway .
“ Thus the downside of the home buyer ’s speculative investment is truncated , making his ‘ reckless ’ behavior not only rational but also consistent with his being well informed about the risks , ” Posner writes .
The conclusion : “ Risky behavior of the sort I have been describing was individually rational during the bubble .
But it was collectively irrational . ”
As for the idea that the bankers were dumb to get so carried away : “ I am skeptical that readily avoidable mistakes , failures of rationality , or the intellectual deficiencies of financial managers whose IQs exceed my own were major factors in the economic collapse .
Had the mistakes that brought down the banking industry been readily avoidable , they would have been avoided . ”
This is a familiar place for these arguments to end up : economists often find that apparently erratic behavior is , at heart , rational .
It helps that the definition of rationality can be stretched to include emotion , which “ is not necessarily or even typically irrational , ” Posner argues .
Reckless greed , incompetent assessments of probability , blindness to the inevitability of downturns , failure to hedge risks so big that they threaten a firm ’s very existence : all are rational .

I wanted to get remote compiles going in Emacs because I wanted to work in Aquamacs on my Mac .
In terminal mode , a lot of keys do n’t work like in particular Control + the arrow keys and in X11 , I lose my Emacs session every time I disconnect and take my laptop home ( unless I use something like VNC ( slow ) or figure out how to get FreeNX to suspend & resume properly ) .
Here ’s how I did it .
The basic approach is to use rcompile.el which seems geared for doing remote compiles over rsh , but it can be cajoled into working over ssh :
Set the Emacs variable remote - compile - host to foobar.com -p 8000 .
The -p 8000 was only necessary for me because I am sshing to a particular FreeBSD jail that has the build environment i need for the particular project I ’m working on .
Set the Emacs variable remote - shell - program to / sw / bin / ssh .
This path is a little unusual because I ’m using a version of OpenSSH that I installed on my PowerBook using Fink .
I ’m choosing this over the stock OS X ssh because OpenSSH 4.0 and up support the ControlMaster feature which speeds up repeated connections to the same remote host .
Instead of the Emacs compile command , use remote - compile ( defined in rcompile.el ) .
At this point , Emacs was still crapping out because it was confused by the remote file pathname from TRAMP and did n’t know how to change directories on the remote host :
bash : line 0 : cd : /ssh:foobar.com:/home/marc/src/foo/bar:
No such file or directory
In order to solve this I got tricky and did this :
sudo ln -s / /ssh:foobar.com :
This is very hacky though and not everyone may have root access to the remote host they ’re using , so I came up with a patch for rcompile.el which works for me .
Let me know if it works for you …
Most programmers agree that another pair of eyes on your code will uncover bugs and disseminate knowledge across development teams .
But many also recognize that peer review can waste a lot of time .
So how do you get started in such a way that you 1 ) do n't waste time , 2 ) match the process to your team and your goals , and 3 ) have a clear way to evaluate results ?
So many code review techniques exist , and each with pros and cons , so which are right for your team ?
Even if you 're unwilling to spend the time to review all your code , perhaps spending a little time reviewing a specific subset would be worthwhile .
The only way to know is to try it for yourself .
Use these tips to simplify , expedite , and measure the process .
What Is Code Review and How Do You Do It ?
First , let 's make sure we 're on the same page .
What is " code review ? "
The answer varies depending on whom you ask , and when ; code review has changed dramatically in recent years .
Thirty years ago , if you wanted a well - known and measurable process that delivered results , your only choice was the dreaded Formal Inspection -- a seven - phase , multi-meeting , paperwork - heavy system popularized by Michael Fagan at IBM .
Properly done , it takes over ten person - hours to review at most 200 lines of code -- a sluggish rate that makes this system impractical ( not to mention excruciating ) even if it does uncover bugs .
In the past 10 years a variety of evidence [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] has shown that many of the components of the traditional " heavyweight " inspection process are inefficient or even unnecessary .
" Lightweight " modern code review methods include :
Over - the - Shoulder :
The reviewer physically looks over the author 's shoulder and is walked through the code .
Pros : Easy to implement , no tools required .
Cons : Interrupts reviewers , hard to know which code is reviewed , impossible to measure and track .
Requires coordinating with someone else 's schedule .
Email Pass - Around : Code differences are emailed automatically by the version control system .
Reviewers respond to changes when they have time .
Pros :
Easy to set up , nothing to purchase , works remotely .
Cons :
No tracking -- do n't know if found defects were fixed , often reviews never happen because everyone assumes someone else looked at it , no metrics ; reviews " fizzle out " instead of finishing .
Hard to follow conversations as emails get replied to and forwarded among several people .
Tool - Based Review :
Use a development tool specifically designed to assist in code review .
A variety of open - source and commercial tools exist .
Pros : Removes most of the busywork associated with file - collection , discussion / defect management , and metrics / reporting .
Tracks reviews and defects .
Cons :
Have to learn and integrate another tool , can cost money .
Pair - Programming : Two developers at the same keyboard and monitor working on the code together .
Pros :
Deep level of review ; teams know review is happening but it 's difficult to track .
Cons : Large time investment , some developers dislike it .
Requires coordinating with someone else 's schedule .
Pick a method that most closely matches the existing culture of the team .
Use the pros , cons and amount of time you have to select one and stick with it for one week before you start to make changes .
MADRID , Spain ( CNN ) --
Spain 's jobless rate rose sharply , to 17.36 percent in the first quarter , with more than 4 million people out of work , the government said Friday .
The collapse in Spain 's construction industry has left thousands out of work and sites unfinished .
Nearly half of the 4 million lost their jobs in the past year , the National Statistics Institute said .
It 's the first time that Spain 's jobless total has exceeded 4 million , economist Carlos Maravall told CNN .
The numbers did not surprise economists , who have been tracking steady increases of monthly jobless raw numbers from the government .
But Spain 's official jobless rate is revised only every quarter .
Spain 's previous rate of 13.9 percent , issued early this year for the fourth quarter of 2008 , was already the highest in the European Union .
When Spain 's jobless figure earlier topped 3 million , officials predicted it would not make 4 million .
Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero recently shuffled his Cabinet , replacing the finance minister and others in a move to boost the economy .
Zapatero predicts that public works subsidies distributed across the country will soon produce tens of thousands of jobs .
Spain 's once - booming construction industry has been battered by the global economic crisis .
But the latest government report shows more jobs were lost in the last quarter in the services sector , another pillar of the economy .
The number of temporary workers declined in Spain , the government said .
But economists say that 's because companies lay off those workers first .
It costs a business in Spain about three times more to lay off a full - time employee .
Increased unemployment was seen across all sectors and across the country , with the urban areas around Madrid , Barcelona and Valencia hit hard , the government said .
According to Gallup Poll Daily , after the presidential election from November 4 - 6 , “ only 27 % of Americans approve of the job Bush is doing as president .
This contrasts with the 70 % of Americans holding a favorable view of Obama . ”
Now in the March 13th Wall Street Journal article , “ Obama ’s Poll Numbers Are Falling to Earth , ” Douglas Schoen and Scott Rasmussen report that the most recent Gallup , Rasmussen , and Wall Street Journal / NBC polls show that despite the earlier claims of some ( such as the the March 6th , pro-Obama , “ We Are All Socialists Now ” issue of Newsweek and a March 3rd Wall Street Journal / NBC poll ) , public support for Obama is plummeting even though he has only been in office for fifty days :
A detailed examination of presidential popularity after 50 days on the job similarly demonstrates a substantial drop in presidential approval relative to other elected presidents in the 20th and 21st centuries .
Interestingly enough , the first reason for this rapid change is that a growing percentage of the public oppose the specific measures of Obama that do not offer real change but instead build upon the Big Government policies of George W. Bush to radically expand government power and spending :
The reason for this decline most likely has to do with doubts about the administration ’s policies and their impact on peoples ’ lives .
. . .
When Gallup asked whether we should be spending more or less in the economic stimulus , by close to 3 - to - 1 margin voters said it is better to have spent less than to have spent more .
When asked whether we are adding too much to the deficit or spending too little to improve the economy , by close to a 3 - to - 2 margin voters said that we are adding too much to the deficit .
. . .
Rasmussen data shows that people now actually oppose Mr. Obama ’s budget , 46 % to 41 % .
Three - quarters take this position because it will lead to too much spending .
And by 2 - to - 1 , voters reject House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s call for a second stimulus package .
. . .
Fifty - six percent of Americans oppose giving bankers any additional government money or any guarantees backed by the government .
Two - thirds say Wall Street will benefit more than the average taxpayer from the new bank bailout plan .
This represents a jump in opposition to the first plan passed last October .
At that time , 45 % opposed the bailout and 30 % supported it .
Now a solid majority opposes the bank bailout , and 20 % think it was a good idea .
A majority believes that Mr. Obama will not be able to cut the deficit in half by the end of his term .
But most interesting is the finding that a sizable percentage of the public is now expressing serious doubt about federal government power itself as beneficial in resolving economic problems :
Only less than a quarter of Americans believe that the federal government truly reflects the will of the people .
Almost half disagree with the idea that no one can earn a living or live “ an American life ” without protection and empowerment by the government , while only one - third agree .
Despite the economic stimulus that Congress just passed and the budget and financial and mortgage bailouts that Congress is now debating , just 19 % of voters believe that Congress has passed any significant legislation to improve their lives .
While Congress ’s approval has increased , it still stands at only 18 % .
Over two - thirds of voters believe members of Congress are more interested in helping their own careers than in helping the American people .
When it comes to the nation ’s economic issues , two - thirds of voters have more confidence in their own judgment than they do in the average member of Congress .

Update : After learning that Mitt Romney played his song “ Wavin ’ Flag ” at his Flordia primary victory rally , Canadian - Somali musician K’naan announced his displeasure via Twitter : “ Yo @mittromney I am K’naan Warsame and I do not endorse this message . ”
He asked Romney not to play the song again ( but said Barack Obama was welcome to ) ; the Romney campaign reportedly has agreed .
Mother Jones interviewed K’Naan shortly before his album Troubadour , which includes “ Wavin ’ Flag , ” was released in 2009 .
• • •
K’naan ‘s music sounds a little like Eminem ’s , if Slim Shady had spent his childhood dodging bullets in Somalia ’s civil war .
The 30 - year - old hip - hop artist ( born Kaynaan Warsame ) grew up on the mean streets of Mogadishu and escaped in 1991 on one of the last commercial flights out of the country .
Now living in Toronto , he ’s just released his second studio album , Troubadour , an addictive blend of African - jazz - infused ballads and rhymes about everything from Somali pirates and the immigrant experience to Iraq .
Having survived “ the most dangerous city in this universe , ” K’naan says he ca n’t separate his music from his past .
“ I do n’t have the luxury of ignoring myself , ” he says .
His honesty has resonated with other musicians ; he ’s collaborated with Damian Marley and Maroon 5 ’s Adam Levine , and Mos Def has joined him onstage .
K’naan talked to Mother Jones while sitting on a bus on his way to a show .
Mother Jones :
You said goodbye to Somalia when you were 13 years old .
How does your childhood relate to your music ?
K’naan :
It ’s kind of the primary influence .
The only way I see the world now is through coming out of and growing up and living in Somalia .
In the time of war , everyone was basically trying to live and manage the best they could .
But you also had another period which was not a hard time at all — it was just a beautiful time .
I lived in both eras .
I got to fully experience and appreciate both the tragedy of Somalia and the beauty of it .
MJ : In your music , you talk a lot about being a kid in a war zone .
In “ People Like Me , ” you say you “ partook in the gun crimes ” and mention a “ close call with a grenade . ”
Did you fight in the war ?
K : The idea of child soldiers is different in Somalia .
There is no real military to join , nor are there any consistent rebel groups .
There is just war .
And it ’s everywhere ; in the hands of adults and in the little hands of children .
It is the very survival of the streets that makes children pick up guns in Somalia , not some older , wide - eyed rebel leader .
My intimate experiences during these years are something which I have shared with people through my music but am very careful about how they are addressed .
I learned to fire guns at the age of nine or so , but luckily was not out killing people .
We zigzagged the streets to escape those trying to kill us .
I guess it would have been a matter of time till I turned around with a gun myself , to go after those coming for us .
But I was fortunate .
The grenade incident was about an explosion which destroyed a section of my school , from a grenade that me and my cousin detonated by accident .
We both lived to tell about it .
MJ : When you were growing up , were you aware of American hip - hop ?
K : Very limited stuff — this one album by Eric B. & Rakim called Paid in Full .
That was my first and last interaction with hip - hop until I got to North America .
MJ : Is there Somali hip -hop ?
K : No . Somalis really are very musically sophisticated , and they ’re about their own thing .
They ’re not very quick to import .
MJ : What do you think about the situation in Somalia right now ?
K : It ’s horrific .
The UN recently said that it ’s the worst humanitarian disaster in the world , more so than Darfur .
What can I say , man — it ’s a sad situation .
It was great to have the fortune to escape what was happening in the country .
Of course , the flip side of that is that you ’re leaving everyone you love , and you ’re leaving the place you love and the things you know .
MJ : How do you feel when people turn Somali pirates into a joke ?
K : Well , the pirates are serving a purpose right now .
They come from regions which have been completely ignored , and Westerners have tried to destroy these regions by their constant plundering of resources and by the illegal dumping of nuclear waste .
The pirates really began in order to discourage these actions — initially .
And then the business became lucrative .
So I do n’t know what to tell these people who want Somalis to condemn them .
One man ’s pirate is another man ’s coast guard .
MJ : You make fun of rappers who have a thug posture .
Do n’t you think that what people are going through in Oakland and New Orleans and Queens is hardcore enough ?
K : I guess it ’s hardcore enough — for them .
The truth is that everyone ’s struggle is legitimate .
I understand those ghettos ; I ’ve lived in them .
But there are , in fact , more severe struggles .
MJ : Have you gotten any flak from other rappers about that stance ?
K : Actually , rappers understand that more than a lot of people .
The same rappers who are the glorifiers of it all , when faced with reality , are like , “ Yo , man , you ’re right .
It ’s the truth . ”
MJ : So why this obsession with glorifying violence in hip - hop ?
K : I think a lot of it has to do with marketing groups , statistics — what works and what does n’t .
If peace began to sell , that would be the norm .
But right now the consumer is getting really smart .
Extreme exposure no longer equals selling records , which I think is a very good scenario for music .
Not so much for record labels .
MJ : In “ 15 Minutes Away , ” about making a money transfer back home , you say , “ Generosity is the key . ”
Are you taking a stance against rappers like Kanye West and Cash Money Millionaires , who brag about how much their jewelry costs ?
K : It ’s just how I feel .
These guys are very hungry for opportunity , and they really try to expose themselves .
But I just think that sometimes that might not be the most important thing in the world .
I ’m not about trying to get and get and get .
I feel good when I get , but I kind of feel better when I give .
Congress Must Also Investigate Bush Policies
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – President Obama today suggested that the attorney general should consider prosecuting those who formulated the legal decisions that purported to justify torture under the Bush administration , and that Congress could play a role in achieving accountability .
The following can be attributed to Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union :
" While President Obama rightly asserts that our government lost its moral bearings when it implemented torture policies , we must not forget that it also broke the law .
Torture is a crime , and we are hopeful that President Obama 's comments today signal a new acknowledgment of the need for criminal investigations of those who authorized , legally justified and carried out these unlawful acts .
" President Obama was right to leave the ultimate decision to Attorney General Holder , as the Justice Department must fulfill its law enforcement mandate independent of political considerations .
" Both Congress and the executive branch must play an active role in seeking accountability .
While a congressional select committee must investigate what went wrong and craft legislation to prevent its reoccurrence , the Justice Department must appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate those who took part in these horrific acts of torture .
" Any suggestion that pursuing criminal prosecutions would be a political act is backwards logic ; indeed , to ignore the mountains of evidence pointing to such shameful criminal activity would be the ultimate act of political cynicism .
Accountability is not retribution ; it is justice . "
International alarm at the Talibanisation of parts of northern Pakistan near Islamabad was mounting last night after militants ambushed a convoy of soldiers deployed to prevent extremists taking over a district only 60 miles from the capital .
Snipers opened fire on police escorting four platoons of Frontier Corps paramilitary troops into Buner district , a day after militants overran government buildings and looted western aid offices .
One policeman was killed and one injured , an army spokesman said .
Locals said the ambush had forced the Frontier Corps to retreat .
" Now Buner is ruled by the Taliban , " one resident told the Guardian by phone .
" They go anywhere they want . "
The confrontation comes just a week after the government introduced sharia law in neighbouring Swat , in an effort to appease the Taliban .
But the deal has only emboldened a spread into other districts , in the name of spreading Islamic law .
Two weeks ago the Taliban occupied a Sufi shrine in Buner , accusing locals of using it for " un - Islamic " practices .
On Wednesday they swept through the main town , Daggar .
Gun-toting militants looted aid agency offices , stole western - funded vehicles and forced police to retreat into their stations .
After talks with district officials , Taliban commanders promised to keep their fighters off the streets yesterday .
But they continued with FM radio broadcasts emphasising Islamic teachings and warning men not to shave their beards .
" We are here preaching for sharia .
We do n't want to fight , " a commander named Khalil told the AP .
The fall of Buner does not pose an immediate threat to Islamabad .
The capital lies across a mountain range and the river Indus .
But the speed and aggression of the latest advance has stoked a sense of panic among Pakistan 's western allies , and , increasingly , at home .
On Wednesday the US secretary of state , Hilary Clinton , accused President Asif Ali Zardari 's government of " basically abdicating to the Taliban and the extremists " .
After an outcry from Pakistani officials , she modified her tone yesterday , conceding there was an " increasing awareness " of the threat within government circles .
Sam Zarifi of Amnesty International said the government had left the 650,000 residents of Buner , particularly women and children , " at the mercy " of the Taliban .
The army spokesman , General Athar Abbas , said that western fears were " overblown " and called for patience in dealing with the militants .
Taliban violence was swinging divided public opinion against the militants , he said .
" We are giving them enough rope to hang themselves . "
Certainly a new sense of urgency is gripping Pakistan 's political class , where it has been fashionable to call the fight against the Taliban " America 's war " .
The opposition leader , Nawaz Sharif , urged the government to contain the militants within Swat .
A more surprising statement came from Maulana Fazlur Rahman , the leader of the pro-Taliban Jamiat Ulema -e - Islam party , who warned the national assembly on Wednesday : " If Taliban continue to move at this pace they will soon be knocking at the doors of Islamabad . "
But there is little sense yet of a concerted effort to push back the militants , who have exposed the fragility of the federation and resurrected fears that the country is heading towards break - up .
The Buner assault is likely to strain the controversial Swat peace accord .
In exchange for peace , the provincial government , headed by the secular Awami National party , agreed in February to introduce sharia law in Swat and seven adjoining districts known as Malakand Division - an area of about 10,000 square miles that accounts for one third of the North West Frontier province .
But since the deal , the Taliban have established control over much more than the judicial system .
In Mingora , the valley 's commercial hub , police have been reduced to directing traffic and secular politicians have fled , many under death threats .
At the nearby Taliban headquarters in Imam Dehri , a Taliban spokesman , Muslim Khan , told the Guardian that their goal was the establishment of an Islamic caliphate - first in Pakistan , then across the Muslim world .
" Democracy is a system for European countries .
It is not for Muslims , " he said .
" This is not just about justice .
It should be in education , health , economics .
Everything should be under sharia . "
If the Swat deal collapses the army is likely to reactivate up to 15,000 security forces currently posted to the valley .
Tensions are starting to show .
Earlier this week the Taliban kidnapped four soldiers .
Gen Abbas said negotiations were under way for their release .
With the economy worsening , B'nai Brith Canada fears disgruntled citizens are turning to a historic scapegoat to vent their anger and fear .
" Any time there 's bad economic times , the Jews get blamed for it , " said Marvin Kurz , national legal counsel for B'nai Brith Canada , which released yesterday an audit of reports of anti-Semitic incidents made to the group .
" The ancient tie between Jews and money that predates Shakespeare and Shylock continues to be stuck in some aspect of our collective memories . "
In the audit released , B'nai Brith stated that anti-Semitic incidents in Canada jumped by 8.9 per cent last year to 1,135 , a high for the 27 years the group has recorded the reports .
Almost half , 547 , were in the last four months of the year as the economy worsened
" Historically , anti-Semitism has increased in this type of climate , as disgruntled citizens seek a scapegoat to blame for their personal difficulties , " the audit states .
" Cyberspace has indeed been buzzing with conspiracy theories linking Jews to the global financial crisis , with Canadian opportunists being just as active as bigots elsewhere . "
The audit reports 405 incidents of Web - based hate activity with a Canadian connection in 2008 , a 30.6 per cent increase over the 310 cases in 2007 .
" Whenever something happens in Israel , anti-Semitism in Canada and around the world increases , " added Kurz .
Middle East tensions – often a trigger for anti-Semitic behaviour in past years – were largely absent throughout the fall , the audit states .
However , once fighting broke out in Gaza in December , there was another spike in incidents .
Across Canada , there were 151 incidents in December , 70 of which coincided with fighting in Gaza and 36 of which occurred in the closing days of the year , as tensions in the war - torn area heightened .
Kurz says that while most of the anti-Semitism he saw when he began with B'nai Brith 20 years ago was from the right wing , he now sees an increase in anti-Semitism on the extreme left , stemming from opposition to Israeli policies .
In the audit , B'nai Brith calls for tougher restrictions on racist groups and their symbols , and suggests that racist motivations be given greater prominence during the investigation of a crime , rather than just at sentencing .
More than half the total incidents , or 682 , took place in Ontario , a 17.2 per cent increase .
Of those , 538 were in the GTA , a 26 per cent jump .
Sixty - two were in Ottawa .
B'nai Brith tracks three forms of anti-Semitic behaviour – harassment , vandalism and violence – using a national hotline to collect data .
Harassment , including an incident in which a Toronto woman was called a " Christ killer " by her boss , was by far the biggest group , with 803 incidents reported .
There were also 318 cases of vandalism , including a Barrie synagogue that was defaced with the word Nazi just prior to the Jewish high holidays .

Obama Nominee Ron Kirk is a Tax Cheat
Stop me if you ’ve heard this one before , a cabinet appointee of President Obama ’s has tax problems .
Just for the record todayis March 3rd and the latest criminal nominated to serve under President Obama is Ron Kirk who was tabbed by the president to be his U.S. trade representative .
You are not reading an old post , this is not a re-post , this is yet another tax cheat who was appointed by President Obama .
Now let me get a little more serious , this is appointee number four for the president who has tax problems .
Ron Kirk forgot to claim almost $ 40,000 in income over five years as well as accidentally claiming to large of a deduction for some basketball tickets that he received , about $ 17,000 worth .
The committee found that Kirk failed to report as income $ 37,750 in honoraria collected for 16 speaking engagements at Austin College over those three years .
One year , he deducted honoraria from four events as charitable donations though he had n’t reported them as income , according to the committee report .
He also deducted too much for the cost of tickets to see the NBA Mavericks , reporting the entire $ 17,382 as business expenses , the report says .
The article goes on to say that he has agreed to pay the IRS the nearly $ 10,000 he owes them .
First of all , he agrees to pay them what he owes them ?
Did he have a choice ?
Does n’t he have to pay them ?
Secondly , is n’t it strange how he suddenly has seen the light and agreed to pay the back taxes he owed now that he is up for a position in the Obama administration .
Would he have agreed to pay these taxes if her were n’t ?
I do n’t think so .
This is how the White House spokesman categorized this latest tax cheat and his problems :
The mayor is working with the Finance Committee on a few minor issues
Owing the IRS $ 10,000 is a minor issue , that is according to the White House spokesman .
Lets see how far you or I get with that line of defense of the IRS ever comes knocking on our door .
Needless to say , the administration does n’t see this as a problem , they feel his nomination is still on course for approval .
And it probably is , these politicians in Washington are held to a different standard than we are .
The problem is that the Democrats won back the house and senate in 2006 because of what they called the “ Republican culture of corruption ” and then they won the White House by promising to bring change to Washington .
These nominees are in direct contrast to both , they continue the “ culture of corruption ” that Democrats railed against , and they trample any real chance that change was ever going to come to Washington under the Barack Obama administration .
Because one man , conceding defeat , did n't issue the typical statement indicating that he preferred to spend more time with his family , and instead launched a frontal attack on those who had attacked him , the foreign policy equation in Washington might have changed in discernible ways last week .
On withdrawing from his nomination as director of the National Intelligence Council , Charles Freeman , former ambassador to Saudi Arabia and a rare provocative thinker in Washington , let loose with a broadside against his enemies .
Of accusations from the generally right - wing groups and individuals who claim to represent the Jewish community in official Washington , he wrote :
" There is a special irony in having been accused of improper regard for the opinions of foreign governments and societies by a group so clearly intent on enforcing adherence to the policies of a foreign government -- in this case , the government of Israel .
I believe that the inability of the American public to discuss , or the government to consider , any option for US policies in the Middle East opposed by the ruling faction in Israeli politics has allowed that faction to adopt and sustain policies that ultimately threaten the existence of the state of Israel ...
This is not just a tragedy for Israelis and their neighbors in the Middle East ; it is doing widening damage to the national security of the United States . "
Thus began a firestorm of commentary , debate , and argument in the mainstream media about , among other things , the very existence of an " Israel lobby . "
Below , Robert Dreyfuss , who writes the Nation 's Dreyfuss Report blog and is the author of Devil 's Game : How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam , offers a powerful , needed assessment of what the Freeman affair may mean for the Obama administration and American policy in the Middle East .
One thing I find odd in the debate about that lobby is this : both those who believe it exists and those who deny its existence generally act as if such a lobby was sui generis in American politics .
No such thing .
It 's just that few bring up the obvious -- if , like all history , not exact -- analogy .
An " island " nation in the Middle East , Israel today plays a role arguably similar to that of an actual island which held formidable sway in American domestic politics decades ago .
Known then as Formosa , it became " the Republic of China " after Nationalist Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek , defeated in a fierce civil war by Mao Ze Dong 's communist movement , moved what was left of his government there .
From the late 1940s deep into the 1950s , that island version of China had a firm grip on what room for maneuver was available to any American government when it came to China policy .
With various Nationalist Chinese representatives and their congressional and media allies , then known as the China Lobby , putting key issues and realities beyond discussion , the results were disastrous .
It 's a cautionary tale that should n't be ignored in the present debate .
Tom
Judging by the outcome of the Charles W. ( " Chas " ) Freeman affair this week , it might seem as if the Israeli lobby is fearsome indeed .
Seen more broadly , however , the controversy over Freeman could be the Israel lobby 's Waterloo .
Let 's recap .
On February 19th , Laura Rozen reported at ForeignPolicy.com that Freeman had been selected by Admiral Dennis Blair , the director of national intelligence , to serve in a key post as chairman of the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) .
The NIC , the official in - house think tank of the intelligence community , takes input from 16 intelligence agencies and produces what are called " national intelligence estimates " on crucial topics of the day as guidance for Washington policymakers .
For that job , Freeman boasted a stellar resumé : fluent in Mandarin Chinese , widely experienced in Latin America , Asia , and Africa , a former U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War , and an ex-assistant secretary of defense during the Reagan administration .
A wry , outspoken iconoclast , Freeman had , however , crossed one of Washington 's red lines by virtue of his strong criticism of the U.S. - Israeli relationship .
Over the years , he had , in fact , honed a critique of Israel that was both eloquent and powerful .
Hours after the Foreign Policy story was posted , Steve Rosen , a former official of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , launched what would soon become a veritable barrage of criticism of Freeman on his right - wing blog .
Rosen himself has already been indicted by the Department of Justice in an espionage scandal over the transfer of classified information to outside parties involving a colleague at AIPAC , a former official in Donald Rumsfeld 's Pentagon , and an official at the Israeli embassy .
His blog , Obama Mideast Monitor , is hosted by the Middle East Forum website run by Daniel Pipes , a hard - core , pro-Israeli rightist , whose Middle East Quarterly is , in turn , edited by Michael Rubin of the American Enterprise Institute .
Over approximately two weeks , Rosen would post 19 pieces on the Freeman story .
The essence of Rosen 's criticism centered on the former ambassador 's strongly worded critique of Israel .
( That was no secret .
Freeman had repeatedly denounced many of Israel 's policies and Washington 's too - close relationship with Jerusalem .
" The brutal oppression of the Palestinians by the Israeli occupation shows no sign of ending , " said Freeman in 2007 .
" American identification with Israel has become total . " )
But Rosen , and those who followed his lead , broadened their attacks to make unfounded or exaggerated claims , taking quotes and emails out of context , and accusing Freeman of being a pro-Arab " lobbyist , " of being too closely identified with Saudi Arabia , and of being cavalier about China 's treatment of dissidents .
They tried to paint the sober , conservative former U.S. official as a wild - eyed radical , an anti-Semite , and a pawn of the Saudi king .
From Rosen 's blog , the anti-Freeman vitriol spread to other right - wing , Zionist , and neoconservative blogs , then to the websites of neocons mouthpieces like the New Republic , Commentary , National Review , and the Weekly Standard , which referred to Freeman as a " Saudi puppet . "
From there , it would spread to the Atlantic and then to the op - ed pages of the Wall Street Journal , where Gabriel Schoenfeld called Freeman a " China - coddling Israel basher , " and the Washington Post , where Jonathan Chait of the New Republic labeled Freeman a " fanatic . "
Before long , staunch partisans for Israel on Capitol Hill were getting into the act .
These would , in the end , include Representative Steve Israel and Senator Charles Schumer , both New York Democrats ; a group of Republican House members led by John Boehner of Ohio , the minority leader , and Eric Cantor of Virginia , the Republican Whip ; seven Republican members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence ; and , finally , Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , who engaged in a sharp exchange with Admiral Blair about Freeman at a Senate hearing .
Though Blair strongly defended Freeman , the two men got no support from an anxious White House , which took ( politely put ) a hands - off approach .
Seeing the writing on the wall -- all over the wall , in fact -- Freeman came to the conclusion that , even if he could withstand the storm , his ability to do the job had , in effect , already been torpedoed .
Whatever output the National Intelligence Council might produce under his leadership , as Freeman told me in an interview , would instantly be attacked .
" Anything that it produced that was politically controversial would immediately be attributed to me as some sort of political deviant , and be discredited , " he said .
On March 10th , Freeman bowed out , but not with a whimper .
In a letter to friends and colleagues , he launched a defiant , departing counterstrike that may , in fact , have helped to change the very nature of Washington politics .
" The tactics of the Israel lobby plumb the depths of dishonor and indecency and include character assassination , selective misquotation , the willful distortion of the record , the fabrication of falsehoods , and an utter disregard for the truth , " wrote Freeman .
" The aim of this lobby is control of the policy process through the exercise of a veto over the appointment of people who dispute the wisdom of its views . "
Freeman put it more metaphorically to me : " It was a nice way of , as the Chinese say , killing a chicken to scare the monkeys . "
By destroying his appointment , Freeman claimed , the Israel lobby hoped to intimidate other critics of Israel and U.S. Middle East policy who might seek jobs in the Obama administration .
On Triumphs , Hysterias , and Mobs
It remains to be seen just how many " monkeys " are trembling .
Certainly , the Israel lobby crowed in triumph .
Daniel Pipes , for instance , quickly praised Rosen 's role in bringing down Freeman :
" What you may not know is that Steven J. Rosen of the Middle East Forum was the person who first brought attention to the problematic nature of Freeman 's appointment , " wrote Pipes .
" Within hours , the word was out , and three weeks later Freeman has conceded defeat .
Only someone with Steve 's stature and credibility could have made this happen . "
The Zionist Organization of America , a far - right advocacy group that supports Israel , sent out follow - up Action Alerts to its membership , ringing further alarm bells about Freeman as part of a campaign to mobilize public opinion and Congress .
Behind the scenes , AIPAC quietly used its considerable clout , especially with friends and allies in the media .
And Chuck Schumer , who had trotted over to the White House to talk to Rahm Emanuel , President Obama 's chief of staff , later said bluntly :
" Charles Freeman was the wrong guy for this position .
His statements against Israel were way over the top and severely out of step with the administration .
I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him , and I am glad they did the right thing . "
Numerous reporters , including Max Blumenthal at the Daily Beast website and Spencer Ackerman of Firedoglake , have effectively documented the role of the Israel lobby , including AIPAC , in sabotaging Freeman 's appointment .
From their accounts and others , it seems clear that the lobby left its fingerprints all over Freeman 's National Intelligence Council corpse .
( Indeed , Time 's Joe Klein described the attack on Freeman as an " assassination , " adding that the term " lobby " does n't do justice to the methods of the various lobbying groups , individuals , and publications : " He was the victim of a mob , not a lobby .
The mob was composed primarily of Jewish neoconservatives . " )
On the other hand , the Washington Post , in a near - hysterical editorial , decided to pretend that the Israel lobby really does n't exist , accusing Freeman instead of sending out a " crackpot tirade . "
Huffed the Post , " Mr. Freeman issued a two - page screed on Tuesday in which he described himself as the victim of a shadowy and sinister ' Lobby ' ...
His statement was a grotesque libel . "
The Post 's case might have been stronger , had it not , just one day earlier , printed an editorial in which it called on Attorney General Eric Holder to exonerate Steve Rosen and drop the espionage case against him .
Entitled " Time to Call It Quits , " the editorial said :
" The matter involves Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman , two former officials for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee , or AIPAC ...
A trial has been scheduled for June in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia .
Mr. Holder should pull the plug on this prosecution long before then . "
In his interview with me , Freeman noted the propensity members of the Israel lobby have for denying the lobby 's existence , even while taking credit for having forced him out and simultaneously claiming that they had nothing to do with it .
" We 're now at the ludicrous stage where those who boasted of having done it and who described how they did it are now denying that they did it , " he said .
Running Scared
The Israel lobby has regularly denied its own existence even as it has long carried on with its work , in stealth as in the bright sunlight .
In retrospect , however , l'affaire Freeman may prove a game changer .
It has already sparked a new , more intense mainstream focus on the lobby , one that far surpasses the flap that began in March , 2006 , over the publication of an essay by John Mearsheimer and Steven Walt in the London Review of Books that was , in 2007 , expanded into a book , The Israel Lobby .
In fact , one of the sins committed by Freeman , according to his critics , is that an organization he headed , the Middle East Policy Council , published an early version of the Mearsheimer - Walt thesis -- which argued that a powerful , pro-Israel coalition exercises undue influence over American policymakers -- in its journal .
In his blog at Foreign Policy , Walt reacted to Freeman 's decision to withdraw by writing :
" For all of you out there who may have questioned whether there was a powerful ' Israel lobby , ' or who admitted that it existed but did n't think it had much influence , or who thought that the real problem was some supposedly all - powerful ' Saudi lobby , ' think again . "
What the Freeman affair brought was unwanted , often front - page attention to the lobby .
Writers at countless blogs and websites -- including yours truly , at the Dreyfuss Report -- dissected or reported on the lobby 's assault on Freeman , including Daniel Luban and Jim Lobe at Antiwar.com , Glenn Greenwald in his Salon.com column , M.J. Rosenberg of the Israel Peace Forum , and Phil Weiss at Mondoweiss .
Far more striking , however , is that for the first time in memory , both the New York Times and the Washington Post ran page - one stories about the Freeman controversy that specifically used the phrase " Israel lobby , " while detailing the charges and countercharges that followed upon Freeman 's claim that the lobby did him in .
This new attention to the lobby 's work comes at a critical moment , which is why the toppling of Freeman might be its Waterloo .
As a start , right - wing partisans of Israel have grown increasingly anxious about the direction that President Obama intends to take when it comes to U.S. policy toward Israel , the Palestinians , Iran , and the Middle East generally .
Despite the way , in the middle of the presidential campaign last June , Obama recited a pro-Israeli catechism in a speech at AIPAC 's national conference in Washington , they remain unconvinced that he will prove reliable on their policy concerns .
Among other things , they have long been suspicious of his reputed openness to Palestinian points of view .
No less important , while the appointments of Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state and Rahm Emanuel as his chief of staff were reassuring , other appointments were far less so .
They were , for instance , concerned by several of Obama 's campaign advisers -- and not only Robert Malley of the International Crisis Group and former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski , who were quietly eased out of Obamaland early in 2008 .
An additional source of worry was Daniel Shapiro and Daniel Kurtzer , both Jewish , who served as Obama 's top Middle East aides during the campaign and were seen as not sufficiently loyal to the causes favored by hardline , right - wing types .
Since the election , many lobby members have viewed a number of Obama 's top appointments , including Shapiro , who 's taken the Middle East portfolio at the National Security Council , and Kurtzer , who 's in line for a top State Department job , with great unease .
Take retired Marine general and now National Security Advisor James L. Jones , who , like Brzezinski , is seen as too sympathetic to the Palestinian point of view and who reputedly wrote a report last year highly critical of Israel 's occupation policies ; or consider George Mitchell , the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East , who is regarded by many pro-Israeli hawks as far too level - headed and even - handed to be a good mediator ; or , to mention one more appointment , Samantha Power , author of A Problem from Hell and now a National Security Council official who has , in the past , made comments sharply critical of Israel .
Of all of these figures , Freeman , because of his record of blunt statements , was the most vulnerable .
His appointment looked like low - hanging fruit when it came to launching a concerted , preemptive attack on the administration .
As it happens , however , this may prove anything but a moment of strength for the lobby .
After all , the recent three - week Israeli assault on Gaza had already generated a barrage of headlines and television images that made Israel look like a bully nation with little regard for Palestinian lives , including those of women and children .
According to polls taken in the wake of Gaza , growing numbers of Americans , including many in the Jewish community , have begun to exhibit doubts about Israel 's actions , a rare moment when public opinion has begun to tilt against Israel .
Perhaps most important of all , Israel is about to be run by an extremist , ultra right - wing government led by Likud Party leader Bibi Netanyahu , and including the even more extreme party of Avigdor Lieberman , as well as a host of radical - right religious parties .
It 's an ugly coalition that is guaranteed to clash with the priorities of the Obama White House .
As a result , the arrival of the Netanyahu - Lieberman government is also guaranteed to prove a crisis moment for the Israel lobby .
It will present an enormous public - relations problem , akin to the one that faced ad agency Hill & Knowlton during the decades in which it had to defend Philip Morris , the hated cigarette company that repeatedly denied the link between its products and cancer .
The Israel lobby knows that it will be difficult to sell cartons of menthol smooth Netanyahu - Lieberman 100s to American consumers .
Indeed , Freeman told me :
" The only thing I regret is that in my statement I embraced the term ' Israel lobby . '
This is n't really a lobby by , for , or about Israel .
It 's really , well , I 've decided I 'm going to call it from now on the [ Avigdor ] Lieberman lobby .
It 's the very right - wing Likud in Israel and its fanatic supporters here .
And Avigdor Lieberman is really the guy that they really agree with . "
So here 's the reality behind the Freeman debacle : Already worried over Team Obama , suffering the after - effects of the Gaza debacle , and about to be burdened with the Netanyahu - Lieberman problem , the Israel lobby is undoubtedly running scared .
They succeeded in knocking off Freeman , but the true test of their strength is yet to come .
Robert Dreyfuss is an independent investigative journalist in Alexandria , Virginia .
He is a regular contributor to Rolling Stone , the Nation , the American Prospect , Mother Jones , and the Washington Monthly .
He is also the author of Devil 's Game : How the United States Helped Unleash Fundamentalist Islam ( Henry Holt / Metropolitan ) .
He writes the Dreyfuss Report blog for the Nation magazine .
As charities say , it takes money to raise money -- and a growing number of organizations are tapping donors for those costs through what 's known as a " gift tax . "
Big donors often want their entire gift to go to a specific purpose , be it a research program , a construction project or something else .
To keep them satisfied , many organizations exempted those donations from being used , to any extent , for fundraising and other general administrative costs .
These costs were covered by endowment profits or unrestricted gifts .
" In ...

Bow Down Before the One You Serve

The latest fringe right meme : President Obama tipped us off to , uh , something , by briefly bowing before the king of Saudi Arabia .
Townhall.com has the video ( after the jump ) :
From the comments at , oh , let ’s pick a random site … Michelle Malkin ’s blog .
“ Call me crazy – but Obama is communicating to a muslim how a muslim communicates .
It ’s really that simple .
I was never one to accuse the man of being muslim in the past , but honestly , the more I hear and see from this man regarding all things muslim – it is disconcerting . ”
“ Maybe he was chanting his allah akbars when he was in Rev Wrights church for the last twenty years . ”
“ Is he bowing to Abdullah as a dhimmi , or is he bowing to acknowledge the king ’s possession of Mecca ? ”
“ HUSSEIN Obama recognizes the Saudi king as the defender of the Islamic faith … and that gets a bow from any moslem .
Amyone ever see Obama eat a pork chop ? ”
Now , this is n’t at all when inspired Malkin to post the story .
She was criticizing the president for genuflecting before the Saudis the way that former President George W. Bush once did .
The “ Obama proved he was a Muslim ! ” meme is sticking , though .
This is the 50th episode of the StackOverflow podcast , where Joel and Jeff sit down with Steve Yegge of Google and the most excellent Stevey ’s Blog Rants .
This episode was recorded on site at the Kirkland , Washington Google office , where Joel gave a talk earlier in the day .
A brief discussion about the APL language , whose keywords are symbols .
Imagine how challenging it would be to program in a language where you need a special keyboard .
There ’s a more popular ( not sure “ popular ” is the right word ) version of APL named J which drops the symbols in favor of plain ASCII .
How big a fan of working at Google is Steve ?
He worries that new hires from college will expect the rest of their working life to be as good as their Google experience .
Steve can finally talk about what he was working on , which he was so vague about on our previous podcast with him .
Mostly , he was disturbed at the state of JavaScript tooling at Google — “ dude , you spelled it fuction again . ”
The state of the art in tools means painstakingly adding support for each individual language into each individual editor .
What if there was a way to plug first - class language intellisense / compilation functionality into any editor — in a generalized way ?
That ’s the problem Steve set out to solve .
Take compilers that are defined for IDEs — Eclipse has three Java compilers built into it — a fast inaccurate one as you type , a better batch one , and then a great big one that does exhaustive analysis on large trees ( Steve says Eclipse has “ a better Java compiler than the Java compiler ” . )
This is all necessary to get good editor support !
Why not take these compilers and run them on the google infrastructure , so they are commoditized and available to any editor ?
Steve says the way tools and languages integrate today is utterly backwards .
Languages should support the tools , rather than the other way around .
“ We should have been doing this for 20 years ! ”
Prototype does n’t play well with the JavaScript compiler at Google , partly because nobody has actually tried to compile the code before !
It exposes some problems that were n’t immediately obvious .
All the common JavaScript frameworks require some tweaking for the JavaScript compilation process .
Steve likens the comparison between compilation and dynamic typing to taking a shower and brushing your teeth .
You should do both !
The only reason we ca n’t do both of these things is because , as Steve points out , our tooling currently sucks .
JavaScript has a more interesting origin than I realized — it was originally based on Scheme .
Per Steve , Scala is like Haskell but with more concessions to real world programming .
He points out that the great thing about Java is the fantastic tooling , which means it ’s ultimately a better programming experience than a theoretically “ superior ” programming language .
Joel does n’t hate Unix ; FogBugz supports Unix ( although that support tends to be complex and costly ) and Joel regularly runs cygwin on his laptop .
That said , modern Unixes have their faults too .
Steve observes that the only way to determine what packages are installed on Ubuntu is to diff the dpackage output against a clean machine .
Also , Firefox is very slow on Linux relative to Mac and Windows .
Stack Overflow is for programming related questions , but defining programming related is n’t easy .
There will always be a gray area , which is further complicated by the fact that we do want the _occasional _fun questions — we just do n’t want the system overrun with the stuff .
Steve points out that even Amazon has examples of “ fun ” product reviews that would n’t normally be permitted , such as On Amazon , All of a Sudden Everyone ’s a Milk Critic and The Story About Ping .

I know this can be a sign of diabetes .
But I wondered if dry mouth / thirst is also just a symptom that some pregnant women deal with ( who DON'T have diabetes ) ?
gestational diabetes .
I do n't recall any studies about the topic .
Historically cannabis has been used to ease childbirth .
I know the the uterus has a high concentration of cannabinoid receptors .
I 've seen several cases of sugar being reduced in type 2 and a couple of cases for type 1 .
I 've seen a couple of medical studies that noted benefit for both types of diabetes .
And the Rick Simpson folks have noted the sugar reduction effect .
In fact they warn to monitor sugar with diabetics that are on diabetic medication .
That the regular medication may need to be lowered or eliminated .
That may include elimination of insulin shots .
As for the gestational diabetes , I just do n't have any information about it to pass on .
But based on how these other forms of diabetes react to cannabinoids , I would expect this form to benefit also .
I think that if there were a problem related to marijuana and gestation , we would have heard about it by now .
In big bold press on the front pages of a lot of papers and as headlines on CNN .
I 'm not suggesting that you try it out .
I can't risk making such a suggestion .
But I think it would be good for both mother and child .

Let ’s say you live in the suburbs and work downtown .
You always take the highway because it ’s a safer route , but surface streets would be so much faster if you could just get over your fear of driving through the inner city .
BMW has heeded your call .
The BMW X5 Security Plus is the anxious commuter ’s new best friend .
Now , for the first time ever available to the public from a high volume manufacturer , you have access to a Class 6 bullet proof vehicle with armor plating .
Designed to handle heavy AK - 47 fire and be impervious to clubbing , the new Security Plus option also has sealed joints that prevent penetration from bullets or fragments and make virtually impossible your being pried from the vehicle with a crossbar .
Robbery , abduction and carjacking are things of the past as long as you are inside your personal BMW “ safe room . ”
Jodi Foster would be proud .
But the fun does n’t stop there .
A special intercom system allows communication with external parties so that you do n’t have to drop your window or open your door to say “ I called the police !
Run Forrest , Run ! ”
Pressing the hold - up alarm immediately puts the vehicle into lockdown wherein the doors and windows secure themselves , a loud siren blares and lights flash .
Just like Jason Statham ’s g-ride in The Transporter ( yes , I know it was an Audi ) , you get a cool set of controls placed behind a panel on the center console .
Optional camera mounts can provide rear view and side view video through the iDrive system on the dashboard .
The BMW X5 Security Plus is based on the company ’s Sports Activity Vehicle ( SAV ) .
An upgraded suspension adds the capability to handle multiple terrains and special run-flat tires keep you moving forward . (
I wonder after how many AK - 47 projectiles a run-flat tire loses it effectiveness ? …)
Power comes from a 4.8 - liter V8 that ’s powerful enough to lug this titan from 0 to 62 mph in 8.2 seconds .
We ’d like to see the BMW X5 M engine thrown in the mix .
This may just be my own paranoia talking here , but I like to reach maximum escape velocity very quickly when I feel in danger .
But I can understand why hurling all that weight with 500 hp may be a bad idea for the everyday man who would probably overreact to a scary trick - o- treater and wrap this baby around a light pole at 160 mph where it would take 3 weeks for a blowtorch and the '” jaws of life ” to get it free .
Actually , that brings up an interesting question .
Is there a fridge or food hideway in this thing ?
If you have to wait out an attack and ca n’t just drive away , for example , ham sandwiches and slaw may satisfy your appetite as you watch an angry mob smashing away at your unbreakable windshield .

『その日の試験は “ グループディスカッション ” でした。
採用希望者が何人か集まって、与えられたテーマについて議論する。
審査官は黙ってその様子をチェックする、という試験です。
私が部屋に入ると、そこには一人の審査官と、７人の大学生がいました。
最初に全員の自己紹介。いわゆる“ 名門大学 ” の学生も何人か混じっていたのを覚えています。
自己紹介が終わると、審査官は一枚の紙を全員に配りました。そこに記されていたのは以下のリストです。
・酸素ボンベ（40kg×8 ）
・飲料水（30L×8 ）
・パラシュー ト
・ ４平方メートルの白い布
・ビスケッ ト
・粉ミル ク
・非常用信号 弾
・宇宙食
・ライタ ー
・ 45 口 径の 拳 銃
・方位磁 石
・無線機（受信のみ ）
・救急用医療セッ ト
なんだこりゃ、と私が顔をあげると、審査官は宣言しました。
「 あなた方８人が乗っていた宇宙船が故障し、月面に不時着することになりました。
着陸の際の衝撃で宇宙船は大破。あなた方にお渡ししたのは、中から持ち出すことができた品物のリストです。救助隊とのランデブー地点まで180km、あなた方はその距離を自らの足で進まなければなりません。現在の状況下でリストの品物に優先順位をつけてください。質問は一切受け付けません」』
『まさか就職活動中に月面で遭難することになろうとは。
予想外の展開に、私はわくわくする心を抑えられませんでした。
まず、これらの品物は宇宙空間仕様になっているのかを考えねばなるまい。そうでなかったら、ライター、拳銃は使い物にならない。おそらく信号弾もだめだろう。そしてさらに重要な点として、装着している宇宙服は、外部から食料を供給することが可能なのかという問題がある。月面で顔をむきだしにしたらどうなるかなんて考えたくもない。
といったことを私が一人で考えていると、他のメンバーが手をあげて自分の主張を始めました。
……その 内容は、驚くべきものでした 。
「 パラシュートはあったほうがいいでしょう。崖があったら降りられない」
「 この白い布ですけど、ライターで燃やせば救助隊への目印になりますよね」
「 酸素ボンベは重すぎて持ち運べない。海にもぐる必要はないだろうし、おいていきましょう」
「 水も最小限でいいんじゃないですか？ 足りなくなったら途中でくめばいい」
途中まではジョークに違いないと思いながら聞いていましたが、誰もにこりともしません。
どうやら彼等は本気のようです。
やがて私の番がまわってきたとき、すでに私は冷静さを失っていたのでしょう。
「 月をなめるな 」
それが私の第一声でした 。
その後、えんえんと月面について語り、そのままタイムアップ。
当然のように不合格でしたとも。ええ』
６～７年前のこと、僕はマディソンウィスコンシン大学（科学／工業系の良い学校です）の哲学のクラスにいました。ＴＡ（教育助手）はデカルトについて説明していました。彼は物事は必ずしも思った通りになるわけではないということを説明しようとして、こう言いました。地球でペンを放せばいつでも下に落ちる。しかし、月では漂い出してしまう、と。
僕の顎はがくっと落ちました。「何で！」と口走りました。部屋を見回すと、僕の友人のマークと、もう一人の学生だけが、ＴＡの言葉に混乱していました。他の１７人の学生は、「何か問題でも？」という顔で僕を見ていました。
「 だって、月でペンを落としても下に落ちますよ、すごくゆっくりだけど」と僕は抗議しました。
「 いや、違うよ」ＴＡは穏やかに説明しました。「だって地球の重力から遠く離れているからね」
考えろ、考えろ、そうだ！ 「アポロの宇宙飛行士が月面を歩いているのを見たことがあるでしょう？」僕は言い返しました。「なぜ彼らは漂って行かなかったんですか？」「それは重いブーツを履いてたからさ」完全に筋が通っているかのように、彼は答えました。（思い出してください。彼は多くの論理学のクラスを受け持つ哲学のＴＡなのです）
僕はあきらめました。僕たちは完全に別々の世界に住んでいて、自分たちとは異なる言語を理解できないのだと。部屋を出る時、友人のマークは激怒していました。「何てこった！
あの連中はどうやってあそこまで愚かになれるんだ！」
僕は理解しようとしました。 「 マーク、彼らも一時はこうしたことを知っていたんだよ。でも、彼らの基本的な世界観の一部じゃないので、忘れてしまったのさ。ほとんどの人々がたぶん同じ誤解をしてるよ」僕たちは寮の部屋に戻ってくると、僕の論点を証明するために、キャンパス用の電話帳から名前をランダムに選択し、約30人に電話をして、こんな質問をしました。
1. あなたは月面でペンを持って立っています。それを放したらどうなりますか？ a)遠くまで漂ってゆく。b)その場に浮かんでいる。c)地面に落ちる。
約47パーセントがこの質問に正解しました。間違っていた人に対して、僕たちは追加の質問をしました。
2. あなたはアポロの宇宙飛行士が月を歩き回っているフィルムを見たでしょう。彼らはなぜ漂い出さなかったのですか?
これを聴くと、約20パーセントの人は最初の質問の答えを変えました！
しかし、最も驚くべきなのは、彼らの約半分が自信たっぷりにこう答えたことです。「彼らは重いブーツを履いてたんだ」
もう９年も前の話である。以前から一部で有名な話だったらしいんだけど、僕は知ったのはつい最近である。２０００年頃と言ったら、まだ接続が遅かったせいで、インターネットはほとんどやっていなかったのだ。「間歇日記」これ、以前から新人研修や就職試験でよく出る問題だったらしい。（知り合いにも「やった」という人がいる）細かいことを言えば、これはずいぶんアバウトな問題である。「質問は一切受け付けません」というのは、ちと困る。この宇宙服はヘルメットをかぶったまま水を飲んだり宇宙食を食べたりできる仕様になっているのか、通信機はどれぐらいの重さで周波帯は何ヘルツなのか、そもそもここは月のニアサイドなのかファーサイドなのか、今は月の昼なのか夜なのか……といった条件が分からないと、必要かどうか判断できないものが多いのだ。天文学や宇宙開発に詳しい人ほど悩むかもしれない。しかし、この場合、大学生たちの反応は予想の斜め上を行っていた。今ならこのリストに「ＧＰＳ機能つき携帯電話」を入れてもいいかもしれない。「これは持って行きましょう。地球と電話で話せるし、ＧＰＳで現在位置も分かるし」とか言い出す奴が絶対いると思う。日本の大学生だけではない。アメリカでも似たような「月の哲学者」という話がある。（試訳。英語は苦手なので、間違いがあるかもしれませんが、ご容赦）「いくら何でもこんなのはネタだろ？」と思われる人も多いかもしれない。僕はそうは思わない。科学に興味のない一般人の、天文学や物理学に関する知識の欠如については、実例をいっぱい見てきたからだ。スペースシャトルや宇宙ステーションの中が無重力なのは「地球の引力が届かないほど遠いからだ」と思っている人。小惑星帯には見渡すかぎり無数の岩のかけらが漂っていると思っている人。彗星の尾は進行方向と反対方向にたなびくと思っている人。彗星と流星の区別がついていない人。夏が暑いのは、地球が太陽に近づくからだと思っている人……。僕はそういう誤解をさんざん見てきた。ちょうど今、フィリップ・プレイト『イケナイ宇宙学』（楽工社）という本が出ている。素人が誤解しがちな天文学の常識を解説した本なのだが、これによると、欧米では「月の裏側はいつも暗い」と思っている人や、「夜空でいちばん明るい星は北極星」だとか「空が青いのは海の色を反射しているからだ」とかと思っている人も多いらしい。当然のことながら、 「 宇宙で写真を撮ったら必ず星が写る」と思っている人も多い。そういう人たちがアポロの月面写真に星が写っていないのを見て、「捏造だ！」と言い出すわけである。（『イケナイ宇宙学』の中でも、ひとつの章がアポロ陰謀説への論破に当てられている）つい先日も、アポロ陰謀説の信者とまではいかなくても、疑問を抱いている人に出会ったばかり。某有名小説誌の編集者である。「アポロで撮られた写真が嘘だっていう話、あれはどうなんですかねえ？
影の向きがバラバラなのは、ライトがいくつもあるからだっていうのは」と訊ねられたので、遠近法や地面の凹凸によって影の向きが平行にならないこともあるのだと説明し、「だいたい、光源がいくつもあったら、影もいくつもできなきゃおかしいでしょ」と言うと、「ああ、言われてみればそうですねえ」と、おおげさに感心していた。光源が複数あったら影も複数できる……という当たり前のことでも、言われるまで気がつかない人がいるのである。ちなみに、その人がアポロ捏造説に初めて接したのは、例のビートたけしの番組だそうだ。これが陰謀説信者となると、さらにひどい。今、mixiの「人類は月に行っていない!?」というコミュに入っているのだが、陰謀説信者の知識の欠如ときたら、まさに絶望的。ほんの一例を示すと、アポロの月着陸船の写真を貼りつけて、「NASAが発表したこんなちゃちな宇宙船で、月面に降りたり、月面から地球に向けて飛び立ったり、地球に着陸したりできるかな」などという人がいるのだ。この人はアポロの飛行士たちが月着陸船に乗って地球まで戻ってきて、地球に「着陸」したと思っているのだ！中学生程度の計算もできない連中も何人もいる。きちんと計算を示してやっても、「数字なんか信じられない」「直感で十分」と開き直られるので、まったく手がつけられない。彼らは天文学や物理学や宇宙開発について完璧なまでに無知であり、自分で計算もできないのに、アポロの映像に科学的な間違いを指摘できると思い上がっている。無知そのものはしかたがない。僕もそうだが、一人の人間は世の中のことの一万分の一も知らないものだ。分からないことは調べればいい。それでも分からないことは、判断を保留しておけばいい。必要なのは謙虚さだと思う。「専門家ではない無知な自分には理解できないことが多いのだ」と思うこと。専門家ではない人間の言葉は疑ってかかること。それがトンデモ説にひっかからない秘訣だろう。
Twenty of China 's most courageous and outspoken civil rights lawyers face being disbarred next Monday , as judicial authorities reject or delay their applications to renew their professional licenses , according to three of the lawyers affected .
Forbidding them to practice after a May 31 deadline would , at a stroke , decapitate the budding " rights protection movement " that is at the heart of activists ' efforts to build a civil society in China .
" If these 20 lose their licenses it would be the biggest step back in legal reform for 20 years , " warns Nicholas Bequelin , a researcher with Human Rights Watch based in Hong Kong .
" It would be really very dramatic . "
The lawyers who have reported problems having their annual licenses renewed have all represented plaintiffs or defendants in politically sensitive cases over the past year , such as members of the banned Falun Gong religious group , parents of children killed at their school desks in the Sichuan earthquake last May , and people arrested in the March 2008 crackdown in Tibet .
What they have in common , says Jiang Tianyong , who recently successfully represented a Tibetan monk charged with concealing weapons , is that " we do not take orders from the [ government 's ] Judicial Affairs Bureau " about which cases to take .
Some , like Wei Liangyue in the northern city of Harbin , who recently served 30 days in prison in connection with the defendant , accused of belonging to Falun Gong , whom he is representing , have already been told by officials that their licences will not be renewed before the deadline .
" They are worried that I will take more Falun Gong cases , " says Mr. Wei .
Others , such as Mr. Jiang , have not yet received official notification that they should send their license for renewal .
" There is not much time left , " he points out , fearful that he will be unable to practice law next week .
Dong Chunjiang , a senior official at the Beijing Judicial Affairs Bureau , refused to answer a reporter 's questions about the delay .
Though troublesome lawyers have had problems in the past renewing their licenses , " this year it is more severe , " says Patrick Poon , executive secretary of the Hong Kong - based China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group .
" These lawyers are taking up a lot of sensitive cases ... and that has touched a nerve in the authorities , " he adds .
" More and more lawyers are getting involved in these sorts of cases , " says Wen Haibo , who says he fears for his license because of his work on behalf of some of the 50,000 - plus children poisoned by Sanlu - brand powdered milk last fall , among other things .
" Somebody believes that if this trend continues , the situation will get out of control . "
The handful of civil rights lawyers have an impact far beyond their numbers .
Of the 120,000 lawyers in China , hardly any take criminal cases , let alone human rights cases .
Only a few score lawyers have taken it upon themselves to litigate sensitive cases .
Even if all or most of the controversial group are eventually given new licenses , warns Mr. Bequelin , the affair " will have a chilling effect on lawyers , to deter them from taking sensitive cases .
" You can have all kinds of nice laws , but if people do n't dare to take cases to court it defeats the purpose of having rights , " he points out .
" In China lawyers are walking on thin ice , and we are hearing some cracks that are not very reassuring . "
Jiang and other civil rights lawyers say that their firms have come under quiet but strong pressure from the judicial authorities to sack them , or to steer them clear of cases that the government would prefer to see swept under the carpet .
Earlier this year a prominent civil rights law firm , Yitong , was closed down for six months on a technicality .
" We are seen as unstable elements in society , and the government wants to maintain superficial harmony and stability , " Jiang says .
Silencing lawyers , however , does not resolve the social problems that they bring to court , such as land grabs or other illegal practices by local authorities .
The ranks of civil rights lawyers have swelled in recent years because " they are riding a tectonic shift in the citizenry 's view of the law , " says Bequelin .
" You can shoot the messenger , but that wo n't change Chinese citizens putting up more of a fight to defend their rights . "
The Rise To The Top : Entertaining , Energizing and Empowering Entrepreneurs
The Everything Goes Right Day : The “ One ” Entrepreneurship Principle
Earlier this year I wrote a somewhat controversial blog post about how to suck it up and deal with crappy days that of course come up on the entrepreneurial path to success .
Some days everything seems to go wrong :
Your clients fall off the face of the earth , your best employee quits , you spill coffee in a place where coffee ( or anything else should n’t be spilled ) and probably something else happens such as the letter “ E ” on your keyboard falls off .
These tough days are of course difficult to deal with .
Self - doubt rears its stupid head , things go wrong which in turn seems to make everything else go wrong ( awkward moment there from “ The Secret ” ) and of course the most successful pound through this days ( hopefully not with Scotch ) in their continued Rise To The Top .
Now lets flip the coin and talk about something that happens but is rarely talked about :
The everything goes completely right day .
You heard back from three people you have been trying to reach for a century , your website hits are on fire ( not literally , I hope ) , you received that one HUGE email from a client , and you found an extra $ 20 in your pants .
Suddenly you feel on top of the world .
The 18 hour work days , sleepless nights , endless phone calls and emails are all worth it .
You can feel in your very bones that big things are happening .
You are pumped up , high - fiving strangers ( I do that but then again I ’m weird ) and ready to take on the next challenge .
Whether your company is making - $ 1 , $ 1 , $ 10,000 , $ 1,000,000 , or $ 1,000,000,000 , remember this small , but important point : Enjoy those amazing days .
Relish in them .
Get energy from them .
Do things you did n’t think were possible .
Do n’t consider yourself lucky .
You are an entrepreneur and work your freaking face off .
You create your own luck for days like today .
Business , like your personal life , is meant to be enjoyed .
Own it .
It may be naive to think that every day can be “ the everything goes right day ” so I wo n’t paint the pretty picture of all of us singing Kumbaya and passing around cupcakes .
But , here is an idea : Focus on the power of one .
ONE big email you received back that you have been waiting for .
ONE big phone call you made .
ONE person that said something nice about you and your business .
ONE new business contact you made .
ONE editor from a news source that called or emailed you back .
ONE customer that is interested in you , your product , or your service .
ONE business partner that seemingly comes out of nowhere .
ONE opportunity you have been waiting for .
ONE risk that you decide to take .
ONE sale .
ONE person that follows through on a promise .
ONE website user that loves your content .
A million little ones are going to add up both for you , your business , and your bank account .
Today I ’ve definitely had one of those days and it just continues to be a flood of “ ones ” from an international distribution deal pending for The Rise To The Top , some amazing new sponsors coming on board , a crazy “ business celebrity ” contact made , a possible co-partner for our The Rise To The Top LIVE Series , good news on taxes , and much more .
It is days like today that keep you energized , humble , and remember the bigger picture .
Now get out there and rack up the “ ones ” .
Live Passionately !

Conficker -- the malicious worm expected to activate today -- did not cause widespread computer meltdowns around the globe .
But considering that Microsoft patched the flaw five months ago , it 's not clear why Conficker ever became a concern to begin with .
So why was it an issue -- and will it be an issue again ?
The rise of Conficker , as an event and as a media phenomenon , has as much to do with user inaction as it does with the actual threat posed by the worm itself .
The Conficker worm is proof positive of the fact that despite security updates and media reports , users can be the weak link in the security ecosystem unless motivated to action .
" Unfortunately the majority of the work that we are doing now is unnecessary if we had reacted quicker in the first place , patching immediately after the fix was released , " Wolfgang Kandek , Qualys 's CTO , told InternetNews.com .
" The delay in applying the patch has lead to this widespread problem with millions of machines infected , and is something that we , the industry and the users , have to address . "
Fortunately , while many users did n't patch for Conficker early on , all the media hype surrounding the April 1 activation date may have had a positive impact on mitigating risk .
" The problem with past Wolverine games is that they played to an ESRB rating , not who the character is , " said Senior Producer Jeff Poffenbarger while showing off the X - Men Origins : Wolverine game recently to a few members of the gaming press .
The movie will be rated PG - 13 , which means Logan / Wolverine will be slashing at the ground and walls , with perhaps a few bloodless attacks on enemies .
But the game will be rated Mature , which means that Wolverine will be able to rip his prey limb from limb .
" In past games , you 'd have things like Professor X telling Wolverine to ' sheath those claws ! ' and you know , I just did this after a while , " Poffenbarger said , and he pantomimed putting the controller down .
No one in the room had a sense of how bloody and violent the new game would be , as the pictures given to magazines and websites early on featured no blood and no violent attacks .
We pressed for reasons why and everyone got uncomfortable .
It boils down to marketing , and perhaps keeping the expectations in line with what the movie will show .
To illustrate Raven 's love of the character , let me share some of the scenes we saw in our demo .
A soldier stalks Wolverine , who stands on the other side of a cement wall .
They 're both listening to the wall , trying to sense the movements of the other .
Wolverine puts his fist against the wall , pointing at the soldier 's head .
The claws come out , slicing through the cement and running through the man 's head at three points .
There is blood .
The man twitches .
Logan " sheaths those claws " and the man drops dead .
The camera does n't pull away .
In another scene , Wolverine leaps onto a helicopter , punches through the glass , drags the pilot out , and holds his head up to the spinning blades with predictably wet results .
We see a multi-stage fight against a Sentinel , part of which happens in mid-air .
The Sentinel crashes , and Wolverine puts his arms forward in a Superman pose and then slams through the robot's head like a bullet .
The resulting crater looks just like the panel of a comic book .
It 's odd to see Hugh Jackman become this brutal killer in the game , knowing that the violence and ferocity most likely wo n't be present in the film .
Even cooler is that his healing factor is handled both as a game mechanic — this is the rare game where regenerative health makes sense — but also graphically .
As Wolverine gets shot up you see blood on his clothes , then gashes in his skin , and then you can begin to see the adamantium skeleton underneath .
If he gets really beaten up , you might see clean through his body in places .
Do n't worry : take out the threat and just wait .
You 'll watch his skin grow back and his wounds close in real time .
Later , I was able to play the game myself .
The controls are intuitive , the battles intense .
When your claws hit an arm , the arm comes off .
To counteract the guns of your enemies , you have a targeted lunge move where Wolverine pounces on an enemy , claws out , and knocks him to the ground .
There you can basically lay the chest open , blood and gristle flying this way and that .
There are only a few moves that feel too " video gamey , " such as a spinning attack where Logan begins to look like a helicopter .
There will be seven boss battles and , like the multi-stage Sentinel fight , some will be up to 30 minutes long .
The gameplay is solid and feels great .
Better yet , Wolverine is a feral , insane , brutal weapon in the game .
It 's like Raven used the movie tie - in as an excuse to make the Wolverine game we all wanted , and better yet was able to use Hugh Jackman 's likeness to do things the film version could never get away with .
I had very few hopes for the game when I entered the meeting , but I left excited about the upcoming title .
It 's possible all this enthusiasm will be dulled by the full release — and we 've been promised a review sample so we 'll be able to give you all the dirt — but on the surface this looks like what a Wolverine game should be .
I asked what other character Raven would like to handle next .
" We 'd love to do the same thing with Gambit , " I was told .
Based on what we 've seen far , we 'd love it if they got the chance .
X - Men Origins : Wolverine is coming to every platform under the sun May 1 .

Today was a very interesting day .
I find it completely ironic how a company will change it ’s tune when they realize they have been nothing but complete and utter schmucks .
I ’m pretty sure the staff that insulted and berated my mother - in - law did n’t give their actions a second thought when they showed up for work today , but this evening I uncovered some things that put the ball is back in our court , and they are not going to be too happy about it .
Twenty - four hours ago my mother - in - law was called a liar , she was demeaned by Erica ( a Best Buy staff member ) , the “ manager ” Nathaniel refused to engage her on the phone , and the corporate “ customer relations ” representative , Billy , told her there was nothing he could do about it .
My mother - in - law endured Erica ’s sarcasm and her rude and inconsiderate attitude .
She tried to humiliate her over the phone and then Billy took the word of Nathaniel and Erica over the word of their customer , without knowing one way or the other , who might be telling the truth .
I ’m pretty sure if asked , the corporate office will deny that ‘ jackass ’ training is included when they hire new employees , but Erica did her best to make my mother - in - law feel stupid for trying to pursue the matter , and after insulting her and getting very sarcastic with her on the phone , she told my mother - in - law to call the corporate office and hung up on her .
When my mother - in - law called the corporate office , Billy told her there was nothing they could do because the manager at the store informed him that the camera “ appeared it had been dropped ” .
Take a look at these photos and tell me where the visible damage is .
Here ’s the front ,
and here ’s the back ,
So , could you find it ?
Of course you could n’t .
There is a small “ scratch ” , if you can even call it that , on the bottom right on the front side , and there is a small “ scuff ” mark on the bottom left on the back .
That ’s it .
That ’s their argument for “ appeared it had been dropped ” .
Of course , that scratch and the scuff mark could have been made while the camera was in someone ’s pocket or in a camera bag .
Either way , it appears to be normal use .
Normal use of a camera that according to them had never been used before my mother - in - law purchased it .
When my father - in - law stood in the store with the camera in hand , Nathaniel informed him there were no longer any images on the camera .
Well , duh , my mother - in - law already told him they had been deleted to make room for my son ’s photographic masterpieces .
Nathaniel also said that the photos I deleted were only “ demo ” photos placed on the camera by the nice folks at Casio .
You know it and I know it .
Casio does not put demo photos on their cameras .
If they did , I doubt they would use photos of a black woman sitting seductively on a bed with the camera box at the corner of the bed .
Fuzzy photos of white shutters in the same bedroom wo n’t exactly sell any cameras either .
Anyway , have you ever heard of “ PhotoRescue Expert ” ?
It ’s a really nice application that allows you to recover images you may have accidently deleted .
Would n’t it be awesome if I was able to run that application and scan the camera to see if I could recover any of those “ demo ” photos ?
Oh but wait , I did .
Due to the fact we had taken a couple photos before we realized the camera was n’t working right , the first couple images were not recoverable .
The first photo showed a young black woman sitting on a bed .
The second shot showed the empty bed with the camera box sitting at the end of the bed .
The third shot …
Oh , here , you can see the third shot for yourself .
You can see the woman and the headboard in this photo .
Here is the fourth photo , notice the bed and the camera box sitting on the bed .
Those are some fuzzy looking blinds if you ask me .
Nice demo .
The fifth image shows a close up of the camera box .
You can clearly see the broken seal on the cd sitting on top of the camera box .
Of course , this ca n’t be the box for this camera because Nathaniel and Erica both say the camera had never been used before it was purchased by my mother - in - law .
The three remaining images we recovered were taken by my son ( when we first realized there was an issue with the camera ) .
The image at the top of this post is one of those oddly exposed images .
In addition to recovering the photos , PhotoRescue Expert also reveals the date and time the photos were taken .
That first photo was taken on February 8 , 2009 at 3:24 .
Funny .
My mother - in - law did n’t purchase the camera until February 25th .
As I said before , today was a very interesting day .
Not only did I prove the camera had no signs of damage , I also proved that the camera had indeed been used before my mother - in - law purchased it .
But that was n’t all I found …
After recovering the images this evening , I called the Best Buy “ customer relations ” number again .
TJ informed me that he could not help me from the corporate office and said I would have to take the camera back into the store with the “ evidence ” to show the store manager .
I decided to call the store and ask a few questions .
It turns out Nathaniel is NOT the store manager .
He is the service manager .
My mother - in - law was under the impression he was the store manager , since that is who she had asked to speak to .
The store managers name is Ryan and after hearing what I had to say , he was quick to offer his assistance .
I told him that I wanted to file a formal complaint against Erica because she was way out of line treating my mother - in - law the way she did .
Once I mentioned the “ evidence ” ( which I will describe below ) from the camera and the formal complaint , he asked me what I was doing on Thursday .
No , he was n’t asking me out on a date , at least I do n’t think he was , but he told me to come in on Thursday and ask for him .
He stressed that I was n’t to ask for anyone else , and that he personally would take care of everything at that time .
Now my question is , why is he being so quick to exchange the camera now ?
Sure , he knows his staff has done wrong , but they ’ve done wrong in the past and that did n’t stop them .
Sure , he knows the gig is up , but that never stopped employees from that location from being pinheads before .
So what ’s changed this time ?
Maybe it has to do with the final two images on the camera .
It could be that those two images hold the key to this whole debacle .
The final two images I found on the camera were not recovered by the software because they had never been deleted .
They were simply sitting in a separate folder and neither I , nor the employees at the store , noticed them .
These two images are evidence that employees at the Best Buy location in Douglasville , Georgia knowingly sold a used camera as new .
Here is the image ‘ CIMG0537.JPG ’ ,
and here is ‘ CIMG0538.JPG ’.
Although the photos are a bit fuzzy , I think it ’s very clear why Ryan is so willing to “ take care of me ” on Thursday .
These last two photos show none other than a member of Best Buy ’s own “ Geek Squad ” .
There is no denying it now .
Someone at that store knew this camera was used , and they knew is since January 1 , 2008 , which is the timestamp on those two photos .
Notice the filenames .
It ’s also clear that this camera had taken hundred of photos before my mother - in - law purchased it last week .
Best Buy has a lot of explaining to do .
First and foremost , they owe my mother - in - law an apology .
The mother of all apologies .
Disciplinary action should be taken against Nathaniel and Erica , at the very least , and someone from the corporate office needs to contact my mother - in - law and explain why Best Buy Store # 519 in Douglasville , Georgia is selling used cameras as if they were brand new .
Is n’t there some sort of law or regulation that covers the deceptive business practice of packing used items and selling them as new ?
Are there any lawyers out there that could shed some light on this topic for me ?
Through my own experiences , I have noticed a consistent pattern at that local Best Buy store , but I never though deceptive business practices was part of their modus operandi .
It should be noted that the images used in this post are copies of the originals .
I have the originals available on my computer , plus they ’re still sitting on the camera waiting to be recovered again and again , if necessary .
This is no longer just about the camera .
This is about doing the right thing .
If we , as consumers , do n’t stand up for what is right , corporations like Best Buy will never change their policies to prevent this kind of behavior from their staff , and they will never stop taking advantage of their customers .
The ball is in our court , and it ’s up to Best Buy to make this right .
Offering an apology to my mother - in - law and explaining how a used camera was sold as new would be a good start .

" With a fresh $ 200 million in the bank , ” said David Coursey in PC World , “ Facebook is again well positioned to avoid growing up . ”
The social - networking site has failed to come up with a business plan to leverage its huge user community and actually turn a profit .
Thanks to Facebook ’s “ Russian bailout plan , ” it can put off the inevitable reckoning a little longer .
Somebody is going to have to face reality , and soon , said Gregory Corcoran in The Wall Street Journal .
The cash infusion from Russian Internet investment group Digital Sky Technologies values Facebook at $ 10 billion .
That ’s shy of the $ 15 billion valuation implied by Microsoft ’s $ 240 million investment in 2007 , but with a recession on and profits still nowhere in sight , it ’s unclear that Facebook ’s “ eyeballs ” are worth as much as everyone seems to think .
“ Facebook did n't land a $ 200 million investment at a $ 10 billion valuation because it's popular with the kids , ” said Nicholas Carlson in Silicon Alley Insider .
“ It got that much because the plan is for Facebook to be a ' social utility ' for people of all ages . ”
The trouble is , users over 55 are leaving the site in droves , and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and company are in trouble if their moms are n’t on Facebook anymore .
Online photo service ScanCafe tells us a customer in upstate New York submitted this photo , ostensibly of Bernie Madoff , about a week ago .
We were skeptical , but check out the nose and the smile .
The photo is dated 1999 on the ScanCafe website ; a company rep said in an email that the shot is believed to be from one of Madoff 's costume Christmas parties .
Between the hat , dollar - sign chain and fur coat , worn shirtless , it 's pretty clear the photo subject is dressed as a pimp .
In other words , a criminal who normally impersonated a legitimate businessman apparently liked to sometimes impersonate a different type of criminal .
A less ambitious type , and one who would be facing far less jail time right now if busted by the cops .
The ScanCafe picture could always be a prank .
We wonder who would go to this much trouble , though .
If it is a fake , then the subject has a future career ahead of him as a Madoff impersonator .

According to The Age in Australia :
“ We would have to pay a lot of money , ” said Sephery - Rad , noting that most of the government ’s estimated one million PCs and the country ’s total of six to eight million computers were being run almost exclusively on the Windows platform .
“ Secondly , Microsoft software has a lot of backdoors and security weaknesses that are always being patched , so it is not secure .
We are also under US sanctions .
All this makes us think we need an alternative operating system . ”
[…]
“ Microsoft is a national security concern .
Security in an operating system is an important issue , and when it is on a computer in the government it is of even greater importance , ” said the official .
A confrontation between a group of stranded Somali pirates and the world 's greatest military power intensified today in the Indian Ocean as the bandits refused to release an American hostage despite the presence of a US destroyer .
More American warships are on the way .
The US navy called in a team of FBI negotiators last night and moved the USS Bainbridge into position to try to secure the release of Richard Phillips , who was being held by four Somali gunmen in a lifeboat some 300 miles off the Horn of Africa .
But despite an apparently hopeless position , the pirates showed no signs of giving in .
" Please pray for us , " one of the four told Reuters .
US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said that it appeared the lifeboat , which was no longer tethered to the Alabama , had run out of fuel .
Helicopters had also been deployed to the scene , while a P - 3 Orion surveillance aircraft was securing aerial footage .
" FBI negotiators stationed at Quantico [ in Virginia ] have been called by the navy to assist with negotiations with the Somali pirates and are fully engaged in this matter , " an FBI spokesman said .
Phillips , the captain of the Maersk Alabama , had offered himself as a hostage during a dramatic turn of events in which the gunmen escaped in the ship 's lifeboat with their captive after the 20 - strong American crew overpowered them and retook control of the vessel .
A spokesman for Maersk , the largest container shipping company in the world , said yesterday that Phillips was believed to be unharmed .
His family had gathered at his farmhouse in Vermont waiting for news .
Andrew Mwangura , head of the East African Seafarers ' Assistance Programme , said last night the Alabama had left the scene and was sailing under armed guard towards Mombasa , Kenya , its original destination , where it was expected to dock on Saturday .
None of the crew members were hurt in the attack .
A stalemate appeared to be established in which neither side had much room for negotiation .
The gunmen know they are likely to be arrested if they give their hostage up while still far out to sea .
In Harardheere , one of the notorious pirate strongholds in Somalia , an associate of the gang said that two boatloads of gunmen had left the port to try to assist their colleagues .
" Our friends are still holding the captain but they cannot move , they are afraid of the warships .
We want a ransom and , of course , the captain is our shield .
The warships might not destroy the boat as long as he is on board . "
The Alabama was the sixth ship to be hijacked off Somalia 's Indian Ocean coast in a week , and is believed to be the first American - flagged merchant vessel to be attacked by pirates anywhere since the early 19th century .
The surge in attacks has coincided with a return to calm seas after the monsoon period , and has seen the main pirate gangs shift their focus away from their favoured hunting ground in the Gulf of Aden , off northern Somalia , which is now patrolled by at least 15 warships in separate EU , US and Nato - led forces .
It is likely that the pirates used a previously captured mothership from which to launch their speedboat before attacking the Alabama .
Normally at least nine or 10 gunmen form part of an attack team , and it is not known why just four men armed with AK - 47s tried to take the large container ship , usually a difficult vessel to hijack due to its speed and the height of its deck .
The ship is carrying thousands of tonnes of food aid , some of it meant for Somalia .
According to second mate Ken Quinn , who spoke by telephone to CNN , the pirates sank their speedboat shortly after boarding the Alabama early on Wednesday .
The crew managed to regain control of the ship from the pirates by " brute force " , according to another crew member 's account .
Phillips is reported to have convinced the gunmen to board the lifeboat after agreeing to go with them , in order to secure the safety of his fellow sailors .
( CNN ) -- McLaren chairman Ron Dennis ended his 40 - year involvement with Formula One on Thursday when he announced a major restructuring of the British - based company .
McLaren chairman Dennis , right , will no longer be seen alongside world champion Hamilton on the F1 circuit .
The 61 - year - old Dennis , who handed over the role of Team Principal to Martin Whitmarsh in January , has now severed all links with grand prix racing ahead of Sunday 's Chinese GP in Shanghai .
" I 'm not always easy to get on with .
I 've always fought hard for McLaren in F1 , " said Dennis -- who will now lead the growth of McLaren 's new sports car business -- in a statement .
" I doubt if ( FIA president ) Max Mosley or ( F1 supremo ) Bernie Ecclestone will be displeased by my decision .
But no - one asked me to do it .
It was my decision .
" Equally , I was the architect of today 's restructure of the McLaren Group .
Again , no - one asked me to do it .
It was my decision .
" I feel enormously enthused about the prospects for the McLaren Group and for McLaren Automotive , and have no qualms about leaving Martin to report to the board regarding matters connected with Formula 1 . "
Dennis 's decision follows the Surrey - based team 's controversial start to the F1 season in Australia .
World champion Lewis Hamilton , originally promoted to third place after a post - race inquiry , and McLaren were later disqualified after they lied to stewards over an incident during the race .
McLaren have been ordered to face governing body FIA on April 29 when Whitmarsh , who becomes CEO , will have some explaining to do as he faces the prospect of hefty sanctions against his team and number one driver .
Thursday 's statement could help their cause and left Dennis to reflect on his life in F1 .
" I passed the role of Team Principal of Vodafone McLaren Mercedes to Martin Whitmarsh on January 16th , the day of the launch of our new Formula 1 car , " he said .
" That day I was asked many times whether I would attend the 2009 Australian Grand Prix .
My answer was " yes " .
I duly attended it , albeit not as the person in charge of Vodafone McLaren Mercedes .
It was , I admit , a strange feeling .
" The next race , the Malaysian Grand Prix , I watched on TV -- an activity I found surprisingly easy .
I 'd expected to be more emotional about it , after an unbroken run of attending so many grands prix for so many years . "
The compary Web site says McLaren has been engaged in a program to develop a range of pure sports cars that will build on the great successes of the McLaren F1 and Mercedes - Benz SLR McLaren .
As part of this plan , it is intended that McLaren Automotive , currently one of a number of companies within the McLaren Group , will become an independent company later this year .
Dennis said : " With planned additional investment in the company of £ 250 million , proposals in place for a new McLaren car production facility in the UK , and the potential for up to 800 skilled jobs , McLaren Automotive 's expansion will represent a significant investment in the UK automotive industry . "

The US Federal Reserve Board on Wednesday announced that it will massively expand its moves to pump liquidity into near - frozen credit markets , including a highly unusual plan to purchase up to $ 300 billion in longer - term Treasury securities over the next six months .
The plan also includes an additional $ 750 billion in Fed purchases of mortgage - backed securities guaranteed by the federally owned mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and an additional $ 100 billion in Fed purchases of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt .
These measures came as a surprise to global financial markets and triggered a simultaneous rush to buy Treasury bonds and a sharp sell - off of US dollars on world currency markets .
The announcement came in the statement issued by the Fed ’s policy - making Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) following its scheduled two - day meeting .
As expected , the FOMC said it would continue to keep the Fed ’s benchmark federal funds rate — the interest charged by banks for overnight loans to one another — in a range of 0 to 0.25 percent , and would do so for the indefinite future .
But the announcement that the Fed would inject up to $ 1.15 trillion in additional funds into the US financial system — essentially printing that amount of additional dollars — was widely seen as something of a desperate gamble , motivated by concern over the deepening economic crisis as well as the mounting political crisis arising from public outrage over the $ 165 million in bonuses awarded to executives and traders at the bailed - out insurance giant , AIG .
The gamble is that the Fed ’s emergency measures will drive down mortgage rates and yields on corporate as well as government bonds and kick - start lending without precipitating a run on the dollar .
One of the motives behind the move is to encourage investors , in the face of lower Treasury yields , to buy higher - yielding private corporate bonds .
In recent weeks , interest rates on US government debt have risen as the massive deficits from bank bailouts and the stimulus program have required the Treasury to attract an ever larger inflow of capital from abroad .
The flood of private and government funds into the US , freezing out many smaller and weaker economies in desperate need of capital , led to a rise in the dollar on world currency markets .
The Fed ’s moves announced Wednesday could rapidly reverse the dollar ’s fortunes .
Last December , when the Fed cut the federal funds rate to its present level , effectively zero , it indicated that it was considering directly buying longer - term Treasuries , something that had not been done for 50 years .
But in recent days Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke had indicated a reluctance to take such a drastic measure in the hope that existing government lending and bailout programs , combined with a new plan to allow banks to offload their “ toxic assets ” at taxpayer expense , would be sufficient to stabilize the financial system and stem the slide toward a full - scale depression .
However , soaring unemployment in the US and a rash of economic reports showing an accelerating slump in the US and internationally have compelled the Fed to abandon its previous projections of a recovery beginning later this year and accelerating in 2010 .
At the same time , the Fed and the Treasury have in recent weeks handed over tens of billions of additional taxpayer funds to AIG , Citigroup , Bank of America and other firms to avert bankruptcy , while the worsening slump has raised the prospect of a new wave of bank losses that could eclipse the losses from the collapsed subprime housing market .
In addition , the Obama administration ’s plan to use public funds to subsidize and virtually guarantee large profits to hedge funds and other investors who purchase unmarketable subprime - backed securities and other “ toxic assets ” weighing down the balance sheets of major banks , initially announced last month by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , is now in doubt .
It faces mounting opposition both from Congress , buffeted by public anger over the bailouts and corporate bonuses , and from Wall Street , which is increasingly balking at the minimal limits on executive pay imposed in return for government handouts .
The administration had said that Geither would announce the details of the new bank bailout program — expected to exceed the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) enacted under the Bush administration — sometime this week , but in the wake of the AIG furor the announcement has evidently been postponed .
The Fed ’s action had the character of a pre-emptive move aimed at averting a financial panic should the Obama administration fail to obtain Congressional approval for its bailout plan .
The Fed has the legal power to take such action without recourse to Congress .

In its Wednesday statement , the FOMC painted a grim picture of the economic situation .
It began : “ Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy continues to contract . ”
It went on to note job losses , declining equity and housing wealth , tight credit , falling consumer sentiment and spending , declining business investment and shrinking exports resulting from the global contraction .
Significantly , the statement omitted any reference to the economy recovering “ later this year . ”
In addition to the purchase of Treasury securities and the increased purchase of mortgage - backed securities , the statement indicated that the Fed and the Treasury would widen the scope of their Term Asset - Backed Securities Loan Facility ( TALF ) , which officially began on Thursday .
Under this plan , hedge funds and other investment firms can receive low - cost loans from the Fed to purchase new securities backed by auto loans , credit card debt and other consumer financing .
The Fed and the Treasury plan to enlarge the class of asset - backed securities under TALF to include commercial real estate and other investments .
However , many hedge funds and other Wall Street firms have indicated a reluctance to participate in TALF because they object to having any strings imposed that would limit executive pay and bonuses and are wary of the public fallout should it become known that they are reaping huge profits from the government program .
In recent days , major banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have declared their intention to pay back the billions they received under the TARP bailout as early as possible in order to remove themselves from the modest government restrictions that accompany the government cash .
Stunned economic commentators and analysts referred to the Fed ’s announcement as a “ shocking ” admission that its previous efforts had failed to stabilize the banking system .
The Financial Times carried a commentary under the headline “ Fed ’s Shock and Awe , ” which began : “ The Federal Reserve is on a war footing and is using the Powell doctrine — only go to war as a last resort , and do so with overwhelming force .
“ The stunning news that it would buy $ 300 billion in Treasury bonds ( and spend a lot more on many other fixed - interest securities ) also used another classic military strategy .
It had the element of surprise … ”
The article noted that the Fed ’s move “ provoked a drastic market response .
Ten - year Treasury yields dropped half a percentage point in minutes .
The dollar dropped more than 3 percent against the euro . ”
The plunge in Treasury yields was the steepest one - day drop since the 1987 stock market crash .
Thirty - year , fixed rate mortgages , which are pegged to the yields on ten - year Treasury notes , fell below 5 percent .
Deutsche Bank economist Peter Hooper said , “ This is effective life support … keeping things from getting a lot worse . ”
Nick Kalivas , an analyst at MF Global , wrote , “ The effectiveness of the Fed ’s panic move of Treasury and mortgage - backed buy - back is an open question .
The aggressive move by the Fed is stoking inflation expectations and there is a belief that a lot of money could flow into commodities or other inflation hedges . ”
There are indications that this is already occurring .
The dollar fell sharply on Wednesday , as the euro staged its biggest one - day percentage gain since it was launched 10 years ago .
The dollar fell 4.5 percent against the euro between Wednesday and Thursday .
The US currency also fell against sharply against many other currencies .
Thursday morning the British pound advanced to a four - week high of $ 1.4593 .
The pound has gained about 7.5 US cents from its intraday low Wednesday to its Thursday high .
The dollar fell to its lowest levels against the Japanese yen in a month .
Commodity prices have surged .
Gold futures , down before the Fed announcement , jumped 5.7 percent during after - hours electronic trading on Wednesday .
Gold prices rose $ 26.60 an ounce , hitting $ 942 , a sign of declining confidence in the dollar .
Oil prices rose sharply on Thursday to reach their highest levels this year .
US stock markets , which rose Wednesday in response to the Fed ’s announcement , gave up most of their gains on Thursday , as the longer - term implications of the massive increase in Fed lending and doubts about the Obama administration ’s bank bailout plan took hold .
Bank stocks , which had led Wednesday ’s rally , drove the downward move on Thursday .
The Fed is taking advantage of the privileged and unique position of the United States due to the role of the dollar as the world ’s reserve and trading currency .
That status gives the US a degree of leeway to print money to paper over its debts far beyond that of any other nation .
In taking the actions announced Wednesday , the US is , in effect , offloading the brunt of its crisis onto its international creditors .
However , there are limits to this license .
Since last September , the Fed ’s lending programs have doubled the size of its balance sheet , to about $ 1.8 trillion from $ 900 billion .
The actions announced Wednesday are likely to expand that to well over $ 3 trillion over the next year .
Such an immense expansion of US debt inevitably calls into question the value of the dollar and the credit - worthiness of the US government itself .
Already last week the Chinese premier , Wen Jiabao , warned that China was losing confidence in the value of its more than $ 1 trillion in US debt holdings .
A United Nations panel of experts is looking at creating a new “ accounting unit ” or basket of currencies to replace the dollar as the world ’s central currency .
Reuters reported that Russia is anxious to begin a discussion of such a move at the Group of 20 summit of leading economic nations in early April .
The Fed ’s extraordinary measures highlight the impossibility of resolving the economic crisis within the framework of capitalism without a massive destruction of living standards and a growth of economic nationalism and militarism .
The more the failure of the profit system has become evident , the more emphatically President Barack Obama has declared his support for the capitalist market .
The essence of all of the measures taken in response to the crisis — from the bank bailouts to the stimulus program to the housing plan — is an effort to rescue the system and protect the wealth and power of the financial elite at the expense of the broad masses of the population .
The ability of the American ruling class to reassure its global creditors in the face of an unprecedented expansion of US government debt increasingly hinges on its pledge to ruthlessly slash basic social programs such as Medicare and Social Security and impose poverty conditions on the working class .

There were monstrous reptiles in the deep , back in the time of dinosaurs .
They swam with mighty flippers , two fore and two hind , all four accelerating on attack .
In their elongated heads were bone - crushing jaws more powerful than a Tyrannosaurus rex’s .
They were the pliosaurs , heavyweight predators at the top of the food chain in ancient seas .
Much of this was already known .
Now , after an analysis of fossils uncovered on a Norwegian island 800 miles from the North Pole , scientists have confirmed that they have found two partial skeletons of a gigantic new species , possibly a new family , of pliosaurs .
This extinct marine reptile was at least 50 feet long and weighed 45 tons , the largest known of its kind .
Its massive skull was 10 feet long , and the flippers , more like outsize paddles , were also 10 feet .
The creature  not yet given a scientific name but simply called the Monster or Predator X  hunted the seas 150 million years ago , in the Jurassic Period .
“ Everything we are finding is new to science , ” said Jorn H. Hurum , a paleontologist at the University of Oslo who directed the excavations on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago .
He described new details of the find in a telephone interview last week .
The Incredible Art of Origami
Done in 11 hours work by two hands including several hundred folds ; that ’s basics of origami !
Origami , which originated in Japan in the early - half of the 16th century , is now one of the most popular forms of creative expression .
An art form thatâ€™s interesting for everyone from a six year old to a sixty - six year old .
Origami is one of the oldest and most fun filled activities that can be done by children as well as adults .
It teaches hand eye coordination and patience , which is something everyone can use .
Done by origami veteran Dr. Robert J. Lang
Satoshi Kamiya is one of the most advanced origami experts in the world
Best saved for the end !
Some outstanding examples of origami from various artists :

" We could n't possibly have known this . "
" We did n't know that airlines are subject to this kind of attack . "
It 's almost one year after the attack on America and we know that these kinds of statements had been a lie .
The CIA and FBI were warned by at least eight secret services and had thirty to forty indices about a possible attack with planes .
The FAA had sent out five warnings to the airports about possible hijacks or similar incidents .
On August 6 , 2001 the CIA delivered a memo to George Bush about a terrorist attack .
On August 23 the FBI released an " urgent cable " .
But the most damning evidence that something was known was the enactment of at least eight to ten bio- or regular terrorist exercises during 2000 and 2001 .
The last big one took place in June 2001 and another CIA exercise was confirmed for the day of September 11th !
" In what the government describes as a bizarre coincidence , one U.S. intelligence agency was planning an exercise last Sept. 11 in which an errant aircraft would crash into one of its buildings . " [ 1 ]
It was not the only one of its kind .
During 2000 - 2001 the US Government organised various exercises regarding possible terrorist attacks .
How many more secret terrorist preparation exercises do we have to find before the population of the nation state called United States wakes up ?
The " Agency planned exercise on Sept. 11 built around a plane crashing into a building " event [ 1 ] cited at the beginning of this article was at least Number 10 .
Until we are able to establish verifiable answers to the preponderance of unanswered questions surrounding what happened on September 11 2001 , and the events that led up to it , there is only one explanation for it :
They let it happen on purpose !

Officials will remove oil from two massive storage tanks near the base of erupting Mount Redoubt in Alaska , a spokesman said Friday .
Much of the oil in two massive tanks near rumbling Mount Redoubt will be removed , officials said Friday .
As the volcano continues to spew ash across Alaska 's Cook Inlet , U.S. Coast Guard officials said they will begin to transfer oil from the Drift River facility to get to a " safe " level .
Coast Guard Officer Sara Francis said the oil is being reduced to protect against " the potential threat by the volcanic activity " and the potential effect on the environment near the storage locations .
Francis said the workers will remove about 75 percent of the 6.3 million gallons of oil in the tanks .
Workers may also work on other facilities upstream , Francis said .
The Mount Redoubt volcano started erupting on March 22 , shooting ash up to 65,000 feet in air , dusting parts of the state and stopping air traffic in the area .
Do n't Miss
More ash shoots from volcano
The 10,197 - foot peak is about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage , the most populous city in Alaska .
Mount Redoubt last erupted nearly 20 years ago , in December 1989 .
That eruption lasted until April 1990 .

We have already commented on a similar diet study , A to Z. Again with DIRECT ( DIetary RandomizEd Controlled Trial ) we have another attempt to prove the Atkins diet is better but is really another demonstration of lying by most overweight and obese people .
Any study on diet and energy balance that cannot first demonstrate that the First Law of Thermodynamics is obeyed from self - reported data is totally unreliable and unreproducible and should never be published .
While the data as presented are hard to interpret in terms of detailed energy balance because daily energy intake and expenditure is not reported , as it should have been , the subjects claimed to be doing more exercise and eating less but only lost 10 pounds in two years .
The prescribed diets contained 1800 kcal for men and 1500 kcal for women .
These values are close to the basal metabolic rates of these mostly obese people .
They should have lost weight continuously and markedly during the trial .
Let ’s see how much they should have lost if they were reporting accurately .
They claimed to be eating about 500 kcal less than baseline per day on all diets .
Even doing the same amount of exercise they should have lost about a pound per week ( one pound of fat is about 3500 kcal ) or about 50 pounds per year or 100 pounds in 2 years .
Since they claimed to be doing more exercise they should have lost even more .
If they had been telling the truth , most participants should have starved to death well before the end of the study !
Ergo , most overweight and obese people lie about food intake and exercise ; they tell investigators what the investigators want to hear .
Obesity is and always has been caused by junk food addiction .
Until we deal with that , the pandemic of obesity and its terrible consequences will only worsen .
Unlike most infectious diseases , there is no vaccine against addictions .
We all must make the right choices as to what we put into our bodies .
In developed capitalist democracies resisting the self - destructive temptation to consume all manner of cheap addictive substances or to adopt addictive behaviours readily supplied by highly profitable enterprises is the hardest task we have .
And how to deal with it is not taught in medical school .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
That obese people lie about food intake was proven beyond doubt by a study using doubly - labeled water to measure true energy expenditure .
About 65 % of these subjects were overweight or obese .
They claimed to be eating only about 1500 kcal / day , about 40 % less than they actually ate , but were burning 2500 .
So , they should have had a deficit of 1000 kcal / day and be losing weight dramatically but their weights were stable .
Ergo they were “ misreporting ” , a euphemism for lying .

The Prophet 's Fifth Column Islamists Gain Ground in Sarajevo
Radical Muslim imams and nationalist politicians from all camps are threatening Sarajevo 's multicultural legacy .
With the help of Arab benefactors , the deeply devout are acquiring new recruits .
In the " Jerusalem of the Balkans , " Islamists are on the rise .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd flew into Esperance today to fly the flag for the Government 's support of young people dealing with substance abuse by opening new facilities on the Western Australia 's south coast .
But hundreds of kilometres to the west in Perth , there is a battle over funding for a program whose proponents are convinced helps heroin addicts .
The WA Government is baulking at putting more money into the Naltrexone implants program until it is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration ( TGA ) .
There are now calls for a broad clinical study into the value of the implants .
Dr George O'Neil says Naltrexone implants have helped the vast majority of his patients stop their heroin use .
One such patient is single mother Brenda .
Brenda had started using heroin again soon after the effects of her last implant wore off .
" Before it got really bad .
I just really wanted to get better .
That 's why I really wanted to get this implant in so I do n't keep going , using heroin , " she said .
Dr O'Neil says he has not had the time , the staff or the money for a large - scale clinical trial and says he has been too busy saving lives .
" From an efficacy point of view we can see people are reducing heroin and from efficacy point of view we can see people are not dying , " he said .
" And from a safety point of view we 're seeing some minor complications that can be dealt with by good medical management .
" In Western Australia we can work with the coroner obviously .
" All of the hospitals in Western Australia have got a nice computerised system that link the data with patients who wander back to the eastern states .
" We run a risk of missing some of the data but we 've been getting cooperation from quite a few interstate people as well and I guess we can only reliably comment on the patients who 've stayed in Western Australia . "
A counsellor , who wants to be known only as Steve , says it would be much better if the implants were approved by the TGA .
Steve says there needs to be a strong independent study .
" The TGA is really there to protect all of us from devices and medicines that may have unintended negative consequences , " he said .
" It 's only by rigorously assessing these things prior to using them with patients that we can be assured that situations like Thalidomide , Vioxx and the other medical disasters we 've seen in the last hundred years do n't recur . "
He says the medication has not worked for some of the people he has come into contact with .
" Certainly some of the people that we 've seen , the treatment either has n't worked in managing their opiate addiction , that they 've turned to using opiates of a kind that can actually override the effect of Naltrexone and so they 've continued being opiate users ; not heroin users but other opiates , " he said .
" In other cases we 've seen people that have simply switched their allegiance from opiates to amphetamine type stimulants - benzodiazepines , alcohol - sometimes all of these drugs in combination . "
Outcomes ' overstated '
A drug and alcohol worker who wants to be known as Paul believes the success of Naltrexone implants has been overstated - particularly in the media .
" Obviously patients who continue to return to that clinic , the majority of those people are going to say that Naltrexone is working well for them ; that 's why they 're returning to the clinic , " he said .
" But the patients who Naltrexone is a less than useful experience for are not appearing in the media .
They 're dropping out of treatment or they 're going onto other forms of treatment .
" We 're talking about a very disenfranchised and marginalised portion of the population and they 're very unlikely to advocate successfully on their own behalf if they 're experiencing problems . "
Steve and Paul say they want to see studies on the reported success of implants in helping people combat gambling and sex addictions , and even kleptomania .

Scroll of the Psalms ( Photo credit : Wikipedia )
As Sisyphus Fragment recently noted , one of the passages from the Christian bible which Christians are particularly fond of quoting at atheists on or around April Fools ' Day is Psalm 14:1 - 3 .
And no , my somewhat unusual use of the word " at " in the previous sentence was not an error .
It was deliberate .
When on the receiving end of this quote , as I have been many times , it indeed feels as if it is being thrown in my face ( probably because it is ) .
I expect that it will be no different today .
In this post , I 'd like to remind you about one of many simple ways to respond to this projectile quote .
I 'm sure there are plenty of others , but this is one I 've enjoyed over the years .
As a brief reminder , this is what Psalm 14:1 - 3 says :
The fool says in his heart , “ There is no God . ”
They are corrupt , they do abominable deeds , there is none that does good .
The LORD looks down from heaven upon the children of men , to see if there are any that act wisely , that seek after God .
They have all gone astray , they are all alike corrupt ; there is none that does good , no , not one .
Most Christians who pitch this quote in your direction are content to use only the first sentence , essentially saying that atheists are fools .
I have not encountered nearly as many who go the full distance and call us " corrupt , " but it would not surprise me to learn that some are out there .
I love how Sisyphus Fragment phrases the following :
From Chuck Norris to the average Catholic blogging soccer mom , this little bible quote has been thrown around as though excreting scripture at atheists actually has a tangible metaphysical impact .
While this is as effective as a witch doctor pricking a voodoo doll of me in the hopes that I will actually be pricked ...
Since the Christian hurling such a quote in your direction likely believes that his or her bible is worth at least some attention , I suggest that you offer a quote of your own .
Specifically , I 'd refer to Matthew 5:22 , which says ,
Whosoever shall say , Thou fool , shall be in danger of hell fire .
Interesting , is n't it ?
The Christian who squeals with delight while tossing Psalm 14:1 - 3 at you is risking the wrath of his or her imagined god by doing so .
That being the case , I think it is probably safe to conclude that such a Christian is either ignorant of his or her bible or - and this is where it gets fun - does n't give a damn because the transient pleasure of insulting you is worth the risk of eternal punishment .
So , Pontiac is dead .
GM pulled the plug this morning and vehicles will stop hitting showrooms by 2010 .
It 's no mystery why it failed .
Pontiac 's struggled for an image since it transformed itself from a Grandma car in the 1950s to an enthusiast 's dream in the Sixties with the introduction of the GTO .
From then on , it lost its way as GM tried to graft on mass - market cars around the likes of the GTO , the Firebird , the Fiero and the Solstice .
Adding trucks and minivans did n't work ; neither did a last - ditch attempt to turn Pontiac into a Scion clone .
GM tried in vain to make Pontiac relevant , and in truth , it might have been on the cusp of greatness with the 2009 G8 sedan .
But for every great performance vehicle -- G8 or GTO or Solstice -- there were unforgivable concessions to dealers like these five vehicles that eventually killed Pontiac :
2002 Pontiac Aztek
Pontiac Aztek :
Take a minivan , wrap it in ungainly sheetmetal meant to turn it into a sporty crossover and give it a funky - spelling name .
The Aztek was a disaster from the get - go , though some GM generals were adamant that the Aztek was at least as good as the Honda Element .
In its best year , the Aztek moved about 20,000 copies and dented the brand even more than the Cavalier - based Sunfire , which in retrospect was one of Pontiac 's recent successes .
2004 Pontiac Montana 4dr Reg WB exterior front upper left
Pontiac Montana SV6 / TranSport : Here 's the platform that spawned the Aztek .
The notion of a more sporty minivan was pretty questionable : Chrysler never did one for Dodge , but GM plowed ahead with the TranSport , the original space - shuttle - style minivan clad with plastic body parts .
Over the years , GM's Doraville plant cranked out succeeding versions that either got Western - themed names like Montana , or alphanumerics like SV6 , or both , finally caving into real sheetmetal when the minivan world had moved on to Toyota 's Sienna and Honda 's Odyssey .
From soup to nuts , the idea was less than half - baked , and families turned elsewhere in droves .
2009 Pontiac G3
Pontiac G3 : Near the end , GM decided that a rebadged Chevrolet Aveo five - door would be the ideal sop to dealers , who saw Pontiac sales shear in half in the 2000s .
Canada got it first -- but GM did n't get that the G3 was n't going to spark a Scion - style party in Pontiac 's U.S. showrooms .
The arrival of the G3 sounded like the thud a heart - attack victim makes when they hit the floor .
2009 Pontiac Torrent
Pontiac Torrent : Maybe the most acceptable of the misguided Pontiac efforts at fielding a family vehicle , the Torrent was based on the roomy Chevrolet Equinox and offered a potent V - 6 option for the 2009 model year .
The problem ?
The Equinox itself was in need of replacement .
It gets replaced for 2010 , but the Torrent will be trapped in time as the brand 's last - ditch effort to generate sales volume .
2010 Pontiac G8 ST
Pontiac G8 ST : The Pontiac G8 sedan -- especially in GXP form -- is one of the best rear - drive sedans you can buy .
Making it into a " ute " pickup might work for Australia , but for America ?
A Pontiac pickup ?
Really ?
Our dubious pen was working overtime when GM confirmed it last year at the Chicago auto show , and was unsurprised when it was axed earlier this year .
You might be able to drive one down under , but the ST checks in with history , never having sold a single copy .
Hello .
My name is Stew Miller and I am the newest ‘ Beer Guy ’ here on Gunaxin .
Now , I have been drinking beer for a good long time , most of which , admittedly , was more for fun and the sheer act of getting as blotto as possible than for the enjoyment of the product .
Then I sort of grew up .
Oh , do n’t get me wrong ; I refuse to be one of those snobby beer assholes who treat each bottle as though it were a wee babe and caress and care for it as such .
However , when I am doing a beer review I do look at it from its due perspective and give it ever opportunity to shine .
In fact , as I go off on a bit of a tangent here , I use three criteria when it comes to creating my write - up : Pour , Color / Look / Smell , and Flavor .
Now I do n’t necessarily condemn drinking beer right from the bottle , but I do n’t really condone it either .
Let me explain .
Beer is an awful lot like wine .
Now how many people do you know who would buy a really nice bottle of wine and just swig it right from the bottle ?
Well , aside from the guy who thinks he ’s Jesus living behind your dumpster , but chances are he ’s looking toward the Night Train , ya know ?
Anyway , very very few .
A normal person even a little in the know will use a proper wine glass or champagne flute , whatever the case may be .
And , as I ’m sure you can imagine , there ’s a proper way to pour wine as well .
Now , back to the brew : the bottle in which it comes may be pretty and convenient , but it is merely a vessel .
Especially cans .
Repeat after me : really good beer does not come in cans .
Sorry , but it ’s true .
So , now that we ’ve established that a nice vintage needs to be poured into a glass , let ’s go over a few steps on how to do it correctly .
Before I go on : I have never been a bartender .
I have , however , known a bunch of them over the course of the many years I worked at restaurants and I have combined my knowledge from everyone into a few simple steps .
They ’re really not that difficult but you ’d be amazed how discombobulated people can get when they ’ve got half of the beer ’s head all over the floor and it tastes as flat as sour orchestra note .
Just take it easy , let gravity work for you , and you ’ll be pouring like a champ in no time .
Step 1 .
Let ’s choose a glass !
I have two main glasses at my disposal and three different versions of them .
It ’s really up to you what you want to use , but since companies actually manufacture glasses specifically designed for beer , well , you see what I ’m getting at .
I use either a standard Pilsner glass , a Larger Sized Pilsner glass ( 20 oz. ) , or my personal favorite , the Pint glass .
Of course the Pint glass is n’t exactly a Pint per , say ‘ European ’ standards ( see : Ireland ) , but it does hold an entire 12 oz .
beer and it looks like a Pint glass , so I stipulate .
So , once you ’ve chosen your preferred decanter , it ’s time to pour .
Step 2 . Keep your Head !
Beer , like wine , is far better when it ’s ‘ opened up ’ .
That is n’t to say it ’s best when the top is removed , though that does ultimately assist in removing it from the bottle .
However , it does mean that it needs to be exposed to the air .
Subtle flavors and aromas are buried deep within the liquid elixir and the only method of retrieval is to pour it out .
So , with glass in hand , or , if you ’re feeling a little less brave , on a flat surface more like a table and less like a toilet lid , and with an opened beer in the other , we marry the two .
Slowly .
First :
Tilt the glass at about a 30 degree angle so it ’s nearly perpendicular to , say , the table .
Tip the bottle the same way .

Tip the bottle the same way .
Second : Pour .
Slowly at first as the glass begins to fill .

Third :
Slowly tilt the glass back up to 90 degrees as you simultaneously continue to pour the beer down the side .

Fourth : Just as the bottle reaches it ’s conclusion , maybe 1/3 full , pour the remainder slowly down the center of the glass .
Just as the bottle reaches it ’s conclusion , maybe 1/3 full , pour the remainder slowly down the center of the glass .
Fifth : Keep an eye on the head .
Some beers have a far frothier head so speed management is a virtue to keep it in the glass .
Keep an eye on the head .
Some beers have a far frothier head so speed management is a virtue to keep it in the glass .
Sixth : Look at it .
Watch as it settles at it ’s final transformation .
Notice the ‘ silt ’ if it ’s unfiltered .
It ’s a beautiful thing .
Look at it .
Watch as it settles at it ’s final transformation .
Notice the ‘ silt ’ if it ’s unfiltered .
It ’s a beautiful thing .
Seventh : Smell it .
Swirl it a bit to get all the available effervescing odors to your nose .
Now drink .
Man , that ’s good .
Step 3 . Enjoying your beer to its fullest .
There ’s no reason to chug your beer unless you ’re playing a drinking game , and you really ought to do that with some inferior swill .
Believe me , if you buy yourself a fifteen - dollar six pack , the last thing you want to do is kill it off before you enjoy it .
So , whether you ’ve chosen a Porter , a Stout , an Ale , a Dunkel , a Witbier , or any number of available options out there , make sure you set upon it with enjoyment and an open air of critique .
Beers did n’t get their selling points and descriptive adjectives without having been thoroughly tested and tried first , and there ’s no reason why you should n’t do the same :
Trust the taste , not just just the look .
One of the most fun things to do is to seek out a brew you ’ve never had and give it a whirl .
Trust me , if you ’re a true beer fan , the worst possible outcome is that it ends up not being your favorite , but still a palatable beer .
Enjoy your beer : it ’s one of life ’s greatest pleasures .

You already know which new car 's your favorite , and here at TheCarConnection.com , we have some favorites , too .
But when it comes to entertaining us at the wheel with great music and excellent music interfaces , which cars truly rock ?
Spending $ 30,000 on a new car is easy to do -- and yet , some luxury cars do a terrible job of bringing star - quality audio to their owners .
On the flip side , some cheapo compacts have excellent stereo options , and the aftermarket offers a myriad of ways to upgrade your sound .
TheCarConnection.com 's editors think it 's easier to find a great car with a great sound system straight from the factory .
Just by ticking an option box ( usually to the tune of $ 1000 or more ) , home - theater - style sound is yours for the asking in most of today 's new cars .
Some cars eliminate even that step , installing world - class music machines as standard features .
What 's the sound of success ?
After hearing from all of the 2009 new cars , trucks and crossovers , we like these seven factory - installed audio systems best :
Do n't forget to enter our Infinity speaker giveaway !
Jaguar XF : Bowers & Wilkins
Bless the Jaguar XF : it showed up just in time to clinch the sale from Ford to Tata .
As great as the car is , we 're inclined to love on its upgrade audio system even more .
For a mere $ 1800 or so , the 440 - watt Bowers & Wilkins system offers up a bounty of Dolby 7.1 surround , 14 speakers , and the cleanest sound this side of a Magic Eraser on Michael Chiklis ' scalp .
There 's perfect MP3 integration , a touchscreen for audio settings , incredible punch even from compressed music files -- everything a discriminating music lover looks for other than a place to burn their " really ?
seriously ? "

2009 BMW 7 - Series
BMW 7 - Series : harman / kardon Logic 7
The newest 7 - Series has some marvelous room to spread out -- and few cars indulge audiophilia so purely .
BMW matches the 7 - Series ' lounge - like atmosphere with the Logic 7 surround sound system and a state of the art list of ways to pipe in the music of your choice .
There 's a hard drive for music storage , an iPod connectivity interface , a six - disc DVD changer , and premium sound with Sirius Satellite Radio and HD Radio .
BMW also fits the 7er with a rear - seat entertainment system , so the kids or passengers can get in on the top - notch sound .
2009 Infinit G37 Convertible
Infiniti G37 Coupe and Convertible
Infiniti's premium - sound package for cars like the scrumptious G37 lineup not only has the aural goods -- it has one of the best user interfaces for iPods , iPhones and other inferior MP3 players ( Zune , it 's you , babe ) as well as radio and satellite - radio bands .
Teamed up with an optional 11 - speaker Bose Studio on Wheels premium audio system and a Music Box 9.3 - gigabyte hard drive , it 's difficult to top -- unless you go topless with the G37 Convertible , which programs in a top - down stereo mode that shifts audio signals to the driver 's seat .
Nifty .
2009 Hyundai Genesis
Hyundai Genesis
It 's the same system as in the Rolls - Royce Phantom -- the same brand , at least .
The paradigm - shifting Genesis sports an available Lexicon surround - sound audio system with 500 watts , 12 channels , and 17 speakers , plus an HD radio tuner .
There 's also an iDrive - ish controller to manipulate it all , and it works surprisingly well , so keep your smart mouth to yourself .
All Genesis sound systems come with XM Satellite Radio and inputs for USB and iPod attachments , too .
Lacking ?
That big Rolls - style radiator grille .
We 'll let you be the judge , positive or negative on that .
2010 Ford Mustang
Ford 's Shaker 1000 - watt system is just that -- the best , easiest way to make the Mustang 's natural good vibrations go to eleven .
The Shaker setup is available across the V - 8 lineup , from GT to Shelby GT500 -- and its 1000 watts of power plug - and - play nicely with Ford 's Bluetooth - enabled SYNC controller and available Sirius satellite radio .
( A " Shaker 500 " will have to do for V - 6 ' Stangs . )
Bring your own Beach Boys MP3s -- or AAC files , if you 're one of those hardcore Apple - blinded loyalists .
2009 Chevrolet Malibu
Chevrolet Malibu , and most of the GM lineup
It 's not luxuriant sound that makes the Malibu 's stereo -- and most GM stereos -- good enough to make this list .
It 's their utterly logical preset setup .
You can use a single set of preset keys to program in stations on AM , FM and XM .
For those of us who still use all three bands , it 's a godsend .
Steering - wheel audio controls and USB links for MP3 players are good , too -- they scroll through all presets and seek as well -- but GM 's USB port integration has taken some hits for its , uh , knockoff look .
Like seek buttons on the steering wheel , this whole preset thing has us asking : do automakers do any benchmarking anymore , and why is n't this the new normal ?
Runners - Up : Acura 's DVD - driven audio systems .
Yep , they sound awesome -- but DVD - Audio is the Blu - Ray of its kind .
Ahead of its time , and quite possibly overkill .
Audi's
Bose speakers sound great , and their roller - controllers on the wheel feel great -- but faceplate buttons and MMI controls are a learning hurdle here .

A team of UC San Diego - led atmospheric chemistry researchers moved closer to what is considered the " holy grail " of climate change science when it made the first - ever direct detection of biological particles within ice clouds .
The team , led by Kerri Pratt , a Ph.D. student of atmospheric chemistry Professor Kim Prather , who also holds appointments at Scripps Institution of Oceanography as well as the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at UCSD , sampled water droplet and ice crystal residues at high speeds from an aircraft flying through clouds in the skies over Wyoming in fall 2007 .
Analysis of the ice crystals revealed that they were made up almost entirely of either dust or biological particles such as bacteria , fungal spores and plant material .
While it has long been known that microorganisms or parts of them get airborne and travel great distances , this study is the first to yield in - situ data on their participation in cloud ice processes .
Results of the Ice in Clouds Experiment - Layer Clouds ( ICE-L ) , funded by the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) , appear May 17 in the advance online edition of the journal Nature Geoscience .
" If we understand the sources of particles that nucleate clouds and their relative abundance , then we can determine the impact of these different sources on climate , " said Pratt .

The effects of tiny airborne particles called aerosols on cloud formation have been some of the most difficult aspects of weather and climate for scientists to understand .
In the climate change science field , which derives many of its projections from computer simulations of climate phenomena , the actions of aerosols on clouds represent what scientists consider the greatest uncertainty in modeling predictions for the future .
" By sampling clouds in real time from an aircraft , these investigators were able to get information about ice particles in clouds at an unprecedented level of detail , " said Anne- Marine Schmoltner of the NSF 's Division of Atmospheric Sciences .
" By determining the chemical composition of the very cores of individual ice particles , they discovered that both mineral dust , and , surprisingly , biological particles play a major role in the formation of clouds . "
Aerosols , ranging from dust , soot , sea salt to organic materials , some of which travel thousands of miles , form the skeletons of clouds .
Around these nuclei , water and ice in the atmosphere condense and grow leading to precipitation .
Scientists are trying to understand how they form as clouds play a critical role by both cooling the atmosphere and affect regional precipitation processes .
ICE -L was the first aircraft - based deployment of the aircraft aerosol time - of - flight mass spectrometer ( A - ATOFMS ) nicknamed " Shirley , " which was recently developed at UCSD with funding from NSF .
The ICE - L team mounted the mass spectrometer and an ice chamber run by Colorado State University researcher Paul DeMott onto a C - 130 aircraft operated by NCAR and made a series of flights through a type of cloud known as a wave cloud .
The researchers performed in - situ measurements of cloud ice crystal residues and found that half were mineral dust and about a third contained nitrogen , phosphorus and carbon — the signature elements of biological matter .
The second - by - second analysis speed allowed the researchers to make distinctions between residues of water droplets and ice nuclei in real - time .
Ice nuclei are rarer than droplet nuclei and are more likely to create precipitation .
The A - ATOFMS also allowed the unambiguous measurement of biological particles in the cloud ice , which scientists previously concluded serve as ice nuclei based on simulations in laboratory experiments and precipitation measurements .
Based on modeling and the chemical composition of measured dust , the ICE - L team was able to identify the source of the dust as Asia or Africa .
" This has really been kind of a holy grail measurement for us , " said Prather .
" Understanding which particles form ice nuclei , which occur at extremely low concentrations and are inherently difficult to measure , means you can further understand processes that result in precipitation .
Any new piece of information you can get is critical . "
The findings suggest that the biological particles that get swept up in dust storms help to induce the formation of cloud ice and that their region of origin makes a difference .
Prather said initial evidence is increasingly suggesting that dust transported from Asia could be influencing precipitation in North America , for example .
Researchers hope to use the ICE - L data to design future studies timed to events when such particles may be playing a bigger role in triggering rain - or snowfall .

Cartoon strip aimed at under - 12s depicts Christian boy as Islamaphobe thug
A Government - funded charity was at the centre of a row last night after a magazine it publishes for children appeared to depict Christians as Islamaphobes who regard Muslims as terrorists .
In a cartoon strip , a boy wearing a large cross around his neck is shown telling a friend that a smiling Muslim girl in a veil looks like a terrorist .
He later confronts her and shouts : ‘ Hey , whatever your name is , what are you hiding under your turban ? ’
' Wrong message ' :
The cartoon thug is wearing a cross
She replies that the garment is called a hijab and it is part of her religion , ‘ like that cross you wear ’ .
The girl is then shown standing up for another boy , who is being bullied , and her behaviour is contrasted with that of the boy wearing the cross .
The cartoon story , entitled Standing Up For What You Believe In , appears in the latest issue of Klic ! , a quarterly magazine aimed at children in care aged from eight to 12 .
Published by the Who Cares ?
Trust , a charity set up in 1992 , it is described on the cover as ‘ the best ever mag for kids in care ’ and is widely distributed by town halls .
The charity received £ 100,000 from the Department for Children , Schools and Families , headed by Ed Balls , in both 2007 and 2008 , and £ 80,000 this year .
Although the cartoon does not specifically refer to the boy ’s religion , it has angered Christian groups and MPs who fear it sends out the wrong message .
Mike Judge , of the Christian Institute , said : ‘ What about Christian children in care who received this magazine ?
How will they feel to see themselves mocked as narrow - minded Islamaphobes ?
‘ It is a clumsy caricature , symptomatic of a culture which says it is OK to bully Christians in the name of diversity . ’
Philip Hollobone , the Tory MP for Kettering , said : ‘ I think it is very unfortunate that the lad who is pointing the finger is wearing a cross .
' You can hardly imagine anyone producing a magazine in which the roles were reversed and it was the Muslim girl who was behaving badly . ’
Gary Streeter , the Tory MP for South West Devon , said the religious parody was ‘ unacceptable ’ , adding : ‘ If it is being done with public money , it should be investigated and the magazine withdrawn . ’
But Who Cares ?
Trust chief executive Natasha Finlayson said she had no intention of withdrawing it , describing the cross as ‘ bling ’ rather than a religious symbol .
She said the charity had received a complaint but did not agree the cartoon was derogatory towards Christians .
‘ I am a Christian myself , so when a woman called us , I went back and looked at the comic strip from her point of view , ’ Ms Finlayson said .
‘ I am sorry that she is upset but I do n’t share her view .
When I saw the cartoon , I did n’t think of that character being a Christian because I saw the cross as ‘ bling ’ , as jewellery .
‘ To me it is a cartoon about bullying rather than discrimination or religion . ’
The woman who would one day become one of the best - known test pilots of the Third Reich was born on March 29 , 1912 , into an upper - middle - class family in Hirschberg , Silesia .
From early on , Hanna Reitsch was an intense , determined and intelligent individual .
She became fascinated with flying at a young age , reportedly attempting to jump off the balcony of her home at age 4 in her eagerness to experience flight .
Looking back on her childhood , she wrote in her 1955 autobiography The Sky My Kingdom : ‘ The longing grew in me , grew with every bird I saw go flying across the azure summer sky , with every cloud that sailed past me on the wind , till it turned to a deep , insistent homesickness , a yearning that went with me everywhere and could never be stilled . ’
By the time she was 14 , she had set her sights on becoming a flying missionary doctor in Africa .
It was a dream that seemed likely to please both her authoritarian ophthalmologist father , a Protestant , and her devout Catholic mother .
During her teens she studied the writings of Ignatius of Loyola to discipline her mind and develop highly focused concentration .
She made a pact with her father that if she did not mention going to a glider school until she had completed her secondary schooling , she would then be allowed to learn how to fly .
Thanks to her determined silence , she managed to fulfill that pact .
On the condition that she would also take a course in what was then called ‘ domestic science , ’ she was allowed to go to the Grunau School of Gliding .
Reitsch had the good sense to realize that a domestic science course would serve her well in the primitive conditions she would likely encounter in Africa , and she dutifully undertook her studies at the Colonial School for Women at Rendsburg .
There , in addition to her other lessons , she was taught how to care for domestic animals as well as to ride and shoot .
For young Reitsch , however , the real goal remained flying .
Despite the derision of the male students as well as instructors — she was the only woman in her class — she was the first class member to pass the ‘ A ’ level beginning course .
Authorities were so taken aback when they learned of her rapid progress that they made her retake the test — which she once again passed .
She went on to pass the ‘ B ’ and ‘ C ’ tests before beginning medical school at the University of Berlin .
While studying medicine , she also sought permission from her parents to continue with flying lessons in Staaken .
She later recalled , ‘ I managed to convince them that for my career as a flying doctor in Africa it would be necessary for me to learn to pilot engined aircraft . ’
She soon realized that most pilots knew little if anything about the engines of their planes .
That seemed to her to be like a doctor who knew nothing about the heart .
Never afraid of hard work or dirty hands , she started hanging out with the mechanics at the flight school and worked herself into their favor as they realized she was serious about learning about airplane engines .
The mechanics gradually gave her more challenging jobs .
One Friday the master mechanic pointed to a worn - out engine and told her that she could have it to take apart and put back together again by the following Monday .
She did just that , later recalling , ‘ on the Monday morning , with torn and bleeding hands and covered from head to foot in oil and grime , I was able to show the foreman the reassembled engine . ’
By doing repairs , helping out with chores , and polishing and moving airplanes , she also managed to eke her way through flight school .
She demonstrated superb piloting skills , even doing stunt flying for motion pictures .
While attending powered flight school , Reitsch realized that a missionary doctor needed to know how to drive an automobile .
She had no money for driving - school tuition but solved that problem in typically creative fashion .
She began to visit with workmen who were operating earthmoving machinery near the airstrip .
She would do the same dirty jobs they did and ask them questions about clutches , brakes , chokes and carburetors .
They finally let her drive some equipment .
In 1934 Reitsch traveled to Brazil and Argentina as part of a German research expedition to test - fly gliders in extreme thermal conditions .
Her growing reputation as a pilot resulted in her leaving medical school and accepting an invitation to become an experimental glider test pilot at the Deutschesforschungsinstitut fur Segelflug ( DFS ) , the German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight at Darmstadt .
She became involved in flight testing to address problems of stability and control and structural vibration .
She also test - flew the first glider seaplane and evaluated the capabilities of new glider catapult mechanisms .
In 1936 Reitsch met Ernst Udet , head of the Technical Branch of the Ministry of Aviation and the highest - scoring German fighter ace to survive World War I .
At the time , she was working on the development of dive brakes for gliders .
After demonstrating the use of dive brakes in a vertical dive before Udet , other Luftwaffe generals and German aircraft designers , she was awarded the honorary rank of Flugkapitän , the first woman ever so honored .
In 1937 she was designated as a Luftwaffe civilian test pilot , a post she would hold until the end of World War II .
Reitsch and Udet shared a passion for flying and developed a close professional relationship that lasted until Udet , depressed by the crushing demands of his job , committed suicide in November 1941 .
Reitsch also became close to another former fighter pilot and rising Luftwaffe star , Robert Ritter von Greim , a Bavarian ace who had scored 25 aerial victories during World War I and had been awarded a knighthood and the coveted Orden Pour le Mérite .
Greim had been appointed by Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring to be the first squadron leader of the new Luftwaffe .
Along with Udet , Greim witnessed Reitsch ’s high - speed dive brake tests , which he found very impressive .
In February 1938 , Reitsch became the first person to fly a helicopter , the Focke - Achgelis Fa-61 , inside a building , Berlin ’s Deutschlandhalle .

In the years leading up to WWII , Reitsch made a name for herself on the international flying circuit .
In May 1937 , she became one of the first Germans to fly a glider over the Alps .
That same year , she set a world long - distance record and won the National Soaring Contest — the only woman entrant .
She also traveled extensively , to Africa and to the United States .
By the summer of 1937 , Reitsch had completed her test pilot duties in the development of dive brakes .
After Udet appointed her a civilian test pilot at the primary Luftwaffe research station at Rechlin , she was allowed to fly almost anything she could lay her hands on , which included most of the high - performance aircraft in the Luftwaffe inventory .
Rather than seeing her work with these aircraft as a prelude to what she would one day characterize as ‘ the tragedy to come , ’ at the time she chose to view them as guarantors of peace .
She later wrote : ‘ Stukas — bombers — fighters !
Guardians at the portals of Peace !
And in this spirit I flew them , each time in the feeling that , through my own caution and thoroughness , the lives of those who flew after me would be protected and that , by their existence alone , they would contribute to the protection of the land that I saw beneath me as I flew … .
Was that not worth flying for ?’
In February 1938 , at Udet ’s bidding , Reitsch would become the first person to fly a helicopter , the Focke - Achgelis Fa-61 , inside a building , Berlin ’s Deutschlandhalle .
She had previously been called on to demonstrate the Fa-61 to American aviation legend Charles Lindbergh at Bremen , whom she afterward described as a man ‘ whose simplicity of manner won all hearts wherever he went . ’
She also became the first woman to be awarded the Military Flying Medal , thanks to her helicopter flights .
But the prospect of appearing as what she characterized a ‘ variety artiste ’ in Berlin appalled her , even though Udet ’s goal was legitimate — to prove before an international audience that the helicopter was fully controllable .
Reitsch dutifully completed a series of indoor demonstrations .
But as she later wrote , ‘ Exactly how deep an impression my flight with the helicopter had made on the world at large I was not to realize till many years later , in 1945 , [ when ]
I came across an American soldiers ’ magazine … .
The first thing that caught my eye was my name and then I saw that it contained an article describing in popular terms my flight with the helicopter . ’
War clouds were beginning to gather , but there would be time for at least one more foray into the world of international sports flying in August 1938 , when Reitsch visited the United States to make an appearance at the International Air Races at Cincinnati .
Friends and family had prepared her to dislike Americans , but she enjoyed the trip immensely , later writing , ‘ there was much in the American way of living that seemed to me worthy of imitation . ’
She did encounter some anti-German sentiment , but her demonstration of Hans Jacobs ’ aerobatic glider , the Habicht ( goshawk ) , in Ohio garnered frenzied applause and invitations to appear elsewhere .
At that point , however , she was summarily recalled home by her government .
In 1939 Reitsch suffered through a three - month bout with scarlet fever , followed by muscular rheumatism .
On recovering , she went right back to work , becoming involved in the development of large cargo - , troop - and fuel - carrying gliders .
The work was largely abandoned after the 180 - foot wingspan Messerschmitt Me-361 Gigant ( giant ) crashed and killed the pilots of its three Me-110 tow planes , the Gigant ‘s six - man crew and 110 troops in the glider .
She later undertook a very dangerous assignment involving the development of barrage balloon cable shears for German bombers .
In 1942 the operational version of the single - seat rocket - powered bomber interceptor known as the Komet , the Messerschmitt Me-163 , was undergoing testing at the research center at Augsburg .
Reitsch became determined to fly this bullet - shaped plane , driven by a liquid - fueled Walther rocket engine .
By the autumn of 1942 , she managed to finagle three flights in the prototype , Me-163A , as well as a flight in the first production model , the Me-163B .
In an image taken from newsreel footage , test pilot Heini Dittmar chats with Reitsch ( in fur coat ) .
Her tests of the rocket - powered Me-163 “ Komet ” ended when she crashed while attempting to land the plane with the dolly undercarriage — which was meant to fall away on takeoff but had hung up — still attached .

Her tests of the rocket - powered Me-163 “ Komet ” ended when she crashed while attempting to land the plane with the dolly undercarriage — which was meant to fall away on takeoff but had hung up — still attached .
Reitsch ’s last flight in the Me-163B nearly ended her life .
The Komet ‘s cockpit proved to be arranged so that someone her size could not easily fly the plane .
It was hard to reach the rudder pedals , and she was also forced to dispense with the shoulder harness and lean forward to operate the controls .
The flight proceeded uneventfully until Reitsch moved the control to drop the takeoff undercarriage .
The plane immediately began to shudder and became nearly impossible to control .
Her hand radio had stopped working , and it was not until she saw one of her tow plane crewmen waving a handkerchief while the pilot raised and lowered its landing gear that she understood that the Me-163 ’s dolly undercarriage had not fallen away as it was designed to do .
Despite her best efforts and those of the tow plane pilot , no maneuver would dislodge the undercarriage .
Reitsch decided to try to land the plane .
She nearly succeeded , but at the last instant the aircraft stalled and crashed into a plowed field just short of the runway .
She survived the crash but suffered severe injuries .
Her nose was nearly sheared off , her skull was fractured in four places , two facial bones were fractured , and her upper and lower jaws were misaligned .
Four days after that accident , in tribute to her skill and bravery in this and other developmental work , Reitsch was awarded a special diamond - encrusted version of the Gold Medal for Military Flying by Reichsmarshall Göring .
She was also later awarded the Iron Cross First Class .
After five months in the hospital and much plastic surgery , Reitsch was discharged — though at first she was still plagued with spells of dizziness and spatial disorientation .
Without medical permission she began to fly again , starting with gliders and graduating to powered aircraft and strenuous aerobatic maneuvers until she was satisfied that her flying skills were as good as they had ever been .
In August 1943 , 10 months after her accident , her surgeon gave her medical clearance to return to normal activities .
Reitsch followed the Me-163 development group to its site at Peenemünde - West .
There , she learned the details of the pulse - jet powered V - 1 buzz bomb and the V - 2 ballistic missile programs run by General Walter Dornberger and Wernher von Braun .
She survived unscathed the first Allied bombing raid on the complex , which left most of Peenemünde a pile of rubble .
Shortly thereafter , when she met with friends in Berlin at a luncheon , the conversation turned to a discussion of what they could do to save Germany from what was now seen as a slide into defeat .
The group decided to propose aerial strikes on strategic Allied targets carried out by suicide bomber pilots , a concept dubbed Operation Self Sacrifice .
Despite her association with the highest levels of Nazi officialdom , Reitsch was apparently slow to recognize the ruin into which they were leading the country .
When she resumed her Me-163 flight test duties following her accident , she was invited to a luncheon with Hermann Göring .
During the meal she was appalled to realize that the Reischmarschall was apparently living in a dream world .
He believed that the Me-163 was in mass production and would soon deliver the Fatherland from the scourge of the Allied 1,000 - plane bombing raids .
Worse yet , when Reitsch tried to correct Göring ’s misperceptions , he made it clear that he would not listen to any contrary view and abruptly left the room to go and play with his children .
Reitsch ’s return to the Me-163 project , now located at Bad Zwischenahn , was marred by the project director ’s refusal to allow her to fly it again .
Despite her howls of protest , there was no reversal of this position .
She withdrew from the project when her longtime friend Greim approached her with a request to visit him on the Russian Front in an attempt to boost the morale of the troops .
During that trip , Reitsch ’s understanding of the bloody realities of war was driven home with a brutal vengeance .
This new reality fueled her determination to press for the formation of a corps of suicide pilots .
Late in 1943 , Reitsch took the opportunity to discuss Operation Self Sacrifice directly with Hitler when she was invited to a ceremony at Berchtesgaden to receive her Iron Cross First Class .
He parried her efforts to talk about a suicide bomber plan by launching into a long , rambling monologue about how the new twin - engine Messerschmitt Me-262 jet fighter would save the day .
Reitsch pressed her case and finally gained the Führer ‘s reluctant permission to go ahead with experimental work only — with the proviso that he must be spared the details .
Operation Self Sacrifice got underway with a plan to use the Me-328B , already in the prototype stage , as a parasitic ‘ Sacrificial Fighter . ’
Reitsch and other pilots carried out experiments with the Me-328 flying under its own power as well as functioning as a glider to be launched from a Dornier Do-217E twin - engine bomber .
These plans were abruptly terminated when an Allied bombing raid wiped out the factory in which the prototype Me-328s were being built .
This was probably just as well , since the Me-328 had severe flaws .
The planners then adjusted their sights , hoping to use the V - 1 guided glider bomb then entering operational status .
Seventy of the V - 1s equipped with cockpits for piloted flight were ordered , to be built by Fieseler and designated as the Fi-103 Reichenberg .
This manned version of the V - 1 proved easy to fly but glided like a brick and was tricky to land on its skid because of its very high landing speed and tendency to ground - loop .

One factor that caused problems with the V - 1 as a cruise missile was related to vibrations imparted to the airframe by its power plant .
The pulse - jet engine developed thrust through very closely placed machine gun-like explosions , thus the nickname ‘ buzz bomb . ’
In the course of test flights , Reitsch was able to identify this problem , and she may also have contributed to improving the V - 1 ’s accuracy .
In the Fi-103 test plane , the cockpit was directly in front of the engine intake .
It was assumed that in the event of an emergency during test flights , the pilot would be able to open the canopy and bail out .
In point of fact , it is more than likely that the exiting pilot could not survive if the engine was running .
Two of the seven Fi-103 instructors were killed , and four were injured .
Reitsch was the only one of the group to survive the test program without injury .
Reitsch was designated as an instructor of the volunteer pilots in what was called the Leonidas Squadron ( formally the 5th Staffel of Kampfgeschwader 200 ) , presumably named after the heroic Spartan general who , in 480 bc , with a cohort of about 1,000 warriors , fought to the death to save the rest of Greece from invading Persians .
She encountered numerous difficulties with the project , thanks to the indifference of her high - ranking Nazi friends .
The prevailing attitude among them amid the disastrous military situation in late 1944 was that the very idea of suicide pilots was ‘ un - German ’ and that it went against the grain of the German psyche .
The last months of Reitsch ’s wartime service involved flying wounded soldiers into hospital airstrips , carrying urgent dispatches by air and surveying air routes into the rubble of Berlin .
On April 25 , 1945 , Greim told Reitsch she must fly with him to Berlin for a meeting with Hitler .
As a result of a proposal by Göring to take over leadership of the country , Hitler had ordered Göring arrested , and he intended to appoint Greim the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe .
The last leg of their trip to the Führerbunker in devastated Berlin was made in a little Fieseler Fi-156C Storch ( stork ) , with Greim at the controls and Reitsch crouched behind him .
Flying through a hail of Soviet anti-aircraft fire , the plane was hit in the engine and fuel tank .
An armor - piercing bullet smashed Greim ’s right foot , and he passed out .
Reitsch managed to successfully land the Fieseler on the boulevard before the Brandenburg Gate , and they both made it to Hitler ’s bunker , where they stayed for two days .
Ordered by Hitler to flee Berlin in the final hours of the Russian assault on the city , Greim and Reitsch escaped in an aircraft hidden near the bunker .
On the morning of May 9 , Reitsch delivered Greim to a hospital at Kitzbühel .
Based upon information provided by a British officer , she was taken into custody by the Americans that same afternoon .
After extended incarceration and interrogation by intelligence personnel — in part because she had been rumored to have flown Hitler to freedom — Reitsch was exonerated of guilt from war crimes .
She was finally released from prison after 15 months .
During her time behind bars , Reitsch discovered that her parents had committed suicide rather than be taken prisoner by the Russians .
Greim , too , on learning that the Americans were going to turn him over to the Russians , killed himself in Salzburg on May 24 , 1945 .
His last words before swallowing potassium cyanide were reportedly , ‘ I am the head of the Luftwaffe , but I have no Luftwaffe . ’
For some years after the war , the Allies forbade Germans from participating in gliding .
Reitsch eventually began lecturing in Europe , but she was banned from flying in competitions in England until 1954 .
In 1959 she represented Germany on a trip to deliver a glider to Delhi , where she became friends with Indira Gandhi .
She opened a gliding school in Ghana in 1962 , and also revisited the United States , where she met Igor Sikorsky and Neil Armstrong .
Throughout the remainder of her life , Reitsch remained a controversial figure , tainted by her ties — both real and suppositious — to the dead Führer and his henchmen .
The circumstances surrounding her 1945 sojourn in Hitler ’s Berlin bunker especially haunted her .
In a postscript to a new edition of her memoirs , published shortly before her death from a heart attack in 1979 , she wrote that ’so - called eyewitness reports ignore the fact that I had been picked for this mission because I was a pilot and trusted friend [ of Greim ’s ] , and instead call me ` Hitler ’s girl - friend ’ ….
I can only assume that the inventor of these accounts did not realize what the consequences would be for my life .
Ever since then I have been accused of many things in connection with the Third Reich . ’
During WWII , Hanna Reitsch devoted her energy and skill to what she considered to be German nationalism as distinct from Nazism , believing she owed her allegiance to Germany , not to Hitler .
But above all , throughout her life , she remained passionately committed to aviation , especially gliding .
She set more than 40 records during her lifetime , many of them in gliders .
She wrote , ‘ Powered flight is certainly a magnificent triumph over nature , but gliding is a victory of the soul in which one gradually becomes one with nature . ’

COLUMBUS , Ohio --
After three easy victories , the Detroit Red Wings found themselves in a dogfight in Game 4 of their first - round playoff matchup with the Columbus Blue Jackets .
Luckily , the defending Stanley Cup champions saved up one last bit of magic -- and got some help from a controversial call .
Johan Franzen scored on a power play with 46.6 seconds left , giving the Red Wings a 6 - 5 victory and a series sweep over the Blue Jackets on Thursday night .
The call that led to the man advantage was hotly disputed by the Blue Jackets , who were assessed a bench minor for having too many men on the ice .
Replays showed that Fredrik Modin came on the ice and handled the puck while Jake Voracek was still a few feet from the bench .
Blue Jackets coach Ken Hitchcock said it was a picky call that decided the game .
" By the rulebook , it 's probably the right call .
By the circumstances of the game , I did n't like the call .
...
Unless it 's obvious , let 's play , " said Hitchcock , who said the third period had been loosely called to that point .
Marian Hossa had two goals , Nicklas Lidstrom and Holmstrom each had a goal and an assist , and Daniel Cleary also scored for the reigning Stanley Cup champions , who will await their conference semifinal opponent .
" It definitely was the hardest [ game of the series ] , " said Hossa , who signed on with the Red Wings for one year solely to win a Cup .
" We got lucky at the end when they had six on the ice . "
Franzen scored on a rebound after Jiri Hudler skated along the goal line and had his shot blocked by goalie Steve Mason .
" It was a good move by Huds , " Detroit coach Mike Babcock said .
" Anytime the pressures on at the end of a game , all you 've got to do is take it to the net .
That 's what he did . "
Rick Nash , Kristian Huselius and Kris Russell each had a goal and an assist , and R.J. Umberger and Modin also scored for Columbus , making its first foray into the playoffs in the franchise 's eight seasons .
" We were great .
Our fans were great tonight , " Nash said .
" That was our best game by far .
We proved to ourselves , we proved to the whole city , that we can keep up with them . "
Brad Stuart and Niklas Kronwall each had two assists for the Red Wings , who won a series on the road for the eighth straight time .
Their last series - ending win in Detroit was in the 2002 Stanley Cup finals against Carolina .
The Red Wings had pounded the Blue Jackets by a combined 12 - 2 in the first three games .
With a rowdy crowd of 18,889 roaring on every Columbus hit , shot and save , the Blue Jackets finally gave their fans a taste of playoff intensity .
The crowd stood for the entire third period .
" We had a hard time putting them away , " Franzen said .
" This was their first playoff , so they wanted to play hard for the crowd . "
Detroit led 3 - 1 after a period , but things got interesting as Columbus scored twice to tie it and then later came back from another two - goal deficit to head into the third period tied at 5 .
" We had the game in a good situation there , but we made some mistakes , " Babcock said .
" Give them credit , they played with a lot of heart .
And their fans were fantastic . "
Rostislav Klesla 's seeing - eye backdoor pass led to Nash 's goal to cut it to 3 - 2 .
Columbus , last in the NHL all season on the power play , then converted its second man-advantage in two tries when Umberger skated in unimpeded from the left wing and slid a backhander past goalie Chris Osgood .
Mason even assisted with a long stretch pass to initiate the rush .
The arena shook .
Hossa netted the next two goals -- his first of this postseason -- for a 5 - 3 lead .
But the Blue Jackets did n't fold .
On a 2 - on - 1 , Russell whistled a wrister past Osgood .
Then defenseman Aaron Rome , inserted into the lineup because Jan Hejda was out after blocking a shot with his ankle , flipped two shots from the left point .
The second led to a juicy rebound for Modin for an easy backhander .
" We got caught up in that emotional roller - coaster , " Babcock said .
The last time Columbus scored four goals in a period ?
That was on March 7 , when the Blue Jackets piled on the Red Wings 8 - 2 in Detroit in one of the benchmark games in franchise history .
Osgood 's regular - season save percentage ( .887 ) ranked 44th of the 47 goalies with enough starts to qualify statistically .
His goals - against average ( 3.09 ) was 40th of 46 .
But he had been money in the first three games , stopping 76 of the 78 shots he had seen .
But by the end of Game 4 , the crowd was taunting him with chants of " Oz-zie ! Oz-zie ! "
" We showed character all year , " Hitchcock said .
" It 's never been a question for us . "
Ever since being spellbound by the Northern Lights from a flight back from Canada to London , I ’ve been fascinated by the Aurora Borealis .
The first thing I really wanted to know was why they are named Aurora Borealis ?
I found out that they are actually named after the Roman goddess of dawn .
My next question was why on earth do they occur ?
It ’s when highly charged electrons from the solar wind collide with different atmospheric elements in the ring surrounding the North Pole .
My third question and one that most people want to know is – where is the best place to see the Northern Lights ?
Lets start by taking space out the equation 🙂
The Northern Lights work in an eleven year cycle which we ’re currently in a phase of high activity in 2016 after last year ’s ‘ solar maximum ’ .
There are a number of places that you have the best chances of seeing the Northern lights are the 5 best places are as follows :
1. Svalbard , Norway
2. Kakslauttanen , Finland
3. Jukkasjärvi , Sweden
4. Reykjavik , Iceland
5. Northern Canada
Back to some amazing time lapse videos of the beautiful Northern Lights .
Enjoy these magical time lapses of nature at its most beautiful :

Update 3/3 : I 'll be starting the vote tally based on the time stamp of midnight .
If you have posted that you will vote please post another " voted " post after midnight when you have voted so its easier for me to update the spread sheet .
I can see this becoming quite the process if I get even 10 % of the daily visitors to vote a day .
I wo n't know if we won til mid April so expect the drawing to occur late April .
Update 3/4 : Holy **** 7 hours in and we are rocking it nice work guys keep it up remember you can vote every day .
I 've added a section to this post that has which post i have tallied votes to if you do n't see your vote for a specific day pm me the post number .
Many of you have asked about the 1000 and 1700 starting vote counts .
There were some pre voting events that you could earn points at .
I could only make it to the 1000 point event .
I 'm not condoning voting from multiple accounts and doing it will be easy to spot .
So do n't even try cheating its not worth it .
Update 3/9 :
Over the weekend we were as far as 900 votes behind to being just 450 votes behind earlier this morning .
This is a good sign .
It means that their initial push is wearing off and their easy pool of voters has dried up .
TW on the other hand has only had 200 or so people register and vote .
There are at least 700 people that go through here on any given day and 10 - 15 new guys have been registering every day .
If we can get those who are ignoring this thread to vote we can easily get the win .
I almost want to stay behind by a little bit until the last few days .
pull out a bunch of new voters in the last 72 hours and not give them enough time to scramble to get more .
Looking at their forum and other places they have advertised they are getting a bit worried and have yet to find any of my advertisements since they seem to be pretty damn confused on their forum .
The face book group is up to ~320 people and there are still 1800 or so invited that have n't responded .
In the last few days any one who has been invited and not responded will be getting a message from me .
if even 10 % of them get the 16 votes thats a 3000 vote surge .
Not sure they can contend with that .
So keep promoting .
Get your friends , family and coworkers involved and lets win this thing .
DON'T TRY AND CHEAT .
BREAKING THE CONTEST RULES HAS ALREADY COST US 1300 + VOTES
This included using the white house address for your address , Mike Hawk for your name and 867-5309 for your phone number .
If you do n't want to provide that information thanks for stopping by but your participation could hurt us in the long run .
Update 3/16 :
We had another 1066 votes knocked off .
This time around I 'm hearing from a bunch of people who claim their info was 100 % legit and yet got locked .
If you fall in this category you can e-mail them at
Update 3/24 :
They have picked a a ton of speed today .
we need to kick it into high gear .
only about 50 of the 250 TWers who have been awesome enough to sign up have been voting each day .
Just getting more of you to vote would put the xbox crew in the ground .
Update 3/31 : Drawings : Assuming the win is verified on April 8th .
any one at 28 days has one chance to win $ 75 Any one over 20 Days has a chance at $ 75 for each day over 20 Any one over 17 days has a 1 chance at $ 50 - this one was done to compensate for the 5 votes I gave people who registered in the last 48 hours .
Every one has 1 chance at each day for 3 $ 50 prizes
Your ticket position will be based on alphabetical sort of voters and counting down columns .
Voters will be drawn at random using random.org 's random generator .
Users who got the 5 bonus votes for voting in the last 48 hours will have their 5 bonus votes applied to the 5 days leading up to their first vote .
Yes I realize I ended up at $ 550 total but it seems the fairest after adding the 5 bonus votes for voting in the last 48 hours .
I will revert to $ 75 for over 20s and a $ 25 for a random if our win is not confirmed on april 8th .
I will also unleash the hordes
Payment can be any type of digitally deliverable prize .
Amazon , steam , iTunes ect .
Thanks again guys
After Voting Update :
Well we lost due to a disqualification .
No real answer was given causing a **** storm on TW .
A lot of people say some really stupid things and the thread gets moved here .
Talking about blowing up a dealership , posting the bridal parties information and threatening to crash it and other such retarded comments cause more trouble .
Contest administration will no longer respond to my e-mails , Feldmann nissan has said they will set up a meeting for me and their GM / Owner .
Hopefully this goes well and some **** gets cleaned up .
The e-mail of the contest administration owner and my contact at feldmann .

here is a generic one that covers the basics .
Quote : Hello ,
I assume I have this email correct , but if not , please direct this to the public relations representative for the Feldmann Nissan Giveaway contest which ended on March 31st , 2009 .
I am one of hundreds of voters who voted for Brandan Iwaszko and Gabrielle Pastore .
I , like many , am in complete disbelief over the handling and execution of the contest results .
For over a month , hundreds and hundreds of us voted , diligently , every single day , ensuring what we thought was a clear win for our friends Brandan and Gabrielle .
On numerous occasions , voters saw their votes " deleted " through " audits " , many times shown to be erroneous .
On several occasions , voters who found that their votes were deleted through audits were able to retrieve their votes through petition - I have no doubt you are aware of many instances where votes were deleted only to be re-honored .
What is most upsetting to many of us is the complete lack of integrity through this entire contest .
There is no doubt that your audit system , whether automated or manually operated , bore flaws ; clearly this has been shown through the many voters who saw their votes taken away , only to have them re-instated later on .
So I beg to ask a few questions in the interest of integrity and good will :
What of the voters who never saw their votes re-instated for Brandan and Gabrielle ?
Being that your audit system is misguided , how can you not possibly question every other vote that was thrown away ?
By default , in knowing your audit system has been shown to be erroneous , how can you not honor them as well ( unless the information was clearly not filled out at all , for which there should be greater transparency ) ?
Worst of all , how does an audit system that has been shown to be erroneous , fail to penalize the 2nd place contestants who also had several thousand votes ?
How is it that Brandan and Gabrielle work so hard to correspond with you during the contest , and insure integrity , yet become " disqualified " with little to no transparency ?
How is it that the 2nd place contestants manage to add over 1000 new legitimate votes in the last hour of the contest and yet again their votes are fully supported , even by a failed auditing system ?
There are hundreds of voters who want answers to these questions .
In the mean time , I am filing a petition with the better business bureau .
I would encourage anyone who has bore witness to this blatant lack of integrity to do the same .
I would like to request that my email is taken out of your database .
I did not submit personal information for what has turned out to be gross exploitation and a complete lack of good faith .
Thank you for your time .
Regards ,
Yeah thats right I tricked some one into marrying my ugly mug and now I need you guys to hit this contest in true TW style and win me a free wedding .
It 's basically a popularity contest so pretty much anything goes as far as getting people to vote .
Yes you have to register to vote ( 15 bonus votes for filling out information though ) so I 'm going to make it worth your while .
Sign -ups are open for voters and voting begins at 12:01 cst on March 4th and runs until March 31st .
YOU CAN VOTE ONCE PER DAY and only use one account .
They will be doing IP Checking .
I 've already donated $ 100 to TW and Rayn will attest to that .
If you guys earn us the win I 'll donate another $ 100 .
We 'll now you are asking yourself " whats in it for me ? " well even if we do n't get the win any one with 20 + days of voting , recorded by posting " voted " or something to that effect in this thread , will be thrown in a drawing for $ 75 over amazon / paypal / steam and for every day any one votes they will be entered for a $ 25 drawing .
If we win the " perfect attendance " pool will be upped to $ 100 and I will do $ 200 in prizes for the other raffle .
That comes out to $ 200 guaranteed and with a win $ 500 to TW and its members .
A win will guarantee a TW logo on the cake .
I 'm also pushing for a TW table at the reception for any one who wants to come get drunk on me , there are quite a few TWers in the area .
I will be screening any one who would want to do this .
No one who is likely to show their testicle to my mother will be invited : PThis is n't against the rules I checked with the people running it so do n't bother reporting this thread .
They allow selling of Advertising T'shirts and paying outright for advertisement and this is no different they just want your data and I want a free wedding .
Here is the facebook group if any of you want to join up and spam your lists .
I 'll track all votes here : Real time top 5 : Voting trend charts for top 2 couples :
You can submit the current totals for us and the xbox crew here : Vote Tracker .. We do n't need data every 5 seconds though so try and check the time of the last submission before submitting your data .
So be sure to bump this thread with an " I voted " or else I wo n't know .
I 've also set up a L4D server so have at it : 208.100.45.131:27015
Picture of us drunk at some formal.us and the dog ( descriptive i know ) Thanks for voting .
VOTES TALLIED TO POST : Update 3/3 : I 'll be starting the vote tally based on the time stamp of midnight .
If you have posted that you will vote please post another " voted " post after midnight when you have voted so its easier for me to update the spread sheet .
I can see this becoming quite the process if I get even 10 % of the daily visitors to vote a day .
I wo n't know if we won til mid April so expect the drawing to occur late April .
Update 3/4 : Holy **** 7 hours in and we are rocking it nice work guys keep it up remember you can vote every day .
I 've added a section to this post that has which post i have tallied votes to if you do n't see your vote for a specific day pm me the post number .
Many of you have asked about the 1000 and 1700 starting vote counts .
There were some pre voting events that you could earn points at .
I could only make it to the 1000 point event .
I 'm not condoning voting from multiple accounts and doing it will be easy to spot .
So do n't even try cheating its not worth it .
Update 3/9 :
Over the weekend we were as far as 900 votes behind to being just 450 votes behind earlier this morning .
This is a good sign .
It means that their initial push is wearing off and their easy pool of voters has dried up .
TW on the other hand has only had 200 or so people register and vote .
There are at least 700 people that go through here on any given day and 10 - 15 new guys have been registering every day .
If we can get those who are ignoring this thread to vote we can easily get the win .
I almost want to stay behind by a little bit until the last few days .
pull out a bunch of new voters in the last 72 hours and not give them enough time to scramble to get more .
Looking at their forum and other places they have advertised they are getting a bit worried and have yet to find any of my advertisements since they seem to be pretty damn confused on their forum .
The face book group is up to ~320 people and there are still 1800 or so invited that have n't responded .
In the last few days any one who has been invited and not responded will be getting a message from me .
if even 10 % of them get the 16 votes thats a 3000 vote surge .
Not sure they can contend with that .
So keep promoting .
Get your friends , family and coworkers involved and lets win this thing .
Update 3/16 : We had another 1066 votes knocked off .
This time around I 'm hearing from a bunch of people who claim their info was 100 % legit and yet got locked .
If you fall in this category you can e-mail them at info@feldmannnissangiveaw ay.com .
If you are not from the US and had your account locked it was not your fault because it is not against their rules as stated in their FAQ .
You too can send them an e-mail at info@feldmannnissangiveaw ay.com and get your account unlocked .
I thank any one who goes through this extra leg work .

here is a generic one that covers the basics .
I was living out the dream of entrepreneurs everywhere – taking my company public .
During the day , preened investment bankers fawned over me .
And at night , visions of sugar plums in “ green shoes ” danced in my head , as I price - earnings ratioed myself to sleep .
While my managers battled the bitter realities of getting the company ready , I wafted in the sweet intoxication of my securitized reverie .
It came to pass that well before circulating our prospectus and starting the road show , we had to have one big meeting with the three investment banks we had selected .
The purpose was to sift through a myriad of mind - numbing issues .
Seated around a huge table in the windowless conference room of a Georgetown law firm were representatives from each of our investment banks .
Counting their lawyers there were 14 of them .
If it were a police line up , you would n’t had been able to tell one from the next .
All were young ( late twenties to mid thirties ) , similarly pinstriped , identically coiffed , universally spit - shined , racially indistinguishable , and male .
With one notable exception !
Julia Barton .
( Not her real name . )
Julia , the sole female , was the lead banker from one of the big Wall Street houses .
To be sure , she was as professional , as proficient , as polished as her male counterparts , if not more so .
AND she was pretty .
Very pretty .
Julia dazzled me .
She clearly had game .
I marveled how she gave no ground and elbowed for rebounds with the best from the other banks .
Did I mention she was pretty ?
It was easy to fall in love with her .
And I did .
But I was n’t the only one .
During a lively discussion , the substance of which has long since been forgotten , John , our chief operating officer , left his seat and came over to me .
For a little background , John was enormously competent .
He graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School as a Baker Scholar ( a great distinction ) and worked for Boston Consulting Group .
Fluent in Wall Street -ese , he was completely at home in this meeting .
He too had been smitten by Julia .
“ What about Julia Barton for our board of directors ? ” he whispered in my ear .
Needless to say I was intrigued .
John proceeded to give me his reasoning as if crude logic were required to justify delicate emotion .
“ She ’s a woman and we ’re short on women in upper management .
She ’s smart .
She knows her stuff and she ’s well - connected . ”
I nodded approvingly at his compelling analysis .
When John returned to his seat , I swiveled to the man on my right – Doug , our chief financial officer .
It took a lot to impress Doug who , in his distinguished career , had long ago become immune to occupants of dark blue suits .
“ What about Julia Barton for our board of directors ? ” I whispered .
The question blindsided Doug .
He just stared at me slack - jawed .
Struggling for words , he finally stammered , “ W - w - why would you EVER think THAT ? ”
I was shocked by his reaction .
Fortunately John ’s Harvard - educated arguments were fresh in my mind so I quickly repeated them , “ Well , she ’s a woman and we ’re short on women in upper management .
She ’s smart .
She knows her stuff and she ’s well - connected . ”
Once again Doug was rendered dumbfounded .
He gaped at me in astonishment .
Carefully choosing his words , he whispered , “ But she ’s a jackal ! ”
He paused to collect his thoughts and then added , “ Fred , these people are not your friends .
They ’re hyenas !
The only reason they are being friendly to you is because you are fresh kill .
Right now they are fighting over who gets to eat your heart and who gets to eat your head .
These people will turn on you and sell you down the river in a wink if it is to their advantage . ”
“ From now on , ” he counseled , “ every time you look at Julia Barton , I want you to see her with a patch over her eye , a peg leg , and a parrot on her shoulder . ”
He then turned back to the discussion at hand .
With my hormones having had the equivalent of an ice water plunge , I watched Julia Barton belly - ache about her bank ’s allotment of the fees .
In retrospect , whatever they got was too much .
Over the next few months , her bank did not contribute anything substantial to the success of the IPO and , true to Doug ’s characterization , her bank became the first one to turn against us .
It was the hottest of times .
It was the coldest of times .
