SINCE HE BEGAN his presidential campaign , Republican candidate Mitt Romney has held more than 125 " Ask Mitt Anything " town hall forums , and the people who have shown up for them have done their best to make the events live up to their name .
There have been questions about medical marijuana , about abolishing the income tax , about Romney 's Mormonism and his potential vice president .
Of course , certain topics come up more than others .
One is healthcare .
Another is Iraq .
A third is the North American Union .
The North American Union is a supranational organization , modeled on the European Union , that will soon fuse Canada , the United States , and Mexico into a single economic and political unit .
The details are still being worked out by the countries ' leaders , but the NAU 's central governing body will have the power to nullify the laws of its member states .
Goods and people will flow among the three countries unimpeded , aided by a network of continent - girdling superhighways .
The US and Canadian dollars , along with the peso , will be phased out and replaced by a common North American currency called the amero .
If you have n't heard about the NAU , that may be because its plotters have succeeded in keeping it secret .
Or , more likely , because there is no such thing .
Government officials say a continental union is out of the question , and economists and political analysts overwhelmingly agree that there will not be a North American Union in our lifetimes .
But belief in the NAU - that the plans are very real , and that the nation is poised to lose its independence - has been spreading from its origins in the conservative fringe , coloring political press conferences and candidate question - and - answer sessions , and reaching a kind of critical mass on the campaign trail .
Republican presidential candidate and Texas congressman Ron Paul has made the North American Union one of his central issues .
As fears of the mythical NAU grow , they appear to be subtly shaping more mainstream debates about immigration and trade .
Paul 's fellow Republican congressman Virgil Goode introduced a congressional resolution early this year to block the creation of the NAU and the " NAFTA Superhighway System . "
Similar resolutions have been introduced in several state legislatures - in Montana 's case , the resolution passed nearly unanimously .
And back in July , the US House of Representatives easily approved a measure that would cut off federal funds for an existing trade group set up by the three countries .
The NAU may be the quintessential conspiracy theory for our time , according to scholars studying what the historian Richard Hofstadter famously called the " paranoid style " in American politics .
The theory elegantly weaves old fears and new realities into one coherent and all - encompassing plan , and gives a glimpse of where , politically , many Americans are right now : alarmed over immigration , worried about globalization , and - on both sides of the partisan divide - suspicious of the Bush administration 's expansive understanding of executive power .
The belief in an imminent North American Union , says Mark Fenster , a law professor at the University of Florida and author of a 2001 book on conspiracy theories , " reflects the particular ways in which Americans feel besieged economically , powerless politically , and alienated socially . " . . .
As a social anxiety , the NAU 's roots run deep .
Global government and elites who secretly sell out their own citizenry have long been staples of conspiracy theories , thanks in part to the Book of Revelation 's warning that world government will be an early indicator of the Apocalypse .
Over the centuries , the world 's puppeteers have been thought to be , in turn , the Bavarian Illuminati , the Freemasons , the pope , the Jews , international bankers , the League of Nations , the United Nations , the Rockefellers , and the Communist International .
For most of the 20th century , American conspiracy theories tended to focus on communist infiltration of the upper echelons of the US government .
The founder of the John Birch Society , a leading source of such imagined schemes , accused President Dwight Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , among many others , of being communist agents .
The dissolution of the Soviet Union , the one country that has actually challenged American global preeminence in the postwar period , forced a conceptual adjustment among the conspiracy - minded .
In the past two decades , the United Nations and trade groups like the World Trade Organization have figured more prominently in their dark visions .
" In the 1990s in particular , with the militia movement , you had all the rumors of black helicopters and jackbooted UN troops , " says Chip Berlet , an analyst at the liberal , Somerville - based think tank Political Research Associates .
" There was this sense that the secret elites behind the UN were the same secret elites who had been behind the Soviet Union . "
Recently , other threads have emerged .
The 1994 birth of NAFTA gave new strength to worries that free trade would cripple the American middle class .
In the past two years , immigration has once again thrust itself into the national political discussion .
And the once - mighty dollar has entered a steady decline that shows no signs of ending - in sharp contrast to the strength of the euro , the new currency of an economically united Europe .
In March 2005 , those seemingly disparate worries found a banner under which they could unite .
President Bush , along with then - President Vicente Fox of Mexico and then - Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada , held a summit in Waco , Texas , and announced the creation of the Security and Prosperity Partnership , a framework for greater continental cooperation on trade and security issues .
Alarmed at the fact that the United States had entered into the arrangement without explicit congressional approval , and by what they saw as a lack of public detail about the meetings , a few conservative activists became convinced that the SPP was the first step in a secret plan to dissolve the three nations into one continental unit .
Their suspicions were further inflamed when , two months later , a working group at the Council on Foreign Relations , a think tank long viewed with suspicion by the conspiratorial fringe , published a report called " Building a North American Community . "
The report recommended the establishment of a common North American security perimeter , the development of biometric North American border passes , and the adoption of a common North American tariff .
One of the vice chairs of the council 's working group was a political science professor at American University and former Carter administration official named Robert Pastor .
In 2001 , Pastor had written a book arguing for greater economic integration between the three North American nations - and specifically discussed the possibility that the nations could jointly adopt an amero currency .
A fully realized theory was born .
In the fall of 2006 , Phyllis Schlafly , along with the conservative author Jerome Corsi and Howard Phillips , founder of an organization called the Conservative Caucus , started a website dedicated to quashing the coming North American " Socialist mega - state . "
If the anti-NAU cause has a prophet , it is Corsi .
In 2004 , Corsi was a leading spokesman for Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ; last year , he co-wrote a book on the Minuteman Project with its founder , Jim Gilchrist .
Earlier this year Corsi published a book , " The Late Great U.S.A. , " and it was here - and in his columns on the conservative websites WorldNetDaily and Human Events - that the NAU conspiracy theory emerged in full flower .
A new continental government will grow out of the tri-national working groups set up by the SPP , complete with bureaucratic agencies outranking the three national legislatures , and a North American Court able to overrule national courts .
There is talk , Corsi writes , of issuing North American passports , and of meshing the three nations ' militaries .
And the infrastructural backbone of the sprawling new superstate is already being built :
The NAFTA Superhighway , a " four - football - fields wide " Mississippi of concrete and rail along which goods , cheap labor , narcotics , terrorists , and pandemics will flow unimpeded from Mexico ( and , via Mexico 's Pacific ports , from China ) into the United States and on to Canada .
Corsi said in an interview that his belief in the NAU stemmed from his realization that it was the only logical explanation for the Bush administration 's refusal to police the US - Mexico border adequately .
" I kept asking myself why , six years into the war on terror , was Bush not securing the border ? " he said .
When he heard about the SPP , he had his answer : Bush , bent on creating the NAU , saw the border as a near - anachronism , fated for irrelevance in a North American superstate .
" He 's creating a fait accompli , " said Corsi .
" First you change the North American reality , then you can change the regulations . "
Corsi 's warning cry and gift for detail have given the theory traction in circles where anxieties about immigration and corporate oligarchy intersect .
Lou Dobbs , whose CNN show portrays both free trade and increased immigration as sops to multinational corporations and body blows to the middle class , has devoted investigative segments to the NAU , the amero , and the NAFTA Superhighway .
The John Birch Society a month ago devoted an entire issue of its magazine to the NAU .
The coin designer Daniel Carr , who created the New York and Rhode Island state quarters , has minted a series of copper and silver ameros , in denominations from one up to one thousand , and is selling them online to raise awareness of the issue .
And a year ago on CNBC , a financial analyst named Steve Previs , from the investment bank Jefferies International , caused a minor stir when he called the amero " the one thing that nobody 's talking about that I think is going to have a big impact on everybody 's life in Canada , the US , and Mexico . "
( Asked about his comments recently , he said that , while he was happy to " get the message out , " what he said had also been " not a joke , exactly , but a way of deflecting a hard question about the behavior of the dollar . " ) . . .
So how real is the NAU ?
In the literal sense , not very .
Its underpinnings turn out to be a hodgepodge of mostly unconnected facts and suppositions .
But the very existence of the theory is starting to have an influence of its own , and the concerns it represents suggest a new kind of anxiety that crosses traditional political boundaries .
The SPP does exist , and its tri-national task forces continue to meet , but its members consider it a way for the United States , Canada , and Mexico to collaborate on issues such as customs , environmental and safety regulations , narcotics smuggling , and terrorism .
The amero , on the other hand , appears to be purely theoretical .
It was first proposed in 1999 by a Canadian economist named Herbert Grubel , when the euro was first entering circulation .
Grubel says he did manage to interest Vicente Fox in the idea , but whenever he brought up the topic with American officials , he recalls , he got nowhere .
" There would n't be very much benefit for the United States " in an amero , he concedes .
The NAFTA Superhighway has a more complicated origin .
One piece is a nonprofit organization , called the North America 's Supercorridor Coalition , or NASCO , dedicated to ensuring the efficiency and safety of some of the country 's major truck trade routes - a map from the organization 's website has shown up on NAU watchdog websites , erroneously labeled the blueprint for the NAFTA Superhighway .
Another is a controversial toll highway that Texas is considering building to accommodate the sharp increase in freight traffic brought by NAFTA .
These constituent parts are a long way from the many - tentacled conspiracy that Corsi and other see .
But the theory still has managed to make itself felt .
Frank Conde , the director of communications for NASCO , believes that fears of an NAU are preventing the North American countries from having long - overdue discussions .
US - Mexico trade has quadrupled since 1993 , and at $ 540 billion , the US - Canada trading relationship is the largest in the world .
He argues that making economic relations among the three nations more efficient is no more than responsible stewardship .
We have been downloading and converting YouTube videos but have not looked at how to upload them .
In this post I 'll teach you how to upload YouTube videos via the command line .
To find out how a video is uploaded we will need just the Firefox browser .
Here is a typical scenario when you would want to automatically upload your videos to YouTube .
Suppose you were using some other video sharing site and had already uploaded like 100 of your videos there .
To get more popular on the net you 'd also want to get your videos on YouTube , right ?
Doing it manually is a boring and tedious job , you want a program to do it for you while you produce new content .
Finding the YouTube Upload Form's Elements
Log into your account and go to " My Account " menu in the upper right .
Then press the " Upload New Video " button .
Now let 's use Firefox 's " Page Info " tool which is located under " Tools " menu .
When the " Page Info " tool pops up , select the " Forms " tab .
The tool will list all the HTML forms on the page .
The one named " the Form " with action 's url " http://www.youtube.com/my_videos_upload " is the upload form !
When a user uploads the video , it gets submitted .
Our program will submit this form for us .
Now that we have found all the fields we need to submit , we can write the tool itself .
I 'll use my favorite programming language - Perl , again .
It is perfect for this job because it has extremely good packages for working with HTTP protocol .
I will probably write another post just about the Perl programming language - how to get it working on Windows Operating System .
For now , if you are running Windows , then you can download ActiveState 's ActivePerl which is Perl 's port to win .
Writing the Program
As I said , we will be creating the tool in Perl programming language .
In the previous post about YouTube I used the WWW :: Mechanize package .
I can tell you in advance that it will not work this time because there will be some unexpected surprises , such as hidden form elements being created by Javascript when the form is submitted .
Since WWW :: Mechanize stores all the forms internally , it will not be able to submit this form with these dynamic form elements .
That 's why we will use the base class of WWW :: Mechanize - the LWP :: UserAgent .
LWP :: UserAgent package can be installed with the following command :
perl - MCPAN -e ' install LWP :: UserAgent '
Once you have it installed , we can start writing the program .
Step 1 : Logging in to YouTube
Before we can upload a video , we need to login to YouTube .
Let 's use the same procedure as before to find out what form do we need to submit to login .
Let 's go to this url :
http://www.youtube.com/login
and look at all the forms on this page .
One of them is named " loginForm " with four fields .
We will need to submit this form and save the cookies .
Luckily LWP :: UserAgent can do it for us and we will not have to parse HTTP headers or anything like that .
We see that there is no action URL provided for the loginForm , that means that the form should be POSTed to the same URL it was located on , in our case :
http://www.youtube.com/login
We also see that the form has 4 elements which should be submitted :
' current_form ' with value ' loginForm '
' username ' with our youtube login / username
' password ' with our password , and
' action_login ' with value ' Log In '
How would we submit this form with LWP :: UserAgent ?
Easy - it has a member function $ ua -> post ( $url , \%form , $ header_field_name => $ value , ... ) , where % form is a hash of key , value pairs of form elements and $ header_field_name => $ value is a pair of HTTP headers we would like to add to the request .
Given an object of LWP :: UserAgent named $ ua , code which would login us to YouTube is the following :
$ ua -> post ( ' http://www.youtube.com/login', { current_form => ' loginForm ' , username => ' youtube_login ' , password => ' youtube_password ' , action_login => ' Log In ' } , ) ;
See how easy it was ?
I love it .
The only problem is how to detect if we have really logged in .
I noticed that when we log in , the upper right menu has a ' Log Out ' button .
So if we logged in succesfully , we should find this button .
Step 2 : Uploading the Video
Now , once we have logged in , let 's upload the video .
Here is the image with all the fields we have to submit to upload a video , once more :
There are 17 fields totally :
" field_myvideo_title " - title of the video
" field_myvideo_descr " - description of the video
" field_myvideo_keywords " - comma separated tags
" field_myvideo_categories " - video category
" language " - language of the video , i'll leave it " EN " for English
" action_upload " - a string " Upload a video ... "
" session_token " - we will have to extract the session token for this upload
" allow_embeddings " - should the video be allowed to be embedded on other sites , i'll leave the default " Yes "
" allow_responses " - should we allow video responses , i'll leave the default " Yes "
" allow_comments " - should we allow comments on the video , i'll leave the default " Yes "
" allow_ratings " - should we allow users to rate the vide , i'll leave the default " Yes "
" location " - latitude and longitude of the location video was shot , i'll leave it empty
" field_date_mon " - month the video was shot , i'll use default 0 ( unknown )
" field_date_day " - day the video was shot , i'll use 0 ( unknown )
" field_date_yr " - year the video was shot , i'll use 0 ( unknown )
" field_privacy " - privacy of video ( public or private ) , i'll use the default - " public "
" ignore_broadcast_settings " - no idea what this is , i'll use the default value 0
The trickiest part here is to extract the " session_token " which is some kind of unique id .
Going through the HTML source of upload page :
http://www.youtube.com/my_videos_upload
We find a javascript function called " dynamic_append_session_token " which dynamically creates a hidden form element containing the session ID :
We have to extract this session ID from the line in red .
It can be done with the following regular expression :
token_elem\.setAttribute\(' value ' , '(.+? ) '\ ) ;
Update 2008.03.12 : This is no longer true !
A session cookie is represented by a variable now :
var gXSRF_token = ' OTxXiSg8O-oQFB-PWTSaDv7oX2V8MTIwNTQ1NzYxNQ== ' ;
When we have done this , we can submit the form .
For this form we will need to add a " Content - Type : form - data " header to the request because the upload form has explicitly stated that its " enctype " is " multipart /form - data " .
As it turns out the actual video upload process is a two step process .
This was the first step which set the video information .
After we submit this form , we get redirected to a page which contains the upload file selection form .
It might seem that that is the only element in this form but not so .
Actually this 2nd step form has a few new fields and it also has all the fields from 1st step as hidden elements .
Here are the modified and added fields in the 2nd step :
" contact " - no idea what this field is for
" field_command " - always " myvideo_submit "
" field_uploadfile " - our video file we want to upload
" field_private_share_entities " - no idea
" action_upload " - submit button 's caption " Upload Video "
" addresser " - another mysterious unique id
Here is what page info tool shows us about 2nd step 's form elements :
Notice that the form 's action URL changes , we have to extract it from the html source .
Someone might suggest not to use regexes for parsing HTML but it is perfectly ok for this tiny project .
The trickiest thing here is telling LWP :: UserAgent that ' field_uploadfile ' is a form element of ' file ' type .
If we look in the LWP :: UserAgent 's documentation we find that the three argument post ( ) subroutine uses " POST ( ) function from HTTP :: Request :: Common to build the request . "
Further looking in the HTTP :: Request :: Common documentation we find that to specify a file to be uploaded the field has to be an array ref looking like this : [ $ file , $ filename , Header => Value ... ] .
That 's it .
When we submit this form the video should have been uploaded .
Now we just need to detect if the upload was successful .
I noticed that when the video has uploaded successfully , YouTube thanks me for uploading .
It looks like this :
So checking if a video uploaded successfully is reduced to checking for the thank you message .
The program can be used from command line and takes a few mandatory arguments :
Usage : perl ytup.pl -l [ login ] -p [ password ] -f < video file > -c < category > -t < title > -d < description > -x < comma , separated , tags >
The login ( - l ) and password ( - p ) arguments are not mandatory because not to expose your password on a publically shared machine ( by looking at process list ) they can be specified in the source file by changing YT_LOGIN and YT_PASS constants .
Possible categories ( for - c switch ) : 2 - Autos & Vehicles 23 - Comedy 24 - Entertainment 1 - Film & Animation 20 - Gadgets & Games 26 - Howto & DIY 10 - Music 25 - News & Politics 22 - People & Blogs 15 - Pets & Animals 17 - Sports 19 - Travel & Places

University of California , Riverside nanotechnologists have succeeded in controlling the color of very small particles of iron oxide suspended in water simply by applying an external magnetic field to the solution .
The discovery has potential to greatly improve the quality and size of electronic display screens and to enable the manufacture of products such as erasable and rewritable electronic paper and ink that can change color eletromagnetically .
In their experiments , the researchers found that by changing the strength of the magnetic field they were able to change the color of the iron oxide solution – similar to adjusting the color of a television screen image .
When the strength of the magnetic field is changed , it alters the arrangement of the spherical iron oxide particles in solution , thereby modifying how light falling on the particles passes through or is deflected by the solution .
Study results appear in Angewandte Chemie International Edition ’s online edition today .
The research paper is scheduled to appear in print in issue 34 of the journal .
Identified by Angewandte Chemie as a “ very important paper , ” the research will be featured on the inside cover of the print issue .
“ The key is to design the structure of iron oxide nanoparticles through chemical synthesis so that these nanoparticles self - assemble into three - dimensionally ordered colloidal crystals in a magnetic field , ” said Yadong Yin , an assistant professor of chemistry who led the research .
A nanoparticle is a microscopic particle whose size is measured in nanometers .
A colloid is a substance comprised of small particles uniformly distributed in another substance .
Milk , paint and blood are examples of colloids .
“ By reflecting light , these crystals – also called photonic crystals – show brilliant colors , ” Yin said .
“ Ours is the first report of a photonic crystal that is fully tunable in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum , from violet light to red light . ”
A photonic crystal controls the flow of light ( photons ) and works like a semiconductor for light .
The nanoparticles ’ spacing dictates the wavelength of light that a photonic crystal reflects .
Iron oxide ( formula : Fe 3 O 4 ) nanoparticles are “ superparamagnetic , ” meaning that they turn magnetic only in the presence of an external magnetic field .
In contrast , “ ferromagnetic ” materials become magnetized in a magnetic field and retain their magnetism when the field is removed .
The researchers used the superparamagnetic property of iron oxide particles to tune the spacing between nanoparticles , and therefore the wavelength of the light reflection – or the color of the colloidal crystals – by changing the strength of the external magnetic field .
“ Other reported photonic crystals can only reflect light with a fixed wavelength , ” Yin said .
“ Our crystals , on the other hand , show a rapid , wide and fully reversible optical response to the external magnetic field . ”
Photonic materials such as those used by Yin and his team could help in the fabrication of new optical microelectromechanical systems and reflective color display units .
They also have applications in telecommunication ( fiber optics ) , sensors and lasers .
“ This is an elegant method that allows researchers in the field to assemble photonic crystals and control their spacing by using a magnetic field , ” said Orlin Velev , an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering at North Carolina State University , Raleigh , N.C. , who was not involved in the research .
“ A simple magnet can be used to change the color of a suspension throughout the whole visible spectra .
This has potential to result in usable precursors for various photonic devices . ”
“ What should make the technology commercially attractive is that iron oxide is cheap , non-toxic and available in plenty , ” Yin said .
Yin explained that the new technology can be used to make an inexpensive color display by forming millions of small pixels using the photonic crystals .
“ A different color for each pixel can be assigned using a magnetic field , ” he said .
“ The advantage is that you need just one material – for example , photonic crystals like iron oxide – for all the pixels .
Moreover , you do n’t need to generate light in each pixel .
You would be using reflected light to create the images – a form of recycling . ”
The UCR Office of Technology Commercialization has filed a patent application on the technology .

The Parents Involved decision -- Swann Song or Bakke for our times ?
JB
Justice Kennedy 's limiting concurrence in Parents Involved ( the school desegregation cases ) will be the object of much study in the days to come .
It is important to note that no matter how strident or uncompromising the language one finds in Chief Justice Roberts ' and Justice Thomas ' opinions , Kennedy 's concurrence limits what the Court has held .
So here are a few things to think about at the outset .
First , Kennedy acknowledges that racial diversity and avoiding racial isolation in schools are compelling interests that might justify racially conscious school assignment policies .
On this question he disagrees with the plurality and agrees with the dissenters .
Kennedy objects to student assignment policies that use the race of a particular student as the controlling factor in determining where an individual student goes to school .
He also objects to student assignment policies that are unrealistic in their portrait of the population as white / non - white .
Any student assignment policies that direct where individual students will be placed must , at a minimum , have to be multi-factor individualized considerations roughly akin to the sort approved in Grutter v. Bollinger , the University of Michigan affirmative action case decidedi n 2003 .
That in itself would make them far less likely to be employed by large school districts .
Kennedy would also require considerable transparency as to how the selection system worked , which of course , undermines the way that the system approved in Grutter worked in practice .
We might call this the Grutter- ization of school assignment policies .
Second , Kennedy objects to individual student assignment policies based on race if school boards have not considered other , non-race - based methods for promoting racial diversity and avoiding racial isolation .
Nevertheless , Kennedy has no problem with race - conscious policies by school boards that do n't involve the specific assignment of individual students to schools based on their race .
That means that race conscious policies that site new schools or move old ones based on expectations about likely racial makeup are permissible .
Policies that assign students randomly by lottery or use factors like geographic distance from a school are also perfectly permissible , even if they are designed to achieve a more diverse balance of students by race and ethnicity .
For example , a school district that used magnet schools with assignments based on nonracial factors to promote racial diversity would be permissible under his model .
What does this leave us with then ?
It leaves us with Grutter applied to elementary and secondary schools .
Race conscious policies using non racial means are favored and must be attempted first ; race based assignment policies that target individual students ( as opposed to structural reforms like school siting policies ) are permitted if they make individualized determinations and use race as only one factor .
This is , to be sure , a limitation on what courts had assumed following Swann v. Charlotte - Mecklenburg Board of Education in 1971 , when the Court gave its blessing ( albeit in dicta ) to voluntary efforts by school boards to achieve racial integration .
See 402 U.S. at 16 ( " School authorities are traditionally charged with broad power to formulate and implement educational policy and might well conclude , for example , that in order to prepare students to live in a pluralistic society each school should have a prescribed ratio of Negro to white students reflecting the proportion for the district as a whole .
To do this as an educational policy is within the broad discretionary powers of school authorities ; absent a finding of a constitutional violation , however , that would not be within the authority of a federal court . " )
The Court distinguishes away Swann , arguing that Swann itself applied only to school districts that had previously been de jure segregated and were attempting to become unitary .
I 'm not sure that Swann can so easily be distinguished -- after all , the Court was clearly signaling that it wanted school boards to solve the problem of racial segregation on their own , rather than having the federal courts get involved .
In any case , that aspect of Swann has now been discarded .
Instead , Grutter becomes the model , if not in the plurality opinion , then in Justice Kennedy's .
And that is quite interesting , precisely because Kennedy himself did not join the majority opinion in Grutter .
In one stroke he has signalled that he is more or less on board with Grutter .
That is good news for people who were worried that all affirmative action policies were now in danger following Justice O'Connor 's retirement .
Kennedy may not uphold the next affirmative action policy that comes before the Court .
But his position on affirmative action is not the same as the plurality 's , much less that of Justice Thomas .
The final thing worth noting about the opinion is that because Kennedy takes a position in between the plurality and the dissenters , his position may end up serving the same function as Justice Powell 's Bakke opinion did .
It will set the boundaries of future debate about the scope of race conscious policies .
All this , of course , depends on new appointments to the Court .
But if the Court 's composition does not change in the near future ( or if Justice Stevens retires and is replaced by a liberal justice ) , Kennedy 's approach will be what everyone will be talking about and working around .
It 's good to be the Swing Justice .

EDIT : What I should really say is that it isnt ’ just Designing for Testability , it ’s Designing with Testability
From a question on my Passive View blog post :
“ should we design for testability , or should we try and test what ’s designed ( perhaps designed badly , so we refactor later ) ? ”
Here ’s my take :
“ Done , done , done ” is n’t just writing code .
It ’s writing code and verifying that that code works correctly .
You do n’t ship until the code is proven to work ( hopefully ) .
Designing for testability might cost you extra time in coding ( which I would actually dispute somewhat ) , but can easily save time in the whole by cutting down on the time spent debugging and testing .
I see testability design as a way to optimize the time to deliver , even if it ups the time spent on design or coding .
One of the very painful truths that TDD newbies learn the hard way ( myself included ) is that retrofitting automated tests to existing code can be very difficult .
Just trying to test what ’s designed may not work out very well , and frankly , I have yet to see a codebase that was n’t built with TDD that was easy to test .
What is Testability design anyway ?
Granted , there are some things I do like opening up more public accessors or pulling out more interfaces strictly for testing that could arguably described as “ bad . ”
However , most of what constitutes designing for testability , or using testability as a design heuristic , is a matter of how best to assign responsibilities by following older design principles that predate TDD by many years .
Achieving testability is mostly a matter of separation of concerns , coupling between classes and subsystems , and cohesion .
Exactly the design qualities that we ’ve always strived for to make our code maintainable .
It ’s what we ’ve been trying to do anyway .
If you practice traditionally good design , you might already be there to testability .
Testability is , in my opinion , the ultimate design smell detector at the granular level .
If you ’re finding it hard to unit test your code , you ’ve likely got a coupling or cohesion problem .
Testability is yet one more design tool to stick in your design toolbox right between UML / CRC modeling and code smells .
At least think of it this way , driving an application design at least partially through tests is yet another example of starting with the end in mind .
How will I know that this code works correctly ?
How will I know that I ’m done ?
Yes , using TypeMock or switching to a dynamic typed language will let you more readily create testing seams with less conscious effort , but that ’s not the entire ballgame .
Throw testability and orthogonality out the window to write a ball of mud and no amount of TypeMock magic is going to help you out .
Anyway , go ahead and start arguing with me .
As always , comments are open .

One of the recent changes we ’ve made to our spending is buying generic products .
This includes generic branded medicine , food and non -food products .
I ’ve found that you can save a significant amount of money purchasing generic products and in general with no sacrifice in quality .
There are generics for almost everything : trash bags , plastic wrap , aluminum foil , canned products , frozen products , milk , bread , etc .
Note , I said “ in general no sacrifice in quality “ .
Our experience with prescription and over the counter medicine , the quality is identical .
This also holds true for non -food items that you typically find at the grocery store such as trash bags , plastic wrap , dish soap , dish washer detergent , rinse aids , etc .
Regarding food products , the quality is a little more varied .
Our experience is that for the most part you ca n’t tell the difference .
This is particularly true of products that you mix with other food items , such as sugar , spices , canned vegetables , coffee creamer , etc .
For food products that you directly consume , here ’s where you may notice a difference .
For example , I love Pop - Tarts , all flavors , all kinds .
I tried the store brand of pop-tarts and even the branded “ Toastems ” and they do n’t even come close .
Another example where I personally can’t tolerate the generic brand is Yogurt .
For me , nothing compares to Dannon Fruit on the bottom yogurt .
On the other hand , I ’ve found a few products I enjoy where I can’t even tell the difference .
Overall though , I prefer brand names for products I consume directly .
Generic Prescription medicine
When a drug manufacturer creates a new drug , they typically have about 7 - 12 years of patent protection for the drug .
Once this patent protection runs out , other companies can then begin producing the drug .
Due to the competition , the prices for the generic products are significantly cheaper than the name brand .
Generic drugs must contain the same active ingredients as the original and are identical in dose , strength and safety .
If you take prescription medicines , make sure you tell your pharmacy to provide generic alternatives when they become available .
In general most health plans offer a reduced co-pay on generic drugs as well .
Generic over the counter medicine
The concept here is exactly like prescription drugs .
Same product , just made my multiple manufacturers thus reducing the price .
I take Claritin - D , and up until a few years ago it was by prescription only .
Once the patent ran out , it went over the counter and now “ drug - store ” branded versions are available that are half the price for the exact same product .
This holds true for Tylenol ( Acetometaphin ) , Advil ( Ibuprofine ) , Sudafed ( pseudoephedrine hydrochloride ) and many many other products .
If you are n’t purchasing generic over the counter medicines , you are missing out on considerable cost savings and you are just paying more money for the same product .
Generic Grocery Products
Most common food and non-food products are available in generic and store branded versions .
This includes pasta , detergents , soap , frozen and canned vegetables , diary products , sugar , flour , cereal , etc .
For non-food products , the generics are excellent alternatives and the quality is on - par with name branded versions .
For food products , you may find some difference in quality and taste .
This is particularly true of products you consume directly .
Products that you cook with or mix with other products are great options .
Conclusion
We ’ve saved a considerable amount of money over the past few months buying generics .
It ’s been a difficult effort though , as we ’ve had to change our habit of picking up the name branded products we ’ve become so used to .
We ’ve learned what we like and what we do n’t , and are n’t completely generic , but much more so than before .
I would strongly encourage you to give generics a try .
Worst case you are n’t happy and you return to the product you used before .
Best case , you ca n’t tell the difference and you ’ll see those expenses take a significant drop !
What ’s your experience with generic products ?
Are there any I ’ve missed ?

Senator Jay Rockefeller ( D - West Virginia ) is reportedly steering the secretive Senate Intelligence Committee to give retroactive immunity to telecoms that helped the government secretly spy on Americans .
He has also recently benefited from some interesting political contributions .
Top Verizon executives , including CEO Ivan Seidenberg and President Dennis Strigl , wrote personal checks to Rockefeller totaling $ 23,500 in March , 2007 .
Prior to that apparently coordinated flurry of 29 donations , only one of those executives had ever donated to Rockefeller ( at least while working for Verizon ) .
In fact , prior to 2007 , contributions to Rockefeller from company executives at AT&T and Verizon were mostly non-existent .
But that changed around the same time that the companies began lobbying Congress to grant them retroactive immunity from lawsuits seeking billions for their alleged participation in secret , warrantless surveillance programs that targeted Americans .
The Spring ’07 checks represent 86 percent of money donated to Rockefeller by Verizon employees since at least 2001 .
AT&T executives discovered a fondness for Rockefeller just a month after Verizon execs did and over a three - month span , collectively made donations totaling $ 19,350 .
AT&T Vice President Fred McCallum began the giving spree in May with a $ 500 donation .
22 other AT&T high fliers soon followed with their own checks .
Prior to that burst of generosity , the only AT&T employee donation to Rockefeller was a $ 300 contribution in 2001 .
That supporter did not identify herself as a company executive .
When asked about the contributions , an AT&T spokesman told THREAT LEVEL : " AT&T employees regularly and voluntarily participate in the political process with their own funds . "
Both companies are being sued for allegedly turning over billions of calling records to the government , while AT&T is also accused of letting the National Security Agency wiretap phone calls and its internet backbone .
A federal judge in California allowed the suits regarding the eavesdropping to continue despite the government ’s attempt to have the suits thrown out on the grounds they will endanger national security .
The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reviewed that decision in August .
The judges seemed reluctant to toss the cases , but have yet to issue a ruling .
On Thursday evening , the Rockefeller - led Senate Intelligence Committee is marking up a bill to re-amend the nation ’s spy laws .
While the text of the bill has not yet been released , the bill reportedly includes a way for the telecoms to escape the litigation against them .
Rockefeller ’s commitment to getting the telecoms out of court surprises some who remember that Rockefeller was originally disturbed enough about the secret spying programs that he hand - wrote a letter to Dick Cheney in 2003 , expressing his concerns about the program ’s legality .
In a fairly stunning related news , Democratic Senator Chris Dodd went all in with his political capital Thursday , announcing he would unilaterally put a hold on the bill , which would stop the bill from being voted on .
Representatives for Verizon and Rockefeller did not respond to requests for comment .
The contributions and the following tables were found thanks to OpenSecrets.org .
UPDATE : Reader
Theo writes in to say why the money , though tiny in comparison to Rockefeller ’s fortune , is not negligible .
Rockefeller is believed to have a personal fortune over $ 100 million .
He spent $ 12 million of personal funds on his first Senate campaign .
( http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-3521561.html)
However " in recent campaigns , he has downplayed his personal wealth in one of the nation ’s poorest states .
‘ I will not spend one single dime of any money that I have , ’ he said in 2002 .
‘ So that I if I do n’t raise money , I wo n’t spend money .
I am on exactly the same playing field , so to speak , with anybody else who runs for office . ’ "
AP
He ’s up for election in 2008 .
The cost of Senate races has increased several times over the last two decades .
With a serious Republican challenger in WV , which Bush won twice , such as Rep. Shelley Moore Capito , he could be forced to raise tens of millions of dollars .
That , or break his promise not to use his personal fortune , which would n’t play very well in one of the country ’s poorest states .
So yes , even a Rockefeller has to raise money .
And in West Virginia , $ 50,000 is a lot of money .
It ’s about 2 % of all the money he raised last year .
( But I ’ll bet he ’s slightly more worried about being red- baited for suppurtin ’ terrists . )

The Problem of Apostasy in Islam
Apostasy , or the rejection of religion , is a highly controversial issue in Islam .
And after the case of Abdul Rahman , an Afghan man charged with apostasy ( View related MyScribbles article here ) , discussions about apostasy and the manner in which an apostate should be dealth with have sprung up throughout the Muslim world with a renewed impetus .
There are three main ideological divisions among Muslim scholars about apostasy :
Those who believe it is punishble ( by death ) after the apostate converts to another religion and then back to Islam several times with the objective of " making fun " of the religion .
Holders of this view also maintain that if an individual becomes an apostate after careful research and a thorough understanding of the other religion , he is not punishable .
Those who believe an apostate must be punished by death the first time he turns away from Islam .
The holders of this view also maintain that execution can be carried out only after a three - day ultimatum given to the apostate to reconsider his decision and to subsequently reconvert .
Those who believe there is no earthly punishment for apostasy and that Allah will punish the apostate in the hereafter .
This mess of ideas is further compounded by the fact that all of them are underpinned by religious citations from the Hadith ( sayings of Prophet Mohammed ) and the Qur'an ( Koran ) .
Here are some of the citations used to justify that apostasy is not punishable and that Allah despises it :
" Let there be no compulsion in religion : Truth stands out clear from Error : whoever rejects evil and believes in Allah hath grasped the most trustworthy hand - hold , that never breaks .
And Allah heareth and knoweth all things .
" ( Sura 2:256 )
" Those who believe , then reject faith , then believe ( again ) and ( again ) reject faith , and go on increasing in unbelief , - Allah will not forgive them nor guide them nor guide them on the way . "
( Sura 4:137 )
" O ye who believe !
if any from among you turn back from his Faith , soon will Allah produce a people whom
He will love as they will love Him , - lowly with the believers , mighty against the rejecters , fighting in the way of Allah , and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault .
That is the grace of Allah , which He will bestow on whom He pleaseth .
And Allah encompasseth all , and He knoweth all things . "
( Sura 5:54 )
" Intellect is the foundation of my religion and knowledge my weapon . " ( Hadith )
According to this Wikipedia article , nowhere in the Qur'an is it explicitly mentioned that there is an earthly punishment for apostasy .
Afghan scholar , Ali Mohaqiq Nasab , was imprisoned for expressing the same views about apostasy last year .
He narrowly escaped death punishment .
Those who believe apostasy must be punished by death base their arguments mainly on the following two Hadith texts :
" Whoever changes his religion shall be killed . " ( Abu Dawood )
" It is not lawful to kill a man who is a Muslim except for one of the three reasons : Kufr ( disbelief ) after accepting Islam … " ( Abu Dawood )
Some scholars do not consider these two texts enough evidence on the basis of which to execute an apostate , because the texts have simply been quoted by individuals and attributed to Mohammed and because there is no endorsement to the quotations from a reliable source .
Furthermore , neither Mohammed , nor any of his companions ever sentenced anyone to death for apostasy .
It is interesting to note that when a female becomes an apostate , she is only punishible by a life sentence not death .
Also , mentally retarded individuals are exempt from any form of punishment .
However , heated debates still continue among Muslim scholars on this issue .
Until they come to a definite conclusion , many Muslim countries , whose constitutions are based on this ambiguous Sharia law , will be going against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by punishing apostates by death .

India differs from giant slow - growth and no -growth auto markets like the United States and Western Europe , and even from fast - growing markets like China , in that the emphasis is on small , low - cost cars — but with four doors , not two , and room for the extended family .
Image Rush hour in New Delhi .
Analysts expect more cars to join or replace the 65 million scooters on Indias roads , with new ultra- affordable cars leading the boom .
Credit ... Jacob Silberberg for The New York Times
While the Indian upper classes are snapping up roomier models and even imports like Mercedes - Benz , first - time buyers will provide a big chunk of growth for years to come .
By 2013 , CSM predicts , India ’s market will expand an average of 14.5 percent a year , compared with just over 8 percent for China .
CSM estimates that in 2013 , the Chinese will buy 10.8 million cars , compared with 3.8 million in India , but says there is already a glut of local and foreign manufacturers in China , making India a more attractive long - term market .
If global manufacturers can figure out how to make small , cheap cars in India , they are expected to start exporting them to other fast - growing markets where the proportion of car ownership remains small — places like Southeast Asia , Africa and the Middle East .
But first they have to conquer this market .
A. T. Kearney , an international management consulting firm , estimates that a car with a $ 3,000 list price could attract 300 million buyers in India by 2020 .
Of course , forecasters were bullish on China for decades before its growth finally took off .
And economic upheaval or political change could stall India ’s expected growth , too .
But the millions of Indians who will buy cars are likely to agree with Shuchita Bagga , who bought her first auto in July .
“ Budget was the most important thing , ” said Ms. Bagga , 26 , a trainee in human resources who earns about 375,000 rupees a year ( about $ 9,500 ) and paid a little more than 235,000 rupees ( $ 6,000 ) for it .
“ I ’m not in a position to buy a big or an expensive car . ”
In addition to new economy types like Ms. Bagga , car manufacturers are looking at India ’s approximately 65 million scooter owners , mostly men .
Currently , entire families commute on scooters , with the man of the house driving , his wife sitting side - saddle on the rear , and as many as three children wedged in between .
Suppose you hire a person to check groceries but , instead of doing so , he tells customers to put their items back on the shelves .
Do you fire him ?
Of course you do .
Now suppose we hire a president whose constitutional job description is to “ take care that the laws be faithfully executed . ”
Instead , he issues more than a thousand signing statements saying , in effect , he ’s not going to execute parts of the very laws he has signed .
Do we fire him ?
Of course we do .
Impeachment is not a political issue .
It ’s a constitutional issue .
The U.S. Constitution describes impeachment more fully and carefully than practically any other power delegated to Congress .
Impeachment is mentioned six times in the Constitution as the remedy for any misbehavior of our high officials .
Yes , President Clinton ’s impeachment was a political circus , but impeachment of President Bush is necessary to maintain our government ’s separation of powers , our checks and balances , our Constitution ’s integrity .
While The Oregonian ’s recent editorial ( ” The emptiness of impeachment , ” Sept. 29 ) opined that impeachment would be “ pointless , ” my view is that it is essential because , after all , the Constitution is the “ supreme law of the land . ”
What could be more important than preserving the rule of law ?
It is the bedrock of our democratic society .
Let me give you an example of a signing statement , this one issued on March 9 , 2006 , when Bush signed the renewal of the USA Patriot Act .
Part of the signing statement says : “ The executive branch shall construe the provisions . . . that call for furnishing information to entities outside the executive branch . . . in a manner consistent with the president ’s constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information . . . which could impair the deliberate process of the executive . ”
In other words , Congress cannot expect the reports of FBI activities that the law requires .
Not only will President Bush not enforce the law , but he also has told Congress to pound sand .
As The Oregonian points out , Congress has “ waived its own oversight responsibilities . ”
But just because Congress is weak - kneed does n’t mean that we ought not to require it to execute its constitutional duties — for the House to impeach and the Senate to try President Bush on the basis of his refusal to take care that the laws be faithfully executed .
There may not be much time left .
There may not be much political will among our elected representatives .
But this issue goes to the very heart of who we are as a people .
Either we are a nation of laws , or we are nothing .
President Bush has taken the oath of office prescribed for him in the Constitution : “ I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States , and will to the best of my ability , preserve , protect and defend the Constitution of the United States . ”
Instead , he has engaged in a concerted course of constitutional vandalism .
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said it best : “ Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter . ”

Romney endorses religious discrimination in government
Of all the presidential candidates , Mitt Romney should be the very last one to publicly endorse discrimination on the basis of religion .
He ’s a member of a religious minority , he ’s been the target of discrimination , and he ’s spent the better part of 2007 imploring Americans to judge public officials on their ideas and character .
To show prejudice on the basis of faith , Romney has said many times , is “ un-American . ”
And yet , there was Romney in Las Vegas recently , insisting that he would discriminate against a religious minority if he ’s elected president .
From a report in the Christian Science Monitor from diplomat Mansoor Ijaz :
I asked Mr. Romney whether he would consider including qualified Americans of the Islamic faith in his cabinet as advisers on national security matters , given his position that “ jihadism ” is the principal foreign policy threat facing America today .
He answered , “ … based on the numbers of American Muslims [ as a percentage ] in our population , I can not see that a cabinet position would be justified .
But of course , I would imagine that Muslims could serve at lower levels of my administration . ”
This is more than just offensive ; it ’s a special kind of stupid .
Indeed , Romney would likely have faced no flack at all if he ’d only said what was expected : “ When picking members of my cabinet , I will judge them exclusively on the basis of merit and qualifications . ”
It ’s not as if Republicans would respond , “ Hey !
If he ’s judging officials on their fitness for office , a Muslim might get a cabinet spot ! ”
But , no , Romney had to pander to the right ’s most crass instincts , and argue that Muslims do n’t deserve a cabinet position because they ’re a small religious minority .
It ’s painful to recognize , but in modern Republican circles , there is widespread tolerance for intolerance .
Open and unabashed discrimination towards certain Americans — Muslims and gays , among others — is not only acceptable to too many conservatives , it ’s expected .
It ’s why Romney ’s vow to discriminate against Muslims will probably not hurt him politically — given the ideology of the GOP base , it might even help him .
That said , his comments raise a few questions .
First , Jewish Americans represent a fairly small percentage of our population .
Does this mean that Romney would oppose cabinet positions for Jews , too ?
Second , by basing cabinet slots based on population percentages , is n’t Romney embracing a quota system ?
Third , if Romney supports quotas in employment , why did he say the exact opposite yesterday on CNN ?
BLITZER : The charge — the charge is that you have no diversity in your inner circle , no African - Americans who are really involved in your decision - making process .
ROMNEY : Well , I do have inner-circle members of my team that are African - American and also Hispanic - American and people of various backgrounds .
So , he just happens to be ill - informed .
But I also think that suggesting that we have to fill spots based on checking off boxes of various ethnic groups is really a very inappropriate way to think about how we staff positions .
I ’m very pleased that , among my Cabinet members , for instance , I had several African - American individuals .
I had people of different backgrounds .
But I do n’t go in every circumstance I ’m in and say , OK , how many African - Americans , how many Hispanic - Americans , how many Asian - Americans , and fill boxes that way .
I fill responsibilities based upon people ’s merit and their skill .
Fourth , Bush appointed Zalmay Khalilzad , a Muslim , to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations .
Why does Romney believe he should be automatically disqualified from a cabinet position ?
Fifth , can Romney not see an instance in which a Muslim cabinet official might be the ideal person to , as Mansoor Ijaz put it , “ engage America ’s Arab and Muslim communities and to help deter Islamist threats ” ?
And sixth , the Muslim percentage of the U.S. population is similar to the Mormon percentage of the U.S. population .
By Romney ’s logic , would n’t he also support discrimination against members of his own faith ?
Romney should be ashamed of himself .

The Tennessee Titans suspended in - person activities through Friday after the NFL says three Titans players and five personnel tested positive for the coronavirus , becoming the first COVID - 19 outbreak of the NFL season in Week 4 .
The outbreak threatened to jeopardize the Titans ' game this weekend against the Pittsburgh Steelers and posed the first significant in - season test to the league 's coronavirus protocols .
The NFL issued a statement Tuesday saying both the Titans and Minnesota Vikings suspended in - person activities Tuesday following the Titans ' test results .
VILLIERS-LE-BEL , France ( Reuters ) -
At least 40 French police were hurt late on Monday in running battles with scores of rioters in a suburb north of Paris where two youths died after a crash involving a police car .
During a second night of disturbances in Villiers - le - Bel and nearby areas , a local government official said one policeman was shot in the shoulder by some kind of firearm but was only slightly wounded .
A garbage truck and a police vehicle were among at least 36 vehicles torched late at night in the Val d’Oise area that includes Villiers and nearby districts also hit by the unrest , police and local officials said .
A Reuters witness said police were pelted with stones , petrol bombs and large firecrackers that exploded over their heads during hours of cat - and - mouse skirmishes with rioters .
Police replied with tear gas , rubber bullets and paint guns designed to identify troublemakers .
Spent cartridges and rocks thrown by rioters littered the streets .
Injured officers were given treatment in a local fire station used by police as a base .
One , his face bloodied , had his arm in a sling .
Officials said 40 officers were slightly hurt , though three officers needed hospital treatment .
Local mayor Didier Vaillant , who had earlier called for calm , said airguns had been fired at police .
“ It looks like it ’s going to be a long night , ” he said .
The violence revived memories of the 2005 riots in France ’s poor , often ethnically diverse , housing estates .
In that unrest thousands of cars were torched after two teenagers were accidentally electrocuted when they climbed into a power sub-station while apparently fleeing police .

Extra police had been drafted into Villiers - le - Bel on Monday in case of a repeat of disturbances on Sunday , sparked by the deaths of two youths whose moped collided with a police car .
Officials said 28 cars and five buildings were set ablaze , including a police station , in violence that injured 26 police and fire officers .
Nine people were arrested on Sunday .
CALLS FOR CALM
President Nicolas Sarkozy was interior minister during the 2005 riots , when he took a tough line with the rioters which critics said helped stoke the violence .
On Monday , the head of state called for calm .
“ I call on everyone to calm down and let the justice system decide who was responsible , ” Sarkozy told reporters during an official visit to Beijing .
Police have launched an investigation into Sunday ’s accident , which involved a police car and a moped driven by youths aged 15 and 16 .
Police say the moped was stolen and the teenagers ignored traffic regulations .
The investigation will focus on whether the two officers helped the dying youths .
Relatives and locals complained the police fled the scene after the incident .

Local public prosecutor Marie - Therese de Givry told LCI television the crash investigator ’s preliminary findings showed the youngsters had turned into the path of the police vehicle .
“ The mini-moto was in third gear , which means it was going at top speed , ” she said .
“ That ’s what the expert report says , which confirms the statement by the driver of the police vehicle as well as that of two witnesses . ”
The officers had immediately called the emergency services .
Tapes of the calls and subsequent radio traffic would be studied to see if police followed the correct procedures , she said .
Local inhabitants of the Villiers - le - Bel estate contested that version of events .
“ That they say it was an accident , when they ran away , -- ran away , I say -- that ’s unacceptable for those who represent the law , ” Slimane Erraji , uncle of one of the dead , told LCI .
You want to see the real - world problems with right - wing extremism ?
Here 's a good example from Big Sky Country .
With Montana facing major wildfires , senior Montana Republican lawmaker John Sinrud - who heads the state House 's appropriations committee - used a legislative hearing this week to attack Gov. Brian Schweitzer 's ( D ) administration for - get ready for this - trying to prevent homes and buildings from being burnt down .
At the hearing , he asks " Why not just let [ buildings ] burn ? "
Ah yes , what a refreshing dose of " compassionate " conservatism .
You can listen to the audio yourself ( which was also posted by Kos this morning ) .
But there 's an even bigger backstory to all this that makes this offensive statement worse .
See the extended entry for what I mean .
The Helena Independent Record last week reported that Schweitzer is being forced to call an emergency legislative session ( at a cost of $ 65,000 per day ) in order to obtain more firefighting money because Republicans like Sinrud previously rejected his efforts to add that money to the budget - all while they advocated for massive tax cuts for out - of - state corporations .
The Montana GOP has responded by writing letters to the editor claiming Schweitzer is lying , though the Great Falls Tribune editorial board debunks that claim entirely - showing that it is the GOP that is lying .
Here 's an excerpt :
" Gov. Brian Schweitzer called Thursday to advocate on behalf of his appropriation request in the special legislative session he called for this Wednesday in Helena .
He rightly disputed claims in a letter to the editor by Rep. Rick Ripley , R - Wolf Creek , that the governor had never requested $ 25 million for fires .
The amount is in Schweitzer 's original budget , and it was in a bill that was killed , on a party - line vote , by the Appropriations Committee on which Ripley sits .
The session is needed , Schweitzer said , because ' we 've got bills to pay ' -- totaling about $ 34 million -- and the Legislature wo n't otherwise meet until 2009 .
' I can't say to contractors , ' We 're out of money , sorry . ' " ( emphasis NOT added - it was in the original editorial ) .
So , to review .
The Montana Republican Party is now on record A ) Attacking Montana state government for trying to stop buildings and homes from being burnt down B ) Rejecting money to better fund firefighting while pushing massive tax cuts for out - of - state corporations and C ) Lying about rejecting money to better fund firefighting .
I guess the best thing you could say about Sinrud after this is that at least he did n't use profanity , like his colleague Rep. Michael Lange ( R ) infamously did a few months ago .
That said , most people will probably find his desire to see Montana homes and buildings burn down even more offensive than Lange 's temper tantrum .
This has been your daily example of right - wing extremism - and its destructive consequences .

They say he ’s the only one who can beat the Democrats in ’ 08 , the only one who ’s tough enough to take on Hillary and keep the White House for the GOP , but the truth is quite the opposite .
With at least two major scandals brewing under the surface , in addition to his other distinctively un-Republican peccadilloes , Rudy is the candidate with the biggest glass jaw of them all .
The slow - burning fuse of the controversy surrounding the lack of functioning radios for the New York City firemen who suffered such heavy losses on 9/11 has already been lit by the grieving  and angry  families of those who died .
The firemen ’s union is going to harry the Giuliani campaign until the whole , sordid story of how a no - bid contract with Motorola and that company ’s cozy relationship with Giuliani led to the deaths of so many  the very ones whom Giuliani invokes as key actors in his 9/11 narrative , whose heroism he bathes in as if it would rub off .
The media is n’t covering it yet , but the firefighters are n’t going to let go of this one : hubris invites nemesis , as the ancient Greeks correctly believed , and in Giuliani ’s case , it ’s just a question of when his nemesis is going to appear  before the Republican convention or after .
However , the trial of Bernie Kerik , a former Giuliani protégé charged with 16 counts of fraud , conspiracy , and lying on his federal disclosure forms , has a much shorter fuse and packs much more explosive potential .
The indictment [ .pdf ] of Kerik , which I wrote about here , was long expected : the one surprise was a count of lying on his financial disclosure forms when he was being vetted for various positions with the federal government .
Kerik failed to report a $ 250,000 " loan " from a mysterious Israeli billionaire , which had been laundered through a Brooklyn businessman .
As the indictment puts it :
" On or about June 13 , 2003 , ‘ John Doe # 7 , ’ a Brooklyn businessman , made a personal loan of $ 250,000 to Bernard B. Kerik ( ‘ the John Doe # 7 loan ’ ) .
As Kerik well knew , John Doe # 7 obtained the funds with which to make the loan to Kerik by in turn taking a loan from ‘ John Doe # 8 , ’ a wealthy Israeli industrialist whose companies did business with the federal government . "
It turns out that John Doe # 8 is Eitan Wertheimer , the richest man in Israel , whose Iscar Metalworking Companies  recently acquired by Warren Buffet for $ 4 billion  makes precision metal - cutting tools .
Iscar maintains a global network of metalworking facilities , from Tefen , Israel , to the U.S. , Germany , Italy , Japan , Korea , China , India , and Brazil .
Wertheimer passed the money to one Shimon Cohen , " John Doe # 7 , " a Brooklyn dealer in marble and stone , who then handed it off , in the form of a " loan , " to Kerik .
Dan Janison , writing in Newsday ‘s Spin Cycle blog , puts this train of circumstances into perspective :
" A lingering question : Why would Cohen , described as a pal of Kerik , front the loan for Wertheimer as opposed to a direct transaction ?
Another question :
Where did Kerik , who investigators portray as chronically in search of cash , get the funds to pay back the loan ?
Wertheimer is described in the indictment as having done business with the federal government . "
They knew they were doing something wrong .
Why else try to launder the money through Cohen ?
Wertheimer , as the indictment says , " does business with the federal government " : Iscar has government contracts with the Department of Defense .
What ’s interesting , however , is that at the time the " loan " was made , Kerik was being vetted by federal investigators because of his appointment to the post of chief trainer of the Iraqi police  you know , the same police who turned out to be little more than Shi’ite death squads .
In the atmosphere of New York City politics , such " loans " are part of the political culture , i.e. , the culture of corruption that flourished under the Giuliani administration .
The same sort of shenanigans led to the deaths of all those firemen on 9/11 : a sweetheart deal between the city of New York and Motorola , which left the firefighters without working radios on that fateful day .
In the case of Wertheimer ’s attempted bribery , however , it does n’t look like an ordinary case of venality and corruption .
After all , what did Wertheimer think he was getting for his money ?
Wertheimer ’s motive is murky , at best , but his politics are certainly in sync with Giuliani’s .
He appeared on the same stage with Christian Zionist nut John Hagee at the last AIPAC policy conference , where he touted the success of Iscar as Israel ’s success story .
AIPAC , you ’ll recall , is currently enmeshed in a messy spy scandal , with the trial of the group ’s former head honcho , Steve Rosen , and his sidekick , Keith Weissman , scheduled for mid-January .
The charge : filching U.S. secrets on Israel ’s behalf .
And what about Janison ’s fascinating final question : where did Kerik get the money to pay back the " loan " days after it was discovered by city investigators ?
The Kerik - Giuliani-Wertheimer connection goes all the way back to 2001 , when Wertheimer was appointed " honorary police commissioner " by Kerik .
Among the other honorary appointees was Judith Regan , Kerik ’s former lover and publisher .
Regan is now alleging , in a $ 100 million lawsuit against her former employers in the Murdoch media conglomerate , that at least two Murdoch executives urged her to " lie and withhold information " from government investigators to " protect Giuliani ’s presidential ambitions . "
Fox News , the jewel in the crown of the Murdoch media empire , has not exactly been shy about its partiality for Giuliani .
The Kerik case has all the ingredients of a real courtroom potboiler : money , illicit sex , political corruption , and , quite possibly , an attempt to unduly influence U.S. operations in Iraq on behalf of a foreign power .
Perhaps our somnolent press corps will wake up long enough to ask Rudy if he can shed any light on these matters .
Kerik was and is Giuliani ’s man , no matter how energetically he tries to paddle away from his former pal .
The Mayor of 9/11 not only personally lobbied for his protégé ’s appointment as head of the newly created Department of Homeland Security , he was the chief promoter of the cult of Bernie Kerik , the tough guy from the wrong side of the tracks who made it big .
A movie was in the works , and as Kerik cashed that $ 250,000 check from Cohen , he was riding high .
The irony is that his meteoric rise and fall may limn the arc of Giuliani ’s political career .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I want to thank everyone who gave during this very difficult fundraising campaign  and , yes , we ’re almost there .
But not quite .
We ’re still a few thousand short of our $ 70,000 goal , and , while I ca n’t threaten you with all sorts of dire consequences if we do n’t make up the shortfall , I can say that it would be very good , and gratifying as all get - out , if you would pitch in for one final effort to put us over the top by making your contribution today .
October 5 , 2007
Since 2005 , the Bush administration has produced at least three secret orders and memoranda justifying extreme interrogation methods banned under international law as forms of torture , according to a newspaper report published on Thursday .
The existence of the memos was revealed in a New York Times article ( " Secret US Endorsement of Severe Interrogations , " by Scott Shane , David Johnston , and James Risen ) published on Thursday .
None of these opinions or memos have been released to the public .
The authors highlight the attempt by Justice Department lawyers , under the leadership of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , to conceal the illegal actions of the administration and allow its policy to continue despite an unfavorable Supreme Court ruling and a bill prohibiting " cruel , inhuman and degrading " treatment .
One memo , a Justice Department legal opinion , was approved by Gonzales shortly after taking the post of attorney general in February 2005 .
It was " an expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency , " the Times reports , citing unnamed officials briefed on the memo .
The memo authorized the use in combination of several torture techniques .
" The new opinion , the officials said , for the first time provided explicit authorization to barrage terror suspects with a combination of painful physical and psychological tactics , including head - slapping , simulated drowning and frigid temperatures . "
Another opinion was issued later that year declaring that none of the methods used by the CIA constituted " cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment , " and in 2006 Bush signed an executive order authorizing " enhanced interrogation techniques . "
According to the Times , the CIA is once again holding prisoners in secret overseas prisons .
Some prisoners who had been held in these torture facilities were transferred to Guant�namo Bay in 2005 .
These findings and memos have their roots in disputes that emerged within the political establishment surrounding the administration�s assertion of virtual dictatorial powers for the president .
Memos arguing for these powers were produced immediately after the September 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks by a group of officials that included Vice President Dick Cheney �s legal counsel David Addington , then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales , and then - Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo .
The opinions expressed an open contempt for international law and constitutional constraints on executive power .
They asserted , among other things , that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the " war on terror , " that the president can detain anyone ( including a US citizen ) indefinitely and subject him or her to drumhead military commissions , and that the president can spy on the population without a warrant .
The most infamous of these memoranda , however , was the " torture memo , " written largely by Yoo .
The memo gave an extremely narrow definition of torture , while at the same time declaring that the president has the power to order torture as commander - in - chief .
According to this theory , any law that abridges this power is unconstitutional .
The Times article makes clear that this original opinion is still the guiding doctrine of the administration .
In April 2004 , the revelations and photographs of outrageous torture and sexual abuse at Abu Ghraib prison were published in the media , and in June of that year the " torture memo " was leaked .
The resulting international public outrage generated concerns within sections of the American ruling elite , including within the Bush administration , that open arguments for torture were undermining the occupation of Iraq and the legitimacy of the American government .
A number of officials in the Justice Department started questioning certain aspects of the administration�s prior arguments .
These included Jack Goldsmith , appointed in 2003 to head the Office of Legal Counsel , and James Comey , who became deputy attorney general in December 2003 .
While Goldsmith was a close associate of Yoo with ties to the right - wing Federalist Society , he began to question certain aspects of the theory of unconstrained executive power that had been developed over the previous two years .
The " torture memo " was officialy withdrawn in June 2004 , and was later replaced by one declaring that torture is " abhorrent . "
According to the New York Times , the Justice Department was " wrenched back into line " with the resignation later that year of Ashcroft , who was replaced by Gonzales in February 2005 .
In June 2005 , Steven Bradbury replaced Goldsmith as head of the Office of Legal Counsel .
Bradbury , whose legal views were close to those of Addington and Yoo , was , according to the Times , selected only after he had proven himself .
" White House officials , still smarting from Mr. Goldsmith�s rebuffs , chose to delay his nomination , " the Times reports .
" Harriet E. Miers , the new White House counsel , ' decided to watch Bradbury for a month or two .
He was sort of on trial , � one Justice Department official recalled . "
Bradbury followed the memo written by Gonzales in early 2005 on CIA techniques with one of his own in late 2005 .
At the time , Senator John McCain was pushing for a bill that would nominally outlaw torture and " cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . "
This language was eventually included in the December 2005 Defense Authorization bill , after McCain reached a compromise with the Bush administration .
As the World Socialist Web Site wrote at the time , and the Times article substantiates , the bill was " a ploy to cover up Washington�s past defiance of international laws banning torture and provide a pseudo - legal cover for the continuation of the same methods . "
( See " McCain - Bush ' anti- torture � measure gives legal cover for continued abuse " ) .
There were no explicit prohibitions of any torture methods in the bill .
However , according to the Times article , " At least a few administration officials argued that no reasonable interpretation of ' cruel , inhuman or degrading � would permit the most extreme CIA methods , like waterboarding . "
Bradbury�s task was to generate an unreasonable interpretation that would permit these methods .
The administration required such a legal finding for a number of reasons .
First , it wanted to continue using these techniques and preserve its expansive interpretation of executive power .
Second , top administration officials needed a legal cover for their blatantly illegal acts , fearing the possibility of prosecution .
The Times writes , " Mr. Bradbury was placed in a tough spot , said Mr. [ Philip ]
Zelikow , the State Department counselor , who was working at the time to rein in interrogation policy .
' If Justice says some practices are in violation of the CID standard , � Mr. Zelikow said , referring to cruel , inhuman or degrading , ' then they are now saying that officials broke current law . � "
The Times presents this as primarily a concern originating from CIA officers .
However , if the CIA officers are guilty of crimes , so too are those who ordered them to commit these crimes .
" In the end , Mr. Bradbury �s opinion delivered what the White House wanted : a statement that the standard proposed by Mr. McCain�s Detainee Treatment
Act would not force any change in the CIA�s practices , according to officials familiar with the memo , " the Times reports .
The administration suffered a setback in June 2006 , when the Supreme Court struck down the military commissions established after September 11 and ruled that all prisoners held by the US , including presumed Al Qaeda members held by the CIA , are protected by the Geneva Conventions � prohibition of torture and cruel treatment .
This again raised the question of the administration�s violation of international and domestic law .
According to the Times , " [ I ] n July , after a monthlong debate inside the administration , President Bush signed a new executive order authorizing the use of what the administration calls ' enhanced � interrogation techniques �the details remain secret �and officials say the CIA again is holding prisoners in ' black sites� overseas .
The executive order was reviewed and approved by Mr. Bradbury and the Office of Legal Counsel . "
The Supreme Court case also led to the passage of the Military Commissions Act in October 2006 , which gave congressional approval to the Bush administration�s policy of torture , indefinite detention and drumhead tribunals , while shielding it from prosecution .
It gave the president explicit authority to " interpret " the Geneva Conventions , which served to bolster the earlier executive order referred to by the Times .
On Thursday , administration officials issued statements declaring that the US " does not torture . "
These statements have no more credibility than those made repeatedly in the past .
The determination by the Bush administration to continue its policy of torture has nothing to do with a supposed " war on terror , " as is presented by the Times and the media as a whole .
The attack on democratic rights has its roots in the policy of the American ruling elite , which has provoked and will continue to provoke massive opposition around the world , including in the United States .
The methods of torture are ultimately directed against anyone who comes into conflict with this policy .
Throughout the period covered in the Times article , the Democratic Party has been entirely complicit , facilitating the policy of torture and covering up its real significance from the American people .
Democrats refused to filibuster Gonzales when he was nominated for attorney general , in spite of his known involvement in the production of the " torture memo . "
They also helped pass the Military Commissions Act .
This complicity is again on display with Bush�s nomination of Michael Mukasey for attorney general to replace the outgoing Alberto Gonzales .
Mukasey is a strong supporter of state power .
In one of the most important cases before him as judge on the US District Court for the Southern District of New York , Mukasey ruled that Jose Padilla , a US citizen , could be held indefinitely by the military .
Padilla was subsequently tortured during his three - and - a - half years of military confinement .
Leading Democrats have announced that they will not make any attempt to block the nomination of Mukasey .
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy said on Wednesday that he was dropping any suggestion that the confirmation would be blocked until the White House turned over documents relating to the firing of US attorneys and the Bush administration�s warrantless wiretapping program .
The program to research and develop the atomic bomb was n't called " The Manhattan Project " for nothing ; much of the early work to build a nuclear weapon was done right here in New York City .
The Times is running a cute atomic travelogue today .
That gives me an excuse to point back to my favorite character from New York 's nuclear age , Tom Dowd .
It 's safe to say that , of all the people who helped build the first atomic bomb , Tom Dowd was the only one to make records with
Eric Clapton , Ray Charles , Aretha Franklin , John Coltrane , and the Allman Brothers Band .
Here 's a snippet from the obituary I wrote for him , back in 2002 .
Dowd grew up in Manhattan , the son of a singer and a theater producer .
He studied the violin , the piano and the tuba .
But he wanted to become an engineer .
After graduating from a science high school program at 16 , he got a night job at the Columbia University physics department while he took classes at City College of New York .
By helping run the cyclotron – the machine that speeds up charged atomic particles – Dowd became involved in the nascent American effort to build an atomic bomb – the Manhattan Project .
After the war , Dowd could n't get a job as a physicist ; his work at Columbia and the clandestine atomic research facility in Los Alamos , New Mexico , remained a secret .
So he turned to music for work .
He became a recording engineer in 1947 – and quickly developed a name as a technical mastermind as he worked with such jazz giants as Dizzy
Gillespie and Charlie Parker .
" Having worked with such sophisticated electronic equipment ( in the Manhattan Project ) , and being musically sensitive , recording was child 's play , " Dowd told Mix magazine .
A longer Dowd bio is here .
And there 's a sweet documentary about the man , Tom Dowd and the Language of Music , that includes much of his Manhattan Project history – and a live remix of " Layla , " straight from the master tapes .
Sun Microsystems has been issued an interesting patent for a " magneto-hydrodynamic " heatsink packed in a closed fluid system .
The device , spotted by tgdaily , uses tiny magnetic fields to pump electrically conductive fluid towards and away from hot spots on a CPU .
The electric current is dependent on a temperate sensor on the top , which sends liquid where it needs to go .
The heatsink , of course , contains plenty of shielding to protect itself and the computer from magnetic interference .
The design would eliminate moving parts found in a traditional heatsink , and should be virtually silent .
A closed system would also eliminate most of the difficulties of setting up a modern water cooling kit .
Sun 's patent was filed in September 2005 , and awarded in September 2007 .
Chien Ouyang is credited as the inventor .
A copy of the patent is available at the US Patent & Trademark Office website .
Fortress European Union
November 22 , 2007 at 3:00 am thinkingshift
Mmmmm ….. well maybe I was a bit hasty with my Fortress Britain post when I said that the UK was fast becoming a police state , surveillance society , fortress – take your pick .
Because like a seasoned galloper in a horse race , the European Union ( EU ) has burst forth with its own plans to become a locked - down space .
The EU has just unveiled new measures that could make Gordon Brown jealous .
Draft laws propose that use of the internet be criminalised if used to incite or recruit for acts of terrorism and passenger lists for airlines flying into or out of the EU will have to be coughed up by the airlines .
And …passenger list data will be stored for 13 years ( 13 ? why 13 – is this some magical number ? ) .
Apparently , the European Commissioner for Justice and Security thinks the internet is a pretty suspicious place because it breeds international terrorists .
Hello !
There were “ terrorists ” way before the internet .
I ’m sure the British would say that the IRA and their campaigns in England in the 1970s might have fallen into the category of “ terrorist activity ” .
And the Commish says that : “ Those telling others how to commit acts of destruction – with a clear terrorist intention – should be put behind bars .
Be it on the internet or print “ .
Now , I would n’t for one hop onto a plane brandishing a manual in Arabic on how to fly a plane , but Mr Commish might have forgotten that there are many , many books published over the years that have never managed to get their authors thrown into jail .
For example , I read Hayduke Lives ! by Edward Abbey way back in the early 1990s .
Check out the illustrated front cover of the book here on Amazon – it is a man ’s hand holding several sticks of dynamite .
I remember really liking this novel about George Washington Hayduke III ( who nearly carked it in an earlier novel ) .
He runs around blowing up bridges or anything that ruins the pristine beauty of a landscape filled with deep canyons and sprawling deserts .
In other words , Hayduke is an environmental activist using violent means to protect nature .
Last time I heard , Abbey ( who died I think in the mid-90s ) did n’t get hauled off to jail for inciting environmental terrorism .
Clearly , reading the “ wrong thing ” in public from some “ forbidden library ” of books might land you in trouble these days .
US airport screeners pounced on the Electronic Frontier Foundation ’s co-founder , John Gilmore , recently because he was reading a book entitled “ Drugs and Your Rights ” .
And here is the book he was reading – part of a Cambridge University series in studies in philosophy and public policy .
John Gilmore is a civil libertarian not some dangerous drug smuggler .
As Gilmore says : ” The Gestapo cared what works of philosophy you were reading .
So did the Stasi .
Those of you who live in free countries may find it a bit hard to understand why any populace would n’t tear to bits any bureaucrats that would take away the fundamental right to read whatever you like without it being used to determine how your government treats you as you cross borders or travel within your own country “ .
Instead of hauling hapless travellers aside because their book might look suspicious , it might be a better use of time if officials considered the plight of individuals who are persecuted because of the writings they produce or circulate .
Two prominent Egyptian bloggers for example , Abdul Karim Nabeil Suleiman and Abdel Moneim Mahmoud , have been arrested over their blogging activities or writings .
And if you do n’t think that you could get a visit from the FBI or ASIO ( Australia ) because of what you ’re seen to be reading in public – check out this article on Creative Loafing .
Back to the EU : just like the UK , the EU will collect information about you such as name , passport number , address , credit card details , email address and phone numbers .
And in the most sensible observation I ’ve seen in awhile , Syed Kamall , a Conservative MEP stated : “ This is just another extension of the surveillance society being built across Europe .
If we continue to remove people ’s basic liberties in this way , the terrorists will have won “ .

A newly study commissioned by Industry Canada , which includes some of the most extensive surveying to date of the Canadian population on music purchasing habits , finds what many have long suspected ( though CRIA has denied ) – there is a positive correlation between peer - to - peer downloading and CD purchasing .
The Impact of Music Downloads and P2P File - Sharing on the Purchase of Music : A Study For Industry Canada was conducted collaboratively by two professors from the University of London , Industry Canada , and Decima Research , who surveyed over 2,000 Canadians on their music downloading and purchasing habits .
The authors believe this is the first ever empirical study to employ representative microeconomic data .
The two key findings :
When assessing the P2P downloading population , there was " a strong positive relationship between P2P file sharing and CD purchasing .
That is , among Canadians actually engaged in it , P2P file sharing increases CD purchases . "
The study estimates that 12 additional P2P downloads per month increases music purchasing by 0.44 CDs per year .
When viewed in the aggreggate ( ie. the entire Canadian population ) , there is no direct relationship between P2P file sharing and CD purchases in Canada .
According to the study authors , " the analysis of the entire Canadian population does not uncover either a positive or negative relationship between the number of files downloaded from P2P networks and CDs purchased .
That is , we find no direct evidence to suggest that the net effect of P2P file sharing on CD purchasing is either positive or negative for Canada as a whole . "
Bear in mind , this is not a study with a particular desired outcome or sponsor – it is the government commissioning independent research to help it make better policy decisions .
The results of that research , consistent with earlier Canadian Heritage sponsored study by Shelley Stein - Sacks that refused to blame P2P for the industry 's problems , is that P2P actually increases CD sales since those that download also tend to buy more music .
The study also addresses a number of other frequently discussed issues .
It finds that :
there was no statistically significant relationship between P2P downloads and digital download purchases from stores such as iTunes .
In other words , P2P downloads neither increase nor decrease the likelihood of such purchases .
CD prices have little impact on CD purchases , though there was some indirect evidence of pricing being factored into those that P2P file share .
people who buy digital downloads are not less likely to buy CDs
people who own MP3 players are less likely to buy CDs
people who buy large numbers of DVDs , videogames , cinema and concert tickets also buy a higher number of CDs .
In other words , consumers of entertainment consume more entertainment , not less .
household income has no statistically significant effect on CD or digital download purchases
The study is a tough read for the non-economist , yet given the breadth of its data and the importance of its findings , it is a must - read .
When combined with the income generated from the private copying levy , much of which is seemingly linked to P2P copying , it becomes increasingly clear that the industry has benefited from P2P and that there is no " emergency " that necessitates legislative intervention .
Update : Jack Kapica of the Globe and Mail provides additional coverage of the study and its policy implications .
‘ Dust ’ , a proposal for a large scale sculpture , received a Rhizome commission in June 2011
‘ Dust ’ is a 1:1 scale replica of one of the most played computer game maps in the world .
The idea is to build the 3D model of ‘ de_dust ’ of the first person shooter game ‘ Counter Strike ’ as a permanent ‘ building ’ from concrete , making this map accessible as a large scale public sculpture .
Computer games differ from other mediums such as books , movies or TV , in that spatial cognition is a crucial aspect in computer games .
To win a game the player needs to know the 3D game space very very well .
Spatial recognition and remembrance is an important part of our human capability and has formed over millions of years by evolution .
A place , house or space inscribes itself in our spatial memory .
We can talk about the qualities of the same movies we watched or books we have read .
But millions of gamers experienced the same worlds in computer games .
They all remember very well the spaces that they ’ve spent a great deal of time in .
Computer game architecture and game maps have become a new and yet undiscovered form of cultural heritage .
How many people in the world have seen the real Time Square , the Kaaba in Mecca or the Tiananmen Square with their own eyes ?
Millions of players share the experience of the same computer games and 3D spaces they have ‘ lived ’ in for a significant amount of time in their lives .
A computer game map like ‘ de_dust ’ appears to be more real than many other places in the world such as artificially constructed places like supermarkets , airports or cities like Dubai .
Unlike current computer games ( with their endless worlds and terrains ) , game spaces of the 1990 ’s were still limited in size due to graphic card and processor power limitations .
A respectively small and simple map like ‘ de_dust ’ offered a high density of team play with repetitive endless variations .
Made from concrete in 1:1 scale , the map becomes an art piece and a museum for a game at the same time .
Visitors are invited to take a walk in materialized virtuality and experience the loaded game space in the physical reality .
In a level of abstraction all parts of the map will be made from concrete ( no color or textures ) and will represent a petrified moment of cultural game space heritage .
Aram Bartholl 2011
“ Today Dust is – according to the statistics – one of the most played maps in the world , and certainly racks up a remarkable amount of multi player time .
Some say the reason for Dust ’s success was its simplicity .
Others say it ’s due to how balanced it is .
In reality , the two are closely linked – the simpler a map is , the easier it is to balance .
In essence , it ’s hard to make a simple map play badly . ”

UK : Parents face £ 1,000 fine in truancy crackdown
The Telegraph ^ | 9/4/2007 | Graeme Paton
Posted on by bruinbirdman
Parents face fines of up to £ 1,000 if they allow their children to roam the streets after they have been thrown out of school .
The penalties - which come into force for the first time this week - are part of a new crackdown on soaring truancy rates and bad behaviour .
Parents of pupils suspended from school will also be hauled before headteachers for a " reintegration interview " before their child is allowed back into the classroom .
Ed Balls , the Children 's Secretary , said he wanted parents to take responsibility for their children 's behaviour .
" Good discipline and strong leadership are vital for driving up standards in our schools , " he said .
" But schools can only do so much in isolation .
Parents have to be responsible for instilling right and wrong too .
" Our measures help to build strong and supportive partnerships between parents and teachers that will create a more united front against poor behaviour .
" I want heads to engage with parents , including using parenting contracts at an early stage so that schools and parents are able to work together to prevent bad behaviour from escalating .
" It is also important that parents take a central role when a child is excluded - making sure they are at home working , rather than treating the exclusion as a holiday or an excuse to wander the streets . "
Under laws - first announced in the Education Bill last year - parents can be hit with fines of £ 50 if their children are found in a public place without justification in the first five days of an exclusion .
The fine will rise to £ 100 if it is not paid within 28 days and if parents do not pay up after 42 days they face prosecution and a possible £ 1,000 fine .
The reforms also allow headteachers to require parents to sign " contracts " governing the behaviour of their children even before pupils have been excluded .
Mr Balls said it was right that , in the " rare cases " where parents " persistently obstruct or fail to work with schools on their child 's behaviour " , heads could seek parenting orders from the courts .
Parenting orders enforce the terms of a parenting contract .
If parents fail to comply with the order , they face being fined .
However , the proposals were attacked by the Conservatives , who said that headteachers should have more power to expel pupils .
In the past , there has been criticism that some decisions by heads to expel pupils have been overturned on appeal .
Michael Gove , shadow children 's secretary , said : " Let 's not kid ourselves that these measures , welcome as they are , do anything like enough to solve the behaviour problem in our schools .
" You can't have a proper discipline policy unless heads are free to exclude disruptive pupils without being second - guessed .
And children who 've been excluded should n't be left to sink or swim .
They need a tough love regime to turn round their behaviour and get their lives back on track . "
Meanwhile , the Government also announced today that all secondary school children will have lessons in " happiness " and emotional wellbeing to help improve discipline in the classroom .
Mr Balls unveiled a £ 7 million - a- year initiative to expand lessons to older pupils following a successful pilot in primary schools .

Backass backwards .
I thought kids were the responsibility of their parents .
I know this is the UK ; but we hear everyday of rights of citizens being eroded both here and other countries .
Does or does n’t our government have the power to rule citizens ?
I do n’t believe so .

So after posting
Interestingly , I do n't hear the word " refactoring " a lot in Lisp circles .
Why ?
yesterday in my blog entry about intentional programming , I was browsing Planet Lisp and saw Glen Ehrlich 's blog entry about Tayssir John Gabbour posting some of Antonio Menezes Leitao 's papers on the ALU site ( how 's that for a twisted chain of references , eh ? ) .
Of course , one of the papers was titled " A Formal Pattern Language for Refactoring of Lisp Programs . "
So , there you go .
I guess people do talk about refactoring in Lisp circles , just not very often .
Tayssir also wrote me an email and said that Kiczales started a company , Intentional Software , with Simonyi , but has since left .
The links are starting to become more clear now , I guess .
It looks like at least some of the Intentional Programming ideas came from Lisp systems , with some extension to abstract away from Lisp specifically .
I enjoy lurking in obscure IRC channels and often have been amazed how many people I met there I already knew from some other channel .
Today , this happened again , so I just had to map all language channels I could find on Freenode and make a diagram of their relationships .
I tried to find all language - specific general channels , and came up with these : # perl , # #c , # python , # # c ++ , #ruby - lang , #haskell , # bash , #lisp , # # java ## # javascript , # perl6 , # scheme , #erlang , #ruby , #latex , #lua , #d , #asm , #zsh ##tcl , #ocaml , #fpc , # io , #awk , #sed , # forth , # scala , #ada , #dylan , #sml , and #!/bin/sh .
I also added #rubyonrails , # concatenative , #esoteric , #oasis , #haskell - blah , #ruby - de , #camping , and #rack , which are not really general language channels but interesting to see .
After frustration with R ( I first wanted to make a kind - of heatmap ) , I decided to use GraphViz ’s fdp .
Here ’s the preview of the map ( click for fullsize , beware : 1833x2084px ) :
If you want to print it , there also is a PostScript version .
The font - sizes are logarithmic , legend for the edges :
If 45 % of the smaller channel are in the other channel , there is a bold line .
If 25 % of the smaller channel are in the other channel , there is a solid line .
If 10 % of the smaller channel are in the other channel , there is a dotted line .
Enjoy .
At a time when encroaching human development in former wildlife areas has compressed African elephants into ever smaller home ranges and increased levels of human - elephant conflict , a study in the October 9th issue of Current Biology , a publication of Cell Press , suggests that strategically placed beehives might offer a low - tech elephant deterrent and conservation measure .
The researchers found that a significant majority of African elephants fled immediately after hearing the sound of bees , providing “ strong support ” for the idea that bees , and perhaps even their buzz alone , might keep elephants at bay .
By contrast , the elephants ignored a control recording of natural white - noise , the authors reported .
“ We were n’t surprised that they responded to the threatening sound of disturbed bees , as elephants are intelligent animals that are intimately aware of their surroundings , but we were surprised at how quickly they responded to the sounds by running away , ” said Lucy King of the University of Oxford .
“ Almost half of our study herds started to move away within 10 seconds of the bee playback . ”
King is also affiliated with Save the Elephants , a Kenya - based organization that aims to secure a future for elephants .
Earlier studies had suggested that elephants prefer to steer clear of bees .
For instance , one report showed that elephant damage to acacia trees hosting occupied or empty beehives was significantly less than in trees without hives , the researchers said .
In Zimbabwe , scientists have also seen elephants forging new trails in an effort to avoid beehives .
In the new study , the researchers tested the response of several well - known elephant families in Kenya to the digitally recorded buzz of disturbed African bees .
Sixteen of the 17 families tested left their resting places under trees within 80 s of hearing the bee sound , the researchers reported , and half responded within just 10 seconds .
Among elephants hearing the control sound , none had moved after 10 s , and only four families had moved after 80 s .
By the end of the 4 min sound playback of bee buzz , only one elephant family had failed to move , whereas eight families hearing the control sound had not moved .
This behavioral discovery suggests that bees might very well be a valuable addition to the toolbox of elephant deterrents used by farmers and conservation managers across Kenya , King said .
She added that such innovative approaches are sorely needed “ to avoid extreme solutions such as shooting problem animals . ”
She cautioned that the use of beehives to shoo elephants away might prove to have limited application and that more research is needed if we are to understand its effectiveness .
“ But if we could use bees to reduce elephant crop raiding and tree destruction while at the same time enhancing local income through the sale of honey , this could be a significant and valuable step towards sustainable human - elephant coexistence . ”

Software excellence
We are a bit fanatical when it comes to delivering software .
We ’re serious about our craft and are always striving to improve the way we do things .
And we like to push the industry as a whole to improve .
This is a central tenet of our software excellence mission .
We believe that software quality is driven by open communication , review and collaboration .
That ’s why we ’re such vehement supporters of open source and have been throughout our history .
Open source enables us to build superior solutions to those based on proprietary software in terms of cost , freedom , privacy , security , quality and community .
Building open source allows us to pay it forward , share new ways of working , and learn from the wider community .
I did n’t immediately recognize the equation that Steve Knight used in his answer to problem 6 of the Euler Project , but it was in fact just the formula for an arithmetic series .
This one ’s actually pretty easy to come to from an intuitive standpoint .
The story goes that Gauss had one of the meanest school teachers in the world .
He made all of the students add the whole numbers from one to one hundred .
The children would work for hours scratching away on their little chalk boards trying to get the answer , but Gauss was too lazy for that .
He scribbled the answer and threw the chalk board across the room and said , “ there it lies . ”
What he had done was simplified the problem .
If you take the numbers from 1 to 50 and pair them up with the numbers 100 to 51 , you get a series of sums : 1 + 100 , 2 + 99 , … , 49 + 52 , 50 + 51 .
All of these add up to 101 .
To get the answer he simply multiplied 101 by 50 .
Generalizing this technique , to add up the first n natural numbers , you multiply half of n with n plus one … which is ( n / 2 ) * ( n + 1 ) .
Algebraically , this “ simplifies ” to [ n( n+1 ) ] / 2. Putting that into prefix notation gives you Steve Knight ’s equation : (/ (* n ( 1+ n ) ) 2 ) .
Now the people who put together the Euler project did not intend for us to write clever recursive programs .
The problems they chose were meant to be so onerous that one would rather do the math than work it out .
Us being programers , we miss the point completely !
Now , I ’ve seen the formula for doing whatever you want with arithmetic series .
I ’ve seen stuff for geometric series , too .
Arithmetic series are defined recursively where each term equals the previous term plus a constant .
The nth term of a geometric series is equal to the first term times the “ common ratio ” raised to the ( n – 1 ) th power .
So we ’ve got math for series like 55 , 55 , 60 , … , 2035 and 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 , ….
But I do n’t see math for series like 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , … , 10000 .
I do n’t see the cutesy thing we were supposed to be doing with this one … .
What is the “ right way ” to sum a list of squares ??

Obesity is more dangerous than smoking and will dramatically shorten the lives of millions , a landmark study has found .
While smoking reduces life by an average of ten years , the research says being seriously overweight can cut life expectancy by as much as 13 years .
The Foresight report , written by 250 leading scientists , says Britain 's obesity crisis is so severe that it would take at least 30 years to reverse .
Scroll down for more ...
If current trends continue , by 2050 about 60 per cent of men , 50 per cent of women and 25 per cent of children in the UK will be clinically obese - so fat that their health is in danger .
At present around a quarter of adults are obese .
The effects of this on the nation 's health will be devastating .
The report expects type 2 diabetes to rise by 70 per cent , strokes to go up by 30 per cent and a 20 per cent rise in coronary disease .
The rates of certain cancers will also go up .
The associated chronic health problems will cost an extra £ 45.5 billion a year , more than half the amount of money that goes into the entire NHS at the moment .
The Foresight study warns that the majority of adults are already overweight and that being overweight is now seen as " normal " .
But modern life - with the easy availability of cheap unhealthy food and families relying on their cars - means it is almost impossible for many to avoid putting on weight .
Indeed , it is becoming inevitable for most because our biological instincts combined with our modern environment mean we are " destined " to pile on the pounds .
Lead author Professor David King , the Government 's chief scientific adviser , said : " We must fight the notion that the current obesity epidemic arises from individual over - indulgence or laziness alone .
" We live in a consumer society which encourages us to eat .
We have a sedentary lifestyle .
It 's an environment which means that if we just behave normally we will become obese .
" We may only put on a bit of weight a day but there are 365 days in the year . "
He added : " This will need a major culture change and a long - term commitment from government .
" The obesity issue is getting worse every year and we have not got much time to act . "
The report comes after the Government quietly dropped its target to halve the rise in childhood obesity by 2010 .
Accepting the target was unachievable , ministers sneaked out an announcement last week that it would be replaced by a target to reduce by 30 per cent the proportion of children who are obese or overweight by 2020 .
The Foresight report found that being obese , with a body mass index of more than 30 , knocks nine years off a person 's life , while men with a BMI of more than 45 face 13 years less life .
At present around 50,000 men have a BMI of more than 45 but in the coming years this figure is expected to soar .
The report says the human body is biologically predisposed to put on weight because this was an advantage in our evolutionary past .

Pointing out that the design of many towns and cities is based around the needs of the car , it suggests more should be done to ensure that it is easier to walk and cycle to encourage residents to take more exercise .
Sugary and fatty foods are much cheaper than they used to be , but the cost of fresh fruit and vegetables has actually risen over the past 15 years .
The report says the availability of unhealthy food and drink should be controlled , perhaps by restricting advertising or certain ingredients in foods such as trans fats .
The scientists call on the Government to make the problem a priority , perhaps forming an independent committee similar to the one being developed on climate change to bring together government departments and industry .
Dr Susan Jebb , of the Human Nutrition Research Unit , said action against obesity needed to be as tough as the action taken against infectious diseases in the 19th century .
She said Britons were in general eating more unhealthily and taking less exercise because that was becoming normal behaviour and " generally we act as a herd " .
The real problem was that " we have prioritised cheap food above healthy food , and we have prioritised taking the car over walking " .
Public Health Minister Dawn Primarolo said : " There is no single solution to tackle obesity and it cannot be tackled by Government action alone .
" We will only succeed if the problem is recognised , owned and addressed at every level and every part of society . "

But Peter Hollins , chief executive of the British Heart Foundation , said successive governments had ignored warnings of an obesity crisis since the mid-1970s .
" It is hardly a wake - up call , " he said .
" Repeated reports like this , which should have had alarm bells ringing in Whitehall long ago , have been met only by repeated pushes of the Government 's snooze button .
" We have seen several policies touted in recent days as suggested solutions , but what we lack is a multi- faceted cross-Government strategy , backed with resources and the full attention of the Prime Minister , with clear short - term targets and a commitment to bold , concerted action . "
Tory health spokesman Andrew Lansley said : " Three years after it published a public health White Paper , the Government 's approach remains uncoordinated and limited .
" Public health budgets have been raided to offset deficits in the NHS and the number of public health professionals has declined .
" It 's time for the Government to prioritise public health .
If it does n't , the human and financial cost on society and the NHS will escalate out of control . "
In the past 30 years , physical activity has declined significantly in the UK .
Between 1975 and 2003 , the average distance per year each person in England walked fell from 255 miles to 192 miles .
Over the same period , distances cycled fell from an average of 51 miles per person per year to 34 miles .
Car use , meanwhile , increased by more than 10 per cent .
A fifth of all journeys of less than a mile are now made by car .
A US defence department advisory board has warned of the danger that American war robots scheduled for delivery within a decade might be riddled with malicious code .
The kill machines will use software largely written overseas , and it is feared that sinister forces might meddle with it in production , thus gaining control of the future mechanoid military .
The most eye - catching of the equipment mentioned is the lineup of the US Army 's Future Combat Systems ( FCS ) programme .
FCS was originally supposed to include a wide range of deadly unmanned systems , including a small , possibly rocket - firing flying Dalek , a heavily armed autonomous helicopter gunship , and a robot tank packing guided missiles and cannon .
There would also be intelligent sensor minefields , droid - mule transport systems and loads of other stuff ; and all of it is supposed to be linked together by a data network .
Some of this has been scratched from the plans of late to save money - fans of Keith Laumer 's Bolo novels will be sorry to hear that the robotanks have gone - but FCS remains a big deal , and parts of it are meant to arrive within a few years .
" On the network the strong become stronger , " runs the US Army slogan .
But now the US Defence Science Board , in a report being analysed by the military press , have started to worry about that network .
" The System of Systems Common Operating Environment ( SOSCOE ) and the Integrated Computer System / Operating System ( ICS / OS ) rely predominantly on [ Commercial Off The Shelf - COTS ] and Open Source software , " say the gov advisors .
" The ICS / OS is almost 99 per cent COTS / OS , " they add .
" The SOSCOE , essentially the ' middleware ' ... is almost 80 per cent COTS / OS . "
Apparently the FCS programme office has admitted that there is a " low to moderate risk that malicious code could be inserted ... and exploited . "
It seems there is also an " irresistible tendency to replace relatively secure special - purpose communications ... with the general purpose Internet Protocol ( IP ) stack . "
If that does n't boil down to a teenager with a laptop seizing control of robot helicopter gunships , we do n't know what does .
We 'll say that again : ROBOT GUNSHIP HAX0R ARMY MENACE 2 SOCIETY .
Aiee !
Run !
( It wo n't be any use , but run anyway . )
The soldiery have come up with some cunning plans to deal with this problem , including that of using undercover software buyers so that the vendors would n't know they were selling to the US military .
There was also a suggestion that " the profit motive will assure clean code in shrink - wrapped consumer software " .
( They really did say that , apparently . )
The Science Board guys said they were " skeptical " of these thoughts , and concluded that " malicious code is a key concern of the FCS program " .
Read the full report in all its hefty pdf glory here .
Still , things might be OK .
Apparently the incredibly expensive new F - 22 Raptor stealth superjet is pretty secure ( it " appears to be at the high end ... for secure software development " ) .
So the Raptor finally has a clear and well - defined purpose : saving the taxpayers from the hacker robot army . ®

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Bush on Wednesday told CNN he would personally " facilitate " peace negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis , saying the formation of a democratic Palestinian state was the best way to bring peace to the region .
President Bush says he would " facilitate " negotiations but not travel to the Middle East .
" A democracy on Israel 's border is important for Israel 's security and that very democracy is important for the Palestinians to have a hopeful life , " Bush said .
" It is also important for the broader Middle East . "
Bush 's comments come a day after a summit at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , in which Israeli and Palestinian leaders agreed on a framework for future peace talks .
The sides set the end of 2008 as a goal for completing a peace treaty .
Bush made the comments during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer .
Watch Blitzer 's one - on - one with Bush »
The framework for negotiations was agreed to by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
Abbas is currently in a bitter power struggle with Hamas for control of Palestinian territory .
Hamas , which currently controls Gaza , opposed negotiations and supports continued armed resistance against Israel .
Hamas , which the United States and Israel label a terrorist group , won Palestinian legislative elections in 2006 , ousting the long - ruling Fatah party that Abbas heads .
Abbas dissolved the Hamas - led government earlier this year after Hamas forces seized control of Gaza .
When asked whether the peace process can overcome opposition from Hamas , Bush said " the best way to defeat those terrorists and radicals ... is through a vision based upon liberty . "
" Ultimately , if this can be done , if the state can be laid out -- what the state should look like -- then it gives people like President Abbas the chance to go to the Palestinians and say , ' You can have their vision of violence or this vision of peace , take your pick . ' "
" America ca n't impose our vision on the two parties , " Bush said .
" If that happens , then there 's not going to be a deal that will last . "
When asked by Blitzer what he would do to advance the negotiations , Bush said " it depends on the circumstances . "
But , he said he thought a personal visit to the region would not further the peace process .
" It is working with the principals , Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas -- that 's how you get things done .
Now if I have to call them together , I will . "
Bush said the attendance of numerous Arab states , including Saudi Arabia and Syria , at Tuesday 's summit was " quite an accomplishment . "
Asked why Syria , which the United States accuses of funding terrorism , was invited to the conference Bush said other Arab nations requested it and that " We wanted to make sure as many Arab nations came as possible . "
" We have our differences with Syria , no question about it . "
When asked why Iran 's leadership was not invited to the conference , Bush said " they would not be constructive " and " were n't going to come anyway " based on recent comments from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
" This is a man who does n't believe in democracy and freedom and peace , " Bush said .
" And this was a conference of people who are supportive of the idea of a democratic state living side by side with Israel . "
Bush stood by his previous assertion that the United States would support Israel if it was attacked by Iran , but would not elaborate on what that support would entail .
On Wednesday , Palestinian and Israeli negotiators said they were optimistic that an agreement could be reached .
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat said the two sides can " absolutely " fashion a peace deal by the end of next year .
However , he said , the deal must come in the form of a package that resolves at least six points : Israeli settlements in the West Bank , the right of Palestinian refugees to return to Israel , Jerusalem as the shared capital of a future Palestinian state , settling on borders , security and water supply .
Israel will add the condition that the conflict must end , Erakat said .
Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev concurred with Erakat that the deal must come in package form .
But he refrained from discussing specifics , saying only that Israel is willing to discuss all " sensitive and problematic issues . "
He added , though , that there " are different ideas out there . "

Gloria
Thomas was in such distress that her crying alarmed some passengers on a plane trip from India to Sydney .
She had been overseas for two months receiving medical treatment , and homeopathic medication from an uncle for severe eczema .
But in that time she missed two appointments which separate doctors had made for her at specialist dermatologists .
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) has begun an investigation ( PDF ) into accusations that some insiders may be using inside information to collect data and purchase unregistered domain names that get a lot of DNS lookup requests — nonexistent domains that surfers frequently try to access .
ICANN refers to the practice as " domain name front running , " adding that it — along with several registrars and intellectual property attorneys — has received a number of complaints from registrants suggesting that such a thing has occurred .
While the organization currently has no solid evidence on the matter as of yet , it feels that an investigation is warranted in order to nip in the bud any perceptions that the domain name industry is involved in unethical activity .
ICANN 's Security and Stability Advisory Committee ( SSAC ) likens the practice to stock and commodity front running , which occurs when a broker makes a personal stock purchase based on inside information before fulfilling a client 's order .
An insider to one of the popular domain registrars can see which domain names are popular with visitors , even if they are not yet registered .
That person can then register the domain , knowing how much traffic it could get before the general public does , with the intent to resell it at a profit later .
While the practice is illegal when it comes to stocks and commodities , it is much more cloudy when it comes to domain names .
ICANN recognizes the lack of regulation covering this area and makes it clear that a stronger set of standards needs to be established .
" ICANN 's Registrar Accreditation Agreement and Registry Agreements do not expressly prohibit registrars and registries from monitoring and collecting WHOIS query of domain name availability query data and either selling this information or using it directly , " writes the SSAC .
" In the absence of an explicit prohibition , registrars might conclude that monitoring availability checks is appropriate behavior . "
The SSAC report comes just a day after news leaked that Verisign , a major root name server operator , was considering selling access to select DNS server lookup data .
DomainNameNews first broke the story , saying that sources had indicated the company would provide " lookup traffic " reports on specific domains .
The sources also said that pricing for the service was not known , but that it could cost up to $ 1 million per request .
The SSAC is now calling for public discussion of the situation in hopes of gathering more data and coming up with standardized practices on how to manage it .
The committee suggests that those involved with domain name registrations " examine the existing rules to determine if the practice of domain name front running is consistent with the core values of the community . "
If registrants continue to find what they consider to be evidence of the practice , SSAC requests that users submit incidents to SSAC - DNFR@icann.org with as much information as possible , including specific details of domain name checks and copies of any correspondence with the believed to be engaged in domain front running .
The Wisdom of Browse
Just a thought from 20 April 2006 about Design , Geek , Internet .
There 's some drama afoot lately as bloggers pick apart Digg 's user - controlled editorial system , looking for evidence of editors lurking in the darkness .
But much of the conversation is overlooking a crucial nuance when it comes to authentic media and democratic editorial systems .
For the uninitiated , Digg is a tech news site , where the members post links to interesting stuff , and then the community chooses which links get promoted to the front page .
For readers , this means they see stuff that a lot of people think is interesting , which is why the site is so popular .
Digg 's members influence which stories get promoted by " digging " those stories .
A digg is like a vote , and everybody gets one .
How , exactly , a story winds up on the Digg homepage is never explicitly disclosed , but most people have assumed that the front page is simply a collection of the stories with the most votes .
And , certainly , Digg has encouraged this view .
Their about page simply says , " Once a story has received enough diggs , it is instantly promoted . "
But a simple voting system is not necessarily the best way to provide an interesting experience for users .
In fact , it might very well be the worst .
It 's been said that wisdom is the ability to hold two completely opposing thoughts in your head at the same time .
So try being wise with me and see if you can hold both of these ideas in your head for a moment :
When it comes to group behavior , people are both stupid and brilliant .
People are stupid in groups .
Think about popularity for a moment .
You know what the most popular TV show of all time is ?
Baywatch – a show with the primary distinguishing feature of slow - motion shots of Pamela Anderson in a swimsuit running down a beach .
Think about mob behavior and our basest instincts .
Think about the prom king and queen .
If we learned anything in high school , it 's that there 's no better way for the crap to rise to the top than a popularity contest .
People are brilliant in groups .
Crowds can also be wise .
The famous example is to ask a group of people to guess the number of coins in a jar .
Any single individual 's answer will most likely be wrong .
But if you take all the answers and average them together , most of the time , they 're right ( give or take a percent or two ) .
Groups are also the foundation of democracy , which , for all it 's problems , is pretty much a great thing .
So what 's going on here ?
How can people in groups be both brilliant and idiotic ?
One word : Interface .
In the television example , people are just acting on their own , engaging their baser instincts , making selfish decisions .
But in the coin - guess example , there 's a structured interface in place – a moderator asking a specific question and then working with the data to produce the result .
Bottom line : Crowds are not wise by default – they 're wise when guided with a specific task and given specific moderation .
Back to Digg .
First of all , it 's their site , and they can do whatever they want .
They have as much right to exclude sites or links for editorial reasons as Flickr has to exclude illustrations because they 're not photos .
And I applaud their efforts to keep their site on target .
In the end , it 's a site for readers , and the readers want an interesting front page to read every day .
It 's Digg 's job to serve them up a great experience , or they 're gone .
But Digg has fallen victim to its own system of mob rule .
While a most - votes - first , tyranny of the masses approach works when your community is small , as you get bigger it falls apart as members gang up to game the system for their own purposes .
This will lead some to abandon the idea of giving the users a vote at all .
A similar news site , Fark , experimented in letting their members vote on story placement , but abandoned the idea when they did n't like the results .
But that , too , is a mistake .
The problem is not the voting , the problem is the mob rule .
The crowd needs more guidance to be wise .
Sorting the content by votes is often the first approach on sites like this , but it 's not the only way to sort data .
The site could just as easily experiment with other sorting methods .
For example :
Voting Velocity .
Who cares how many total votes a story got ?
Instead , pay attention to the timeframe in which the votes came in .
A story that gets a lot of votes very quickly would outrank a story that got more votes over a longer period of time .
This sort would favor hot news over the slow burners .

This sort would favor hot news over the slow burners .
Member Karma .
The system could assign " karma " points to members that consistently participate in quality ways ( as judged by the site founders , naturally ) .
The contributions by members with high karma could then comes in higher than the contributions of members with low karma .
( Slashdot has a version of this running now , but it only applies to comments and is mostly to combat spam . )
This may sound exclusive , but remember , anyone can earn karma – they just have to participate , and participate well , for a period of time .

This may sound exclusive , but remember , anyone can earn karma – they just have to participate , and participate well , for a period of time .
Other Metrics .
Digg has other metrics to use besides voting : Number of clicks on the link , number of comments , number views on the link 's conversation page .
Digg could add them all up , or factor them in to an overall rating , which would be more nuanced than a simple vote .
And then there are the other methods that other sites use .
They could editorially select what goes on the homepage ( like Slashdot or every newspaper out there ) , or just go newest first ( like MetaFilter or every blog out there ) .
Note that all of these ideas could be inverted , too .
You could just as easily use voting velocity to discount the fast - rising stories in favor of the slow burners .
Or use member karma to promote contributions by low - karma members who are brand new instead of the oldies who have accumulated a lot of karma already .
These sorting methods are all editorial decisions .
You select the one that best produces the kind of contributions you want to see , and engenders the kind of community you want to host .
And here 's the really cool part :
The default sort does n't have to be the same for everybody .
Instead of looking at everyone 's metrics , it could just look at mine .
Instead of looking at everyone 's votes , it could just consider the votes by my friends .
The result would be a very different site : more personal filter , less New York Times .
A great case in point is Flickr 's Interestingness .
Flickr could have just counted up how many times a photo has been favorited , and been done with it .
But they realized that would have just produced a crass vote - getting game culture that would n't have actually produced an interesting selection of photos .
So , instead , they came up with an Interestingness algorithm .
How it works is a secret , but it takes into account all kinds of user behavior , above and beyond simple voting , to determine what photos are interesting .
Is it perfect ?
Hell , no .
So they 're constantly tweaking it to make it better ( much to the chagrin of the Interestingness - watchers who are always trying to decompile the system in order to game it ) .
This is reminiscent of Google 's closely guarded and oft - tweaked PageRank algorithm that determines the order of their search results .
Both companies had the same problem that Digg is starting to have :
Too much data , a community of contributors with a huge incentive to game the system , and an audience looking for a quality experience .
As the web matures , and we get better at developing member - driven media sites like Digg , we have to look beyond simplistic majority - rule popularity contests if we ever want to take on traditional editor - driven media .
People are complicated , and we 're going to need complicated systems to really draw the wisdom out of the crowd .

Jack Valenti , the urbane Washington lobbyist who served as Hollywood ’s public face for nearly four decades and was best known for creating the film ratings system , died Thursday afternoon , according to Warren Cowan , his longtime friend .
He was 85 .
Valenti had been in ill health since suffering a stroke in March .
He was treated for several weeks at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore but was released Tuesday and returned to his home in Washington , where he died .
For 38 years until retiring in 2004 , Valenti headed the Motion Picture Assn. of America , guiding the trade organization from a clubby group of movie studios led by autocratic moguls into a collection of global media conglomerates involved in television , the Internet and an array of other media businesses .
To the moviegoing public , however , Valenti ’s legacy will always be the ratings system he fathered in 1968 , which now labels movies G , PG , PG - 13 , R or NC - 17 .
Valenti defended it for years against attacks by critics .
Today , it remains largely intact as the self - policing vehicle he envisioned .

“ It ’s the end of an era , ” said industry veteran Sherry Lansing , former Paramount Pictures chairwoman .
“ He was one of the greatest leaders our industry ever had .
He was one of those unique individuals who could build consensus . ”
Former Warner Bros. Chairman Bob Daly said Valenti ’s passing represented “ a sad day . ”
“ He was friends with everybody in the industry , and even though he might not agree with you , you could talk to Jack and he understood your point , ” Daly said .
Valenti ’s death comes on the eve of the anticipated release of his memoirs chronicling a life that included piloting a B - 25 in World War II , serving as one of President Lyndon Johnson ’s closest confidants and shaping nearly every issue faced by today ’s entertainment industry .
Titled “ This Time , This Place : My Life in War , the White House , and Hollywood , ” the book is tentatively scheduled for release in June .

In his role as entertainment industry lobbyist , Valenti moved effortlessly between Hollywood and Washington while trying to bridge two cultures that were often at odds .
With his silver mane , custom - tailored shirts and suits , and polished cowboy boots , Valenti was one of the most recognizable figures in the nation ’s capital .
Despite being a loyal Democrat , he skillfully worked both sides of the aisles , possessing one of the town ’s best Rolodexes .
Along the way , he became nearly as much a celebrity as the stars he befriended , addressing the worldwide Academy Awards TV audience each year .
In public , his Texas - accented eloquence was reminiscent of a Southern preacher .
In fretting over the rising costs of making and marketing films , Valenti once said : “ As the American movie rides an ascending curve throughout the known world , it is being pursued with malignant fidelity by total costs .
It is a terrible confluence of hope and terror which confronts every studio , every producer , every production company . ”
The grandson of Sicilian immigrants and son of a tax clerk , Valenti was born Sept. 5 , 1921 in Houston .
An honor student and debating champ at Sam Houston High School , he graduated at age 15 .

Lacking the money to attend college , Valenti worked as an $ 11 - a - week movie theater usher -- his only entertainment experience before going to work for the MPAA .
While employed by an oil company , he attended night classes at the University of Houston , where he was elected student body president .
At age 20 , Valenti enlisted in the Army Air Forces after being turned down by the Navy because of a heart murmur .
Flying 51 missions , he won the Distinguished Flying Cross .
He received his MBA from Harvard University in 1948 and four years later started his own advertising firm .
He was among a dozen young men and women invited to a reception at a Houston hotel to meet Johnson , then the U.S. Senate ’s majority leader , who was eager to cultivate talented young fellow Texans who might help him one day .
Valenti was in awe the moment he met his future mentor .
Recalling that day during a Caltech appearance in 2003 , Valenti said : “ I was fascinated the way I ’m fascinated by a hooded cobra or a silken panther on a hillside ready to spring .
It was an animal magnetism I never got over . ”

After Johnson was selected as John F. Kennedy ’s running mate in 1960 , Valenti worked on the ticket ’s media campaign in Texas , and he kept in touch with Johnson after he became vice president .
Valenti was also smitten by Johnson secretary Mary Margaret Wiley .
After spotting her coming off an airplane with Johnson in Houston , Valenti asked an aide to call the Rice Hotel and order the staff to rearrange the seating so she would be placed next to him .
When the couple married in 1962 , Wiley ’s father was ill , so Johnson gave the bride away .
The couple had three children .
Valenti continued to handle assignments for Johnson , and , in November 1963 , the vice president asked him to help in a politically sensitive campaign visit that President Kennedy planned to make to Texas .
The trip would make Valenti an eyewitness to one of America ’s darkest chapters and abruptly change the course of his life .

On Nov. 22 , Valenti was riding six cars behind the presidential limousine as it snaked through the streets of Dallas toward Dealey Plaza .
Valenti would later recall that he never actually heard the shots that killed Kennedy but immediately knew something was wrong .
“ Suddenly the slow - moving motorcade became the Indianapolis Speedway , ” he recalled in a Times piece published on an anniversary of the Kennedy assassination .
“ The car in front drag - raced from 10 mph to over 60 .
None of us had any idea of what happened . ”
After Kennedy died , Johnson asked Valenti to join him on Air Force One flying back to Washington .
Valenti can be seen crouching on the left in one of the event ’s defining photographs showing a somber Johnson taking the oath of office on the presidential jet , Jacqueline Kennedy at Johnson ’s side still wearing her blood - stained dress .
“ That act of inscrutable fate changed my life , ” Valenti said .

Valenti helped write the words Johnson uttered when he addressed the American people for the first time as president , and bunked at the White House until his family arrived from Texas .
Valenti effectively became Johnson ’s companion , troubleshooter and trusted confidant .
Throughout his life Valenti was a loyal defender of Johnson , even as his presidency was crumbling because of the Vietnam War .
He compared Johnson to the Greek mythological hero Achilles , seeing him as a talented leader whose flaws brought him down .
In a 1965 speech to the Advertising Federation of America , Valenti uttered a sentence that would hang around his neck like an albatross : “ I sleep each night a little better , a little more confidently , because Lyndon Johnson is my president . ”
Later , when he complained to Johnson that he could n’t escape the quote , Johnson replied : “ I do n’t know what you ’re fretting about , Jack .
Do you know how few presidential assistants say anything memorable ? ”

Valenti regarded his time with Johnson in Washington as the “ summertime ” of his life -- the only period when he was doing something that really “ counted , ” he said in his 1976 book about Johnson , “ A Very Human President . ”
Washington , he added , is the “ ultimate seduction .
After that , everything is tasteless passion . ”
In 1966 , two Hollywood moguls , MCA Inc. power broker Lew Wasserman and United Artists ’ Arthur Krim , were looking for someone to lead their trade group and they approached Valenti .
After initially resisting the idea , Johnson gave his blessing .
Valenti left in April , saying he could not turn down the $ 175,000 - a- year post .
The new position paid more than six times his $ 28,000 White House salary .
By the time he left the MPAA he was one of the highest paid lobbyists in Washington , reportedly earning $ 1.35 million annually .
Two years after taking over the MPAA , Valenti and association counsel Louis Nizer devised the ratings system so they could scrap the industry ’s Hays Code , which for decades placed tight restrictions on movie language and sexual content .
The code had such rules as no open - mouth kissing and a requirement that a man and a woman in bed each have one foot on the floor .
Advertisement
“ If you wanted to be affectionate , you had to be Nadia Comaneci the gymnast , ” Valenti later recalled .
One of his first dealings with the code after being hired by the MPAA was to negotiate what language could be used in Mike Nichols ’ film version of Edward Albee ’s play “ Who ’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? ”
Valenti would not permit the use of some crude language to describe sex , although he approved use of the phrase “ hump the hostess . ”
But the almost comical exercise in discretion made it more obvious that enforcement of the code had become virtually impossible .
At the time , Hollywood was facing competition from more daring foreign films and was seeing a new generation of directors push the boundaries as Nichols did with “ Virginia Woolf ” and Michelangelo Antonioni did with “ Blow Up . ” Valenti abhorred censorship and wanted to do away with the code but knew he needed an alternative to head off any potential restrictions from lawmakers .
Valenti became immersed in the industry ’s business issues as well .
He championed open markets for Hollywood films and in the final years of his tenure was preoccupied with digital piracy , as technology made it easy to create pristine bootlegs of films .

He did misjudge the impact of home video on the business , initially seeing it as such a threat that it was “ to the American film producer and the American public what the Boston Strangler is to the American woman at home alone . ”
Instead , home video became a gold mine for studios .
In the early 1990s , Valenti threatened to resign so he could publicly denounce Oliver Stone ’s “ JFK , ” which suggested that Johnson was involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy .
Daly , the head of Warner Bros. , talked him out of it .
Valenti agreed to wait until after the Oscar ballots for 1991 were in , then issued a blistering seven - page statement in which he called the film a “ propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax . ”
Nonetheless , Valenti defended Stone ’s right to make the film .
“ I do not consider myself anointed by God to have these immaculate visions of how a movie ought to be made or how a movie ought to be told , ” he said .

With the energy of an executive decades younger , Valenti traveled relentlessly until his retirement .
He obtained his taekwondo black belt in 1999 , at the age of 78 .
Toward the end , some executives started to question whether Valenti ’s erudite , Old World style reflected the image of the New Hollywood -- whether his longevity , in fact , was a double - edged sword in dealing with a new range of complex issues .
But Valenti remained one of Washington ’s most effective players .
He scored a victory by temporarily beating back a move by the networks to control TV rerun rights and revenues -- upholding rules prohibiting them from selling or syndicating programs they aired .
It was a windfall for the studios represented by Valenti , and although the networks later won the battle to eliminate these rules , it was regarded as a major success for him at the time .
Throughout , his infectious “ Valenti-isms ” endeared him to politicians and reporters .
In a single conversation he might quote Churchill , Benjamin Disraeli and the Greek philosopher Heraclitus .
After a trying week politically , he once told a Times reporter : “ You gird your loins .
You get out on the battlefield , your broadsword flashing . ”

Valenti expressed some frustrations with the changing nature of the job .
After a series of mergers and takeovers , studios had become slices of diversified entities that changed the landscape of Hollywood .
And with the growing international market and emerging technologies , his focus was not just on movie production and a burgeoning TV industry , as it was when he started out .
In addition , it was Valenti who often took the bullet when it came to criticisms of Hollywood and popular culture .
In 2000 , he led a group of studio executives to Capitol Hill , where they were lambasted over violence in the media .
“ I do get frustrated ; in fact , I do get depressed from time to time .
But if I just hunker down -- as LBJ used to say -- like a jackass in a hailstorm and wait until the storm passes , it ’s going to be all right , ” he said .
“ If this were an easy job , you could probably get someone fresh out of Harvard Business School to do it . ”
Industry veteran Sidney Sheinberg , former president of Universal Pictures ’ longtime corporate parent , MCA Inc. , marveled at how Valenti operated as head of the MPAA .
Advertisement
“ He had an impossible job .
And the impossible part was n’t dealing with the exhibitors [ theater owners ] or foreign countries , but people who were his nominal bosses , ” said Sheinberg , referring to the heads of all the motion picture studios .
“ He had to reconcile their opinions and conflicting interests , and it requires the utmost statesmanship . ”
In 2004 , Valenti finally gave up his post , succeeded by former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman .
Until the stroke , Valenti remained active , working on world health issues and consulting the industry on how to educate parents to block objectionable TV shows .
In addition to his wife of 45 years , he is survived by their three children , Courtenay , John and Alexandra ; his sister , Lorraine Valenti Dinerstein ; and two grandchildren .
Funeral services will be private .

HSPD -12
I will make it as short as I can .
Following 9/11/01 attacks , Bush issued a number of directives aimed at changing the posture of the Federal Government .
These edicts , Homeland Security Presidential Directives , defined the rainbow colors of terrorism threat levels meant to keep us afraid but not too afraid ( HSPD - 3 ) , established policy for continuity of the executive branch , and , among other things , called for a government - wide standard for federal identification .
The new standard requires that all personnel with long - term access to federally - controlled facilities and IT resources pass background checks and be issued tamper - proof , biometrics - capable ID .
The background checks have been part and parcel of federal civil service from time immemorial ; the caveat is that from now on the same checks would also be performed on contractor personnel .
This is where the enormity of the endeavor becomes apparent .
Take NASA , for example .
The space agency operates ~ 10 centers , with ~19000 employees and at least ~ 70000 on - site contractors .
Similarly , the Department of Energy employs ~ 16000 civil servants and at least ~ 100000 contractors .
" Contractors " in these agencies , as well as in some others include researchers working in privately - run facilities such as NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Lab ( run by Caltech ) and DOE ’s Lawrence Berkeley National Lab ( University of California ) and Fermilab .
Investigations
Anyone with long - term access to such facilities will be required to submit to a background investigation of varying levels .
At the very least , neighbors , landlords , employers ( current and former ) and acquaintances are asked to provide their take on the person ’s mental and emotional stability , financial integrity , drug and alcohol use , and even " general conduct " .
Criminal , credit and education history are also checked .
In some cases , detailed medical record and financial institution searches are performed .
Investigators will look at person ’s sexual morality ( sodomy , bestiality and " carnal knowledge " are disqualifying factors )
This is the same investigation as the one required for Civil Service , but these contractors will not have the benefit of civil service job stability , federal medical and retirement benefits , or union representation .
Even those in civil service will be re-investigated .
At EPA , students hired to study effects of toxins on amphibians and paid $ 14.88 / hour are required to undergo the more intrusive investigation , including a medical record search .
Who in their sane mind would agree to such invasion of privacy if they have any alternative whatsoever ?
The best and the brightest will no longer work for the government , as a contractor or even as an employee of a company doing business with the government .
Cost
The number of new investigations required by the directive is estimated to be ~ 10 million .
The cost of the background investigation will run the taxpayers minimum of $ 350 ( more if there are any issues at all , even a divorce or a bankruptcy ) .
, for a total of $ 3.5 Billion .
Loss of productivity ( U.S. Treasury allows its employees two work days to gather the documentation needed to initiate the investigation ) will likely double that number .
Not unexpectedly , there is little effect on security at federal facilities .
The background investigations cannot be meaningfully conducted on recently hired foreign nationals , a large contingent at national labs .
The policy also specifically excludes those employed for less than 6 months .
With the clear indications of a downside for the taxpayer , the contractor employees , and for the government efficiency , one has to ask who benefits from this .
First , it is effectively a stealth introduction of a national ID card , RealID
Second , the government gets to keep a database of ~ 10 million persons investigated , plus their ~ 10 - 15 employer , neighbor and personal references .
Corruption
And third ( actually , this is probably " first " ) , a for - profit company , United States Investigations Services , now performing the background checks for the government , get a $ 3.5B boost to its bottom line .
Who is one of just two USIS major investors ?
That would be The Carlyle Group .
Curiously , the employees of USIS , a private entity , do not need to undergo the investigations .
Failure
Destroying the Federal government by making what remains of it Brownie - incompetent ; failing the stated purpose of the action ; collecting tens of millions of new personal data records to sift through ; neglecting to investigate those who really need to be investigated ; all the while making personal profit .
With this administration it is not a bug , it ’s a feature .
Resistance
Is there hope ?
Employees of NASA ’s JPL , while doing their day job of exploring the solar system , have mounted a significant outreach effort ( http://hspd12jpl.org/) and will welcome any financial or legal help .
Employees and contractors at Goddard Space Flight Center are n’t happy either .
Contractor employees at the U.S. Department of Education are irked at both privacy invasion and the " loyalty oath " aspect of that agency ’s policy .
Some vote with their feet ( contractor for U.S. Bureau of Land Management and a JPL employee )
Some in Congress are paying attention , but with time running out , and Congress reluctance to take on anything Bush connects to " homeland security " , legislative or oversight interventions do not look promising .
Consequences
After Katrina , Grover Norquist ’s bathtub drowning reference transcended from being a metaphor to become a deadly reality .
Next time , there might not be a satellite to take images of the devastation .

Backers of a proposed 2008 medical marijuana initiative in Michigan delivered some 496,000 signatures of registered voters to state election officials Tuesday , far in excess of the 304,000 required by Michigan law to put the issue to a vote .
Provided that signature - gatherers have in fact come up with enough valid signatures -- anywhere over 450,000 would normally be considered a comfortable margin -- the issue will then go before the legislature .
If the legislature fails to act , the issue would go to the voters in the November 2008 election .
Organized by the Michigan Coalition for Compassionate Care , with the backing of the Marijuana Policy Project , the initiative would set up a system of patient and caregiver registries that would allow qualifying patients or caregivers to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and 12 plants .
Caregivers could possess those amounts for each patient with whom they are listed on the state registry .
Medical marijuana would be approved for " chronic debilitating disease or medical conditions " including cancer , glaucoma , HIV / AIDS , Alzheimer 's agitation , wasting , severe or chronic pain , severe nausea , or " any other medical condition or its treatment approved by the department . "
While under Michigan law , the legislature will get first crack at approving the initiative , that appears unlikely .
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mike Bishop ( R - Rochester ) told the Detroit Free Press the legislature could have taken up the issue at any time .
That it has not suggests " there may not be much interest in it , " the spokesman said .
A spokesman for House Speaker Andy Dillon ( D - Redford Township ) had no comment .
But the lackadaisical legislature notwithstanding , Michigan has already proven friendly ground for medical marijuana , with voters in Detroit , Ann Arbor , Ferndale , Traverse City , and Flint all passing local initiatives since 2004 .
An August 2003 poll found 59 % for medical marijuana statewide .
Twelve states currently have viable medical marijuana laws , mainly in the West and the Northeast .
No state in the Midwest has yet embraced medical marijuana , although legislative efforts are underway in several , including Illinois , Minnesota , and Wisconsin .
September 24 , 2020 , ABC News
Study shows Black and Brown adults were least likely to get treatment .
The Google Phone has arrived , sort of , but not in the long - rumored embodiment that many had expected .
Google announced this morning that it has developed a new mobile OS called " Android " — a result of its acquisition of a mobile software company of the same name in 2005 — that will allow the company to get Google 's mobile apps into as many hands as possible starting in mid-2008 .
Android is Linux - based and open source , and aspects of the platform will be made available to handset manufacturers for free under the Apache license .
Google 's handset partners upon launch will include Motorola , HTC , Samsung , and LG , confirming many of the recent rumors that Google would not be developing the hardware on its own .
Google has a number of carrier partners worldwide as well , such as T - Mobile and Sprint in the US , T - Mobile / Deutsche Telekom in Europe , and China Mobile in China , to name a few .
The whole thing comes as part of the Open Handset Alliance — also announced by Google today .
Google has chosen to launch Android in this way is because it wanted to put its focus on the platform for development of its mobile applications .
Although Java is widely available on many handsets worldwide , it still operates differently from phone to phone and can't provide the type of flexibility that Google wants for itself and its partners .
In addition to rolling out its own suite of mobile apps , Google also plans to make a " full " SDK for Android available next week , making the platform even more attractive to third - party developers ( and perhaps delivering a slight ice burn to Apple on the side ) .
And the more third - party apps there are available for the platform , the more attractive it will be for customers .
" This partnership will help unleash the potential of mobile technology for billions of users around the world .
A fresh approach to fostering innovation in the mobile industry will help shape a new computing environment that will change the way people access and share information in the future , " Google CEO Eric Schmidt said in a statement .
" Today 's announcement is more ambitious than any single ' Google Phone ' that the press has been speculating about over the past few weeks .
Our vision is that the powerful platform we 're unveiling will power thousands of different phone models . "
Check out Google 's video introducing Android :
One obvious goal of Google 's is to create not only a platform for its mobile apps , but for its mobile advertising platform .
However , Google said during its press conference this morning that we " wo n't see a completely ad - driven cell phone for some time . "
Android and Google 's mobile ad platform is still young though , and the two will likely evolve together over time .
Schmidt reiterated during the conference that the company sees Android as a way to enable thousands of different gPhone choices and that today 's announcement is fundamentally a developer announcement .
Schmidt did not , however , rule out the possibility of creating a more official " gPhone " in the future .
" We are not announcing a Google Phone today , but if there were to be a Google Phone , Android would be an excellent platform for it to use , " he said .
As he neared the end of a posting in Gaza , the BBC's Alan Johnston was seized at gunpoint by militants .

But after they left , and the small , bare room had fallen silent , I rolled over and pulled myself slowly into a sitting position .
My wrists were handcuffed behind my back , and a black hood had been pulled down over my head .
And as I sat there - in danger , and afraid - I had a great sense of being at the very lowest point of my life .
Alan will answer questions readers have sent in , on Monday
Alan Johnston 's story
It had begun out in the spring sunshine , on the streets of Gaza City .
It had begun out in the spring sunshine , on the streets of Gaza City .
A saloon car had suddenly surged past mine , and then pulled up , forcing me to stop .
A young man emerged from the passenger side and pointed a pistol at me .
I had reported many times on the kidnapping of foreigners in Gaza .
Now , as I always feared it might , my turn had come .
The figure with the pistol and another gunman forced me into their car , and as we sped off I was made to lie on the back seat .
In the claustrophobic , intense , violent , sliver of land that is Gaza , there was now a shadowy organisation that thought in terms of waging Jihad on the West
A hood had been shoved over my face , but through it I could see the sun flickering between the tower blocks .
I could tell that we were heading south and east , towards the city 's rougher neighbourhoods .

I could tell that we were heading south and east , towards the city 's rougher neighbourhoods .
Most kidnappings in Gaza used to be carried out by disgruntled militant groups seeking the attention of the authorities in some minor dispute .
And always the Westerner was freed within a week or so , shaken but unharmed .
But the game had changed last summer .
A much more sinister group had emerged and seized two members of a team from the American Fox News network .
They were freed , but only after making a video - taped denunciation of the West , and a public conversion to Islam .
Of course this was serious .
Gaza has a population of 1.5 m

In the claustrophobic , intense , violent , sliver of land that is Gaza , there was now a shadowy organisation that thought in terms of waging Jihad on the West .
I knew it was likely to strike again , targeting the few dozen members of Gaza 's foreign community .
And so , with the help of the BBC 's security experts , I did everything I could to reduce the risk of capture .
I moved to a better - protected apartment .
I filmed less in the streets , and switched cars and made sure that my movements in the city were always random and unpredictable .
And set against the danger , I felt that Gaza 's story was important .
It is at the centre of the Palestinian drama , which in turn lies at the heart of the rising tensions between the East and the West that have become the defining story of our time .
So , in consultation with senior colleagues , I decided that the risks were worth taking , and I stayed in Gaza .
And I did manage to keep out of the grasp of the kidnappers almost to the end .
When the man with the pistol emerged from the white saloon , I had just 16 days left until I was due to leave for good .

The Jihadi leader
As I lay on a thin mattress on the floor , late on the first night of my captivity , the door opened .
Its frame was filled by a tall figure in a long white robe .
ALAN JOHNSTON ABDUCTION Monday 12 March 2007 : Goes missing in Gaza Friday 1 June : Video released showing first images since abduction Monday 25 June : Second video : Second video in suicide bomb vest Wednesday 4 July : Freed
Timeline in full Special report : Alan Johnston
He stood for a moment , looking down at me - swathed in a red- chequered headdress that completely masked his face .
The Jihadi leader had arrived .
He stepped into the room and sat down heavily in a white plastic chair .
" Alan Johnston , " he said in English .
" We know everything . "
He said that my kidnapping was about securing the release of Muslims jailed in Britain .
Later , my captors - the Army of Islam - would describe me as a prisoner in what they see as the war between Muslims and non-Muslims .
When I started to say that Britain would not negotiate , the man in the chair cut me off .
He said that the British would be forced to listen .
But mostly the voice emerging from the mask was calm , and even kindly .
I was left with a disturbing sense that what was about to happen would be protracted and life changing
He said that I would not be killed .
That I would be treated well , in keeping with Islamic codes of conduct towards prisoners .
He said that I would not be killed .
That I would be treated well , in keeping with Islamic codes of conduct towards prisoners .
Crucially , he said that I would eventually be allowed to leave .
I asked when , but he just said , " When the time is right . "
Did he mean weeks , or months , or longer ?
It was impossible to say .
But I was left with a disturbing sense that what was about to happen would be protracted and life - changing .
When it was over , he said , I would write a book about my experience , and even that I would finally get married .
But how far could I trust the masked man ?
Did his word really count for anything ?
Could he simply change his mind ?
And I wondered if he really was a leader of the group .
Perhaps , in reality , others would decide my fate .
I did fall asleep again , but I was woken by two men coming into the room .
I had been stripped of my watch , and could only tell the time by the passage of the sun , and the five calls to prayer from nearby mosques
They handcuffed me and put the black hood back over my head , and led me slowly out into the cold of the night .
They handcuffed me and put the black hood back over my head , and led me slowly out into the cold of the night .
There was no word of explanation , and as my mind searched for one in that terrifying moment of uncertainty , I feared , as I walked into the darkness , that I might be going to my death .
That I was being taken somewhere to be shot .

My first cell
But the tension eased as I began to realise that the men were only moving me to another building and what would - for a time - become my cell .
In that room , on the roof of an apartment block , there was just a narrow , sagging bed and two plastic chairs .
There was no television , or radio , or book , or pen , or paper .
I had been stripped of my watch , and could only tell the time by the passage of the sun , and the five calls to prayer from nearby mosques .
As one empty day slid slowly into another , the seriousness of my situation became more and more apparent
I had had to throw away my disposable contact lenses on the first day , and my eyes are very weak .
I had had to throw away my disposable contact lenses on the first day , and my eyes are very weak .
And so , in this blurred , empty room I began to try to come to terms with the disaster that had engulfed me .
I paced backwards and forwards across the cell .
Five strides , then a turn , and five strides back .
Mile , after mile , after mile .
Imagine yourself in that room .
Imagine pacing , or just sitting for three hours , for five hours , for 10 hours .
After you had done 12 hours , you would still have four or five more before you could hope to fall asleep .

And you would know that the next day would be the same , and the next , and the one after that , and so on , and on , and on .
As one empty day slid slowly into another , the seriousness of my situation became more and more apparent .
It is hard to strike at Britain from Gaza .
There is no British business there , and the British Council library was burned down last year by an angry mob .
Almost all that Britain had left in Gaza was the BBC .
And in the BBC , there was only one British citizen , me .
And the Jihadis had me , like a bird in a cage .
Britain never does deals with kidnappers , so why - I could not help worrying - would I ever be freed ?
I thought of the Western hostages who had been held for years in Beirut in the 1980s , and I wondered if their fate might now be mine .
The first crisis came in the form of a bout of illness .
The food was quite reasonable , Palestinian - style rice or bean or vegetable dishes apparently cooked in a flat just below my room .
I was frightened that I would just get sicker and sicker
But my European stomach could not cope either with what I was eating , or the dirty water .
But my European stomach could not cope either with what I was eating , or the dirty water .
Soon I could feel a swelling just below my ribs , and there were many trips to the small , foul - smelling toilet attached to my room , where the floor was always awash with water .
I was frightened that I would just get sicker and sicker , and I decided I must try to get some control over my diet .
In the first weeks I had occasionally been given potato chips , and I knew that even the toughest Gazan bacteria could not survive the sizzling oil that they were fried in .
So I asked just for a plate of chips each day , and for my water to be boiled .
And those simple elements , along with bread , tomatoes , some fruit and later eggs became the basis of my rather dull but safe two meals a day .
There was , though , never quite enough food , and I eventually lost 10kg ( 22lb ) .
I felt very , very far from home , trapped , and aghast at how dire my situation was
And always I worried - especially when I had a serious allergic reaction later on - that I might fall dangerously ill .
And always I worried - especially when I had a serious allergic reaction later on - that I might fall dangerously ill .
I was sure that , if it came to it , the Army of Islam would just let me fade away slowly rather than call off the kidnap because I was sick .
Return to top Report of my death
In those first , terrible days - the hardest that I have ever known - I worried very much about the impact my abduction would have on my elderly parents and my sister at home in Scotland .
And of course , with that wonderful clarity of hindsight , I deeply , deeply regretted having stayed in Gaza so long and having taken the risks that I had .
One of my lowest moments came during a power cut .
I lay in a dwindling pool of candlelight , listening to the shouting , rowing neighbours and occasional gunshots that are all part of the noisy clamour of Gaza 's poorer neighbourhoods .
I felt very , very far from home , trapped , and aghast at how dire my situation was .
Things were , however , just about to get a little better .

Desperate for some distraction to ease the psychological pressure , I had repeatedly asked for a radio , and amazingly , on the night of that power cut , a guard brought one into my room .
Desperate for some distraction to ease the psychological pressure , I had repeatedly asked for a radio , and amazingly , on the night of that power cut , a guard brought one into my room .
Suddenly I had a link with the outside world .
A voice in my cell , and something to listen to other than my own frightening thoughts .
And through the radio I became aware of the extraordinary , worldwide campaign that the BBC was mobilising on my behalf .
It was an enormous psychological boost .
And , most movingly , I realised that the vast majority of Palestinians were condemning the kidnappers .
Many people in Gaza seemed to appreciate that I had chosen to live among them for years in order to try to tell their story to the world .
But the radio also brought dreadful news .
In those calm , measured tones of the BBC , I heard reports of a claim that I had been executed .
I was sure that if I was to be put to death , the act would be video - taped in the style of Jihadi executions in Iraq
It was a shocking moment .
I had been declared dead .
It was a shocking moment .
I had been declared dead .
And I thought how appalling it was that my family should have to endure that .
But of course , I knew that I was far from dead , and after a few minutes I could not help recalling that famous Mark Twain line : " Reports of my death are exaggerated . "
I was worried though , that perhaps the announcement of my execution was just a little premature .
I knew that my kidnappers ' demands were not being met , and I thought that perhaps they had decided to kill me .
I felt that I needed to prepare myself for that possibility in the hours ahead .
I was sure that if I was to be put to death , the act would be video - taped in the style of Jihadi executions in Iraq .
My guard barged into my room with a set of manacles
If that was to be the last image my family and the world was to have of me - if at all possible - I did not want it to be one of a weeping , pleading , broken man .
If that was to be the last image my family and the world was to have of me - if at all possible - I did not want it to be one of a weeping , pleading , broken man .
So through that long night , I lay listening to every sound that might signal the coming of my assassins , and tried to gather the strength that I would need if the worst were to happen .
But at last the silence was broken by the dawn call to prayer .
The night was over .
Somehow I felt that the danger had passed , and I fell asleep .
But that was not the last time that death seemed a possibility .
Return to top
Threat to kill me A few weeks later my guard barged into my room with a set of manacles .
My wrists and ankles were chained together .
And the guard shut my window , and put off the light , leaving me in the dark to swelter in Gaza 's summer heat .
He told me that it was being decided whether I should be put to death in the days ahead .
If that was to happen , he said , my throat would be cut with a knife .
He told me that it was being decided whether I should be put to death in the days ahead .
If that was to happen , he said , my throat would be cut with a knife .
I did not quite believe the threat , but again , I had to prepare myself for the worst .
I am sure that different people approach something like that in different ways .
But I chose to rehearse in my mind exactly what might happen , hoping that somehow that would make the lead - up to any execution a little less shocking , a little less terrifying , and hoping that that might make it easier to preserve some kind of dignity in my final moments .
But mercifully , the crisis passed .
In fact , the chains came off after just 24 hours , and as the days went by , the threat of execution seemed to recede again .
Through all this I gradually came to know my guards .
One of them , a man in his mid-20s called Khamees , with a dark , quite handsome face , would be with me almost every day .
Right through to the kidnap 's frightening climax .
Khamees had matured into a battle - hardened , urban guerrilla .
Like many young men who I had met in Gaza , Khamees was the son of a family that had either fled or been driven from their home in what is now Israel .
Like many young men who I had met in Gaza , Khamees was the son of a family that had either fled or been driven from their home in what is now Israel .
He had been raised in the poverty of one of Gaza 's intensely crowded cities , and been drawn to the militant groups that had fought the occupying Israeli army .
Khamees had matured into a battle - hardened urban guerrilla .
He walked with a limp and had a slightly misshapen torso , the legacy of a wound inflicted by the Israelis .
But they were not his only enemy .
He had trouble too with both of Gaza 's main factions , Hamas and Fatah .
After worrying about them so much it was a vast relief to see my father make a powerful and dignified address
He was a wanted man , and he almost never left the succession of flats that were my prisons .
He was a wanted man , and he almost never left the succession of flats that were my prisons .
He lived confined to the shadows - almost literally , in the second of our hideouts - where the shutters on the windows were kept closed and I did not see the sun for nearly three months .
Khamees would exercise by pacing up and down the gloomy corridor , counting the laps on his prayer beads .
He spent countless hours flipping through the Arabic satellite television channels , and often , far into the night , he would sit in a pale blue robe , reading aloud from the Koran .
Occasionally he would let me go through to his room and watch television for an hour or two .
And one day he allowed me to see my parents make a televised appeal for my release .
After worrying about them so much , it was a vast relief to see my father make a powerful and dignified address .
And although my mother did not speak , when I looked into her eyes I was somehow sure that she too had the strength to cope .
I felt very bad at having brought the worst of the world 's troubles crashing through my parents ' peaceful lives , far away on the west coast of Scotland .
My kidnappers - the most frightening kind of people - were putting them under appalling pressure , and all of Britain was watching .
But my parents were not being broken .
They were , in Dad 's words , " hanging in there " - and for me , it was their finest hour .
To let me see my parents on television was an act of kindness on the part of my guard .
And there were certainly others .
Return to top Dark and violent guard
In the second of our four hideouts - where I was held longest - Khamees allowed the regime to become quite lax .
A number of times , tiny things sent Khamees into frightening rages
My door was left unlocked so that I could go to a bathroom and even use a kitchen next to my room , where eventually I was boiling water and fixing very simple meals for myself twice a day .
My door was left unlocked so that I could go to a bathroom and even use a kitchen next to my room , where eventually I was boiling water and fixing very simple meals for myself twice a day .
And there were moments when Khamees would be friendly , when we would talk a little about Gaza , and about politics or Islam .
But mostly I will remember Khamees as a dark and moody figure .
Often , for days at a time , he barely spoke to me , refusing to respond if I said hello .
Handing me my food , he would just glare at me hard , saying nothing , and a number of times tiny things sent him into frightening rages that I came to dread .
It was often easy to imagine that he saw me as a great burden , and that he loathed me .
And when he smashed me in the face in the final moments of the kidnap , I felt that with Khamees , perhaps , all along violence had never been far below the surface .
As the weeks drifted by , and I paced through my wasteland of time , my thoughts often ranged back across my life .
I filled many empty hours reflecting on periods in my childhood and phases of my career .
I tried to work out the roots of certain aspects of my character .
And I thought hard again about why one or two particularly important relationships in my past had worked , but then eventually lost their way .
But much of my mental energy went into the huge effort to confront my many anxieties , the struggle as I saw it , to keep my mind in the right place .
I tried to strangle damaging , negative thoughts almost as they emerged , before they could take hold and drive me down
I felt very strongly that in the kidnapping I was facing the greatest challenge of my life , and I knew that I would perhaps always measure myself by the way I met it , or failed to meet it .
I felt very strongly that in the kidnapping I was facing the greatest challenge of my life , and I knew that I would perhaps always measure myself by the way I met it , or failed to meet it .
I told myself that in my captivity there was only one thing that I might be able to control - my state of mind .
And I struggled to persuade myself that bouts of depression did nothing to change the hard realities of my situation , they only weakened me .
I tried to strangle damaging , negative thoughts almost as they emerged , before they could take hold and drive me down .
And positive thoughts had to be encouraged .
Return to top Psychological battle
Of course , at first glance , there was not much to take heart from in my situation .
But the fact was that I had not been killed , and I was not being beaten around .
I was being fed reasonably , and I decided that my conditions could have been much , much worse .
Whatever else it was , my Gazan incarceration was not what Iraqi prisoners had been forced to endure at Abu Ghraib jail .
It was not the Russian Gulag , and it certainly was not the Nazi death camps .
I felt that I would not be able to pick up a book again about the Holocaust without feeling a sense of shame , if I were somehow to break down mentally under the very , very , very much easier circumstances of my captivity .
I thought too that , unfortunately , every day around the world , people are being told that they have cancer , and that they only have a year or two to live .
But the vast majority of them find the strength to face the end of their lives with dignity and courage .
I , on the other hand , was just waiting for my life to begin again , and I told myself that it would be shameful if I could not conduct myself with some grace in the face of my much lesser challenge .
And in its search for inspiration , my mind took me down what may sound to you like some rather strange paths .
But for me , as impressive as any story of endurance , is that of the explorer , Ernest Shackleton .
Shackleton and six of his crew spent 16 days crossing 1,300 km of ocean
After his ship was crushed by the Antarctic ice nearly a century ago , he took a tiny lifeboat and set out across the great wastes of the stormy Southern Ocean .
He aimed for an almost unimaginably small island far beyond his horizon , and eventually he reached it .
After his ship was crushed by the Antarctic ice nearly a century ago , he took a tiny lifeboat and set out across the great wastes of the stormy Southern Ocean .
He aimed for an almost unimaginably small island far beyond his horizon , and eventually he reached it .
And in my prison , I felt that I needed some kind of mental lifeboat , to help me cross the great ocean of time that lay before me , aiming for that almost unimaginable moment far beyond my horizon when I might somehow go free .
And so I took all the positive thoughts I could muster and lashed them together in my mind , like planks in a psychological raft that I hoped would buoy me up .
And in some ways it did .
It was one of several mental devices , or tricks , or props that helped me get through .
In this way , I fought what was the psychological battle of my life .
God knows , it was hard , and lonely , and there were many dark passages when I edged close to despair .
But I was always in the fight , and there was no collapse .
Eventually Gaza 's violent politics suddenly shifted against my kidnappers .
The powerful Hamas and Fatah factions began a fight to the death .
Hour after hour , I lay listening to machine gun and rocket fire in the streets around the apartment block where I was being held .
Bad enough , I felt , to be kidnapped , but worse still to be lost in a place that had descended into all - out war .
Eventually though , Hamas managed to seize complete control .
It immediately set about imposing what it would regard as order on Gaza , and it made ending my high - profile kidnapping a priority .
For the first time , my captors seemed shaken , and uncertain - but they had a plan .
Return to top Terrifying ride Khamees came into my room with a plain , black briefcase , of a kind that you might see any accountant carry on the London underground .
The Army of Islam released two videos of Alan Johnston
But he opened it to reveal a suicide bomber 's vest , with panels of explosives that closed tight around my stomach as I pulled it on .
But he opened it to reveal a suicide bomber 's vest , with panels of explosives that closed tight around my stomach as I pulled it on .
In a letter , the leader - the masked man from the first night - said that I needed to be afraid .
He said that Hamas was planning an assault that would turn the hideout into what he called " a death zone " .
The message I had to give via a video camera - dressed in my deadly contraption - was that if there was an attack , I too would die .
But still Hamas was closing in , and the Army of Islam prepared for a showdown .
A machine gun nest was set up just under the room where I was being held .
And I could hear the group 's fighters scramble to their battle stations below me , during an exchange of fire , as Hamas forces probed their defences .
I knew that if Hamas stormed the apartment block it would come with all guns blazing , and I might well die in the assault .
And even if Hamas did not kill me accidentally , there would be a danger that the kidnappers - furious and frightened and about to die themselves - might shoot me to prevent me being rescued alive .
Then suddenly , late one night , I was taken downstairs .
A hood was put over my head , and I was led stumbling out into the darkness as members of the gang began to hit me and slam me against walls and the side of a car , before I was shoved into its back seat .
The kidnappers and the powerful clan that was protecting them , seemed to have buckled under the Hamas pressure .
They had agreed to deliver me up , in return for their survival .
But I did not know that , as the car began to move slowly towards the Hamas lines - and the most terrifying ride of my life began .
It seemed that a gun battle might erupt at any moment and the car would be filled with bullets
My guards , with their Kalashnikov rifles on either side of me , were screaming angry - furious , no doubt , at the failure of the kidnap and scared , perhaps , that Hamas would kill them anyway , whatever the deal .
My guards , with their Kalashnikov rifles on either side of me , were screaming angry - furious , no doubt , at the failure of the kidnap and scared , perhaps , that Hamas would kill them anyway , whatever the deal .
Khamees struck at my head , and I could taste blood in my mouth .
At one of the checkpoints , through the wool of my mask , I could see the muzzle of a rifle inches from my eye and I knew that the guard on my right was roaring that he would put a bullet in my brain if the Hamas men did not back off .
In the extraordinary tension and the confusion it seemed that a gun battle might erupt at any moment and the car would be filled with bullets .
Return to top I 'm going to be fine Eventually we came to a halt , and Khamees dragged me out into the road .
Alan 's friend Fayed Abu Shamalla ( right ) was present at the handover I looked up to see the alleyway filled with armed men standing in the street light .
Two of them stepped forward and led me away .
I looked up to see the alleyway filled with armed men standing in the street light .
Two of them stepped forward and led me away .
I was afraid that this was some new gang to which I had now been passed on .
But actually these were Hamas men , and as we turned a corner , there , standing in a garden , was my old friend and colleague , Fayed Abu Shamalla of the BBC Arabic service .
Only then did I know that my kidnap was over , and that I was free .
Days later , I was back in Scotland , taking that road that I know so well - heading at last for the hills of Argyll , and my family .
And there , in our house by the sea - in that beautiful , peaceful place - all that happened to me in Gaza began to slide into the past .
But the experience of incarceration does have a way of lingering , of haunting the nights .
I dream sometimes that I am in captivity again , and I cannot tell you how good it is to wake and gradually realise that , actually , I am free .
Safe , back at home , on the shores of Loch Goil .
But the nightmares come less frequently now .
And although psychologists might say that these are still quite early days , I very much believe that I am going to be fine .
Alan returned to the UK on 7 July And the kidnap 's legacy is not all bad .
And the kidnap 's legacy is not all bad .
With its locks and chains , its solitary confinement and moments of terror , it was a kind of dark education .
I lived through things which before I would have struggled to imagine and maybe , in the end , I will be stronger for that .
I have gained too a deeper sense of the value of freedom .
Perhaps only if you have ever been some kind of prisoner , can you truly understand its worth .
Even now , more than three months after I was freed , it can still seem faintly magical to do the simplest things , like walk down a street in the sunshine , or sit in a cafe with a newspaper .
And in my captivity in Gaza , I learnt again that oldest of lessons .
That in life , all that really , really matters , are the people you love .

It appears that we must toss the previously - blogged tale of Nazi Sex Doll Borghild ( Link ) on the dungheap of internet hoaxdom .
Boing Boing reader Rochus Wolff says of the fabled proto - robo - ho :
I came across the story about these dolls about a year ago after a Canadian researcher sent an email around asking whether anyone knew anything about this doll apart from what it said on the ( now mostly defunct ) site borghild .de .
After reading your post , i researched the matter a bit further .
The origin of the information that led to your post ( via Fleshbot and other blogs ) seems to be an article by the widely read but often less - than - accurately - reporting German daily Bild .
All the information given is what can be found on the rather odd website borghild .de – the " information " given there can still be found here in an English translation .
Independently of each other , Jens Baumeister and I have concluded from the information available to us , that the " Borghild " story is quite probably a fake .
( The German posting on my research is here .
Jens has posted his results here .
Some of his findings are translated here : Link ) .
The main problems with " Borghild " are :
– There is no evidence that any of the documents the text talks about ever existed .
The Deutsche Hygiene Museum says that of course most records were destroyed in an attack in 1945 , but that still no one they talked seems to remember anything about this project .
The photographs on borghild .
de are clearly fabrications , and the site even acknowledges that .
– The author of borghild .de , " Norbert Lenz " , claims to have worked for a number of German magazines – all of which claim not to know a journalist by that name .
He is not listed in phone directories , and the only book currently available in Germany by a Norbert Lenz is a book about – ducks .
So in the end it seems like the Nazis were not , after all , planning to equip their soldiers with sex dolls .
That hardly comes as a surprise .
Yours truly ,

Psychological Operations during the Israel - Lebanon War 2006 By SGM Herbert A. Friedman ( Ret . )
On 12 July 2006 Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon crossed the border into Israel , killed eight soldiers and abducted two others .
Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said that a prisoner exchange was the only way to secure the release of the soldiers , who he said were being held in a " secure and remote " location .
" No military operation will return them , " he said .
" The prisoners will not be returned except through one way : indirect negotiations and a trade . "
The Israelis do not negotiate and in general do not trade with terrorists .
Israeli forces retaliated against Hezbollah strongholds in Southwest Lebanon the same day .
They sent troops across the border to search for the missing men .
This rapidly escalated into a full - scale invasion and a surprisingly strong defensive reaction by Hezbollah who had thousands of rockets instead of the hundreds that Israel probably expected .
Hezbollah even had an estimated eight or nine drones produced by Iran .
Their bunkers were equipped with computers and video systems that were able to watch Israeli military movement .
Their bunkers were dug deep into the ground and fortified .
Israeli forces struck Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah 's office and home in Beirut 's Shiite - dominant southern suburbs , prompting the leader of the " Party of God " to declare " open war " against the Jewish state .
This article is not about the war .
We will mention some pertinent points briefly , but this article is about the psychological operations conducted by the Israeli Defense Forces and the Hezbollah Party .
Readers who are interested in the military aspect of this short 34 - day war must look elsewhere .
I should also point out that translations differ , and in some cases the text does not translate to proper English .
I have tried to give a translation of the message that is what I believe the PSYOP troops wanted to convey to the target audience and edited the grammar where needed .
Readers will note that many of the leaflets are without translation at present .
Any Arabic - speaking reader who might care to translate a leaflet and send the information to the author is thanked in advance .
During the Israeli retaliatory raids and invasion of Lebanon , the Israeli Defense Forces dropped a great number of leaflets on an almost daily basis .
The leaflets were dropped from fighter aircraft using leaflets bombs , in containers on parachutes , and from helicopters .
There are reports of them being disseminated by artillery shells both from land and naval ships , and one photograph showing a fragment of what is reported to be part of an American propaganda artillery shell may prove that the reports are true .
They had dropped leaflets in the past , but never to the extent that they did in July and August 2006 .
During the conflict , there were 47 leaflet missions over Lebanon , with a total of more then 17,000,000 leaflets dropped .
In addition to that , more then 700,000 computerized voice messages were delivered to citizens in Lebanon .
The Israeli Army reactivated its Psychological Warfare Unit and in a rare televised news broadcast they allowed a 20 - year old unnamed female cartoonist to be photographed from the back as she designed leaflets showing the Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah as a snake or a scorpion with text that said that Nasrallah is leading Lebanon to ruin and is the blame for all the death and destruction .
Many of the leaflets are brightly colored in pink or yellow and many contain cartoons and caricatures .
Among the leaflets displayed were some that will be mentioned in this article and some that are yet unknown .
They are ;
The Hezbollah leader as a puppet holding two rockets ;
Nine white tombstones on a black background ;
The Hezbollah leader as a spider in the center on a web ;
The Hezbollah leader hiding while Lebanese civilians are killed by four explosions ,
The face of the Hezbollah leader showing shock and awe ; The Hezbollah leader behind three bound Lebanese civilians , and The Hezbollah leader walking off a cliff pulling a cedar of Lebanon ( the national symbol ) behind him .
Curiously , each of these prospective leaflets has its propaganda text in Hebrew .
We assume that since the artist was Jewish she added the text to the leaflet in her own language , and if and when they were approved for dissemination and forwarded to the printers for mass production the text would have been translated into Arabic by a trained Israeli linguist .
We should point out that at the same time Israel was dropping leaflets on Lebanon they were also dropping leaflets on other contested areas such as Gaza .
For instance , the following leaflet had been dropped the previous September over the Gaza Strip .
To the residents of the northern Gaza Strip
The terrorist actions originating from your areas are forcing the Israel Defense Forces to respond harshly to those who are subjecting the citizens of the State of Israel to danger .
We call on the Palestinian Authority to shoulder its responsibility to prevent these criminal acts .
We warn you of the danger of remaining in the areas which are being used to launch terrorist actions and we advise you to leave your homes .
We are not responsible for the consequences if you ignore our warning .
Israel Defense Forces
It is also worth noting that Israel had invaded Lebanon before .
On 6 June 1982 the Israeli Defense Forces entered Southern Lebanon in response to an assassination attempt against Shlomo Argov , Israel 's ambassador to the United Kingdom and artillery attacks by the Palestine Liberation Organization against Northern Israel .
During the first week of Israel 's operations in Lebanon , Syrian troops engaged in battles with Israeli forces .
The Israelis destroyed or damaged 18 of the 19 Syrian missile batteries and , in one day , shot down 29 Syrian MiG fighters without the loss of a single plane .
The operation was called " Peace for Galilee " and the Israelis occupied southern Lebanon until June 1985 .
Curiously , this invasion is claimed to be the reason for the creation of the Iranian and Syrian supported Hezbollah organization , which replaced the PLO in Southern Lebanon .
The IDF dropped leaflets on Lebanon during the 1982 to 1985 period .
On bright pink leaflet is all text : Announcement to the inhabitants of the southern villages
Due to the increase in terrorist activity and the launching of missiles from the south into Israel , the Israeli Defense Forces will act to curtail these activities .
Calm must prevail on both sides of the border People !
If you want to pursue your day to day life in peace you must cease providing assistance to those engaging in terrorist acts or those helping them , and you should take it upon yourself to insure that no terrorist activity takes place in your area .
Do n't allow your homes to become terrorist dens against Israel or the price will be very costly for all of you both collectively and individually .
It is in your hands to stop the destruction and death .
There will be no excuse for those who have been forewarned .
The Commander of the Northern Israeli Defense Force
For the purposes of this article we will only discuss psychological operations of the Israeli - Lebanon war of 2006 .
Israeli aircraft have been dropping leaflets since shortly after fighting began on July 12 .
Most of them were either against Hezbollah and its leader sheik Hassan Nasrallah , or called on residents to leave border villages .
It is possible that the same leaflet was dropped on more than one occasion .
For instance , we know that on at least five instances the same leaflet was dropped on multiple days .
The dissemination of the same leaflet on more than one occasion occurred on 21 July and 23 July ; 24 July and 30 July ; 29 July , 1 August , 4 August , 5 August , and 12 August ; and 3 August and 10 August .
On 13 July , Israeli warplanes dropped thousands of leaflets over South Beirut urging residents to stay away from the group 's offices and buildings .
The leaflet is all - text and says :
To the Inhabitants of Lebanon Due to the terrorist activities carried out by Hezbollah which destroys the effort to find a brighter future for Lebanon .
The Israeli Army will continue its work within Lebanon for as long as it deems fit to protect the citizens of the State of Israel .
For your own safety and because we do not wish to cause any more civilian deaths , you are advised to avoid all places frequented by Hezbollah .
You should know that the continuation of terrorist activities against the State of Israel will be considered a double - edged sword for you and Lebanon .
The State of Israel On 15 July , Israeli planes dropped packages of leaflets on downtown Beirut attacking Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and depicting him as a Cobra with his black turban rolled into the shape of the snake 's hood and about to swallow the Lebanese capital .
The text of the green leaflet is :
To the Lebanese people , Beware !!!
He appears to be a brother , but he is a snake .
A second version of the same leaflet was dropped the same day , this is almost identical except that there are some minor changes in the cobra 's hood and there is no text to the left of the snake .
A third leaflet was dropped on 15 July depicting the Hezbollah leader at the lower right in a bunker while four explosions killed Lebanese civilians out in the open and warned that Israel would increase its bombardment of Hezbollah : Let it be known that continued terrorism against Israel will not allow you to be in peace .
At the same time , Israel pounded the political headquarters of Hezbollah and the party 's television station , al - Manar .
On 16 July , Israeli warplanes dropped two different propaganda leaflets over southern Lebanon warning of more attacks .
The first leaflet includes references to President Bashar Assad of Syria , Hamas chief Khaled Meshaal and Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
In this leaflet Hassan Nasrallah is a cobra is dancing to the tune of the flute - playing leaders of Iran , Syria and the Palestinian group Hamas .
The cartoon shows two bombs within the cobra 's hood , while the foreign leaders sit cross-legged on a map of Lebanon .
The Nasrallah - snake says : Need any favors ?
The second leaflet is all text and was dropped over downtown Beirut :
To the Residents of Lebanon The Israeli army will increase its actions in Lebanon against the continuing terrorist actions of Hezbollah to defend the citizens of the state of Israel .
For the sake of your own safety , and in our wish not to harm any civilians that are not implicated , you must keep away from the locations where Hezbollah is present and acting against the state of Israel .
Including : Locations where missiles are fired in the direction of the state of Israel .
Locations of Hezbollah 's arsenals and military equipment .
Hezbollah 's centers south of Beirut and areas under its control in the south of Lebanon .
Beirut 's southern suburb , the center of terrorism .
The Israeli defense army calls on the Lebanese residents and Lebanese army to refrain from aiding , either directly or indirectly , elements of Hezbollah .
Anyone who does will be putting their life in danger .
Know that the persistence of terrorism against the state of Israel is keeping you from a better future .
The State of Israel Lebanese and Arab newspapers featured photographs of civilians sweeping up the leaflets and citizens burning them in public .
Lebanese television broadcast what Hezbollah claimed was an Israeli helicopter gunship falling to the ground near the Lebanese capital on 17 July .
The Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation said that it was an F - 16 fighter jet .
The Israeli military stated that none of its aircraft were shot down over Beirut and the object shown burning and crashing was a container of propaganda leaflets dropping from an Israeli plane .
This all - text leaflet has the following text :
To the People of Lebanon Hezbollah declared war on Israel .
We all know Israel 's enormous power and ability to mobilize her forces against terrorist organizations whenever necessary .
People of Lebanon :
If you sleep in a cemetery , you are bound to have nightmares .
Israel is a powerful nation and determined to do whatever necessary to ensure the safety of her citizens !!!
The State of Israel Brigidier General Miri Regev , the Israeli army 's chief spokeswoman stated on TV that the Israeli Defense Forces dropped leaflets on 17 July warning residents of southern Lebanon to flee the area ahead of an impending attack .
Similar leaflets had been dropped for the past week warning civilians to evacuate the area .
On 18 July the Israelis dropped leaflets depicting Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah as a puppet .
It is interesting to note that like the " cobra " leaflet depicted above , they were dropped with and without accompanying text .
The hands that control the Hezbollah leader are labeled " Syria " and " Iran . "
The text is : To Lebanese citizens How long ?
How long will you be marionettes in the hands of Syria and Iran ?
How long will Hezbollah , the Fifth Column , continue to put your independence and safety in danger ?
Hezbollah and its leader are hurting the peace and prosperity of Lebanon that was created after a great effort .
Israel will continue to use all of its power to strike Hezbollah and to bring peace back to the area .
The State of Israel An all - text leaflet was also dropped on 18 July .
The message is : Hassan , what are you afraid of ?
You are afraid of appearing in public and you broadcast recorded speeches .
You fled to your shelter and you left your men frightened and exposed in the face of Israel 's power .
You carry out the orders of your masters and you break your promises to the people of Lebanon causing them painful losses .
How long must the people of Lebanon pay for your cowardice and arrogance ?
Warning leaflets were airdropped on 19 July over the villages of Al Bazurya and Avasya in southern Lebanon to advise residents of coming IDF strikes on missile launch sites and cautioning that anyone near the sites is there at significant risk to their life .
The leaflet text is :
To the People of Lebanon Please follow the instructions below !!!
The Israeli Defense Force will intensify the targeting of all areas from which rockets are launched against Israel .
Everyone in the area will be under extreme danger !
As well as that , any pick - up truck or heavy vehicles moving south of the Litani river will be considered a suspicious vehicle transporting rockets and military equipment and will be a potential target for attack by the Israeli Defense Force .
Therefore , the above will be under extreme danger .
The State of Israel On 19 July the Israelis dropped a leaflet showing the Hezbollah leaders walking off a cliff , pulling the symbolic cedar tree of Lebanon behind him .
We are standing on the edge of the abyss - and we are determined to march forward ( Note ) the word the Israelis used for " abyss " in their original Hebrew - language test leaflet is the biblical one used in Genesis for the pre-creation void .
On 20 July , Israel dropped leaflets entitled " All for Lebanon " offering " attractive material rewards " to people who give information about Hezbollah that helps the Jewish state 's offensive against the guerrillas .
The rewards could be anything from cash to a new house .
The leaflet is similar to the " All4Lebanon " computer Internet website ( see below ) .
The leaflet depicts a Cedar of Lebanon at the left and is all text at the right .
A very rough translation of the text in part is : A brief message to the Lebanese people
We turn to all those who can and want to help Lebanon , to remove the Hezbollah scar from your hearts and the heart of Lebanon , and to return to the previous period of independence and achievement .
Put aside sayings and slogans and contact us at the following addresses .

Secrecy is guaranteed and the reward we offer is tempting .
We would accept with great appreciation any information that can contribute to restoring quiet to the area , so that we can fight terrorists efficiently and carefully .
Please help us so that we can help you protect Lebanon from this evil , and return life to the normal routine .
For your own wellbeing , contact us from places where no one knows you At the same time , there were a number of reports of Israel sending phone calls to Lebanese civilians .
Some of the calls are as early as 5:30 a.m .
They continue throughout the day with such recorded messages such as : Oh Lebanese people , we tell you not to follow Hezbollah .
We will continue to strike and no one will bring your prisoners back from Israel except the Lebanese government .
Hassan , have you realized yet that the Israeli army not as delicate as a spider 's web ?
It 's a web of steel that will strangle you !
This is the state of Israel .
This resistance ... is forcing you to stay at home like rats .
Who is it that 's putting your life in danger ?
Who is using you as human shields ?
We do n't want to harm you .
We 're bombing the infrastructure so Hezbollah will have no means of firing its rockets .
We know you wanted to hit Israel , but you have confronted a house made of steel .
This is the Israel Defense Forces .
Other calls indicated that the Israeli state would not stop the attacks and asking everyone to leave the area south of the Litani .
Meanwhile , an Israeli source ( possibly Israeli Intelligence ) uploaded the Internet website All4Lebanon.org with a logo in the Lebanese national colors of red , white , and green incorporating a cedar tree and text in Arabic , English , and French .
The website is an Israeli " grey " propaganda operation and the server for the website is NS .
BARAK .
NET .IL which was registered on 19 July 2006 .
Some of the website message is :
Let us not be content with words !
Whoever is able and willing to help Lebanon eradicate Hezbollah 's evil and get back its independence , freedom and prosperity , whoever has information that could promote this purpose , is hereby invited to contact us at one of the addresses listed below .
You may enter your personal details , but you can also provide your information anonymously .
Secrecy and appropriate financial reward are guaranteed .
Any information that will help us restore peace in the area and fight terror carefully and effectively would be welcome .
Help us root out this evil and restore normal life to all the people who live in the region .
For your own safety , please contact us from places where no one knows you .
Two phone numbers are listed along with one Internet address .
Some of these operations are mentioned by retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Tim Thomas said in an article entitled " Hezbollah , Israel , and Cyber PSYOP . "
The LTC invents some interesting words and definitions and I thought it might be worth adding his thoughts : … An evolving cyber phenomenon is underway : the concept of cyber psychological operations — which are cyber operations ( those that use the computer chip ) that aim to directly attack and influence the attitudes and behaviors of soldiers and the general population .
While armies continue to compete in digital battle space , local populations are now caught up in digital influence space battles .
As a result armies can no longer stand between an enemy and the public as they once did …
During the recent fighting in Lebanon … in addition to the normal leaflet delivery " propaganda bombs , " the Israeli's were using " E - flets . "
What is an E - flet ?
It is a leaflet type message that appears on the Internet , usually through URL links to a website .
In one case , a website gave the appearance of being Lebanese in content ( a red , green , and white Lebanese flag ) .
It was accompanied by bombastic patriotic statements to rise against Hezbollah .
But the site had a +881 satellite number to call instead of a Lebanese number , and the server was NS .
BARAK .
NET.IL .
On 21 July and again on 23 July , Israeli planes dropped leaflets warning residents to flee for safety beyond the Litani River , about 13 miles from the border .
This was made more difficult after an Israeli air strike hit one of the few remaining crossings over the river early the previous day , trapping hundreds of cars on the southern bank .
The leaflets say :
To the People in the Villages South of al - Litani River Because of terrorist activities made from inside your villages and your homes against the State of Israel .
The Israeli Defense Forces must react directly and immediately against these activities inside your villages .
You must immediately leave your villages for your safety The State of Israel A second almost identical leaflet was dropped with just two minor additions to make the instructions more clear and tell the Lebanese exactly where the Israelis wanted them to go :
To the People in the Villages South of al - Litani River Because of terrorist activities made from inside your villages and your homes against the State of Israel .
The Israel Defense Forces must respond directly and immediately against these activities inside your villages .
For your safety !!!
You are ordered to immediately evacuate your villages and move north of the al - Litani River .
The State of Israel On 22 July , Israeli planes dropped leaflets over the southern city of Tyre .
The leaflets depict Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah hiding behind a Lebanese family represented by a husband , wife and son in bondage .
The husband clearly represents Lebanon since a cedar tree is depicted on his shirt .
The text is :
Your defenders are your destroyers
There is a second version of this leaflet that is almost identical except that it contains one added line .
That leaflet was dropped on 25 July .
Two more all - text leaflets were dropped on 23 July .
One was the warning leaflet for residents to flee for safety beyond the Litani River first dropped on 21 July , the other is an all text leaflet .
To Hezbollah Supporters Hassan continues to mislead you Hassan is claiming that the leadership of Hezbollah is determined to work for your safety but why does n't he show himself to you instead of hanging his picture around Beirut ?
Where is Naeem Qassim ?
Where is Ibrahim Amin Alsayed ?
Where is Hashim Safeydeen ?
Hassan says that only one or two rocket launchers have been destroyed .
If Hassan came out of his hideout for a second , he would know that many rocket launchers have been destroyed and many people have died .
In his latest speech , Hassan attacked Arab leaders and ignored the international community .
Is this what you want for Lebanon ?
To be isolated , surrounded and entirely under the mercy of Syria and Iran ?
The only truth in his speech is that this is only the start .
The three individuals named , also known as " Naeem Qassim , " " Ibrahim Ameen Al Sayyed " and " Hashim Safa El Deen " are the senior leadership of Hezbollah .
Leaflets were dropped on Sidon , south Lebanon , on 24 July .
Fragments of an American - made antiquated M129 leaflet bomb were found and numerous photographs of the fragment were published around the world .
The same leaflet was dropped again on 30 July .
The text is reported to be : To Hezbollah militia activists :
Do you really think that the battlefield looks like the propaganda clips on Al - Manar TV , and that you could sprint so fast and easily up the highest hills ?
Did you believe your leaders , who told you that those facing you are nothing but spider webs easily torn down by you ?
They lied to you all these years ; they are lying to you now .
You know very well that you were sent like sheep to be butchered , lacking military training and without proper combat gear .
You know very well that the reassuring words of your leaders are not sufficient for a resilient stand against highly trained soldiers that fight to protect their homeland , their people and their home .
You are nothing but mercenaries , and the Lebanese people do not support you .
Run as far as you can , save your souls .
[ Note : Al - Manar ( The Beacon ) is a television station based in Beirut , Lebanon .
It was launched by Hezbollah in 1991 with funding from Iran .
Al - Manar calls itself the " station of resistance , " and is instrumental in what Hezbollah calls its psychological warfare against the Israelis .
In 2004 , the station was estimated to be viewed by 10 - 15 million people daily worldwide .
Its programming is geared to keep the Arab world focused on the Palestinian - Israeli conflict , and since the U.S. invasion of Iraq , the US occupation of that country . ]
At the same time , The Guardian Unlimited published a report that Israel is directing a multimedia propaganda campaign at the besieged people of Southern Lebanon .
Mobile phone users are being bombarded with text messages and phone calls , and a local radio station has suddenly had reports broadcast from the Israeli government 's point of view .
Each day Israeli planes drop " propaganda bombs " , which burst to send leaflets fluttering down on to streets and rooftops .
Leaflets dropped yesterday morning described the Hezbollah leader , Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah , as a coward who hid in a cave while the Lebanese people suffered the consequences of his actions .
" He has attacked Arab leaders and ignored the international community ; is this what you want for Lebanon ? " it asked .
Meanwhile mobile phone users regularly receive messages sent to their phones which appear as news updates , attempting to discredit Nasrallah or the party he leads .
Titled " News . " a message sent early yesterday reported that the Hezbollah leader had prepared a secure bunker for himself and other senior Hezbollah officials to flee to in Syria .
The Israeli forces have also resurrected the old Voice of Lebanon radio station , once operated by Israel 's military ally the South Lebanon Army before it was defeated by Hezbollah in 2000 .
Previously funded by Israel , frequency 103.7 is once again broadcasting the Israeli line .
" Why do those people blame Israel for defending itself against terrorism ? " the commentator asks in Arabic .
" Why should we let terrorists bomb our homes ? "
Another interesting leaflet dropped on 24 July is probably the only one produced by the Israelis in both black and white and full color .
It uses an old adage to warn the Lebanese people that creatures that kill cannot change their nature .
The light - green leaflet depicts Hassan as a scorpion crossing a river on the back of a frog , symbolically Lebanon .
The frog asks the scorpion :
Why , why are you stinging me ?
Hassan answers :
To sting is my nature .
This leaflet is based on an old Aesop 's fable :
The Scorpion and the Frog A scorpion and a frog meet on the bank of a stream and the scorpion asks the frog to carry him across on its back .
The frog asks , " How do I know you wo n't sting me ? "
The scorpion says , " Because if I do , I will die too . "
The frog is satisfied , and they set out , but in midstream , the scorpion stings the frog .
The frog feels the onset of paralysis and starts to sink , knowing they both will drown , but has just enough time to gasp " Why ? "
Replies the scorpion : " It 's my nature ... "
According to a 1967 edition of Reader 's Digest ,
There is a Lebanese version of the story that tells of a scorpion on the bank of the Nile who asked a frog to ferry him to the other side with the same results .
In another Lebanese version of the story the frog swam across the Jordan River .
Half way across the Jordan , the scorpion fatally stung the frog .
When asked " Why did you do that ? " the scorpion responded with the wisdom of the ages : " It 's the Middle East . "
The meaning of the Israeli leaflet is clear .
No matter how generous Hezbollah is , how much money they give to the poor , how much food they distribute to the hungry , or how much they claim to be a legitimate political party , they are simply killers and will never change .
As we stated earlier , the second version of the Nasrallah hiding behind the Lebanese family with added text was dropped on 25 July .
At the same time , the Israelis reminded the international press that they had asked the Lebanese to leave the area for their safety .
The text to the right of the vignette is :
To all citizens south of the Litani River Due to the terror activities being carried out against the State of Israel from within your villages and homes , the IDF is forced to respond immediately against these activities , even within your villages .
For your safety !!!
We call upon you to evacuate your villages for your safety and move north of the Litani River .
The State of Israel On 26 July a leaflet showing the Hezbollah leader behind a spider web was dropped by Israeli aircraft .
He promised you that Israel would be a spider 's web ... but he encountered a web of steel .
( Note )
In another Israeli leaflet we see a similar statement : Hassan , have you realized yet that the Israeli army not as delicate as a spider 's web ?
It 's a web of steel that will strangle you !
Problems with the United Nations UNIFIL force started to appear about the end of July .
Some of these are mentioned in the Harvard University paper , The Israeli- Hezbollah War of 2006 : The Media as a Weapon in Asymmetrical Conflict , Marvin Kalb , February , 2007 .
The author states : UNIFIL was the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon .
It consisted of roughly 2,000 troops stationed along the Lebanese - Israeli border from 1978 until the end of the 2006 war .
Its mandate required " full impartiality and objectivity . "
During the war , it published information on its official website about Israeli troop movements , information that in military circles might well be regarded as " actionable intelligence . "
Take , for instance , its posting of July 25 , 2006 : " Yesterday and during last night , the IDF ( Israeli Defense Forces ) moved significant reinforcements , including a number of tanks , armored personnel carriers , bulldozers and infantry , to the area of Marun Al Ras inside Lebanese territory .
The IDF advanced from that area north towards Bint Jubayl and south towards Yarun . "
Or , it 's posting of July 24 , which disclosed that IDF forces stationed between Marun Al Ras and Bint Jubayl were " significantly reinforced during the night and this morning with a number of tanks and armored personnel carriers . "
It was part of UNIFIL 's responsibility to report violations of the ceasefire , including troop movements , to the U.N. , but presumably this information was to be conveyed through confidential channels , not on the Internet , where the information in wartime could be as valuable as hard , military intelligence suddenly exposed to the light .
On 26 July , Israel dropped leaflets on Sidon listing the names of nine Hezbollah fighters it claimed were killed in the battles .
Quote from Nasrallah : " We do n't have any dead or wounded . "
[ Nine headstones with the names of dead Hezbollah fighters ]
This is only a partial list !
He continues to deceive you !
( Note ) The Israelis will later drop leaflets mentioning 90 and 180 dead .
One wonders if the number 9 has any special significance .
Israeli TV also broadcast footage of troops transporting corpses in body bags which the military said were the bodies of Hezbollah fighters .
Meanwhile , Israel managed to intercept the satellite transmissions of Hezbollah 's al - Manar TV channel , replacing it with Israeli transmissions that reportedly showed Hezbollah command sites and rocket launching pads which Israel claimed it has raided .
Israeli technicians hacked the signal and replaced it with a 90 - second spot that begins with a gun sight superimposed on a crude drawing of Hezbollah 's leader , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , looking at the ground .
The image is punctuated by the sound of three gunshots and framed on the top with the words , " Your day is coming , coming , coming . "
The spot goes on to show Sheik Nasrallah giving a speech in which a voice says : " There is no doubt that this is the strongest air force in the area .
And we can't stand up against it . "
It features the view from Israeli bombers striking targets in Lebanon and ends with an announcer saying , " Nasrallah knows the truth , but he continues , as is his way , to drag Lebanon into destruction , to throw sand in your eyes . "
The New York Sun adds : Part of this is to instill fear , " the former senior Israel Defense Force official said .
" This is mostly aimed at the Hezbollah operative .
This is instilling fear . "
The official added , however , that the most effective part of the message was that it proved Israel could take over Hezbollah 's primary instrument of propaganda .
" If you could destroy Al - Manar , which we all know is a platform for destroying psychological order , it is one thing .
But better than destroying it is using it against them , " the official said .
The London Times stated on 28 July that Israel had encouraged Jewish students to track websites and chat rooms so that networks of US and European groups with hundreds of thousands of Jewish activists can place supportive messages .
Nearly 5,000 members of the World Union of Jewish Students have downloaded special " megaphone " software that alerts them to anti-Israeli chat rooms or internet polls to enable them to post contrary viewpoints .
" We 're saying to these people that if Israel is being bashed , do n't ignore it , change it , " Mr. Cline said .
" A poll like CNN 's takes just a few seconds to vote in , but if thousands take part the outcome will be changed .
What 's vital is that the international face of the conflict is balanced - Our problem is the foreign media shows Lebanese suffering , but not Israeli .
We 're bypassing that filter by distributing pictures showing how northern Israelis suffer from Katyusha rocket attacks . "
An Israeli attack on the village of Qana was heavily propagandized by Hezbollah because of the heavy death toll of more than 50 people killed , many of them children .
One man removed the blanket covering his daughter 's dead body and asked : " Is this a Hezbollah fighter ?
Are these missiles ? "
Many men yelled in the streets : " It 's America , its Israel . "
What is most interesting about this atrocity is that there is an excellent possibility that it is a Hezbollah disinformation operation .
If so , it was very well done .
Some of the discrepancies claimed for the photographs are the body count not holding up to reported 57 , Hezbollah might have been launching rockets from the top of the building that was destroyed , discrepancies in published photographs of rescue operations ( time stamps , evidence of staging ) , and photos and video that seem to show Hezbollah operating among the general population , using them as human shields .
Qana had been the site of a previous massacre , so it would be a perfect propaganda operation to cause an uprising of hate among the Muslim people .
However , you must remain cognizant that the concept of calling this a Hezbollah disinformation campaign might be , in fact , an Israeli disinformation campaign , so you pick your side and you hope that you are correct .
On 3 August 2006 , Human Rights Watch specifically accused Israel of war crimes .
The entire concept of the Israelis hitting civilian targets with an indiscriminate callousness amounting to war crimes can be called into question by simply reading Hezbollah 's own admissions .
On 27 May , Sheik Nasrallah had publicly stated that the guerrillas were hiding among the civilians : Hezbollah fighters live in their houses , in their schools , in their churches , in their fields , in their farms and in their factories .
You can't destroy them in the same way you would destroy an army .
Has the news been manipulated ?
Yes , there was a case of a Reuters photographer fired after one of the photographs by Adnan Hajj showed the aftermath of an Israeli air strike on an area of suburban Beirut .
It had been manipulated using Adobe PhotoShop software to show more and darker smoke rising from the buildings .
There were many comments from both sides after this photographer was found to have manipulated another photograph showing an Israeli jet fighter .
However , it must be remembered that he did not originate the photo ; he simply added smoke to add contrast .
It was a disturbing reminder that news photos can be tinkered with .
There are numerous other cases of photo fraud .
A New York Times slide show depicts two photos of a man assisting at the scene of a Beirut bombing .
He later pretends to be a dead man lying in the rubble .
An Associated Press photo shows the same Arab woman wailing about the destruction of her home by the Israelis on both 26 July and 5 August .
U.S. News & World Report shows a photo of what they claim is a Hezbollah fighter near a downed Israeli jet that is clearly burning automobile tires at a dump .
Other photos use emotional additions to increase the dramatic effect .
Four different published photos from major news services such as Reuters and the Associated Press all show bombed buildings in the background , while in the foreground we see pristine and perfectly clean objects such as a wedding dress , a child 's stuffed bear , Mickey Mouse and finally Minnie Mouse .
One Associated Press newscast showed no less than three pristine stuffed toys sitting in the ruins of a bombed building .
It is clear that many of these pictures taken by Arab photographers are meant to increase sympathy for Hezbollah .
Kalb points out : Ravi Nessman , the senior Jerusalem correspondent of the Associated Press , thought the influence of the bloggers , especially in the United States , was " unprecedented . "
When the bloggers discovered that photographs had been doctored , " the credibility of the bloggers … skyrocketed and our credibility plummeted .
After that everything that we did was suspect .
And that makes it very difficult to cover a war , to have honest people who are trying , who are not doctoring photographs … and have everything we say be examined , which is fair , but basically be questioned as a lie , and starting with that premise that the media is lying . "
The history of faked photos emanating from Lebanon goes back many years .
Dino A. Brugioni says in Photo Fakery , Brassey's , Virginia , 1999 : Palestinians working out of Beirut released a number of fake photos , many condemning the Israelis and other opponents .
As early as 1977 at its Oslo meeting , The International Press Institute examined fake photographs and captions coming from Beirut .
One photo of a supposed Israeli air raid made the front page of the Washington Post .
Careful examination of the photos shows that the bombers were mirror images .
Experts also concluded that the Israeli bomber shown could not have executed such a maneuver so close to the ground .
Another photo , which was awarded a prize in 1977 , bore the caption , " One can see how an old Palestinian woman is begging a Phalangist soldier not to separate her from her children , while the Beirut area of quarantine is burning and small children are raising their hands . "
However , the uniformed soldier can be identified as Palestinian by his weapon and American M - 1 .
The Phalangists were armed with AK - 47s .
The Lebanese Prime Minister was caught in what was either a case of hyperbole or just and unfounded statement .
He declared that Israel had perpetrated a " massacre " and killed 40 people in the town of Houla .
Later , he was forced to admit that only one person had died .
When the atrocity news is broadcast everyone hears it , but I suspect that when the apologies are submitted few people hear them .
Hezbollah also placed red banners on bomb debris with messages like , " Made in the U.S. " and " Smart bombs for imbeciles . "
The Israelis disseminated an all - text leaflet on 29 July .
The same leaflet was dropped again on 1 August , 4 August , 5 August and 12 August .
The leaflet says in part :
To the Citizens of Southern Lebanon
The situation in southern Lebanon will continue to be dangerous as long as the Army of the State of Lebanon and the United Nations forces are not deployed on all of the territory of southern Lebanon .
For your safety !
We warn you to avoid the southern area until the deployment of the forces which are tasked with your protection and security in this area .
The State of Israel For the most part every leaflet I show in this article is a mint copy from the Israeli military .
I thought it might be nice to show the reader what a leaflet actually looks like after it has been on the ground for a while in the rain .
As you can see , once out in the weather the leaflet does not look nearly as nice as our filed examples .
The above leaflet was also dropped on 29 July .
The text is :
To the Citizens of Lebanon Hassan promised you that Israel would be a " spider web , " and then was surprised when he collided with the state of Israel and its army to find it was a " web of steel . "
Hassan promised you that Israel would be afraid to retaliate for the attack on it's sovereignty but was surprised at the strength of the attack against him and his party , and of the strength of the Israeli Defense Forces and State of Israel .
Citizen of Lebanon .
Hassan ignited the fire like a child playing with matches , and thought that he would achieve his goals and his ignoble master 's goals , but discovered that the fire of the Israeli Defense Force was much stronger than he had anticipated .
Hassan continues to play his game and continues to destroy Lebanon .
Will he understand that he was wrong and end your suffering and dispair ?
The State of Israel Another all - text leaflet was dropped on 30 July .
It was the same leaflet first dropped on 24 July .
A longer all - text message was dropped on 31 July : Calling Hezbollah Militia to drop their weapons and surrender The Israeli Defense Force is determined to eliminate the rocket threat toward the State of Israel and stop terrorism from Lebanon .
The Israeli Defense Force will continue to work for as long as possible with all their strength to clear South Lebanon of rocket and terrorist bases .
The Israeli Defense Force 's operations in Maron A - Ras , Bint Jbeil and al - Tiba are merely examples of what the IDF can do .
Hezbollah Militia in Southern Lebanon .
Your respectable leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah is protected in an underground shelter , in his cave with his family and friends .
Some people say that he ran far , far away to a territory where the sound of artillery cannot be heard , while you bleed and fight for him against the Lebanese national interest .
We are asking you wherever you are to stop for one minute , and think for whose interest you are fighting ?
To reach the correct answer and drop your weapons and immediately stop fighting the Israeli Defense Force and return home to your families safe and unharmed while you still can .
Hezbollah Militia :
Your lives are very precious and more valuable than Iran and the " goal " you are dying for .
They are very precious in the eyes and hearts of your mothers and sons , so safeguard your lives for the sake of them and for their future .
Note : On 25 July the Israeli Defense Force occupied the area stretching between the village of Maron al - Ras ( Maroun al - Ras ) and the town of Bint Jbeil ( Bent Jubail ) in the central region of southern Lebanon .
The victory came after a week of hard fighting .
The Israeli Army , paratroopers , and armored corps forces with aerial backup completed the takeover with the loss of nine Israelis soldiers .
Lieutenant Colonel Itzik Ronen of the 7th Armored Division said :
We are currently occupied with collecting evidence , the bodies of Hezbollah terrorists , and conducting interviews , while preparing for the next stage .
A third all - text leaflet was dropped on 1 August .
It is the same leaflet first dropped on 29 July .
On 2 August , Israeli aircraft dropped leaflets over Nabatiyeh in south Lebanon calling on Hezbollah guerrillas to surrender and warning them that " we will get you wherever you flee . "
The leaflets were dropped a day after Israeli commandos stormed a Hezbollah - run hospital in Baalbek in eastern Lebanon , where Israel said it killed 10 guerrillas and captured five .
The leaflet text is : To Hezbollah Israeli Defense Forces worked courageously and strongly against the hideouts of your gang in Baalbek last night .
You should know that you will not be able to run away and we will get you wherever you go , whether over or underground .
Your leaders have abandoned you and fled after sending you to death for the sake of foreign interests .
You have only one alternative : SURRENDER !
The State of Israel The Israelis dropped two all - text leaflets on 3 August .
The text of one is : To Beirut Residents
Due to the continued launching of wild firing rockets by the terrorist Hezbollah gang toward the state of Israel , and following the gang leader 's declarations , that continue to gamble on Lebanon 's future - the Israel Defense Force intends to widen its activities in the suburbs of Beirut .
Residents of Haret Hreik , Beer al - Abed , Hay Madi and Alweis For your own safety !
You must immediately leave these suburbs as well as any place in which Hezbollah terrorist elements or their followers are taking part in terrorist activities .
Attention !
The expansion of terrorist operations by Hezbollah will lead to a painful and harsh response by the Israel Defense Force and the results will be painful not only for Hassan 's gang and its criminals .
The State of Israel To the People of Lebanon The Israel Defense Force acted strongly and courageously in Balbak , the Hezbollah guerrilla terrorist 's center , to protect the people of Israel and return the kidnapped Israel Defense Force .
You should know that the Israel Defense Force will continue to extend its operations wherever there are terrorists from Hezbollah to stop them from carrying out their ideology of terror against the people of Israel .
People of Lebanon
The Israel Defense Force is not working against the people of Lebanon but against the terrorist guerilla fighters of Hezbollah , and will continue to operate for as long as needed .
Do n't allow Hezbollah to hold you hostage and use you as a human shield for the benefit of foreign countries .
The State of Israel Note : The Israelis bombed Balbak ( also called Baalbak ) on 31 July and 1 August and landed commandoes by helicopter next to Dar al - Hekmah Hospital .
The Israeli commandos snatched five suspected Hezbollah guerrillas in the helicopter raid .
The Israelis raided the same town a second time a week after the ceasefire to prevent the smuggling of weapons from Iran and Syria to Hezbollah .
That 19 August commando raid was less successful and an Israeli Defense Force officer was killed ; another officer sustained serious injuries in the operation , while a third was lightly wounded .
The Independent wrote on 4 August that : Israeli aircraft had earlier bombed the southern suburbs of Beirut ­ an area where Hezbollah bases itself ­ and dropped leaflets warning civilian residents in three neighborhoods to leave .
The army had indicated on Wednesday that it would be for the cabinet to decide on a resumption of bombing in Beirut 's heavily populated southern neighborhoods .
On 4 August it was reported that Israeli military dropped leaflets over the Lebanese city of Sidon asking residents to leave their homes and move north and warning that Hezbollah rocket launching sites were about to be targeted .
An Israeli army spokesman said that " We dropped leaflets warning residents to leave because the army will attack Hezbollah rocket launching sites in Sidon . "
We have no record of such a drop occurring on that date .
On 8 August , Israeli aircraft dropped all - text leaflets over Tyre explaining that any cars seen moving in southern Lebanon on the roads south of the Litani River will be targeted .
The text is : To Lebanese citizens located south of the Litani River Read this statement carefully and follow its instructions
The Israeli Defense Forces will escalate their operations and strike with extreme force against the terrorist elements that are using you as human shields and firing rockets from inside your homes at the state of Israel .
Any vehicles , no matter what type , moving south of the Litani River will be bombed , because they will be suspected of transporting rockets , military supplies or saboteurs .
You must be aware that anyone moving in any vehicle is exposing his life to danger .
The State of Israel Meanwhile , Hezbollah struck back with its own propaganda campaign on 8 August .
The terrorist organization handed out bundles of Iranian - supplied cash to people whose homes were wrecked by Israeli bombing .
This campaign was aimed at consolidating the Iranian - backed group 's support among Lebanon 's Shiites and embarrassing the Beirut government .
Individuals whose homes were bombed were handed $ 12,000 in banknotes wrapped in tissue paper .
On 9 August , the Israelis dropped leaflets on Tyre criticizing Hezbollah leader Nasrallah .
The skies above the abandoned city of Tyre were alive with warplanes , surveillance drones and attack helicopters .
The only way into Tyre is to wade across a river outside the city , since Israel bombed the makeshift bridge connecting it to the main road north .
Leaflets dropped on those who chose not to flee said anyone seen on the streets would now be deemed a runner for Hezbollah .
An Israeli plane dropped a canister scattering propaganda leaflets which said : To Lebanese Citizens Why has Hassan attacked the State of Israel ?
Is it for freeing Lebanese detainees from Israeli jails ?
Hassan could have released them a long time ago through serious negotiation without bringing disaster to Lebanon .
Hassan has gambled dangerously and returned with nothing .
Hassan is playing with fire and now Lebanon is burning .
Hassan has gambled with your future and now you are paying the price .
The State of Israel .
On 10 August , Israeli forces bombed the heart of the Lebanese capitol for the first time in three weeks .
They warned that the Israeli Defense Forces intended to expand their operations in Beirut and blamed " the leader of the gang " - an apparent reference to Hezbollah leader Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah , who made a taped television address the night before .
They air - dropped leaflets over Beirut warning the residents of these suburbs to evacuate .
At the same time , Israeli forces took control of the strategic southern hub of Marjayoun and warned that its fight against Hezbollah could grow wider and more severe if diplomacy fails .
The leaflet is the same one first dropped on 3 August , " To Beirut Residents . "
At the same time , Israeli aircraft dropped leaflets over northern Lebanon for the first time .
They warned that all trucks must be off the roads by 8:00 p.m .
The leaflets fell north of Tripoli , Lebanon 's second largest city , some 25 kilometers from the Syrian border .
The blanketed area includes the Palestinian refugee camp of Beddawi .
The leaflet said in part :
Any pick - up or truck of any kind moving on the coastal road as of 8:00 pm ( 1700 GMT ) will be attacked because it is suspected of carrying rockets , military hardware and saboteurs .
You must know that anyone who moves in a pick - up or truck is endangering his life .
The State of Israel
It was unclear whether the curfew would be 24 - hours a day , starting on Thursday night , or whether it was only a night - time ban on traffic .
On 11 August , Israeli aircraft dropped leaflets on the port city of Sidon and the capitol city of Beirut accusing Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah of hiding facts about the " great losses " among the Hezbollah fighters .
The leaflet contained " the first list " of names of more than 90 ( other reports say " 100 " ) alleged Hezbollah members killed in fighting with Israeli troops .
The leaflet said Nasrallah was " killing your children for nothing . "
Hezbollah replied that only 58 of its guerrillas died in clashes since Israel began its onslaught on Lebanon on July 12 in response to a cross - border raid by the Shiite militia .
Israel claims a total of about 300 Hezbollah guerrillas .
Some of the text is : Nasrallah is cheating you and hiding from you the great losses in the ranks of Hezbollah members .
The following is a list of some names of those killed whom Nasrallah has abandoned and denied their deaths .
Israeli warplanes dropped leaflets over Lebanon 's capital for a third straight day on 12 August , calling on residents to " shake off " Hezbollah .
The leaflet depicted Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah peeking out from the branches of a cedar tree , Lebanon 's national symbol .
At about the same time the Israelis were dropping scented car fresheners with the same vignette .
The text said in part :
Shake off your shoulders the destroyer of Lebanon .
You can return the cedar odor to Lebanon if you want to !!!
They also dropped two all text leaflets .
The Israelis dropped leaflets over West Beirut .
Many were carried out to sea by a south wind .
The leaflets warned Nasrallah to leave Lebanon .
The message was that Hezbollah is the source of Lebanon 's problems .
This leaflet is the one first dropped on 29 July and then on four subsequent dates .
The IDF also hacked broadcasts of Hezbollah radio and television with recordings announcing the names of the dead Hezbollah members .
One radio message stated : Hassan sent men to fight the Israeli army , an army of steel , without preparing them .
Stop listening to patriotic chants for a moment , think about it and come back to Earth .
They also cut into television broadcasts to show Israeli air attacks on Hezbollah strongholds and even cockpit camera pictures .
In one instance they showed a dead guerrilla while the announcer stated :
This is the corpse of one of the members of Hezbollah 's Special Forces .
Hassan Nasrallah lies .
We 're not the ones who are hiding the real numbers of our dead .
Al Manar Television admitted that the Israelis had succeeded in creating static and other signal interruptions at least 10 times and had managed to broadcast their own images for a few minutes on three occasions .
The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported that the Israel Defense Forces confirmed that the hacking was the work of the army 's intelligence corps .
Hezbollah retaliated , broadcasting Al Manar television from hidden locations despite repeated Israeli bombings .
It repeated Israeli fears about the war .
Hassan Nasrallah said :
They do not want their people and our own people to see the magnitude of the human , material and moral losses they suffered in this war .
This is part of the psychological warfare employed by the enemy .
These are facts that the enemy cannot hide from its people or from us or from the entire world for a long time .
Al Manar also told its viewers that Israel lied about how many Lebanese fighters had been killed , how many Hezbollah rockets had been seized and which Lebanese villages had been captured .
It also aired an image of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert bearing a Hitler - like mustache , pictures of the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and images of President Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
To the people of Beirut As a result of the Hezbollah 's continued launching of missiles towards Israel and the statements of the leader of this group who continues to gamble the future of Lebanon , the Israel Defense Force intends to expand its operation in Beirut .
Districts of Harik , Ber Abd , Rwais , Burj Barjina , Salam , Shyah , Gabiri , Sfair , and Rodof .
For your safety !
You have to evacuate the above areas at once and every site where there are Hezbollah members or their supporters .
Be aware !!
The expansion of the terrorist operations of Hezbollah will lead to a painful retaliation , and not only against Hassan 's members .

The experiments allow scientists to test their models
The three new isotopes of magnesium and aluminium suggest other heavy variants of everyday elements could be created .
The new nuclei existed for only a fraction of a second and were created by smashing atoms at half the speed of light in a particle accelerator .
The work , published in the journal Nature , may give astrophysicists insights into the workings of stars .
" There is a second way to create super heavy nuclei : explosions in stars , " said Paul Henri Heenen , a nuclear physicist at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles .
The lab experiments mimic these violent events and therefore can give astrophysicists clues about stellar processes .
The experiments will also allow theoretical physicists to test the validity of their nuclear models .
" The limit of stability of matter may be further out than previously expected , " wrote Professor Dave Morrissey , one of the authors of the paper .
" It shows how much mystery remains about atomic nuclei . "
Chasing heavier atoms
Physicists have known since the beginning of the 20th Century that the atomic nucleus is formed from two basic particles - protons and neutrons - that are held together by a strong nuclear force .
It is also an established fact that every atom of the same chemical element has a unique number of protons , but can have different number of neutrons - when that happens the two atoms are called isotopes .
But from the 1930s , scientists studying nuclear forces have been trying to establish the limit of how many neutrons a given number of protons can bind , a basic property of matter known as the neutron - drip line .
Prof Dave Morrissey : Heavier isotopes may be out there
" The knowledge of these drip lines is crucial to our understanding of the force that binds a nucleus , " said Professor Heenen
But even today , scientists are not sure exactly which combinations of protons and neutrons can make up most atomic nuclei .
One way of addressing this question is to find out how many neutrons can be artificially loaded on to nuclei of so - called quotidian elements , which contain the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons .
Accelerating particles
This is done using a circular particle accelerator known as a cyclotron that bombards heavy atoms with other materials at very high speeds .
This triggers nuclear reactions that break the initial atoms into pieces and create new heavy nuclei .
Using this technique , the Michigan State University team created and detected a super heavy isotope of magnesium , magnesium - 40 , containing 12 protons and 28 neutrons .
Magnesium usually contains 12 neutrons .
They also found heavier counterparts of aluminium - aluminium - 42 , with 13 protons and 29 neutrons and aluminium - 43 , with 13 protons and 30 neutrons .
Aluminium normally contains 14 neutrons .
Current theories suggested aluminium - 42 was unlikely to exist .
" At this point , we can't define the end of magnesium and aluminium isotopes , " said Dr Morrissey .
" We need to upgrade the measurement and detection techniques for the next experiments which will allow us to detect even more heavier isotopes , " he added .
Young people are lazy , self - absorbed , pleasure - obsessed and imbued with an unrealistic sense of entitlement .
At least , that 's what most baby boomers think .
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Take Margaret Wente's Aug. 18 column in The Globe , in which she deplores the extended adolescence in which young Canadians like me are trapped .
After presenting some historical comparisons -- George Washington bossed a survey team in Indian country when he was 16 , for example -- Wente goes on to argue that young people should consider making something of themselves instead of going to school in search of post - secondary credentials that she seems to believes are of marginal value .
While it would be nice to step into the Wayback machine and return to a time when the labour market did n't demand a post - secondary education , when $ 25,000 was the purchase price of a home rather than the five per cent down payment on it , and when job security was a reasonable expectation , reality is regrettably unco-operative .
Boomer bromides
Wente 's argument is a variation on a treasured baby boomer lecture , normally delivered to members of my generation who make the mistake of complaining about their situation .
According to most boomers , young Canadians have themselves to blame , either because we play too many video games , do n't read enough books , spend too much time on the Internet , or not enough in the real world .
We expect too much , offer too little , give up too easily , and do n't work hard enough to achieve our unrealistic goals and satisfy our outlandish expectations .
This is a curious strategy for a generation whose pension plans , healthcare treatments and income tax breaks will be heavily subsidized by the generation that they 're currently busy maligning .
More important , though , is the fact that it is n't true .
The reason my generation has n't achieved as much as the baby boomers had at our age , be it our mid-20s or our mid-30s , is that the proverbial road to success has become much longer and much more dangerous .
That road begins in high school for most of us , where we 're introduced for the first time to the concept that a university education equals success , and it gets reinforced so frequently that it becomes a shared neurosis .
That anxiety is compounded by skyrocketing entrance requirements at most post - secondary institutions , that are the result of budget cuts to departments of education across Canada .
To earn admission to the bachelor of arts program at a good university -- the University of Toronto , for example -- you 'll need an average in the mid 80s .
If you 're aiming a little higher and want to study engineering or science , you 'll need to be in the 90s , and if you want that scholarship that will help pay for a class or two , you 'll need to be in the mid 90s .
It 's a little different from the 1960s , when the entrance requirements were a pulse and a brain that was demonstrably connected to your spinal cord .
Degrees of debt , rites of passage
Massive personal debt has joined sexual experimentation and binge drinking as a rite of passage for university students in Canada .
Statistics Canada 's National Graduates
Survey released in the spring of 2004 found that 45 per cent of bachelor 's degree grads left school owing an average of $ 19,500 to the Canada Student Loans Program .
Those who also owed money to non-governmental sources like credit card issuers owed an average of $ 32,200 .
Baby boomers offer their sympathy to our debt - riddled generation , but they do n't understand the problem because they lack the necessary context .
When they went to university , the only people who graduated with genuine debt problems were the ones who spent their money recklessly , borrowed needlessly , and thought that a budget was a kind of bird .
But today , thanks to increases in both tuition fees and the cost of living , the bill for a year -- eight months , really -- of post - secondary education regularly approaches $ 20,000 , a figure that no amount of bootstrapping or budgeting can overcome .
Unless you can catch on with a Major League Baseball team during the summer break , it 's virtually impossible to graduate debt - free .
Worse still is the fact that these increasingly expensive educations are n't worth nearly as much as they used to be .
It 's a widely accepted reality -- one treated as an article of faith by guidance counsellors in high schools across the country -- that a bachelor 's degree is today what a high - school diploma was 35 years ago .
According to Statistics Canada , high - school graduates of the 1960s and 1970s earned approximately $ 34,000 , roughly the same amount of money that today 's graduating undergraduate students can expect to earn .
Those with a BA today actually earn less in inflation - adjusted dollars than young boomers with BAs did .
This means that compared to my generation , the baby boomers enjoyed a $ 50,000 head start in life .
Put differently , it means that Canadians my age have to work harder than their parents did to achieve the same level of professional and financial success .
Mom and Dad , I 'm home
It should n't come as a surprise then that many young Canadians are retreating to their family home , long after their parents converted their bedroom into a yoga studio .
Baby boomers have made a cottage industry out of lamenting the increasingly common " boomerang effect , " in which young people , faced with this litany of hurdles , return to the relative safety of the parental home .
I think they imagine that we all get together , wearing our $ 300 blue jeans and drinking our $ 12 martinis , and figure out that moving home will allow us to work less , party more and irritate our parents .
This ignores the crippling blow that moving home delivers to one 's ego and sense of worth , not to mention the devastating effect it has on said person 's social life and , occasionally , mental health .
But the parental home is not , as some boomers seem to think , a rational choice or a calculated decision .
It 's a last resort , a halfway house whose rent is paid not in dollars but instead in increasingly sparse units of self - esteem .
It is n't that younger Canadians find the world in which we live inherently unfair .
But the bar of success is much higher than it was for our parents and grandparents , and the margin of error is much smaller .
If , like the average Canadian undergraduate in my generation , you graduated from university with $ 25,000 in student debt , were required by the banks to start paying it off in six months , and found that the only job your degree qualifies you for was an entry level barista at the local Starbucks , you might prefer to take that long walk off a short ledge and take your chances in one of Canada 's supposedly under - funded hospitals .
We 're not asking for sympathy , pity , or even a few bucks -- although it would certainly help -- but instead an end to the moralizing boomer lectures about how easy we have it .
You 'll be needing our help soon enough , after all .

Would you pay someone $ 12,720 to sell your house for you ?
Based on the current estimated median home price of $ 212,300 and a 6 % realtor fee , that ’s what the bill would come out to .
How Much is Too Much ?
We ’re still living in our first home so I ’ve never had to work with a real estate agent to sell a house but it makes me feel ill just thinking about giving up 6 % of the highest valued piece of property we own .
I know that realtors do provide valuable services to their clients but I have n’t decided whether it ’s worth the money or not .
Market Research
A local realtor sends out a periodic newsletter providing a market update for our area .
Since we ’re in the Mid- West housing prices are a little more reasonable than on the coasts ; you pay less and get more space for your money .
Her latest numbers for the last 12 months of activity in our area can be helpful to prospective buyers but are they worth over $ 12 K ?

Average Sales Price was $ 265,281
Average # of Days on the Market was 67
Realtor Advantage
The way I see it realtors have three advantages over individuals with homes for sale by owner .
Connections
One of the most important things it seems is the ability to add homes into the Multiple Listing Service to advertise to a wide buyer base .
They may also have relationships with appraisers , home inspectors , local officials , banks , lawyers , and other realtors that can streamline many steps in the listing and selling process .
Time
Realtors make their living selling homes so they have time to show houses and return prospect ’s phone calls .
Many people selling their own home have full time jobs , which makes it more difficult to be available to work with potential buyers .
Information
Due to their connections & years of experience , a real estate agent should have an information advantage over people selling their own property .
They know where to look for the necessary pieces of information and can find out what they need to know more quickly .
This knowledge should translate into a better selling strategy , which in turn should help you sell your home faster and for more money .
Are Realtors Worth the Money ?
The advantages I just listed are definitely good arguments in favor of using a real estate agent when selling a house .
However , I still find it hard to pay $ 12,720 to someone , even if they do add the value I just listed .
That is such a large chunk of change , I ca n’t stand to pay that much money , it just goes against my miserly instincts .
When we do sell our home , I ’ll probably try and sell it myself and see how things go .
Maybe I can pay a realtor for a few hours of their time to do some consulting in the areas I ’m unfamiliar with .
If it does n’t work out I can always list it with an agent as a last resort .
What are your thoughts , are real estate agents worth the money ?
Whether out in polite society or answering the questions of nosy psychologists , most people insist to the utmost that they ’re not racist .
But when those same psychologists test people 's subconscious feelings , they find a much different story .
More than 80 percent of white people show some measurable prejudice ( pdf ) against black people , for instance .
About 7 percent of white people , though , actually show a distinct lack of racism on probing psychological tests , says psychologist Robert Livingston of Northwestern University .
Recently Livingston and Brian Drwecki of the University of Wisconsin studied these people to find out why they 're not racist and , by implication , why the rest of us are .
It turns out that the nonracists share a unique emotional style :
They rarely form any negative associations , whether they 're thinking about meaningless symbols or real human beings .
In their experiment , the researchers tested people ’s tendency to form positive and negative associations by showing them written Chinese characters followed quickly by pictures of “ good ” things — like baby seals , flowers , and waterfalls — or pictures of “ bad ” things , like mutilated faces , snarling dogs , and feces .
( Previous research has showed that Chinese characters appear meaningless and neutral to English speakers . )
The researchers presumed that the characters would take on positive or negative traits depending on what images they were paired with .
And indeed , most people liked the characters that were paired with good pictures and disliked those linked to bad images .
A select few , though , did not form negative associations with Chinese characters .
They made positive links just as often as anybody else , but the negative images did n’t stick in their minds .
They seemed not to pay as much attention to negative information as others did and were less likely to form negative associations between two things .
“ They have rose - colored filters , ” Livingston says .
It turns out these people are generally the same people who show no prejudice on the implicit racism test .
In this type of experiment — which has been used by other scientists studying race psychology — subjects look at pictures of faces on a screen and press one button if the face is black and another if it is white .
Interspersed with the faces are words that are either positive ( “ glorious , ” “ joyful ” ) or pejorative ( “ terrible , ” “ nasty ” ) .
In one round , subjects use one key for white faces and positive words and another key for black faces and negative words .
In another round , the keys are switched so that the white faces are matched with negative words and black faces with positive words .
If a person takes longer to press the “ black ” key when it ’s paired with the “ good ” key than when it ’s paired with the “ bad ” key , psychologists believe , that comes from a subconscious resistance to associating black people with goodness — a sure sign of racial prejudice .
You can take this test yourself on Harvard University 's website .
The researchers say that negative associations likely have such power in most people 's minds because evolution prepared us to notice bad things more than good things .
“ If there ’s a lion hiding in a bush , you ’d better see it , ” Livingston says .
“ Whereas if there ’s a tree of mangoes , it ’s unfortunate if you do n’t notice it , but it ’s not as critical to your survival . ”
Since each negative association has more weight in the brain , one must overcompensate with many positive links just to get back to neutral .
The psychologists are n’t clear on why some people do n’t make negative associations , but they are looking for genetic and social factors that predict it .
Other recent research on race has shown that the desire to look past these powerful negative associations is , unfortunately , not very effective at decreasing people 's actual level of prejudice .
“ It ’s not a matter of teaching people that prejudice is wrong , ” Livingston says .
“ They know that already .
You need to expose them to positive associations . ”
So how do you motivate people to form positive feelings for people they do n't like ?
Psychologist Linda Tropp of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst calls Livingston and Drwecki ’s paper “ provocative and important , ” but she says that the desire to avoid being racist can compel people to seek contact with the very people they 're biased against , which is known to be the best way to reduce prejudice .
So maybe our conscious angels can help us silence those subconscious devils after all .
A long , long time ago ( this week ) .
In a world , far , far , away ( from the media ) .
On a remote moon in the middle eastern system ( Afghanistan ) .
The Imperial Stormtroopers ( Blackwater USA ) raided one of their own kind , killing , stealing , detaining and torturing .
Practicing their craft on American and Canadian rebels , all the while preparing to bring the Empire home ........
The mystery is solved !!
I know who the private security contractors are accountable to ........ Blackwater USA the New World Army !
They have no qualms about sticking their guns in your face either .
And here it is in black and water as reported by Associate Press Writers Jason Straziuso and Fisnik Abrashi :
Two private Afghan security companies were raided and shut down this week , and a dozen or so more contractors — including some protecting embassies — would be closed soon , police and Western officials told The Associated Press on Thursday .
Dozens of security companies also operate in Afghanistan , some of them well - known U.S. firms such as Blackwater and Dyncorp , but also many others that may not be known even to Afghan government .
Despite the attention on the Blackwater incident in Baghdad , the Western security official said the catalyst for the Afghan reforms was the May 2006 anti-foreigner riot in Kabul , which erupted over a wreck involving a U.S. military truck .
Some 20 people died in the turmoil , mostly of gunshot wounds .
The Western official would not say whether armed supporters of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance were involved in that bloodshed , but said the incident drew attention to the lack of rules for security firms .
" Allegedly there were 10,000 guards , but in truth the Ministry of Interior had no idea who they were , who they were reporting to , " the official said .
The Interior Ministry says 59 Afghan and international security companies are registered , but the Western official said as many as 25 other firms could be operating in the country .

Again nobody knows who they 're reporting to .
Here is your answer and you 're not going to like it :
It also emerged Thursday that an American security company , U.S. Protection and Investigations , which does security work for the State Department aid arm USAID , was raided last month in Kabul by the Blackwater security firm .
U.S. Protection and Investigations faces accusations of overcharging USAID by billing for nonexistent employees and vehicles , said an American security official with close ties to the company .
The overcharges could run into the millions of dollars , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
Afghan police provided security for the raid on the company , according to Paktiawal , and the U.S. official said Blackwater security teams took computers and office files .
Two Afghan workers were taken into custody , and Blackwater held American and Canadian citizens at gunpoint , the official said .
Blackwater , which helps provide security for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul , could not immediately be reached for comment .

T- Mobile , Orange and O2 are to sell the iPhone in Germany , France , and the UK respectively , according to the Financial Times .
The paper also reports that the operators have agreed to give Apple 10 per cent of all revenue generated from iPhone users .
The companies concerned have dismissed the story as speculation and rumour , though the FT quotes " people familiar with the situation " .
Sharing 10 per cent of revenue is a remarkable development .
While manufacturers such as Nokia have been embedding applications into their phones to bypass the operator , this marks a real shift in power to the handset manufacturer - a development other manufacturers are unlikely to ignore .
Part of the attraction of the iPhone , to operators , is Apple 's insistence that operators do not subsidise the device .
This makes the launch low - risk as consumers pay the full price , but puts the iPhone on the shelf beside a free Nokia N95 .
The FT is predicting a UK launch this autumn , with Germany and France following next spring , but remains silent on the matter of 3G capabilities .
O2 paid £ 4.03 bn for its 3G license , so launching a data - centric device which makes no use of that investment would be politically difficult .
If Apple really has convinced the operators to pass on 10 per cent of all revenue , it will open the doors to other manufacturers to demand the same .
Nokia would already like to be seen as a service provider , and Apple may give it the opportunity to have a go . ®
It 's hard out there for a pimped out ride .
As of this month , Rockford , Illinois will start seizing vehicles that play music too loudly .
The kicker is that your car can be seized if someone merely accuses you of playing loud music , because " hearsay evidence shall be admissible . "
The ordinance is worded in a way that actually disallows many OEM stereos : " " No person shall operate ... any device used to ... reproduce any recorded sound if the device is located ... in any motor vehicle on the public way and the sound can be heard from 75 feet or more from the device . "
And you do n't have to be playing music at the time -- someone could have heard you blasting tunes on your way down the street and reported it to the police .
By the time the police show up your stereo's been silent for hours .
But if the police determine there 's probable cause that it was you , your car goes away .
The fine is $ 150 to $ 750 , plus $ 75 for towing and $ 20 per day for storage .
If the officer has to wait more than an hour for the tow truck , it 's another $ 60 per hour for his or her time .
And if you want to fight it , the city keeps your car while you go through the appeals process , charging you for storage fees , of course .
Silent running might be the phrase to keep in mind while rolling through Rockford .
Thanks for the tip , F451 !

Space Station Computers Have Partial Power Russians to spend next few days monitoring the situation .
June 16 , 2007  --
After days of computer malfunctions , the crew inside the International Space Station has gotten partial power to four of six computers by bypassing faulty power switches .
The Russians are overjoyed about the computer fix , but will spend the next few days monitoring the situation .
Specifically , they are interested in checking if the computer can handle the orientation of the space station .
Initally , they thought they would have to send up an entirely new computer system .
The crew bypassed a faulty power switches for the four computers , and when the Russians commanded the computers to start , they came on .
On Friday , while NASA said it was working to repair the computers , Russian sources told ABC News that they believe the entire computer system will need to be replaced .
Russians have moved up the launch of a Progress cargo ship , scheduled for Aug .
8 . The plan now is to launch it on July 23 , carrying the new units .
The computers are used principally to control thrusters in the Space Station 's Russian - made Service Module , which are used to keep the station properly oriented in orbit .
Large gyroscopes in American segments of the station do most of the job of keeping the station stable , but at times they need help from the Russian thrusters .
The thrusters are used , for instance , to keep the station from tumbling after a Space Shuttle undocks from it .
Russian engineers suggested earlier in the week that the computer problem began shortly after the station began receiving power from new solar panels installed by the visiting shuttle Atlantis .
NASA engineers say they looked into that , and came up dry .
They measured the power coming from the new solar panels ; it appeared normal .
They shut that power down .
It did not help the Russian computers .
" It appears that at least the power source is not the cause of the anomaly , " said Mike Suffredini , NASA 's space station manager , at a press conference in Houston .
" We 'll continue to look . "
" There is nobody in this agency or in the Russian agency that thinks this vehicle is at risk of being lost -- not remotely , " Suffredini told reporters .
" We work problems like this all the time , " Suffredini said .
" When you have two countries with a lot of experience working together , it 's amazing what you can do . "
Crew Not at Risk
The Russian source told ABC News that the Americans and Russians are working " very well " together .
" The Americans are really helping .
Whenever a problem arises , the Americans give them answers , " he said .
After the initial computer failure , according to the Russian source , the American gyroscopes saved the station from worse trouble .
Without thrusters or gyroscopes to stabilize it , the station could begin slowly to tumble .
Suffredini repeated NASA 's message that the crew is not in any danger .
" Space flight is a challenging business .
We can go home , and do nothing , or we can choose to explore , " he said .
" We choose to explore , and these are the things that you occasionally deal with in this business . "
' Fatal Flaw '
Russian space agency officials had told ABC News early Friday that the damaged computers aboard the International Space Station could have a " fatal flaw . "
The officials said they would have the Station 's crew -- two Russian cosmonauts and an American astronaut -- stay onboard in the meantime to keep things running .
Meanwihile , Shuttle astronauts James Reilly and Danny Olivas made a spacewalk on Friday afternoon to repair a small tear in the shuttle 's thermal insulation using a surgical staple gun .
Part of the blanket peeled back during the launch .
During the computer outage , Atlantis ' thrusters have been used to help with the station 's attitude control .
And the shuttle crew has been conserving electricity and fuel in case they needed to extend their stay to help the three station crew members .
Atlantis only has enough fuel to remain docked to the space station until Wednesday .
" Things are not always going to go well .
Fortunately , we have a great operations team down in Mission Control and at the Johnson Space Center and over in Moscow … that are working together to decide what the best course of action is , " said Atlantis Cmdr. Frederick Sturckow .
Homeland Security --
In Defense of the Indefensible
If you go through life without making any enemies you 're doing something wrong .
If you go through life making a lot of enemies you 're doing something worse .
For a long time , the US contented itself with one enemy , the Soviet Union .
Meanwhile , the CIA conducted covert operations such as rigging elections for dictators and assassinating their opponents .
But those thus tyrannized had neither the inclination nor the resources to retaliate against the US .
Then , operating under the illusion that the mujahideen in Afghanistan were " freedom fighters , " as Ronald Reagan called them , we armed and supported them to the tune of billions of dollars .
After driving the Soviets out , though , they were feeling their oats and looked around for a new target .
Watching us stand by as Israel poured salt in the wounds of Palestine and as , during the Gulf War , we stationed our troops in their holy land , Saudi Arabia , they found one what .
Armed with our shoulder - mounted Stinger , among other weapons , the mujahideen turned around and bit the hand that fed them .
In other words , both by arming them and alienating them , we constructed enemies out of whole cloth .
Who says the US does n't make anything anymore ?
Then we retaliated for 9/11 against a sitting ( Saddam Hussein ) instead of a moving target ( bin Laden ) .
Our lack of discrimination sent the message that all of the Middle East was fair game .
Voila â€ “- instant enemies : all you can fight .
To the right , making enemies is a problem only if you 're a wimpy liberal .
To most Americans , it just comes with the territory when you 're in the right .
To our corporate - friendly administration , it justifies billions for defense .
In fact , our overwrought foreign policy almost seems like a make - work scheme for defense industries .
If indeed it is a New Deal for defense , then the Department of Homeland Security is the largest WPA project ever .
Presumably , the term " homeland " was chosen to make us feel safe .
But to those with even a glancing knowledge of the past , it 's a sick joke .
Its uses the terminology of our two most formidable foes from last century : the Nazis , who called Germany the fatherland , and Russia -- the motherland .
Besides , a homeland is a region from whose loins sprung the ethnic group inhabiting it .
The US , a melting pot , is the exact opposite .
" Is that guy an Arab ? " we wonder as we pass someone on the street .
" Or a Hispanic ? "
Even sicker is how little bang for the buck we 're getting from the Department of Homeland Security for $ 30 billion this year .
In his recent Mother Jones series on the DHS , veteran journalist James Ridgeway writes that " safeguards against domestic terrorist attacks .
. . despite a few marginal improvements , remain terrifyingly lax . "
Even the Government Accountability Office recently criticized it for failing to improve its ability to respond to emergencies .
To add insult to injury , each year it routinely flunks its audits .
But that 's probably of no concern to the administation , which was never on board with the creation of the DHS and , most likely , would be just as happy to see it implode .
Meanwhile , Ridgeway explains , for those Congess members , whether Democratic or Republican , who are inclined to lend the DHS a helping hand , " expanding federal regulation , increasing federal spending , hiring unionized federal workers , and facing down industries with powerful lobbies " is " politically risky " in today 's climate .
Besides its aversion to federal agencies ( except the Defense Department ) , neither is the administration 's heart in defending our soil .
It , of course , subscribes to the get - 'em - over - thar theory ( if it 's geopolitically convenient , that is -- vide bin Laden ) .
A Defense Department program that embodies Bush & Co.'s policy of thwarting threats before they reach the US was already entrenched before they were elected :
It 's called the national missile defense system ( it does n't deserve initial caps ) .
But as the administration does with bin Laden , the program ducks the obvious threats .
As a recent Rolling Stone article explained : " Even the Missile Defense Agency concedes that the [ missile defense shield ] -- originally envisioned as a defense against a rival superpower -- is no longer of any use against China or Russia . "
Let 's see if we 've got this right .
Russian and Chinese nuclear weapons would overpower the shield .
Meanwhile , Iran is years away from developing nukes and North Korea negotiates them away .
Against whose nukes then are we spending billions to defend ourselves ?
" Would you believe , " as America 's most beloved intelligence agent , Maxwell Smart , used to say , " Venezuela ? "
Meanwhile , the more prosaic threats remain legion .
They include the obvious : flying planes into buildings ( 9/11 ) and blowing up trains ( Madrid ) and buses ( as in London ) .
Equally vulnerable are ports , especially , as Ridgeway details , liquified natural gas tankers .
These come under the heading of what John Robb of Global Guerillas fame calls " systems disruption . "
Also included are attacks on bridges , tunnels , water supplies , pipelines and refineries .
Equally as devastating is a cyber attack on an electrical grid .
Meanwhile , the hard right stokes fear of terrorists storming across the borders as an excuse to bash immigrants .
But that does n't mean the danger does n't exist .
If only a thousandth of each year 's three - quarter million illegal immigrants were Islamic terrorists , that still adds up to a battalion of 750 .
Many believe that sleeper agents , along with nuclear materials such as suitcase bombs , have already infiltrated the US .
The FBI and , especially , local police forces deserve some credit for the six - year sabbatical terrorists have taken from attacking us on our soil .
More likely though , thanks to al - Qaeda 's reputation for making a virtue of patience , we 're in the eye of the storm .
An example of how it may be toying with us was described by Ron Suskind in his book " The One Percent Doctrine . "
In 2003 , plans to release hydrogen cyanide gas ( a staple of Nazi gas chambers ) in New York City 's subways was called off by Ayman al - Zawahiri .
Apparently the prospect of a body count that might not exceed 9/11 's failed to light his fire .
In other words , the A-man and the Big O dream of a terror extravaganza like a multi-city nuclear attack .
Acquiring nuclear know - how and materials requires serious money , though , to which al - Qaeda central may no longer have access .
Bin Laden , for instance , squandered much of his fortune on building projects in Sudan .
( Once the heat came down from the US , though , it was :
Thanks for the modernization program , Sheikh .
Do n't let the door hit you on the way out . )
Author Paul Williams ( " Osama 's Revenge , " " The Al Qaeda Connection " ) maintains al - Qaeda has generated significant cash through drug and blood diamond transactions .
However , in 2005 , Zawahiri wrote a famous letter to Abu Musab Zarqawi urging him to cool it with the beheadings ( bad P.R. , you know ) .
Also , claiming they were short on funds , he hit him up for a donation to the home office .
Then , last month , President Bush 's homeland security adviser , Frances Townsend , called bin Laden " virtually impotent . "
( One ca n't help wonder how she knows . )
Whatever al - Qaeda central 's financial standing , there 's actually no need to raise a king 's ransom to spend on nuclear weapons .
After all , attacking the infrastructure is as cheap as it is cost - effective .
In his recent book , " Brave New War , " Robb wrote that 9/11 was a " $ 250,000 attack .
. . converted into an event that cost the United States over $ 80 billion . "
One of bin Laden 's goals , he reminds us , remains " bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy . "
To expedite that , al - Qaeda has gone viral .
As has been well - documented , it grants copyright - free use of its brand to knock - off terrorists like the late Zarqawi .
Along with groups advancing other causes , an " almost endless supply of attackers , " writes Robb , " could generate hundreds of millions , potentially billions , in damage . "
In tacit agreement with bin Laden , he maintains that the " cumulative effect of these attacks could grind down even the strongest nation - state . "
The administration looks at threats through a telescope , thus magnifying al - Qaeda to the status of a state .
Actual nations like Iraq and Iran , meanwhile , are inflated into near superpowers .
But al - Qaeda is just a glorified crime syndicate .
Like all such organizations , as countless security experts have testified , it 's more susceptible to good old - fashioned crime busting than the heavy hand of the military .
Ideally , local police forces , in collaboration with federal and international crime and intelligence agencies , should lead the way .
Along with urging the FBI to bring local officials into the loop , think - tanker Daniel Byman , writing on Slate , offers other suggestions for shoring up security stateside .
Among them , the federal government needs to work harder to win the unequivocal support of American Muslims .
( How that can be accomplished while the US continues to foment disruption in many of their homelands he does n't say . )
Byman also urges us to improve " perception management . "
For example , in order to minimize societal impact , Israel cleans up immediately after a terrorist attack .
Yet , from the executive branch to the DHS , the American government elevated our one substantial attack ( 9/11 ) to near - Holocaust status .
Robb too would like to see us adopt a " philosophy of resilience " to help us survive terrorist attacks .
Because " strikes of the future will be strategic , pinpointing the systems we rely on , " he continues , " they will leave entire sections of the country without energy and communications for protracted periods . "
In other words , when it comes to security , not to mention other services , communities will be left to their own devices .
Suburbs will become armed and patrolled by civilian police auxiliaries ; the rich by the likes of Blackwater .
Still , he maintains , we do n't need an " activist foreign policy that seeks to rework the world in our image , police state measures to ensure state security , or spending all of our resources on protecting everything . "
( Bear in mind that he 's no liberal . )
Rejecting an " activist foreign policy " obviously implies embracing diplomacy .
But success is n't guaranteed the next administration just because it's more committed than Bush 's to relying on its statesmen ( notice how that word has all but vanished from common usage ) .
Is there any way to ensure a cure for the impotence of soft power without turning it hard ?
By way of a preface , read what Arthur Silber , one of the Web 's top bloggers , has to say about Congressional Democrats ( edited for conciseness ) .
They " fail to mount serious opposition to our inevitable course toward widening war and an attack on Iran , not because they are afraid of being portrayed as ' weak ' in the fight against terrorism .
They do n't object because -- they do n't object .
" That is : they agree that we have the ' right ' to pursue a policy of aggressive interventionism supported by an empire of military bases . "
In other words , for all of Bush & Co. 's rapaciousness , not just congressional Democrats but , deep - down , most of us concur that , if we 're running out of oil , it 's our right , simply by dint of our might , to take what we need .
If it were n't for all those pesky jihadis , mujahideen , global guerillas , terrorists -- call them what you will -- conspiring to topple us with everything from the slings of systems disruption to the arrows of nuclear missiles .
Attempting to secure our shores from them is like trying to defend the indefensible -- literally .
And metaphorically , as well , when we cling to the myth that we 're manifestly destined to determine the fates of other nations .
Our military might , 700 bases around the world and nuclear capability have outlived whatever their usefulness they had .
The US has become like Russia -- our once - and - ( the way things are going ) future enemy .
We 're a lumbering mastodon , which the cave people of the world lure into traps , like Iraq , where we thrash around and lash out blindly .
It could all have turned out differently if we had n't been stomping around their territory ravishing their resources .
In short , the US needs to take the " super " out of " superpower . "
We might be surprised to find that a country could get used to life without the pressure of being number one .

It started with an ever - expanding sinkhole at the entrance of the Mystic Pointe condominiums here and led to an excavation this spring that revealed an underground complex of brick chambers with vaulted ceilings .
Now the subterranean structure , believed to date to the mid-19th century , is a mystery just begging to be solved .
Is it as pedestrian as a root cellar ?
Or as storied as a stop on the Underground Railroad ?
Does it stretch beyond the cluster of at least nine known rooms to connect to tunnels elsewhere ?
An ad - hoc group of residents , local historians and archaeologists in this Westchester County suburb is racing to figure it out before road repairs that could lead to the destruction of the rooms , which sit under a wooded area that had been part of a Victorian estate and once was owned by a Catholic church .
“ The issue has become a major problem for the condominium as a whole , ” said Anne Marie Leone , a Mystic Pointe resident who writes the “ Then and Now ” feature in The Rivertowns Enterprise and has lately spent much of her free time trying to solve the mystery .

A top BMW boss has been jailed for six weeks for lying to police after being clocked speeding at 101 mph in a Mini .
Thomas Moser , 48 , finance director of the BMW - owned Mini factory in Oxford was given three times to change his story .
Scroll down for more ...
Yesterday he was jailed for perjury after claiming falsely that his 19 - year - old son had been driving the car at more than twice the legal 50 mph speed limit .
He is the latest in a growing number of motorists who try to illegally " swap points " to keep their licences clean or escape a ban .
Mr Moser , from Oxford , was caught shortly after 7 am on May 4 by a speed - camera van on Oxford 's Eastern by - pass .
The legal limit on the road is 50 mph .
He was driving a BMW - owned Mini - the cult car made by the British - based but German owned firm whose finances he controlled , Banbury Magistrates ' court was told .
Despite photographic evidence to the contrary , Moser , a German national , claimed his son Maximilian was driving at the time of the offence .
He continued to name his son despite three times being given the chance to change his story .
He pleaded guilty in court to making a false written statement and to the speeding charge .
Moser , who has a 20 - year career with BMW and was believed to be on a six - figure salary , was sentenced to six weeks jail for perjury , and fined £ 1,200 for speeding .
He was ordered to pay £ 60 costs and was disqualified from driving for three months .
The company 's top of the range Mini Cooper S has a top speed of 140 mph .
Yesterday 's jail sentence on a senior executive is expected to be taken as a salutary lesson to others .
A spokeswoman for BMW said last night : " We are investigating disciplinary action in this case .
" Mr Moser is the finance director of the Oxford Mini plant . "
The incident tarnishes a proud record for BMW which has reinvented the iconic British - built Mini for the 21st century - and reaped a boom in sales .
BMW announced recently that the capacity of the booming Mini factory in Oxford is to be expanded to produce 260,000 cars a year - 20,000 more than the 240,000 already earmarked .
Mini has just launched a new Mini Clubman estate car , with two open doors at the back and a double opening at the side .
A Mini " off - roader " recreational vehicle is also planned , but BMW has confirmed that this will be built abroad , possibly in Austria .
The car giant has invested £ 100 million and created 200 more jobs at the factory - taking the total workforce at Oxford to 4,500 .
But with an engine plant at Hams Hall and a body pressing plant in Swindon , the total UK workforce is 6,800 .
The investment is on top of £ 280 million between 2000 and 2004 .
Darren McCauley , head of car insurance at Churchill , said : " People have become so dependent on their cars that they will go to great lengths to avoid a driving ban .
" Unless driving habits change , speeding will become a real threat to the modern motorist . "
By contrast , England soccer legend Teddy Sheringham admitted in July nominating someone else to take speeding points for him - but escaped with a caution .
He was among a group of stars arrested for allegedly swapping speeding points to beat driving bans .
Sheringham , 41 , initially denied the allegation .
But the policeman 's son later accepted a caution for perverting the course of justice .
He spent an hour with police after answering bail at Chingford Police Station , East London .
Sheringham , who has been awarded an MBE , will not have a police record but details of the offence will be kept on file .
His former West Ham club - mate Bobby Zamora got cautioned for the same offence two weeks earlier .
One reason for the crackdown on ' points swapping ' is a change in the nature of speed cameras .
Traditional style yellow - box ' GATSO cameras flash from the rear , so the identity of the driver is not seen .
By contrast , new forward facing digital cameras have a clear shot of the driver 's face , which can be used for identification purposes .

A low - fat vegetarian diet is very efficient in terms of how much land is needed to support it .
But adding some dairy products and a limited amount of meat may actually increase this efficiency , Cornell researchers suggest .
This deduction stems from the findings of their new study , which concludes that if everyone in New York state followed a low - fat vegetarian diet , the state could directly support almost 50 percent more people , or about 32 percent of its population , agriculturally .
With today 's high - meat , high - dairy diet , the state is able to support directly only 22 percent of its population , say the researchers .
The study , published in the journal Renewable Agriculture and Food Systems , is the first to examine the land requirements of complete diets .
The researchers compared 42 diets with the same number of calories and a core of grains , fruits , vegetables and dairy products ( using only foods that can be produced in New York state ) , but with varying amounts of meat ( from none to 13.4 ounces daily ) and fat ( from 20 to 45 percent of calories ) to determine each diet 's " agricultural land footprint . "
They found a fivefold difference between the two extremes .
" A person following a low - fat vegetarian diet , for example , will need less than half ( 0.44 ) an acre per person per year to produce their food , " said Christian Peters , M.S. ' 02 , Ph.D. ' 07 , a Cornell postdoctoral associate in crop and soil sciences and lead author of the research .
" A high - fat diet with a lot of meat , on the other hand , needs 2.11 acres . "
" Surprisingly , however , a vegetarian diet is not necessarily the most efficient in terms of land use , " said Peters .
Chris Peters honored for foodshed work Chris Peters , the lead author of the study on New York 's agricultural footprint , has been honored for related work on local " foodsheds , " as well as his teaching and outreach , with the 2007 Gerald O. Mott Scholarship for Meritorious Graduate Students in Crop Science .
The award will be presented Nov. 6 at the American Society of Agronomy , Crops Science Society of America and Soils Science Society of America 's International annual meetings in New Orleans .
The reason is that fruits , vegetables and grains must be grown on high - quality cropland , he explained .
Meat and dairy products from ruminant animals are supported by lower quality , but more widely available , land that can support pasture and hay .
A large pool of such land is available in New York state because for sustainable use , most farmland requires a crop rotation with such perennial crops as pasture and hay .
Thus , although vegetarian diets in New York state may require less land per person , they use more high - valued land .
" It appears that while meat increases land - use requirements , diets including modest amounts of meat can feed more people than some higher fat vegetarian diets , " said Peters .
" The key to conserving land and other resources with our diets is to limit the amount of meat we eat and for farmers to rely more on grazing and forages to feed their livestock , " said Jennifer Wilkins , senior extension associate in nutritional sciences who specializes in the connection between local food systems and health and co-authored the study with Gary Fick , Cornell professor of crop and soil sciences .
" Consumers need to be aware that foods differ not only in their nutrient content but in the amount of resources required to produce , process , package and transport them . "
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture , the average American ate approximately 5.8 ounces of meat and eggs a day in 2005 .
" In order to reach the efficiency in land use of moderate - fat , vegetarian diets , our study suggests that New Yorkers would need to limit their annual meat and egg intake to about 2 cooked ounces a day , " Peters said .
The research was supported in part by the National Research Initiative of the USDA Cooperative State Research , Education and Extension Service .
Chomsky points out the basic assumption of the mainstream debate about Iran is that we ( US ) own the world - that we somehow have the right to judge .
It 's amazing how well Chomsky can see through the propaganda .
I find even being aware that it is propaganda , I think get tainted by it sometimes , I still sometimes do n't realize who the whole debate is framed and structured .
Precision and Accuracy
When we make a measurement in the laboratory we need to know how good it is .
To this end , we introduce two concepts : Precision and Accuracy .
Precision indicates degree of reproducibility of a measured number , and
Accuracy indicates how close your measurements are to the true value .
Let 's look at throwing darts and trying to hit the bullseye as an illustration of these two concepts .
When you make measurements in science you want them to be both precise and accurate .
Two students , Raffaella and Barbara , measured the temperature of boiling water , which by definition should be 100 °C under 1 atmosphere of pressure .
Each student made 10 temperature measurements , shown below as red ( Raffaella ) and blue ( Barbara ) dots .
The average of Raffaella 's temperature measurements is 100.1 °C and the average of Barbara 's is also 100.1°C .
So , the accuracy of their measurements is identical .
On the other hand , you can see from the figure that the precision of Raffaella 's measurements was better than Barbara's .
The way this is expressed in science is to include an uncertainty with measured values .
In this case Raffaella would report a boiling point of 100.1 ± 0.3°C , and Barbara would report 100.1 ± 1.4°C .
This uncertainty is also called a random error , and is different from a systematic error , which is the difference between the average value and the true value .
Here , both Raffaella and Barbara had systematic errors of 0.1 °C , since the true boiling point of water is 100°C .
Precision and Accuracy :
If , for whatever reason , the measurement uncertainty cannot be specified , then at the very least , the precision in a measured number can be approximately specified through the number of significant figures .
In the example above , Rafaella would report a boiling point of 1.001 x 102 °C , whereas Barbara would report 1.00 x 102 °C .
That is , Rafaella 's result has four significant figures while Barbara 's has only three .
( CNN ) --
An Iowa district court ruled Thursday that same - sex couples can marry based on the state constitution 's guarantee of equal treatment , court documents show .
An Iowa district judge ruled in favor of same - sex marriage .
The ruling was in response to a December 2005 lawsuit brought by six same - sex couples seeking to wed .
They were denied marriage licenses and claimed such treatment violates equal - protection and due- process clauses in the Iowa constitution .
The court also struck down a state law declaring valid marriages are only between a man and woman .
The Iowa District Court for Polk County advances the case to the Iowa Supreme Court which will make a final decision on same - sex marriage , according to Lambda Legal , a gay and lesbian legal organization representing the couples .
The 63 - page ruling , written by Judge Robert Hanson states : " Couples , such as plaintiffs , who are otherwise qualified to marry one another may not be denied licenses to marry or certificates of marriage or in any other way prevented from entering into a civil marriage pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 595 by reason of the fact that both persons compromising such a couple are of the same sex . "
The law describing marriage as between a man and a woman , " constitutes the most intrusive means by the state to regulate marriage .
This statute is an absolute prohibition on the ability of gay and lesbian individuals to marry a person of their choosing , " Hanson wrote .
Lambda says the six couples are all in long - term relationship - one couple has been together for six years , another couple has been together for 17 years .
" Three of the couples are raising children , others are planning families , and all want the responsibilities of marriage and the protections only marriage can provide , " according to the organization .
" We respectfully disagree with the court 's decision , and we 're going to ask for a stay , " said Polk County Attorney John Sarcone .
He said his office will examine whether it 's best to file a motion to reconsider .
But barring a change in the court 's opinion , Sarcone will appeal the ruling .
Co-counsel for the plaintiffs along with Lambda Legal , Dennis Johnson called the ruling " a significant step forward in recognizing the constitutional rights of all Iowans , and it's an amazing day for same - sex couples and their families all across Iowa . "

“ There ’s a lot of good competition this year , ” said ‘ Herbal Santa ’ a longtime marijuana smoker from Orange Country , California , who , when asked for his name only offered ‘ Jim ’ .
Organizers said they expected about 3,500 participants .
The week - long Cannabis Cup is spread out at various coffee shops throughout Amsterdam , although the main events are held in a club on the outskirts of the city , tucked behind a McDonald ’s fast - food restaurant and a do - it - yourself store .
The event coincides with the annual U.S. Thanksgiving holiday , allowing participants from across the Atlantic to spend a week ’s holiday in Amsterdam .
The event was started in 1987 by Steven Hager , the editor of New York - based magazine High Times that advocates the legalization of cannabis , and has become a key annual event among cannabis - orientated business and for many pot smokers .
Judges pay a fee of up to $ 200 to participate in selecting the winners with their task to examine the potency , taste , smell , curing and overall experience of various herbs .
Marijuana is technically illegal but has been decriminalized and is tolerated in the Netherlands , where it is sold in small quantities in “ coffee shops . ”
“ People should come to peace together and smoke , ” said Arjan Roskam , owner of the Green House Seed Co. , whose marijuana strains have won 31 Cannabis Cup prizes over the years .
His coffee house is a frequent destination for visiting celebrities .
“ You see people from 18 to 80 having a good time , ” said Roskam .
“ It ’s a very friendly gathering . ”
When viral marketing goes awry
The US government is secretly mixing chemicals into the water supply that are supposed to make us immune against chemical weapons .
What sounds like another crazy conspiracy theory is actually - no , not the truth , but part of an underground marketing campaign for the upcoming Nine Inch Nails ( NIN ) album Year Zero .
( Screenshot snippet of the campaign website iamtryingtobelieve.com
The album is promoted with what viral marketing experts call an Alternative Reality Game .
Think of it as an internet - based game of paper - chase , with obscure web sites , answering machines and clues on NIN tour t- shirts all being part of a giant , mysterious puzzle .
NIN fans and Alternative Reality Games players alike have been forming global , spontaneous collaborations to figure out what the game really is about .
They have been exchanging clues on literally thousands of message board postings .
They have been scouring the bathrooms of clubs hosting NIN gigs after mysterious flash drives started appearing , containing MP3s from the upcoming album along with additional clues .
And they have been swapping these MP3s online after they discovered that some of the audio files contain hidden messages themselves German blogger by the name of Christoph Boecken wanted to take part in the game as well .
He did n't want to get accused of spreading unauthorized MP3s though , which is why he posted a Flash player on his blog that allowed streaming , but not downloading one of the songs .
A few days later Boecken received a letter from a well - known German law firm that handles piracy cases for NIN 's label Universal Music , accusing him of copyright infringement .
The letter did n't only demand him taking down the MP3 file in question , but also paying 500 Euro ( about 675 USD ) to cover the expenses for sending this letter .
Invoices like this are regularly part of cease and desist letters in Germany .
Boecken felt betrayed by Universal .
After all , he had helped them with their marketing - and now he was supposed to pay for his efforts ?
He wrote a couple of frustrated rants on his blog , but eventually decided to pay the money because hiring a lawyer and dragging out the case could have been much more expensive .
By last week a growing number of German bloggers became aware of his case .
They started spreading the word , writing emails to Universal and calling up the label in person .
Finally they must have gotten through to someone who realized that lawyers are n't supposed to be part of your marketing .
Universal Germany got in touch with Boecken over the weekend .
They apologized to him , promised to pay back his expenses and give him a chance to meet the Nine Inch Nails backstage .
Ende gut , alles gut , as they say in Germany .
A happy end for everyone .
Universal Germany definitely made up for it 's mistakes , and Boecken made peace with a band that he - while still being a big fan - started to have mixed feelings about .
But unfortunately this is n't the end of the story .
It looks like the efforts to clear the blogosphere from NIN MP3s may have been internationally coordinated .
The music and entertainment gossip blog Idolator got an email from the RIAA , demanding to take down one of the virally marketed NIN MP3s , just about at the same time when Boecken got his costly C&D letter .
Idolator did n't have to pay up , but they were pissed nonetheless :
Of course there is another explanation for this whole mess : Alternative Reality Games tend to be surrounded by secrecy .
Companies regularly do n't disclose their involvement to participating players out of the fear of spoiling the game .
Maybe in this case they should have at least told the RIAA .

In Linux , and other UNIX - like systems , you have to be root ( have superuser privileges ) in order to listen to TCP or UDP ports below 1024 ( the well - known ports ) .
This port 1024 limit is a security measure .
But it is based on an obsolete security model and today it only gives a false sense of security and contributes to security holes .
The port 1024 limit forces you to run all network daemons with
superuser privileges , which might open security holes .
Without the port 1024 limit , most network daemons ( except sshd ) , could be run without superuser privileges .
Some daemons try to remedy this potential security hole by dropping the superuser privileges after binding to the port , but you still need to start the daemon as root .
And this does not work if the daemon is written in Java , which is quite popular for web servers .
Today the typical Linux machine is not used in a way which makes the port 1024 limit relevant .
Either you use it as a desktop client ( workstation ) with only one user which have superuser access via sudo .
In the desktop case the limit is a source of frustration since you have to use sudo more often than necessary .
Or you use it as a firewall , router or web / database / DNS / mail / news server and then only trusted administrators can login at all .
The database or web application have it ’s own user account system separate from the system ’s and these untrusted users cannot install any daemons at all .
And even if you use a Linux machine in a way where the port 1024 limit could be useful , i.e. allowing untrusted users to login , you ’d better not count on it .
If a malicious user can login to a normal unprivileged account , it might be possible to exploit some security hole and gain superuser access .
So if you allow untrusted users to login to a Linux machine , you should not use that machine for anything else and the daemons running on that machine should not be trusted .
The port 1024 limit actually bites itself in the tail .
It forces a daemon practice that might open security holes which make the limit ineffective as a security measure .
I do not blame those who invented the port 1024 limit , it was a natural and important security feature given how UNIX machines was used in 1970 ’s and 1980’s .
A typical UNIX machine allowed a bunch of not necessary fully trusted people to log in and do stuff .
You do n’t want these untrusted users to be able to install a custom daemon pretending to be a well - known service such as telnet or ftp since that could be used to steal passwords and other nasty things .
The port 1024 limit is part of the same security model that gave us the rlogin authentication .
That security model is based on the assumption that every machine ( but not every user ) on the network can be trusted , that only trusted users have root access to any network connected machine and that all network connected machines have the same port 1024 limit .
It is well - known that this security model is obsolete and totally useless on the public Internet today .
Virtually anyone can connect a computer to the pubic Internet and have root access , and there is at least one popular operating system without this port 1024 limit – Microsoft Windows .
Because of this , no sensible person uses rlogin authentication on an Internet connected network today ( at least not without being protected by a carefully configured firewall ) .
But the port 1024 limit is still there in Linux and most other UNIX style systems .
I wonder why .
Is n’t it time to declare the port 1024 limit as obsolete too and remove it ?
It would probably not be a good idea to remove the port 1024 limit completely immediately .
Some machines depend on the limit for security and their system configuration has to be properly adjusted .
The solution is to make it configurable .
FreeBSD have a pair of sysctl parameters allowing you to adjust ( or effectively remove ) this port limit , net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedlow and net.inet.ip.portrange.reservedhigh .
It would be nice if something similar was implemented in Linux ( and in other UNIX - like systems ) .
It ’s probably not very useful to be able to adjust the lower part of the range , it can be fixed at 0 .
But it would be very useful to adjust the higher part of the range from the current value 1023 .
If you set it to 79 you can run a web server without superuser privileges , but only root can bind to the lower ports ( such as ssh ) .

Facebook SANTIAGO , Chile ( AP ) 
The king of Spain told Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to " shut up " Saturday during a heated exchange at a summit of leaders from Latin America , Spain and Portugal .
Chavez , who called President Bush the " devil " on the floor of the United Nations last year , triggered the exchange by repeatedly referring to former Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar as a " fascist . "
Aznar , a conservative who was an ally of Bush as prime minister , " is a fascist , " Chavez said in a speech at the Ibero - American summit in Santiago , Chile .
" Fascists are not human .
A snake is more human . "
Spain 's current socialist prime minister , Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , responded during his own allotted time by urging Chavez to be more diplomatic in his words and respect other leaders despite political differences .
" Former President Aznar was democratically elected by the Spanish people and was a legitimate representative of the Spanish people , " he said , eliciting applause from the gathered heads of state .
Chavez repeatedly tried to interrupt , but his microphone was off .
Spanish King Juan Carlos , seated next to Zapatero , angrily turned to Chavez and said , " Why do n't you shut up ? "
The Venezuelan leader did not immediately respond , but later used time ceded to him by his close ally Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega to answer Zapatero 's speech .
" I do not offend by telling the truth , " he said .
" The Venezuelan government reserves the right to respond to any aggression , anywhere , in any space and in any manner . "
Later , Chavez joined the presidents of Bolivia and Nicaragua , along with Cuba 's vice president , at a parallel " People 's Summit " that leftist groups organized .
Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage handed Chavez a cellphone as the Venezuelan leader addressed the crowd , saying that Fidel Castro was on the line .
Chavez listened briefly and told his audience that Castro was " paying tribute to international and Chilean combatants who fell fighting tyranny . "
The three - day Ibero - American summit ended Saturday with leaders pledging to fight poverty and increase regional cooperation .
The 18 heads of state signed a landmark accord that will allow nearly 6 million migrant workers in Latin America , Spain and Portugal to transfer social security benefits between their nations .
The leaders also vowed to fight " all forms of terrorism " and called on the U.S. to end its economic embargo against Cuba .

This time , venture capitalists loved the idea .
So did Craig McCaw , the early cellular telecommunications pioneer who is now chairman of Clearwire , a wireless network operator .
As Mr. Rubin was negotiating terms with Mr. McCaw , he sent an e-mail message to Mr. Page informing him of the potential partnership .
Within weeks , Google acquired Android for an undisclosed sum .
Mr. McCaw declined to comment on the sale .
AS a testament to Mr. Rubin ’s inner robot , a kitchen cabinet in his home bears a long scar from a laser - controlled Segway , the self - balancing , two - wheeled scooter , that crashed into it recently .
It ’s just one example of the web of computer technology that he lives in .
Mr. Rubin has also tricked out his home theater system to slightly brighten his living - room lights once the screen credits roll at the end of a movie .
Several model helicopters are parked downstairs in his house , all programmed to fly autonomously .
Mr. Rubin readily acknowledges his obsession with consumer gadgets and even more expensive toys — an obsession that put him at odds with Google ’s stated aversion to conspicuous consumption .
The day before Google went public in 2004 , Wayne Rosing , then the vice president for engineering , stood on a stage during a companywide meeting and brandished a baseball bat .
He threatened to use it on anyone ’s car in the Google parking lot that was anything flashier than a 3 Series BMW .
As a result , Mr. Rubin had to buy a new car when he came to Google .
( A souped - up German sports car that he recently acquired sits at home in his garage . )
He acknowledges the discomfort created by the situation .
“ One of the things that Google ’s really good at is not encouraging conspicuous consumption , ” he says .
“ I ’m a big fan of well - engineered things , and so I ’m wrestling with how those two things can coexist . ”
Mr. Rubin is also wrestling with another responsibility : trying to reinvent the cellphone on his second try .
He declined to offer any insights into his strategy , and whether he has the answer wo n’t be clear for about a year — perhaps longer .
Google has a tremendous amount of corporate momentum , and its search service is a huge consumer magnet .
At the same time , wireless carriers jealously guard their networks and worry constantly about the possibility of losing control to potential competitors like Google .
Moreover , the market is already crowded .
Microsoft got a head - start with its Windows Mobile platform a half - decade ago and in the past year has accelerated its efforts by persuading hand - set makers like Motorola , Palm and Samsung to include the software with its phones .
Microsoft is certain to invest heavily to ward off Google ’s incursions into the market .

Facebook SHEIK HUSSEIN VILLAGE , Jordan 
For years , Ibrahim Alayyan watched in frustration as rats devoured the date palms at his lush family farm .
Having no luck with pesticides , the retired Jordanian heart surgeon was only too eager to try a pest control agent widely used in fields just across the Jordan River in Israel — owls .
" There used to be so many rats , " Alayyan said .
" But after we put in the owls , thank God , this is the first time we have had a full date harvest . "
To the world , the symbol of peace may be a dove , but to farmers on either side of the Jordan , it 's Tyto alba , the common barn owl .
Alayyan is one of dozens of Jordanians working in cooperation with Israeli colleagues , targeting rodents with a natural predator instead of with chemicals .
The effort still faces suspicions and superstitions , but organizers hope the message of their partial success will spread to Lebanon , Syria and other Middle Eastern countries , and demonstrate the fruits of the 1994 peace treaty that ended a 46 - year state of war between Israel and Jordan .
Political benefits aside , the project is driven foremost by environmental concerns .
In the late 1970s , chemicals killed hundreds of birds in northern Israel , said Yossi Leshem , an Israeli ornithologist and director of the International Center for the Study of Bird Migration .
So Leshem persuaded Sde Eliyahu , a kibbutz south of the Sea of Galilee , to try owls , which can eat up to 10 rodents a day .
All the farmers needed was to build boxes where the birds could mate and raise their young .
" I put up 14 barn owl boxes , and everybody laughed at me , " said Shauli Aviel , who oversees the effort at the collective farm .
A few years later , Sde Eliyahu 's rat problem had vanished , he said .
More than 60 nesting boxes now sit on the grounds of the kibbutz , and the technique has caught on with other farmers along the Jordan .
Yet as the owl population grew , the birds increasingly began flying — and looking to nest — across the nearby border with Jordan , where pesticide use remains rampant .
Chemicals seeped into the water table , and owls were poisoned by eating contaminated rodents .
Then came the peace treaty , Israelis and Jordanians got used to being good neighbors , and in late 2002 Aviel and fellow Israeli farmers planned a regional conference on barn owls to explain their advantages to colleagues across the Jordan River .
The response was discouraging .
Many Arabs consider owls the same way others view black cats — as bad luck .
Word came back to the Israelis that no Jordanians would attend .
So the organizers changed the title of the conference to focus on organic farming , and two dozen Jordanians turned up .
Midway through the gathering they were given a demonstration on owls , and soon Jordanian farmers were asking how they could attract owls to their fields , Aviel said .
With funding from the Jewish Community Federation of Cleveland , Ohio , the kibbutz gave the Jordanians advice and building materials .
More than three dozen nesting boxes have since been put up in Jordan , organizers said .
Among the most eager participants was Alayyan , a former chief of cardiovascular surgery at a Jordanian hospital .
He agreed to build a nesting box at his family 's farm in the village of Sheik Hussein , six miles from Aviel 's kibbutz .
" For me , it was a real pleasure to find a man like that on the other side of the border , " said Aviel , as he and Alayyan surveyed a group of newborn owl nestlings .
Unable to communicate in their own languages , the two men spoke to each other in English , but when it came to nature and conservation , " He spoke in my language , " Aviel said .
The project also has gotten support from political and former military leaders in both countries , including Mansour Abu Rashed , the former head of Jordanian intelligence .
Rashed , who heads the Amman Center for Peace and Development , said organizers are " under no illusions " the owl project will ease Mideast tensions ; the goal is simply " to bring people together , to let them talk and build confidence . "
But obstacles remain .
After the U.S. - led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 , Israeli farmers delayed the initial delivery of building materials to Jordan for the owl boxes because of the tense atmosphere .
Arabic posters promoting the benefits of barn owls make no mention of Israel .
Some Israeli organizers have expressed frustration at the pace of progress in Jordan .
And last month , some nesting boxes on Jordanian farms were stolen or vandalized .
Although it was unclear whether the vandalism was driven by owl - phobia or by Israel 's involvement , it upset Leshem , the Israeli ornithologist .
" We are wasting our money and time , coming and putting boxes — and then , suddenly , they are destroyed , " he said after a recent meeting with the Jordanians .
" It 's a new project in our area , " explained Abu Rashed , the retired general .
" Nobody knows what 's inside " the boxes .
Organizers also say the project has gained little traction among Palestinians , because of security restrictions that make it hard for them and Israelis to travel to each other 's territory for meetings .
Still , even when tensions run high , the environment is one of the few areas where Israelis and Arabs cooperate .
The owl conference went ahead at a time when the Palestinian uprising against Israel was at its peak , and during that uprising , Israeli and Palestinian officials maintained contacts on issues such as water quality and waste removal .
The Arava Institute for Environmental Studies in southern Israel trains Jewish and Arab students , including Jordanians and Palestinians , in solving ecological problems .
Friends of the Earth - Middle East , an organization of Israeli , Jordanian and Palestinian environmentalists , leads joint efforts to clean up the Jordan River and promote eco-tourism packages on both sides of the border .
" We 're doing something our governments are not able to do , " says Mira Edelstein , an organization spokeswoman .
" If people know how to highlight the environmental benefits that can come out of this type of cooperation , then it's not political anymore . "

The Centre for Education and Research in Environmental Strategies ( CERES ) is an urban oasis on the banks of the Merri Creek , 5 km North of Melbourne CBD in Victoria , Australia .
Over the last 30 years the local community has transformed the 4 hectare landfill site into a thriving community environment park , which encompasses a wide range of enterprises .
( Extracts below are on behalf of the authors , with their permission )
Here are some quotes from the Press Release :
“ Food Miles in Australia : A Preliminary study of Melbourne , Victoria ” researched and written by Asha Bee Abraham and Sophie Gaballa estimates the distances travelled for food items found in a typical Melburnian 's shopping basket and the resulting greenhouse emissions from this transportation .
CERES Chairperson Robert Larocca said that the community understands the link between greenhouse gas emissions and personal transport and energy use , but is only now coming to understand the amount of emissions that result from the production of our food .
The study aims to open discourse in Australia about the sustainability of our centralised food systems and food production and take a proactive stance on forecasting future emissions .
Co-author of the study ; Sophie Gaballa said “ With the current urgency required to respond to climate change and peak oil challenges , the study highlights the need for Australia to respond accurately to the role our current food system plays within these issues . ”
“ The study revealed that food items like oranges , sausages , tea , baked beans etc with ingredients sourced from overseas have seen more of the world than most people .
In fact , the report estimates that the total distance travelled by 29 of our most common food items is 70,803 km — that 's nearly two times the distance around the Earth !
“ Calculating road transport alone , our shopping basket has still travelled 21,073 km , almost the whole way around Australia 's coastline .
The resulting greenhouse gas emissions estimate for all food transporting trucks carrying these 25 items on any given day is the equivalent of 4,247 cars driving for a whole year !
And that 's just for one shopping basket of 25 items .
“ Taking into consideration how far our food travels is only part of the Food Miles story .
To further assess the environmental impact of food items you need to also look at how they are transported , processed and packaged to gain a more complete picture of the energy footprint of food systems , ” Ms Gaballa concluded .
The research was sponsored by the Finkel Foundation with the aim to develop a food education program that will inform and empower primary and secondary students through their food choices .
Results
Below are two tables of results from the study .
The figurs represent the food miles ( kilometres ! ) and greenhouse gas emissions ( for road transportation ) associated with a typical basket of food purchased in a Melbourne supermarket .
[ 1 km = 0.62 miles ]

Junk food junkies take notice .
What you eat does more than influence your gut .
It also may affect your brain .
Increasing evidence shows that mom was right :
You should eat your vegetables , and your blueberries and walnuts , too .
Scientists are confirming that this age - old adage is worth following .
And new studies show that diet may have implications for those who suffer from certain brain ailments .
Diets containing two percent , six percent , or nine percent walnuts , when given to old rats , were found to reverse several parameters of brain aging , as well as age - related motor and cognitive deficits , says James Joseph , PhD , of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts University in Boston .
In previous research , Joseph and his colleagues showed that old rats maintained for two months on diets containing two percent high antioxidant strawberry or blueberry extracts exhibited reversals of age - related deficits in the way that neurons function and in motor and cognitive behavior .
In the brain , antioxidant molecules wage war against molecules known as free radicals , which can harm brain cells and brain function .
The present research extends these findings and shows that walnuts can have a similar effect .
Walnuts contain alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , an essential omega - 3 fatty acid , and other polyphenols that act as antioxidants and may actually block the signals produced by free radicals that can later produce compounds that would increase inflammation .
Findings from the studies by Joseph and his colleague Barbara Shukitt - Hale , PhD , show for the first time that shorter chain fatty acids found in plants , such as walnuts , may have beneficial effects on cognition similar to those from long chain fatty acids derived from animal sources , which have been reported previously .
A six percent diet is equivalent to a person eating 1 ounce of walnuts each day , which is the recommended amount to reduce harmful low - density lipoprotein , or LDL , cholesterol , while a nine percent diet is equivalent to people eating 1.5 ounces of walnuts per day .
“ Importantly , ” Joseph says , “ this information , coupled with our previous studies , shows that the addition of walnuts , berries , and grape juice to the diet may increase ‘ health span ’ in aging and provide a ‘ longevity dividend ’ or economic benefit for slowing the aging process by reducing the incidence and delaying the onset of debilitating degenerative disease . ”
Joseph and his colleagues are currently assessing whether increased neurogenesis or alterations in stress signaling , or both , may be involved in the mechanisms through which the walnut diets could be producing their effects .
Ongoing research suggests that walnuts involve more than the mere “ quenching ” of free radicals and may in fact involve direct effects on blocking the deleterious “ stress signals ” generated by the oxidative stressors .
“ The beneficial effects of walnuts also may be the direct result of enhancements of signals which mediate such important functions as neuronal communication and the growth of new neurons , ” says Joseph .
A great deal of data suggests that the deficits associated with aging , for example , Alzheimer ’s disease and cardiovascular diseases , arise as a result of an increasing inability of the aging organism to protect itself against inflammation and oxidative stress , providing fertile ground for the development of neurodegenerative diseases .
“ The good news , ” Joseph says , “ is that it appears that compounds found in fruits and vegetables — and , as we have shown in our research , walnuts — may provide the necessary protection to prevent the demise of cognitive and motor function in aging . ”
Other research shows that walnut extract may play a role toward developing novel treatments for Alzheimer ’s .
Amyloid -ß plaques are the primary physiological hallmark of Alzheimer ’s .
The presence of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase within these plaques has been confirmed , and the enzyme has been shown to induce plaque formation .
Modern Alzheimer ’s drugs typically target either acetylcholinesterase activity or plaque formation , but do not simultaneously inhibit both .
“ Therefore , they only have limited success in slowing the progression of the disease , ” says Gina Wilson , of Baldwin - Wallace College in Berea , Ohio .
Wilson and her colleagues have discovered through the use of strictly chemical techniques in the absence of living cells that walnut extract and two of its major components , gallic and ellagic acids , act as “ dual- inhibitors ” of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase .
Chemical techniques included enzyme kinetics and colorimetric analyses of congo red , a dye that binds to amyloid -ß aggregates .
It was found that gallic and ellagic acids not only inhibit the site of acetylcholinesterase associated with amyloid -ß protein aggregation , but will also inhibit the site of acetylcholinesterase responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine .
“ Initially , we confirmed earlier results showing that walnut extract inhibits amyloid -ß protein aggregation in the presence of acetylcholinesterase and breaks apart preformed aggregates , ” says Wilson .
“ However , the new findings have not been presented elsewhere or replicated by other laboratories , to the best of our knowledge . ”
Wilson ’s research is the first set of data to demonstrate inhibition of acetylcholine breakdown by walnut extract and to isolate specific chemicals from that extract , gallic and ellagic acids , responsible for the observed dual - inhibition .
The research is the first to suggest that ellagic acid , and possibly gallic acid , can break up preformed aggregates .
While exact replications are needed , Wilson and her colleagues plan to extend their research to live animals .
They plan to inject rats with an amyloid -ß protein fragments that will aggregate in their brains .
Experimental animals will then be treated with either chemical .
This will allow for measurements of brain acetylcholinesterase activity , plaque formation , and oxidative damage .
Additionally , this procedure will provide comparisons of cognitive - behavioral data between treated and untreated groups .
Acetylcholine is a brain chemical particularly important for learning and memory .
Levels of acetylcholine found in the brains of Alzheimer ’s patients are significantly depleted .
However , this is not the sole event responsible for progression of the disease .
Abnormal amyloid -ß proteins aggregate and form what are known as plaques , another key feature found in the brains of Alzheimer ’s sufferers .
Amyloid -ß plaques have also been linked to the memory impairments and cognitive decline associated with the disease .
Acetylcholinesterase is an integral part of these plaques and accelerates plaque formation .
“ It is important , ” Wilson says , “ to investigate ‘ dual - inhibitors ’ of acetylcholinesterase in efforts to develop more efficient pharmacological treatments for Alzheimer ’s disease . ”
Another avenue of research regarding a link between diet and the brain shows that blueberries contain compounds that can reduce inflammation in the central nervous system .
Inflammation in the central nervous system is known to be a key issue in the progression of neurodegeneration , and dietary intake of blueberries has been shown to alleviate cognitive decline associated with disease and aging .
Thomas Kuhn , PhD , of the University of Alaska , Fairbanks , and his colleagues have discovered that Alaska wild bog blueberries contain compounds that efficiently interfere with inflammatory processes in the central nervous system .
The study conducted in Kuhn ’s lab revealed an interaction between compounds in Alaska blueberries and a specific protein molecule in neuronal cells that reduces detrimental effects of inflammation .
Understanding the interaction of these compounds could lead to the development of new drug therapies that would diminish inflammation of the brain and spinal cord .
While the health benefits of fruits and vegetables are largely attributed to polyphenols , molecules with strong antioxidant potential , Kuhn says that , surprisingly , the compounds in Alaska blueberries discovered in their study are neither antioxidants nor polyphenols , yet rather serve as specific inhibitors .
Using a cell - based model of nueroinflammation , Kuhn ’s lab exposed neuronal cells to tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFa ) , a pivotal factor mediating inflammation in the brain and spinal cord .
Exposure of neuronal cells to TNFa rapidly stimulates a cascade of reactions , which ultimately leads to the death of neuronal cells .
The application of Alaska blueberry extracts to neuronal cells effectively prevented the degeneration of neuronal cells exposed to TNFa .
“ Expanding our knowledge of natural products ’ health benefits and their molecular targets in the nervous system would improve preventative measures and potentially reveal new therapeutic strategies to alleviate inflammation in the brain and spinal cord , ” says Kuhn .
Inflammation in the brain and spinal cord accompanies most chronic degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ’s , Parkinson ’s , ALS , or multiple sclerosis , or acute injuries including stroke and trauma .
Moreover , inflammation is highly prevalent in psychiatric disorders such as depression and autism and in the normal aging process .
In other recent studies , Ron Mervis , PhD , of the Center for Aging and Brain Repair at the University of South Florida College of Medicine in Tampa , Fla. , who collaborated with Joseph and Shukitt - Hale , has discovered that supplementing the diet of old rats with blueberries for a relatively short period ( 8 weeks ) , resulted in maintenance and rejuvenation of brain circuitry .
These results , using a small amount of blueberry extract , two percent , to supplement a standard rat diet , are the first to show that a dietary intervention , specifically blueberries , can not only protect against the loss of dendritic branching and dendritic spines ( e.g. , synapses ) seen in aged animals , but can result in neuroplastic enhancement of brain circuitry such that it looks like a much younger brain .
Mervis explains that age - related oxidation and inflammation in the brain can damage neurons .
He notes that blueberries also contain various chemical compounds - flavonoids - which have strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities .
“ These benefits , along with other indirect mechanisms , may help to minimize , or reverse , the age - related breakdown of communication between neurons , ” says Mervis , “ and optimize brain function in the old rat . ”
A two percent blueberry extract is equivalent to a human having about half a cup of blueberries added to their daily diet .
The decrease in the amount of dendritic branching , or atrophy , of neurons and loss of synapses on the branches in the aging mammalian brain is correlated with memory loss and cognitive dysfunction .
Dendrites , which receive and process incoming information from other neurons , comprise about 95 percent of the surface area of the cell , and the vast majority of the synapses are on dendritic spines .
Therefore , Joseph says , “ analysis of dendritic branching and dendritic spines can accurately reflect the integrity of brain circuits and neuronal communication . ”
Previous research showed that blueberry - enriched diets fed to aging rats reversed age - related declines in cognitive function .
The current data show that a diet supplemented with blueberry extract should be able to protect against the loss of dendritic branching and dendritic spines - in other words , Joseph says , the blueberry supplement diet “ would enhance the neuronal circuitry back to the status associated with a younger brain . ”
While these parameters have not been investigated in humans , it is known that individuals who consume a diet high in fruits and vegetables are less likely to develop some of the neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging and may not exhibit declines in motor and cognitive function that are as great as those seen in people whose consumption is less .

The human rights record of North Korea is extremely difficult to fully assess due to the secretive and closed nature of the country .
The North Korean government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do .
Even aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter .
Since citizens cannot freely leave the country , it is mainly from stories of refugees and defectors that the nation 's human rights record has been constructed .
The government 's position , expressed through the Korean Central News Agency , is that North Korea has no human rights issue , because its socialist system was chosen by the people and serves them faithfully .

( Reuters ) A young detainee shows a rash on his arm to al - Hashemi during his visit to the juvenile detention center in Baghdad Sept. 25 , 2007 .
October 9 , 2007
" They told me they would only question me for 5 minutes and I 've been here since the 25th of April , " says Ali Mohammed .
October 9 , 2007
As if it�s not enough that the Iraqis lost their homes , family members , jobs and in general their lives , the U.S. is now creating a new dilemma ; an Iraqi youth detention facility .
The children jailed there are aged between 11 and 17 years old and are detained over allegations ranging from theft to murder .
According to an ABC report , there has been a huge increase in the number of Iraqi detainees since the U.S. troop surge began earlier this year .
Recent reports say detainees� numbers increased from 250 in May to 800 now .
Those imprisoned are said to be mostly Sunnis .
Ali Mohammed is a teenager among thousands of detainees kept in an overcrowded prison in Western Baghdad who has no idea what his crime is .
" They told me they would only question me for five minutes and I have been here since the 25th of April , " Mohammed told Reuters .
" I suffer from epilepsy , a weak spine and a speech defect " , he added , expressing his surprise that he is considered a security threat .
Iraq�s Sunni Vice President , Tareq Al Hashemi , expressed his anger towards capturing innocent children and said he was speechless when he saw Mohammed during his last visit to the detention facility .
" How are they going to interrogate him ? " he told journalist who accompanied him while he toured Ahdath facility .
" Cases of lengthy detention without charge are an embarrassment to a government that says it promotes human rights and whose members , exiled or persecuted under Saddam Hussein 's rule , criticized abuses carried out by his security forces . "
Another orphan detained there was caught for stealing a cell phone from a crowded area in central Baghdad and three months later he has not been charged or tried .
" I 've been here for three months and I do n't know why I am here , " the young boy told Reuters .
As criticism mounts over the growing number of young detainees , Iraqi officials promise that this problem would be solved soon .
" We had a problem with ( detainees in ) Baghdad , but now we have 44 investigative judges and five criminal courts who are all working beyond their hours , " says the head of the Supreme Judicial Council , Midhat Al Mahmoud .
Last Saturday , Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih held a news conference where he promised everyone attending that the government would speed up trials in Iraqi courts .
" We want to cooperate with this humanitarian and legal issue through legal procedures only .
We do n't want this issue to be politicized because it would oppress the citizens who for one reason or another ended up in these prisons , " Salih said .
" There is a problem in Iraqi prisons .
It 's not shameful to acknowledge a problem ; it 's shameful to ignore it . "
According to Reuters , government figures show that 2,661 detainees have been sent to court since the security crackdown in the capital began in February .
Figures also show that more than 4,000 have been freed from prisons over the same period , though it is n�t clear whether those released were all from Baghdad .
One must wonder whether such numbers include those detained by the U.S. , and whether they are accurate given the difficulty of obtaining reliable figures from a government already tainted by corruption !

" Plants are designed to take damage from very large earthquakes , " says Williams , of the Oak Ridge ( Tenn . ) National Laboratory .
Wire reports said 315 gallons of " slightly radioactive " water were released after the quake .
" As long as it was ' slightly ' radioactive , then it is probably not a hazard , " Williams told USA TODAY .
Environmental agency officials will need to investigate such a large leak carefully , he adds .
" That sounds like a lot and from a PR standpoint , it is .
But we are probably still talking about a minor incident . "
Beginning operations in 1996 , the No. 6 reactor produces 1315 megawatts of electricity annually and was designed by Toshiba and General Electric .
So far , Japanese officials have not asked for any assistance with the reactor leak , says Ivonne Gouret of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
By Dan Vergano , USA TODAY GE - HITACHI STATEMENT GE-HITACHI STATEMENT
Serena Levy , PR Manager for GE Energy , released this information to USA TODAY : " Two of the seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki - Kariwa nuclear site were supplied by GE in consortium with Hitachi and Toshiba .
" Four of the seven reactors at Kashiwazaki - Kariwa were online at the time the earthquake hit and shut down automatically , as they are designed to do .
The other three reactors were not on - line at the time of the earthquake .
" In the Unit 3 switchyard , a transformer caught fire following the earthquake .
That transformer is in a non-nuclear section of the plant .
We understand that the transformer fire did not threaten the safety of the plant .

Facebook The U.S. nuclear agency says a fire and spill of radioactive water at a Japanese nuclear power plant triggered Monday by a deadly earthquake posed minor problems and did not amount to a significant atomic incident .
The U.S. government offered technical and other assistance , but Japan has not requested U.S. help , said Eliot Brenner , director of public affairs for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Washington .
GALLERY : Quake injures hundreds VIDEO : Japan rattled " The safety systems in Japan worked exactly as designed , " he said .
" The operating reactors shut down . "
The 6.8 - magnitude earthquake struck at Kashiwazaki along Japan 's northwest coast , 160 miles from Tokyo .
At least nine people were killed and more than 900 injured .
The temblor demolished wooden homes and buckled highways and bridges .
The earthquake started a fire in an electrical transformer at one of seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant — the world 's largest in terms of electrical output — and caused a loss of water from another , according to Tokyo Electric Power Co.
About 315 gallons of slightly radioactive water spilled from a tank at one of the plant 's seven reactors and entered a pipe that flushed it into the sea , said Jun Oshima , an executive at the power company .
There was no " significant change " in the seawater near the plant , he said .
" The radioactivity is one - billionth of the legal limit . " .
Brenner said that , like U.S. nuclear reactors , those in Japan are designed to shut down automatically when there is an earthquake .
He said the episode did not appear to raise concerns about the safety of reactors in earthquake zones .
" All nuclear power plants in this country ( United States ) are built to survive earthquakes , " he said .
Brenner said the incident was in no way comparable to the release of radiation at Chernobyl in Ukraine , the world 's worst nuclear power accident .
" The amount of water spilled that we 've seen references to is exceptionally small , " Brenner said .
A second quake hit off Japan 's coast late Monday .
There were no immediate reports of fresh damage .
Some 10,000 people fled to evacuation centers as aftershocks rattled the area .
Tens of thousands of homes were left without water or power .
The leak was not announced until the evening , many hours after the quake .
That fed fresh concerns about the safety of Japan 's 55 nuclear reactors , which supply 30 % of the quake - prone country 's electricity and have suffered a long string of accidents and cover-ups .
In Kashiwazaki city , the quake reduced older buildings to piles of lumber .
Nine people in their 70s and 80s — six women and three men — died , most of them crushed by collapsing buildings , the Kyodo news agency said early Tuesday .
Kyodo reported more than 900 people were hurt , with injuries including broken bones , cuts and bruises .
It said 780 buildings sustained damage , and more than 300 of them were destroyed .
" I got so dizzy that I could barely stand up , " said Kazuaki Kitagami , a worker at a 7 - Eleven convenience store in Kashiwazaki , the hardest - hit city .
" The jolt came violently from just below the ground . "
The area was plagued by aftershocks , but there were no immediate reports of additional damage or casualties .
Near midnight , Japan 's Meteorological Agency said a 6.6 - magnitude quake hit off the west coast , shaking wide areas of Japan , but it was unrelated to the Niigata quake to the north and there were no immediate reports of damage .
The U.S. Geological Survey put the intital quake 's magnitude at 6.6 and the second at 6.8 .
First word of trouble at the Kashiwazaki Kariwa power plant was a fire that broke out at an electrical transformer .
All the reactors were either already shut down or automatically switched off by the quake .
The blaze was reported quelled by early afternoon , and the power company announced there was no damage to the reactor and no release of radioactivity .
But in the evening , the company released a statement revealing the leak of radioactive water , saying it had taken all day to confirm details of the accident .
But the delay raised suspicions among environmentalists , who oppose the government 's plan to build more reactors .
" The leak itself does n't sound significant as of yet , but the fact that it went unreported is a concern , " said Michael Mariotte at the Nuclear Information and Resource Service , a Maryland - based networking center for environmental activists .
" When a company begins by denying a problem , it makes you wonder if there 's another shoe to drop . "
The accident comes as the government is discussing improving the earthquake resistance of such plants , said Aileen Mioko Smith of the Japan - based environmentalist group Green Action .
The fire indicated that some facilities at nuclear power plants , such as electrical transformers , were built to lower quake - resistance levels than other equipment , like reactor cores , she said .
" That 's the Achilles ' heel of nuclear power plants , " said Mioko Smith , who pointed out that it took plant workers two hours to put out the transformer fire .
Economy , Trade and Industry Minister Akira Amari told the power company early Tuesday not to resume plant operations before making a thorough safety check , Kyodo reported .
The quake , which hit at 10:13 a.m. , was centered off the coast of Niigata .
The tremor made buildings sway in the capital 160 miles away and was also felt in northern and central Japan .
Tsunami warnings were issued , but the resulting waves were too small to cause any damage .
As rescue crews dug through the rubble for survivors or more dead , focus shifted to getting food and water to evacuation centers .
Many roads were impassable , though bullet train service to nearby Niigata resumed late Monday .
More than 60,000 homes in the quake zone were without water , 34,000 lost natural gas and 25,000 had no electricity as of late Monday afternoon , local official Takashi Takagi said .
Prime Minister Shinzo
Abe , whose ruling party is trailing in the polls heading into July 29 parliamentary elections , interrupted a campaign stop in southern Japan to go to the damaged area .
" Many people told me they want to return to their normal lives as quickly as possible , " Abe told reporters in Kashiwazaki .
" The government will make every effort to help with recovery . "
Japan sits atop four tectonic plates and is one of the world 's most earthquake - prone countries .
In October 2004 , a magnitude - 6.8 earthquake hit Niigata , killing 40 people and damaging more than 6,000 homes .
It was the deadliest to hit Japan since 1995 , when a magnitude - 7.2 quake killed 6,433 people in the western city of Kobe .
The last major quake to hit Tokyo killed some 142,000 people in 1923 , and experts say the capital has a 90 % chance of suffering a major quake in the next 50 years .

The US housing market has continued to suffer a slump in the wake of the sub - prime lending crisis .
Here BBC
News website readers from across the US describe how they have been affected by the ongoing problems in the country 's once - booming property market .
RETA SANDEN , TURLOCK , CALIFORNIA
I am a realtor in the Central Valley of California , one of the hardest hit areas in the recent housing crunch .
I am a realtor in the Central Valley of California , one of the hardest hit areas in the recent housing crunch .
I too own a home , and my husband and I are struggling not just because I am not making any commissions lately , but because everything is going up - food , gas , taxes , you name it .
We refinanced our home in November 2005 to do some much needed improvements .
Now our adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) is due to adjust in November .
We are not sure what it will adjust to which is very worrying as my income has been greatly affected recently .
I have wished all affected families I have met good luck .
I know how they feel .
I am one of them too
This makes it very hard to get back on track anytime soon .
Banks used to be happy to talk to us and lend us money .
Now we really need help and they do n't want to know us .

Banks used to be happy to talk to us and lend us money .
Now we really need help and they do n't want to know us .
All of this has made our situation impossible .
We want to keep our home , and make the payments but if banks are going to turn their backs on us , then they deserve the losses they incur .
I have met families who have lost their credit , their home , their dignity and even their jobs .
After that , what 's left ?
Unless people are relieved of their prior credit damages , and are given a reasonable chance to pay back their debts , then they are in serious trouble .
I have wished all affected families I have met good luck .
I know how they feel .
I am one of them too .
CINDY , KANSAS CITY , MISSOURI
We have an adjustable rate mortgage from one of the sub - prime lenders .
We had a terrible financial year last year and fell behind in paying off our credit cards .
As a result our credit is even worse this year and now as our mortgage goes up , we can't refinance due to horrible credit .
We could still make the payments if they [ lenders ] would just give us a chance - before we lose our home
This is all despite the fact that I am finally making more money and am now able to pay higher mortgage payments .
This is all despite the fact that I am finally making more money and am now able to pay higher mortgage payments .
It is a terrible place to be .
If we could get a loan to consolidate all our payments into a new mortgage , we would be so much better off , but that is n't possible now and this whole situation has become a catch - 22 .
Our ARM has gone up twice this year and I am afraid if it keeps up at this rate , I might not be able to stay on top of things .
It would be great if these lenders could appreciate that although a lot of us do n't have good credit , we could still make the payments if they would just give us a chance - before we lose our home .
ANGELA KINARI , EUGENE , OREGON I own a small mortgage brokerage company .
I own a small mortgage brokerage company .
This was one of the worst summers I have seen in my five years in the business .
I have found that although many people want to refinance , many of them are unable to do so because of new guidelines that lenders have imposed .
Personally , it is as though I am starting all over again , spending all of my time trying to figure out each lender 's new rules .
In our office , we processed only a few sub - prime loans .
If truth be told , they are difficult to process and in my experience , the clients tended to be difficult to work with - either in proving their income or having high debt .
We never advertised for these types of loans or clients as a result .
Overall , the money coming in the door is definitely considerably lower than in years past .
I am worried as I am the breadwinner in the family .
JENNA , HOUSTON , TEXAS I am a loan officer working in sub -prime lending .
At the present time , I am looking for a job in other industries as we are facing a 20 % reduction in our company .
I have learned that lending to people with spotty credit and the promotion of ARMs was not the best of ideas .
I am thankful that I was always quick to dissuade borrowers from ARMs , as I had my reservations about them even two years ago .
Encouraging 100 % financing with ARMs is a recipe for disaster , as proven by the hike in foreclosures on homes this year .
My advice to anyone buying a home is - make sure your credit is excellent , put at least 10 % - 20 % down as a deposit , and never ever get an adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) , unless you plan on selling before it adjusts .
MARC CARDULLO , SACO , MAINE
As a mortgage loan officer , the bad news pours in from across the industry on a daily basis .
As a mortgage loan officer , the bad news pours in from across the industry on a daily basis .
Many homeowners are abandoning their homes or are being foreclosed on .
I blame the government for not regulating our business more , like they do with banks .
They should have seen this coming .
I blame homeowners for basically using the equity on their homes as an ATM machine .
I blame the banks and lenders for approving people for homes who had no business buying one in the first place .
I also blame the banks and lenders for coming up with teaser rates and interest - only products that are confusing to your average American consumer .
From my own experience , I have an ARM but knew what I was purchasing and have a plan to switch to a more stable product .
When I re-financed I left my equity alone and went with a reputable bank .
It is back to basics now in the lending business , which means only people with good credit , good ratios , and money down can buy their home and prospective buyers will be scrutinised more closely .
Overall , things are not good here and my guess is it is going to get worse before it gets better .
RICHARD SITTEMA , WARREN , OHIO I live in an area of north - eastern
Ohio that has been in economic decline for quite a few years .
The recent housing crisis has only made things worse .
I live in an area of north - eastern Ohio that has been in economic decline for quite a few years .
The recent housing crisis has only made things worse .
Many people who purchased homes in this area within the last five or six years did so with sub - prime , variable interest - rate loans .
Unfortunately , many of those same people have since lost their homes or have had to sell because they could n't afford the payments once the interest rates went up .
This has impacted on my wife and I as the value of our house has been reduced , and if we wanted to sell it in the near future we would n't make much .
There are simply too many properties on the market now so buyers can essentially dictate their terms .
As a result , our once beautiful town is now dotted with " For Sale " signs and many of our neighbours have had to leave .

What are these ?
CIA Chief Michael Hayden has issued a passionate defense of extraordinary rendition , claiming that the practice , which so often involves abduction and torture , is justified by the “ irreplaceable ” intelligence it produces .
Meanwhile , President Bush ’s preferred successor to loyal henchman Alberto Gonzales refuses to call torture by its name , though he claims to find it “ repugnant . ”
BBC :
[ Attorney General ] nominee Michael Mukasey condemned one technique , water - boarding , as “ repugnant ” and possibly “ over the line , ” but declined to explicitly rule it out as torture , saying he could not speculate on classified procedures .
Water - boarding simulates drowning by immobilizing a prisoner with his head lower than his feet and pouring water over his face .
Leading Democrats in the Senate have threatened to block Mr Mukasey ’s confirmation if he does not explicitly rule out water - boarding as illegal .

Online game competition provider WorldWinner , a Fun Technologies subsidiary , has unveiled the results of a survey it conducted that indicates men and women are equally matched when it comes to their competitiveness in casual competition .
According to WorldWinner , the 2007 WorldWinner Gender and Competition Survey , which examined the attitudes of men and women toward informal contests , revealed that an equal percentage of men and women - 73 percent - describe themselves as " competitive " or " very competitive " .
According to the study , both men and women responded that they 're predominantly driven by a desire to win -- it was the number one response from both genders .
However , this number was slightly higher among men ( 61 percent of all respondents ) versus women ( 50 percent ) .
Women appear to seek out competition more frequently than men ;
The majority of women , or 39 percent , responded that they seek competition daily , while only 31 percent of men do .
The majority of men , or 45 percent , are happy going head - to - head just a few times per week .
Other findings showed that the majority of both gender groups equally compete for validation or to " prove themselves " ; predominantly decided that competition is more " exciting " and " thrilling " than " intimidating " ; tend not to quit when ahead , and feel just as competitive playing against the same gender as they do versus a member of the opposite sex .
So which gender is more competitive ?
According to WorldWinner 's results , it 's a tie .
Survey respondents largely agree that men and women are equally assertive in casual competition .
Forty - nine percent of men and 53 percent of women believe both genders are equally competitive , while 45 percent of men and 35 percent of women view males as more competitive .
Only six percent of men and 12 percent of women perceive females to be the more competitive gender .
Finally , the survey found that when money is no object , both genders agree that they would rather play a game and lose than not play the game at all ( 77 percent of men , 86 percent of women ) .
Fun Technologies CEO Lorne Abony commented , " Men are often stereotypically viewed as more competitive , but our survey revealed what we experience on WorldWinner every day : that both sexes enjoy friendly , casual competition against anyone who 's willing to take them on . "
I already wrote a review of this wonderful book , written by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken , at Amazon.com , so I ’ll just repeat it here :
I highly recommend this book if you are interested in learning about computer science .
The book is organized around the idea of building a computer from the fundamental logic gates up–starting with the hardware ( combinational logic gates , arithmetic logic units , sequential logic gates , the CPU and memory ) and then through the software hierarchy ( starting with the machine language , and working up through the assembler , a virtual machine , a compiler for a high - level language , and an operating system ) .
As a “ by - product , ” one learns , by very relevant examples , many fundamental concepts of computer science .
You can just read the book , but the best idea is to follow the authors ’ advice and do the projects where you implement every necessary piece of the computer system yourself .
The projects are all very well organized .
All the software modules necessary to emulate any part of the computer , plus half the chapters from the book , are available for free download from the authors ’ web - site .
It all works beautifully .
If you want to skip any of the projects , you can , because the software is organized in such a way that it will use built - in modules instead of the ones you built if necessary .
The authors seem to have extensively tested the whole approach through the courses they have taught using this material .
I also noticed that Harvard ’s Computer Science 101 course is being taught based on this book .
I have been using the book for self - study with absolutely no problems–in fact I have never had such a great experience with a self - study course .
All you need is a Windows , Linux , or Mac OS X computer and access to the internet , and you can give yourself a wonderful education in computer science .
In terms of prerequisites , you only really need to have some experience with programming ( e.g. with C , or ideally with Java or Python ) .
I think that the book should work well for students or hobbyists who do n’t have any more experience than that , but it is also great for much more experienced students , as a kind of integrative summary of the field .
I also think the book is perfect for graduate students or researchers from other fields who want to learn how digital hardware and software systems are actually engineered .
Finally , I just want to compliment the authors on the extraordinary care that they have taken with the whole project .
The computer design that you build up is wonderfully elegant–at every stage the design is just as simple as it can be while being sufficient .
Every piece of emulation software works as advertised .
Even the extra powerpoint or .pdf tutorials are nicely done .
This is really quality work , and using it is just a real pleasure .
Finally , the source code for all the software provided by the authors is available , so if you wanted to extend the provided emulators , you could do that .
In summary , I give this book my unqualified highest recommendation .

IBM today announced a breakthrough development in semiconductor performance today .
Working with the Georgia Institute of Technology 's Cryogenic Lab , IBM said it was able to achieve a blazing 500GHz performance , with one caveat ; the chip had to be cooled to near - absolute zero degrees temperatures .
" We realize 4.2 degrees Kelvin is not a practical point of operation for a transistor , " David Ahlgren , an IBM researcher at the company 's Fishkill , N.Y. manufacturing facility , told internetnews.com .
4.2 degrees Kelvin translates to  452.11 Fahrenheit , just a few degrees shy of absolute zero .
But Ahlgren said the point of the research is to test the limits of how fast they could go .
He said IBM actually has run simulations that suggest future versions of the Silicon - Germanium ( SiGe ) chip could run twice the 500GHz speed , already considered a world record for a Silicon - based processor .
There are faster transistors based on non-Silicon materials such as Gallium Arsenide .
Nearer term , Ahlgren said the current test processor can run at a speedy 350GHz at room temperature .
In the digital communications market , where SiGe chips are common , cell phone chips typically operate at a " mere " 2GHz .
Sageza Group analyst Clay Ryder is impressed with the implications of the technology .
" The fact that IBM and Georgia Tech have created such a screamer in the labs with today 's technology shows a lot of promise , " Ryder told internetnews.com .
" This could be a very important development when you look at the increasing focus on energy savings . "
Practical applications for the superfast chip include " automotive radar , " 60 GHz wireless LANs and broadband applications .
Automotive radar encompasses such features as adaptive cruise control , where the car senses , for example , how far the car in front of the driver is and adjusts the speed accordingly .
Another is crash avoidance , where the car would be able to sense an impending crash and either swerve away , slow down or brake .
" You ca n't do this kind of technology cheaply enough with conventional semiconductors , " said Ahlgren .
" The is the first time we think we can make it inexpensive enough for the car makers to implement , down to a few dollars a chip . "
Ahlgren said we 're a good five years away from high production that would get costs down that low , however .
He also said 60 GHz wireless has the most near - term potential , helping companies implement , for example , wireless connections within a building .
" These are fairly short - term signals that only go a few hundred feet so it 's not like a cell tower .
But that can also be an advantage in a building where you do n't want the signal going too far for security purposes . "
When Rogers Communications began promoting its Rogers@Home high - speed Internet service nearly a decade ago , the company branded it " the Internet on Cable . "
Years later , their service , as well as those of their competitors , is gradually morphing into " the Internet as Cable " as broadcasters , Internet service providers , and cultural groups steadily move toward the delivery of content online that bears a striking resemblance to the conventional cable model .

Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
While cable television has its virtues -- some consumer choice , the ability to time shift programs by recording them with a VCR or PVR , and video on - demand offerings -- it is largely premised on limited consumer control .
Cable distributors determine channel choices , geographic distribution , and commercial substitution ( with input from the broadcast regulator ) , offer only limited interactivity , and quietly even possess the ability to stop consumers from recording some programs .
Until recently , the Internet was precisely the opposite , offering unlimited user choice , continuous interactivity and technological capabilities to copy and remix content .
That is gradually changing as broadcasters seek to re-assert greater geographic control over their content , ISPs experiment with cable - like models for prioritized content delivery , and some creator groups lobby the Canadian Radio - Television and Telecommunications Commission to adapt Canadian content regulations to the Internet .
Broadcasters find the Net
The re-emergence of geographic borders on the Internet coincides with broadcasters finally jumping on the Internet bandwagon , as they race to make their content freely available online .
Some U.S. broadcasters are selling downloads through services such as Apple iTunes or Amazon.com , yet the unmistakable trend is toward free , ad - supported streaming of content mere hours after it first appears on commercial television .
Each major U.S. broadcaster already offers a handful of shows in this manner with ambitious plans to expand their services in the months ahead .
NBC and Fox recently unveiled Hulu.com to some critical acclaim , while Comedy Central created a new site for the popular Daily Show that features a complete archive of eight years of programming .
Canadians , alas , are generally locked out of these sites due to licensing restrictions .
Canadian broadcasters have been scrambling to buy the Internet rights to U.S. programming , both to protect their local broadcasts and to beef up their online presence .
U.S. broadcasters may eventually decide it is more profitable to stream their content on a worldwide basis and to remove longstanding geographic restrictions ; however , for the moment they are parceling up the Internet as they would a broadcast destined for multiple cable markets .
No ' Daily Show ' site for you !
This geographic bordering extends beyond just blocking streamed content .
The new Daily Show site is off - limits for Canadians since the U.S. - based Comedy Central recently took the unprecedented step of redirecting Canadian visitors to the CTV - owned Comedy Network site .
Broadcasters are not alone in working to bring the cable model of control to the Internet .
Large ISPs are engaged in similar activities , with a history of blocking access to contentious content ( Telus ) , limiting bandwidth for alternative content delivery channels ( Rogers ) , and raising the prospect of levying fees for priority content delivery ( Bell ) .
There have been similar developments in other countries .
For example , when earlier this year the BBC launched its Internet - based iPlayer , which allows United Kingdom residents to access BBC content online , several broadband providers floated the prospect of charging the BBC for delivering its content on their networks .
Going for control
Several Canadian cultural groups apparently see a parallel opportunity to institute greater control and regulation on the Internet .
Last week , ADISQ , which represents the Quebec recording industry , joined forces with 17 other groups to argue that if ISPs can prioritize content for commercial gain , they can be required to do something similar to advance Canadian culture .
Those claims conveniently ignore the multitude of Canadian online success stories , including Têtes à claques , Glacticast , thousands of bloggers , hundreds of podcasters , and video streams from everyone from political parties to the Toronto Maple Leafs .
Creators ought to be pushing for guaranteed equal treatment online , yet together with the CRTC , some are now actively discussing adapting Canadian content requirements to the Internet , a move that only a few years ago seemed politically improbable and technically impossible .
These issues may ultimately sort themselves out .
Users have many easily - obtainable tools to defeat geographic blocking , ISPs may find themselves subject to net neutrality legislation if they continue to abuse the public 's trust by failing to maintain their networks in a transparent , neutral fashion , and cultural groups may come to the realization that regulatory approaches that mandate content requirements are doomed to failure in a world of unlimited content choice .
Yet as the Canadian broadcasting community gathers in Ottawa this week for an annual meeting called Broadcasting Redefined , it appears that the redefinition of the Internet as Cable has begun .

Tyee stories :
Growing up in a typical small Jewish family , I assumed everyone knew the I ’m - smart - but - not - cheap tactics I was raised with .
But as I ’ve gotten older ( yeah , it had to happen sometime ) , I realized some people do n’t know the one steadfast golden rule of financial success , stability and contentment : EVERYTHING is negotiable .
But , you have to ask !!
There are some obvious things I wo n’t list in this article like that you can bargain for a car .
I ’m pretty sure everyone knows that .
If not , for now , remember to act like you do n’t need one and then e-mail me for further help .
Here are some hints for a fatter wallet and maybe even enough money at the end of the day to buy a new purse to hold it in .
These are in no particular order of importance :
Rent
If the place has been on the market for a bit , you can offer less rent for a longer lease .
Also , you can often bargain less rent if you have a trade to offer like great gardening skills or something else that would improve the property and be less work for the owner .
It ’s a win-win .
Note : you wo n’t have much luck with this if you are going through a property management company as you ’d be cutting out on their profits .
Farmer ’s Market
The price listed is not the price you have to pay .
Always try to round the pounds to a near dollar .
So , if peaches are $ 1.50 per pound and you weigh in at 2.89 pounds , say “ I ’ll give you $ 4 . ”
They ’ll be happy to get the $ 4 and you ’ll get the extra peach .
Note : if you go toward the end of the day , you can usually buy larger quantities for less .
Most likely , the vendor does n’t want to shlep everything home .
Just ask !
Get a discount for a scratch , stain or other imperfection on a purchase
Almost all retail stores will give 10 - 15 % off of glassware , clothing and other items if it is damaged , especially if it ’s the only in the store of the kind ( your size or that color ) .
Of course they do n’t advertise this so you have to ask at the register .
Just know that once you get your discount , it becomes non-returnable merchandise .
Hotel comps for an unpleasant stay
Hotels aim to please .
And if you were lying awake all night because your were placed next to a room full of rowdy children under 5 , then the receptionist did n’t do a good job .
First thing is , you have to call them when it happens .
Then , the next morning , call again and ask to speak to the manager .
Tell them you realize this was n’t at all their fault but it really put a damper on your stay and you ’d like to see “ what they can do for you . ”
Often they ’ll offer a percentage off the room or a free breakfast .
At the least , you can get a late check - out because you need to make up some sleep before you hit the road .

In love with a $ 25 puppy someone has advertised in the newspaper ?
Do n’t pick him up with your carrying crate so fast !
Tell the owner you ’d love to have him and give him a great home but you need to pick him up after he ’s gotten his initial shots .
It ’ll save you a trip to the vet and all the costs associated with it .
Trust me , you ’ll have plenty of other chances in your new buddy ’s life to accompany him on these costly outings .
Get new purchases delivered FREE !
This is one of the bargaining points furniture salespeople have available to make a sale .
Use it .
If you feel like you need an excuse , tell them because you have to wait a day , they do n’t have your color in stock ( or whatever applies ) , you ’d love if they could waive the delivery fee .
They usually wo n’t want you going down the street where they might have it in stock and you can get it today .
Furniture can be an impulse buy and if you walk out the door , they could lose you .
Frame your own pictures
This is a big one .
Never get a picture professionally framed unless you have a ton of money to blow , or you want something very specific .
It can be hundreds and hundreds of dollars .
Order a print from www.posters.com or wherever , and then go to Kmart , Target or Michael ’s ( craft store ) , buy something with another picture or poster in it , remove it and slip yours in .
It ’ll already have nice matting and frame and you wo n’t be too broke to buy nails to hang it .
Free dessert for celebrations
A lot of restaurants will do a birthday dessert for free if you let them know it ’s someone ’s birthday at the table .
Some charge though so make sure they are n’t saying “ yes ” they do it , but forgetting to say “ and it ’ll also cost you $ 4.95 . ”
Room upgrades at hotels ( or higher floors )
If a hotel is n’t booked , they will often give you a complimentary upgrade for a birthday , anniversary , etc .
Just kindly tell them that you are there for a special occasion .
Always show them that you are n’t being demanding by saying something like “ I ’m sure the standard room we have is great , but if you are n’t too full and there is any way you can put us on a higher floor or something with a nicer view , I ’d really appreciate it . ”
They will if they can .
Often asking to speak with a manager will give you a better chance .
And no , it ’s not rude or pushy ever to ask for a manager .
CBS Radio suspended two hosts from an FM station in New York City today after an Asian - American advocacy organization complained about the broadcast of a six - minute prank phone call to a Chinese restaurant that was peppered with ethnic and sexual slurs .
The call was first played on “ The Dog House With JV and Elvis , ” a midmorning show on WFNY , on April 5 , the day after Don Imus made his comment about the Rutgers women ’s basketball team on WFAN , another CBS - owned station .
The call was then replayed on “ The Dog House ” on Thursday , a week after Mr. Imus was fired by CBS Radio .
In the skit , a series of apparently unsuspecting employees of a Chinese restaurant are berated by a caller who tells one woman he would like to “ come to your restaurant ” to see her naked , especially a part of her body he refers to as “ hot , Asian , spicy . ”
The caller also attempts to order “ flied lice , ” brags of his prowess in kung fu and repeatedly curses at several employees .
In a statement on Sunday , the four New York - area chapters of the Organization of Chinese Americans , an advocacy group , demanded an apology from the show ’s two hosts and from CBS Radio , and called for the firing of the hosts and their producer .

Ron Paul : The Only Presidential Candidate to Challenge the American Empire
David T. Beito is a member of the Liberty and Power group blog at the History News Network and Scott Horton is the host of Antiwar Radio in Austin , Texas and runs The Stress blog .
Flying under the radar of mainstream media coverage , supporters of Dr. Ron Paul , a seventy - two year old ten - term congressman and obstetrician from Texas , have staged a political revolution .
Despite little publicity , they have raised over $ 15 million , mostly in small donations , giving Paul more money in the bank than John McCain .
In a November 5 “ money bomb ” ( inspired by Guy Fawkes Day as depicted in the film , “ V for Vendetta ” ) the Paul Revolutionaries raked in $ 4.3 million .
In doing so , they set a new one - day record for all Republican candidates .
In addition , Paul ’s backers have spontaneously organized over 1,100 meet - up groups .
That ’s more than any other candidate in the race including the youthful and photogenic Barak Obama .
By all indications , most of the meet - up group members , now numbering over 60,000 , are under age twenty - five .
Paul ’s appeal can be attributed to his no-holds - barred small government , pro-liberty message as well as his consistent call to bring home the troops .
Reporters are right to emphasize the wide gap between Paul and the pro-war Republican presidential field but they should not stop there .
If they dig a little deeper , they will find that his disagreements with Democrats are equally great .
Paul is the only candidate in either party who wants to shut down the entire American overseas political and military Empire .
Rather than “ isolationist ” in foreign policy , however , Paul embraces as his own Thomas Jefferson ’s stated goal of “ peace , commerce , and honest friendship with all nations , entangling alliances with none . ”
But , unlike our third president , Paul appears bound and determined to apply these words across - the - board .
His voting record shows a consistent support for free trade and legislation to redirect the military strictly to home defense rather than foreign occupation .
The Democrats , by contrast , largely share the bi-partisan post - World War II consensus of spreading democracy , human rights , or “ vital interests ” by military force .
Few subscribe to this consensus more zealously than Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton who has considerable credentials as a hawk dating back to her husband ’s administration .
Most notably , she was an aggressive cheerleader for the bombing campaigns against both Iraq and Serbia in Kosovo .
Paul , like many Republicans at the time , opposed both .
Although Hillary later broke with Bush on Iraq , she rejects a non-interventionist approach .
She wants to leave U.S. troops behind in Iraq to fight al Qaeda as well as keep them in the region .
When asked in a recent debate whether she would promise that the troops would be home from Iraq by the end of her first term , Clinton refused .
Although Barak Obama opposed the war from the outset , his current views are not much different .
He also intends to station U.S. forces permanently in the region and reserves the right to put them back in Iraq again in full force to stop “ genocide ” ( a term he never defines ) .
John Edwards advocates the same approach .
While it is true that the Democrats are dovish on Iraq when compared to Bush , they blow bugles on the Darfur region of Sudan .
The frontrunners demand tougher sanctions , imposition of a no- fly zone , and U.S. aid for more UN troops .
Edwards pledges to work with NATO and deploy U.S. “ military assets ” to enforce the zone .
Clinton has even suggested a blockade of the Port of Sudan , an act of war under international law .
The truculence of the Democrats on Darfur defies logic given their objections to the Iraq War .
The same conditions apply in Darfur that also led to the Iraq quagmire including a history of Islamic sectarian strife , a long civil war , and no real tradition of the rule of law and democracy .
Despite widespread violence and Sunni fundamentalism in Sudan , there has never been a suicide bombing there .
Were the Democrats to spread the War on Terror into Darfur , that statistic would certainly change .
Rather than avoid all foreign political entanglements , as would Paul , the Democratic frontrunners promise to extend them .
All three , to quote Edwards , hope to exercise “ American leadership to forge powerful alliances - with longtime allies and reluctant friends , with nations already living in the light of democracy and with peoples struggling to join them . ”
In contrast to Paul , they do not intend to scale down foreign American bases , much less reconsider the merits of George McGovern ’s old dream to “ Come Home America . ”
As Obama puts it , the United States “ cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now .... we need to maintain a strong foreign policy , relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world . "
Woodrow Wilson could not have said it better .
If Americans expect a “ great debate ” about foreign policy fundamentals in 2008 , absent an upset by Paul and his campaign against the American empire and for free trade , they will not get it .
That would be a pity .
As examples of “ blowback ” from previous and ongoing interventions continue to mount , such as spiraling oil prices , the free - fall in the value of the dollar , and the current strife in Pakistan and Kurdistan , Americans need such a debate more than ever before .

First , some think that the castration of the Imperial stallion will stop it from f*cking other countries .
But a penis without a body can accomplish very little .
You need a strong body in order to force yourself on others .
If you focus on the penis and you solely blame it for the raping and pillage , you 're missing the big picture .
The US plays the role of a punching ball .
However , this diversion tactic is working very well .
This article is a good example of its success .
Second , power is n't an unlimited resource or asset .
( Sorry Anthony Robbins . )
Countries are powerful at the expense of other countries .
On the other hand , mother nature detests power vacuums .
Today it could be the US .
Tomorrow ... maybe Iran or colorful Chavez !

Just because a country enjoys the fruits of economic wealth does n't mean that it is obligated to expend that wealth on vast world policing military and political establishments .
The Japan that largely minds it own business and maintains a small defense - oriented military , for example , is much more successful and well - regardeed than the Japan that tried to become a regional hegemon via political means .
Building large political and military establishments also contradict the more worthy goal of aspiring to be a decentralist , liberty and wealth maximizing republic .

" Paul is the only candidate in either party who wants to shut down the entire American overseas political and military Empire . "
What on earth does this mean ?
If being imperialistic is apparently bad , what kind of political and military power would be acceptable ?
If you have actually amassed power , the worst thing that could happen is to pretend you do n't have it .

The truculence of the Democrats on Darfur defies logic in view of their stance on the Iraq War ?
Not at all .
It is perfectly logical .
They need to hold their 92 % of the black vote , despite many other policies like gay marriage , militant athiesm , anti-choice in schools , and unlimited immigration which are anathema to black voters .
Daniel Aldridge - 11/20/2007
I personally support Ron Paul not b/c I think that he should ( or will ) be President but because I think he expresses many ideas that desperately need to be included in the public debate .
We are going down the same path as the British and Roman Empires and are holding on to a World War II and Cold War sense of global mission that we cannot afford and that will bankrupt us at home .
He is also the only candidate who strongly opposes the " War on Drugs " that has incarcerated millions of poor and working class men of all races , but especially African Americans and Hispanics , and enrolled them in prisons that excel at being universities of crime .
Progressive - minded people should look at libertarianism with fresh eyes .
Progressives , in my opinion , have tied themselves too tightly to the notion that government paternalism and a giant centrally administered welfare state is self - evidently the solution for the problems of the poor and working classes .
Libertarians are also progressive on personal liberty issues such as gay marriage , the right to put intoxicants into your own body , and the right for free sexual and cultural expression .

The thing to remember is that the government and the people are not the same thing .
It seems the trend that the more " non-isolationist " the government becomes , the less engaged with the world the average American becomes , basically because they do n't have to be .
Government interventionist foreign policy creates an economic and political bubble world for the citizenry to live in .
I believe that government non-interventionism would in contrast increase human level interactions , rather than mere State to State ones , between the US and the world .

Thanks for an excellent article .
The big point that some do not consider is that we simply can not afford to maintain the empire we have created .
Ron Paul speaks the truth and people respond in a way that many in the media just do n't understand .
They tell us that Ron Paul is a " long shot " candidate .
In fact Ron Paul dominates in Straw Polls , Debate Polls , Fund Raising , Web Traffic and Grass Roots Networking .
Ron Paul is a “ top tier ” candidate and I have created a website to present this evidence .
Please visit www.thecaseforronpaul.com and judge for yourself .

In order to get Ron Paul the Republican nomination , he needs delegates at the conventions .
To become a delegate , contact your local GOP headquarters and find out when and where your neigborhood GOP caucus will be held , attend the caucus and vote for Dr. Ron ; and if you have the time and means to go to the local , state , and national conventions , become one of his delegates .
David T. Beito - 11/19/2007 Oops .
Thanks for calling that to my attention .
James Hammel - 11/19/2007
Very informative and interesting analysis of the 2008 crop of candidates .
There is something very scary in " sameness " .
The exception is Ron Paul who has created a wake - up call for America , and it could not be too soon .
The big question is " will our herd of sheep listen ? " .
Or will we continue to bury our heads and ignore what is happening to this great country ?
If you truly believe we are not the world 's bullies and babysitters , then Paul 's smaller government agenda has merit .
So , do many other pieces ( including re-looking the monetary system and the Fed as well as the tax system -- both which came into being in 1913 through illegal means ) .
In the end , however , the elite that run this country and seek one - world government , may have something to say about it .
Their goals are probably not well served under Paul 's agenda .
We need to start aksing how citizens can help get get their country back ?
Stephen Michael Ickes - 11/19/2007
Thank you for the very well written article about Dr. Paul .
Many articles about him incorrectly call him an isolationist .
You may want to make a minor correction though , it 's Guy Fawkes Day not Hawkes .
It would n't do to have the History News Network incorrectly naming a very famous historical figure .
John Acord - 11/19/2007 Ron
Paul has to be the most interesting of all the candidates .
I believe an overwhelming number of Americans do not want to continue running an empire , especially when the burden falls 100 % on us .
Unless we follow the Roman example and loot the people we pretend to defend , ( and who wnats to do that ? ) , we are going to be beankrupt very quickly .
Independents are listening to Paul .

Thanks for the insight and good article , I agree the debate needs to take place !
The press seems to have conspired to silence this man but the People are ultimately responsible to educate themselves .
" The strength of the Constitution lies entirely in the determination of each citizen to defend it .
Only if every single citizen feels duty bound to do his share in this defense are the constitutional rights secure . "
Albert Einstein
If you : are a patriot be it left , middle or right , want the war in Iraq to end , want America to stop medaling in other nations affairs , want secure borders and controlled immigration , are tired of the use of fear to promote failed policies that strip our liberties as in the war on poverty , drugs , terrorism or the next Saddam .
If you believe military force is justified only in self - defense and aggression is the realm of dictators .
If you believe , government should balance their budget as you have to .
If you believe in the requirement that law enforcement obtain a warrant before searching as one of the essential protections against abuse of government power .
If you believe the monetary policies of your government and the privately owned Federal Reserve contributed to the housing and .com bubbles .
Finally , if you believe The Constitution of the United States is the REAL contract with America , then register as a Republican and vote for Ron Paul in the Republican Primary .
What we can do at this point is rally for Ron Paul .
Vote in the primaries , talk to your friends and family , call people in Iowa , New Hampshire , Nevada etc. Donate to ronpaul2008.com on December 16 - Boston tea party .
I am privileged and honored to do all I can to support Ron Paul because he will represent the people of this country .
He will respect , protect and restore your rights , liberties and the Constitution !
I have learned so much researching the many issues that Ron Paul led me to .
I ran into Ron Paul 's name studying the federal reserve .
Then listened and read his many house speeches , checked his voting record .
I was so stoked to find an honest politician , a man with integrity and a brilliant understanding of the history of our country , a humble man that makes his point .
A brave man willing to point out the chicanery and what the other candidates do n't want the American people to know .
Bush is ‘ soft on lead ’
You ’ve no doubt heard quite a bit about toys manufactured in China reaching U.S. stores , despite the use of lead - based paints .
McClatchy ’s Kevin Hall reports today on the Bush administration ’s role in the story .
The Bush administration and China have both undermined efforts to tighten rules designed to ensure that lead paint is n’t used in toys , bibs , jewelry and other children ’s products .
Both have fought efforts to better police imported toys from China .
Now both are under increased scrutiny following last week ’s massive toy recall by Mattel Inc. , the world ’s largest toymaker .
The recalls of Chinese - made toys follow several other lead - paint - related scares since June that have affected products featuring Sesame Street characters , Thomas the Train and Dora the Explorer .
Under federal regulations , lead paint is permitted in the coating of toys sold in the U.S. , so long as it amounts to less than six parts per million ..
The Bush administration has managed to screw this up in a variety of ways : 1 ) resisting better inspections of imported children ’s products ; 2 ) changing the focus on the Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC ) away from protecting consumers and towards business - friendly policies ; and 3 ) canceling a Clinton - era drive for an outright ban on lead in all children ’s products .
“ The overall philosophy is regulations are bad and they are too large a cost for industry , and the market will take care of it , ” said Rick Melberth , director of regulatory policy at OMBWatch , a government watchdog group formed in 1983 .
“ That ’s been the philosophy of the Bush administration . ”
Except , whadaya know , the market has n’t been taking care of it .
As long - time readers know , I have an odd sort of fascination with the Consumer Product Safety Commission , which is responsible for reviewing thousands of consumer products to see which , if any , pose a health risk and might need to be recalled .
I thought I ’d note that Bush ’s agenda for the CPSC has always been fairly ridiculous .
I ’d even go so far as to say the president is “ soft on lead . ”
Earlier this year , for example , the Bush administration decided to look the other way on lead in children ’s lunchboxes .
Here ’s the deal : the CPSC had two ways of testing these vinyl lunchboxes used by children .
One involves dissolving part of the vinyl to see how much lead is in the solution ; the other involves swiping the surface of a bag and then determining how much lead has rubbed off .
Using the first method , the CPSC found that 20 % of the lunchboxes exceeded safe levels of lead .
In one instance , a lunchbox had 16 times the federal standard .
Naturally , the CPSC ignored these test results , using the swipe / rub - off tests exclusively .
What ’s more , as the AP explained , researchers changed their testing protocol : “ After a handful of tests , they increased the number of times they swiped each bag , again and again on the same spot , resulting in lower average results . ”
The test results also show that many lunchboxes were tested only on the outside , which is n’t where the food goes .
Alexa Engelman , a researcher at the Center for Environmental Health , said , “ They knew this all along and they did n’t take action on it .
It ’s upsetting to me .
Why are we , as a country , protecting the companies ?
We should be protecting the kids . ”
Well , we should be , but the administration has a philosophical problem with government regulations .
If that means more kids are exposed to more lead , well , it ’s the market ’s problem .
Indeed , just look at how Bush has handled the CPSC .
When Clinton was president , he appointed Ann Brown to chair the CPSC .
It made sense — Brown had spent 20 years as a consumer advocate and served as vice president of the Consumer Federation of America , so she was a logical choice , who ended up doing a fine job on behalf of American consumers .
This is how a functional administration works — find capable , competent people to fill government posts , and the public will be well served .
Then Bush was elected .
He tapped Hal Stratton for the post .
A former state representative and attorney general in New Mexico , Hal Stratton never asked for [ the CPSC ] job , protecting American citizens from such dangers as lead - laced toy jewelry and flammable Halloween costumes .
Instead , the former geology major who went on to co-chair the local Lawyers for Bush during the 2000 campaign initially wanted a job in the Interior Department .
“ That did n’t work out , ” he told the Albuquerque Journal , “ but I told them , ‘ Do n’t count me out ’ … and they came up with this . ” [ … ]
[ Now Stratton has ] a track record : rare public hearings and a paucity of new safety regulations , as well as regular ( often industry - sponsored ) travels to such destinations as China , Costa Rica , Belgium , Spain , and Mexico .
But at least Stratton wo n’t let personal bias influence him :
Despite saying that he would n’t let his own daughters play with water yo - yos — rubber toys that are outlawed in several countries because of concerns that children could be strangled by them — he refused to ban them in the United States .
Now , I should note that Stratton left his post in June 2006 , giving Bush second chance to find a qualified person to head the Consumer Product Safety Commission .
Instead the president picked another hack : National Association of Manufacturers lobbyist Michael Baroody .
This is an administration that puts the needs of the public behind the needs of businesses , and appoints unqualified people to key government posts to implement an agenda that favors profits over people .
We ’re now dealing with the results .

A Fort Collins couple and their lawyer plan to visit the Larimer County sheriff 's office Wednesday in hopes of recovering 39 marijuana plants seized by narcotics officers during a raid at their home in August 2006 .
A Larimer County District Court Judge ruled Monday that authorities must return the plants and growing equipment taken from James and Lisa Masters .
Their lawyer described them as medical marijuana providers for themselves and about 8 to 10 other people .
Brian Vincente , lawyer for the couple , hopes authorities have taken care of the plants as provided by the state 's medical marijuana law , which was approved by voters in 2000 .
" If they 've allowed these plants to die , they 've broken the law , " said Vincente , executive director of Sensible Colorado , a non-profit advocacy group of medical marijuana patients .
He described the ruling as the largest return of medical marijuana to a grower since the law went into effect .
If the plants were destroyed , Vincente said his clients will seek compensation for the plants , which he estimated to be about $ 100,000 .
Representatives of the Sheriff Department and the Larimer County Drug Task Force could not be reached for comment Tuesday .
However , Larimer County District Attorney Larry Abrahamson said his office is weighing whether to appeal the decision issued verbally in court by Judge James Hiatt .
" We 're getting a transcript of the ruling itself , " Abrahamson said .
" Then we 'll sit down and evaluate it . "
If prosecutors appeal , he said they would likely seek an order staying the judge 's order to return the plants and equipment to the Masters .
According to Vincente , the plants first came to authorities ' attention after police accompanied a social service worker on a visit to the couple 's home .
Masters allowed the officer into his home on the assumption that he was protected by the medical marijuana statute , his lawyer said .
Later , police raided the home using the earlier visit as the basis for a search warrant .
In June 2006 , Hiatt tossed out the charges against the Masters after ruling that the search warrant was illegal .
Vincente argued that the officer who drafted the warrant , " wrote up a search warrant on what he had already searched . "
Monday 's hearing concerned the issue of whether the marijuana and equipment seized was contraband or property that needed to be returned to the Masters .
Hiatt heard about four hours of testimony from police as well as people who said they rely upon the couple not only for medical marijuana , but for rides to hospitals and doctors and other care .
While no one had designated the Masters as caretakers at the time of the raid , Vincente argued that the couple 's actions met the definition of the term as spelled out in the law .

Murtha revises : Impeachment is ' on the table ' Michael Roston
Published : Monday April 30 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. John Murtha ( D - PA ) revised the much publicized statements he made yesterday and told National Public Radio late on Monday afternoon that impeaching President George W. Bush was " on the table . "
" I 'm just saying that 's one of the options that Congress has on the table , I 'm getting more and more calls from the public about impeachment , " the long - time Congressman , who is a veteran of the US Marines , told NPR 's Melissa Block on the program All Things Considered .
Murtha 's remark was at variance with Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi , who has insisted since prior to the Congressional election last year that returned a Democratic majority in the House that impeachment was " off the table . "
The Congressman 's explanation came after he repeated his statement made on CBS News '
Face the Nation yesterday that impeachment was one of four options that can be used to hold a President accountable , in addition to elections , polls , and the Congress 's control of the executive branch 's budgets .
In yesterday 's appearance , he refused to say whether impeachment was being contemplated , stating only that it was an option .
Murtha later noted that he did n't think impeachment was appropriate at this time .
But he also added , " It 's just one of the things that we always consider .
That 's part of the process .
" The Congressman , who chairs the powerful Defense Appropriations Subcommittee in the House of Representatives , noted that holding the president accountable via the budgetary process was the best option for the Democrats to take at this stage .
" Realistically , obviously the power of the purse is the most powerful influence that the public has , and we have to exert that influence to our utmost ability , " he explained .
At the beginning of the interview , Murtha made note of the approach he thought would be best for responding to the President 's request for more funds for the Iraq War , after President Bush vetoes the Defense Supplemental bill that Congress will send to him tomorrow .
Calling for two months of funding , he explained to NPR the Congress should fund " operation and maintenance and personnel costs , particularly , for a two - month period .
The other things we 'd fund for the whole year : the health care , the vehicles that they need , to resist the IEDs .
We 'd take care of the Walter Reed problem and some of those things for the whole year "
While noting that he was n't certain that the Democratic leadership in the House would support this approach , he told Block it was time for the President to make the next step forward .
" We 've compromised already on two things , so it 's time for the president to step up and make some compromises . , " the Pennsylvania Democrat argued .
The quotes in this story have been updated to reflect the transcript of the interview , which is now available at NPR 's website .

10年くらい前、システム開発の生産性をいかにして上げるか、というテーマで取材をした時、CASE（コンピュータ支援によるソフトウエア・エンジニアリング）やシステム開発方法論に詳しいコンサルタントに会った。一通りの話が終わった頃、「ところで開発生産性が一番高い言語は何でしょうか」と聞いてみた。彼が挙げた言語は筆者にとって意外なものであった。
「 それは間違いなく、えくせるでしょう 」 。
間抜けな話だが、 「えくせる」と聞いて筆者はまったく新しい言語が登場したのかと思った。すぐにExcelだと気付いたが、「表計算のあれですか」と寝ぼけたことを言ってしまった。そのコンサルタントは「お前は何も知らないなあ」という表情をしながら、それを口に出すことはせず、「まあ、表計算ソフトと言えばそうですが、相当なことができますよ。Excelのマクロでさっと実現できる処理を通常の言語で記述しようとすると、桁違いのステップ数が必要です」と説明してくれた。
学生時代 にPascalやFORTRANでプログラミングをした経験があるが、Excelのマクロを使ったことは取材当時から今日に至るまで一度もない。ただ、Excelはシステム開発言語である、という指摘は印象に残った。
数年後、別のコンサルタントに会った時、「システム開発言語としてのExcel」の話題に再びなった。そのコンサルタントは、ある流通業向けに新しい業務システムを提案し、ソフト会社にシステムを開発させ、納入したところだった。新システムの説明を一通り聞いた後、「開発言語は何ですか」と尋ねた。コンサルタントはにこにこしながら「何だと思いますか」と問い返してきた。突然、以前の取材を思い出し、当てずっぽうで「Excelでしょうか」と答えると、コンサルタントは「その通りです。よく分かりましたね」と言ってくれた。デモ画面を見せてもらったが、とても表計算ソフトを利用したとは思えない出来映えだった。
いくつかの注意点を守って使えば、Excelで相当なシステムを開発できる、とそのコンサルタントは教えてくれた。印象的であったのは、現場の利用部門と情報システム部門を結びつける「共通言語」にExcelはなり得る、との指摘である。現場の利用部門は業務に様々な情報を使いたい。実際、必要に応じて、Excelを使っている。Excelのシートを見れば、必要な情報が「表」の形で整理されている。情報システム部門はその表から現場の要求を汲み取って、役立つ情報を出す業務システムを開発できる。大まかにまとめると、こういう主張であった。
Excelが介在しない場合、現場は「これとこれが欲しい」と曖昧な要求を出し、情報システム部門は「たぶんこんな情報が必要なのだろう」と推測して、システムを作る。出来上がってから、「欲しいものと違う」「最初から言ってくれないと作れない」と押し問答が始まる。「利用部門に仕様書を作れ、というのは無理。でも表なら書ける」というコンサルタントの言葉もまた記憶に残った。
さらに数年が経ち、先の二人とは別のコンサルタントと議論していた時に、またしてもシステム開発言語Excelに出会った。話題は、メインフレームで処理している基幹系システムと、サーバーで処理している情報分析系システムのほかに、業務支援系システムと呼ぶべき領域がたくさんある、というものであった。業務支援系は、金勘定を直接扱うわけではない。ただし、そのシステムを使い、ある情報を得てから、基幹系システムを使うと非常に便利になる。一例として、営業担当者の見積もり支援システムなどがある。
そのコンサルタントは金融機関の情報システム部門に在籍していた当時、現場の要請を受け、業務支援系システムを一人で開発した、現場から大いに喜ばれたという。さすがに三回目になると、筆者は自信を持って指摘できた。「Excelで作ったのですね」。よく分かりましたねえ、とそのコンサルタントは言い、興味深いことを教えてくれた。
「 Excelでシステムを開発すると大きな問題が発生します。一人で相当のものを作れますが、わざわざ文書なんて残さないし、修整も自分一人でやってしまう。ですから運用まで含めても生産性は高まります。しかし、開発者がいなくなると誰も引き継げません。ちょっと前に用事があり古巣の金融機関に電話をしたところ、私が作ったExcelシステムをまだ使っていると聞きました。特に問題が出ないので誰も保守していない。データの整合性は大丈夫なのか、心配になりました」。
6月25日付の本欄で「御意見募集、“ Excelレガシー ” への対処法」という短文を公開した。ここで初めて使った「Excelレガシー」という造語を思いついた経緯を今回簡単に紹介した。10年にわたり、3人のコンサルタントとやりとりした結果、「システム開発言語としてのExcelの可能性と課題」について報道することにした次第である。
幸い、少なからぬ読者にこの言葉に関心を持って頂いたので、日経コンピュータ誌で特集記事「 “ Excelレガシ ー ” 再生計画」を掲載し、7月10日からは、Enterprise Officeに、「 Excelレガシー再生計画」という欄を開設した。
さらにEnterprisePlatform談話室 「 自らを棚に上げ、Excelレガシー問題担当記者に苦言」で予告した通り、Excelレガシー問題に関するセミナー「内部統制の穴、「現場のExcel資産」を見直す」を開催することを決めた。今回紹介したコンサルタントのうち、お一人が登壇する。「内部統制の穴」という題名になっているが、内部統制にとどまらず、システム開発言語Excelについて掘り下げようと考えている。議論・質疑応答の時間を長めに用意しているので、疑問や関心のある方はぜひご参加頂きたい。

But there are 78 million boomers — roughly three times the number of teenagers — and most of them are Internet users who learned computer skills in the workplace .
Indeed , the number of Internet users who are older than 55 is roughly the same as those who are aged 18 to 34 , according to Nielsen / NetRatings , a market research firm .
TeeBeeDee ’s founder is Robin Wolaner , who in 1987 created Parenting magazine .
That year , at least seven magazines focused on being a parent were started , and Ms. Wolaner said she was seeing the same sudden recognition of a need for Internet publishers to respond to the demands of older Americans .
She came up with the idea for the site , she said , “ when I was sitting around with friends and we said , ‘ We ’re not going to hang out at the AARP site .
What is there for us ? ’ ” ( Plus , she said , she wanted to find a community where she could discuss her interest in getting an eye lift ) .
“ There ’s a recognition that this generation now uses the Internet just like younger people , ” she said .
“ The one thing this generation has n’t done yet is network online . ”
The question is whether they ’ll want to network in large enough numbers to justify the tens of millions of dollars going into the space .
Indeed , the interest from entrepreneurs and venture capitalists has led to a mini- boom in sites that cater to baby boomers , creating what they say is both critical mass and a likely falling out .

This fall , the New Mexico Spaceport Authority unveiled the design for the world 's first public launching and landing site for space vehicles , Spaceport America , future home to Virgin Galactic and the X Prize cup .
The plan — by UK architecture firm Foster +
Partners and San Francisco - based engineering shop URS — includes a passenger terminal and a hangar big enough for seven craft .
When it 's completed in 2010 , the project will have set New Mexico 's taxpayers back an estimated $ 225 million .
And with that kind of money , you can buy a lot of sci - fi panache .
" The spaceport design had to be a vision of the future , not the past , " says Will Whitehorn , Virgin Galactic 's president .
" It 's not a railroad station we 're building out there . "
While Spaceport America 's anchor tenant will be Virgin — which is still hoping for a 2009 launch despite a recent explosion at its development facility in Southern California — other private space ventures are invited to dock there as well .

For a nickel apiece a thrilled group tunes in on a screechy jukebox of the 1890s . *
Photo : Bettmann / Corbis * 1889 : The first jukebox is installed at the Palais Royale Saloon in San Francisco .
It becomes an overnight sensation , and its popularity spreads around the world .
That first jukebox was constructed by the Pacific Phonograph Company .
Four stethoscope - like tubes were attached to an Edison Class M electric phonograph fitted inside an oak cabinet .
The tubes operated individually , each being activated by the insertion of a coin , meaning that four different listeners could be plugged in to the same song simultaneously .
Towels were supplied to patrons so they could wipe off the end of the tube after each listening .
The success of the jukebox eventually spelled the end of the player piano , then the most common way of pounding out popular music to a line of thirsty barflies .
The machine was originally called the “ nickel - in - the - slot player ” by Louis Glass , the entrepreneur who installed it at the Palais Royale .
( A nickel then had the buying power of $ 1.08 today . )
It came to be known as the jukebox only later , although the origin of the word remains a bit vague .
It may derive from “ juke house , ” a slang reference to bawdy house , where music was not unknown .

Fluorescent proteins found in nature have been employed in a variety of scientific research purposes , from markers for tracing molecules in biomedicine to probes for testing environmental quality .
Until now , such proteins have been identified mostly in jellyfish and corals , leading to the belief that the capacity for fluorescence in animals is exclusive to such primitive creatures .
Researchers say green fluorescent proteins , which could play role as ' sunscreen ' or stress reducer , may be widespread in animal kingdom .
Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego have discovered fluorescent - light emitting features in an evolutionarily important marine organism and say such a capacity may be much more prevalent across the animal kingdom than previously believed .
In the October issue of Biological Bulletin , Dimitri Deheyn and his colleagues in La Jolla , Calif . and Japan describe finding green fluorescent proteins ( GFPs ) in amphioxus , a fish - like animal closely studied by scientists due to its evolutionarily important position at the base of a large phylum of animals called chordates .
The researchers say amphioxus ' GFPs are very similar to those of corals , an interesting fact since the two animal groups are separated by hundreds of millions of years of evolution .
The finding emphasizes the idea that evolutionary preservation of fluorescence must play an important ecological function , Deheyn said .
Many animals have n't been tested for fluorescence and its prevalence in the animal kingdom remains unknown .
Deheyn made the discovery while analyzing a dozen specimens of the small , slender marine animals collected in Tampa , Fla. , by Nick Holland , a professor of marine biology at Scripps and a paper coauthor .
" When I put the specimens under the blue light ( used for evoking fluorescence ) , every single amphioxus had a bright green area in the anterior that was fluorescent , " said Deheyn .
advertisement
Follow - on analyses in the Tampa specimens , along with similar species samples from France and Japan , revealed details of how the fluorescence spreads along the animal 's body as well as how the animal fluoresces at different stages of development .
Amphioxus -- also called a lancelet -- is found primarily in coastal areas and lives mostly burrowed in ocean sand except for its head .
Previous studies have shown it to be sensitive to changes in light exposure .
Deheyn says the exact role of amphioxus ' fluorescence is not known .
One hypothesis is that the proteins might be used as a form of " sunscreen , " protecting the animal by absorbing harmful ultraviolet light and shielding it away as fluorescent light .
GFPs also may play a role as protective antioxidants , decreasing stress levels undergone by cells when exposed to temperature fluctuations or other environmental changes .
Fluorescence has been used extensively in biotechnology , biomedicine , bioengineering and lately in nanotechnology .
GFPs have been used as markers to examine gene expression as well as probes for tracking how molecules transfer energy .
" ( GFP ) is an easy protein to work with and to use as a label , " said Deheyn , a scientist in the Marine Biology Research Division at Scripps .
" It 's easy to locate and stimulate so it has been used widely around the world .
There is a great deal of interest in finding new fluorescent compounds and proteins that can show different characteristics of light production . "
Deheyn's latest investigations focus on finding GFPs in animals in marine as well as terrestrial environments .
In addition to Deheyn and Holland , Biological Bulletin paper 's coauthors include James McCarthy , Magali Porrachia and Greg Rouse of Scripps Oceanography , Kaoru Kubokawa of the University of Tokyo and Akio Murakami of Kobe University .
The study was funded by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research 's Biomimetics , Biomaterials and Biointerfacial Sciences program and the Ministry of Education , Culture , Sports , Science and Technology of Japan .
Amino acids are a type of organic acid that contains both a carboxyl group ( COOH ) and an amino group ( NH 2 ) .
The general formula for an amino acid is given below .
Although the neutrally - charged structure is commonly written , it is inaccurate because the acidic COOH and basic NH 2 groups react with one another to form an internal salt called a zwitterion .
The zwitterion has no net charge ; there is one negative ( COO - ) and one positive ( NH 3 + ) charge .
There are 20 amino acids derived from proteins .
While there are several methods of categorizing them , one of the most common is to group them according to the nature of their side chains .
Nonpolar Side Chains
There are eight amino acids with nonpolar side chains .
Glycine , alanine , and proline have small , nonpolar side chains and are all weakly hydrophobic .
Phenylalanine , valine , leucine , isoleucine , and methionine have larger side chains and are more strongly hydrophobic .
Polar , Uncharged Side Chains
There are also eight amino acids with polar , uncharged side chains .
Serine and threonine have hydroxyl groups .
Asparagine and glutamine have amide groups .
Histidine and tryptophan have heterocyclic aromatic amine side chains .
Cysteine has a sulfhydryl group .
Tyrosine has a phenolic side chain .
The sulfhydryl group of cysteine , phenolic hydroxyl group of tyrosine , and imidazole group of histidine all show some degree of pH - dependent ionization .
Charged Side Chains
There are four amino acids with charged side chains .
Aspartic acid and glutamic acid have carboxyl groups on their side chains .
Each acid is fully ionized at pH 7.4 .
Arginine and lysine have side chains with amino groups .
Their side chains are fully protonated at pH 7.4 .

Thoughts on the Social Graph

Translations : [ Беларускі ]
I 've been thinking a lot about the social graph for awhile now : aggregating the graph , decentralization , social network portability , etc .
If you 've seen me at any conference recently , I probably talked your ear off about it .
I 've gotten good at my verbal / visual presentations , showing my slides , pictures of graphs , and adapting my delivery to you based on your background , facial expressions , questions , etc .
This is all a lot harder to do in a blog post where the audience is so diverse , so I 've been lazily putting it off .
I was also afraid that if I left anything out , I 'd get flooded with comments like But what about __________ ?
Clearly then all you say is wrong .
But it 's time I braindump this , so here goes ....
First off , before I explain what I 've prototyped so far , and what I want to build ( or see built ) next , let me declare the problem statement , as I see it , and the underlying assumptions I 've been making :
There are an increasing number of new " social applications " as well as traditional application which either require the " social graph " or that could provide better value to users by utilizing information in the social graph .
What I mean by " social graph " is a the global mapping of everybody and how they 're related , as Wikipedia describes and I talk about in more detail later .
Unfortunately , there does n't exist a single social graph ( or even multiple which interoperate ) that 's comprehensive and decentralized .
Rather , there exists hundreds of disperse social graphs , most of dubious quality and many of them walled gardens .
Currently if you 're a new site that needs the social graph ( e.g. dopplr.com ) to provide one fun & useful feature ( e.g. where are your friends traveling and when ? ) , then you face a much bigger problem then just implementing your main feature .
You also have to have usernames , passwords ( or hopefully you use OpenID instead ) , a way to invite friends , add / remove friends , and the list goes on .
So generally you have to ask for email addresses too , requiring you to send out address verification emails , etc .
Then lost username / password emails .
etc , etc .
If I had to declare the problem statement succinctly , it'd be : People are getting sick of registering and re-declaring their friends on every site . , but also : Developing " Social Applications " is too much work .
Facebook 's answer seems to be that the world should just all be Facebook apps .
While Facebook is an amazing platform and has some amazing technology , there 's a lot of hesitation in the developer / " Web 2.0 " community about being slaves to Facebook , dependent on their continued goodwill , availability , future owners , not changing the rules , etc .
That hesitation I think is well - founded .
A centralized " owner " of the social graph is bad for the Internet .
I 'm not saying anybody should ban Facebook , though !
Far from it .
It 's a great product , and I love it , but the graph needs to exist outside of Facebook .
MySpace also has a lot of good data , but not all of it .
Likewise LiveJournal , Digg , Twitter , Zooomr , Pownce , Friendster , Plaxo , the list goes on .
More important is that any one of these sites should n't own it ; nobody / everybody should .
It should just exist .
Ultimately make the social graph a community asset , utilizing the data from all the different sites , but not depending on any company or organization as " the " central graph owner .
¶ Establish a non-profit and open source software ( with copyrights held by the non-profit ) which collects , merges , and redistributes the graphs from all other social network sites into one global aggregated graph .
This is then made available to other sites ( or users ) via both public APIs ( for small / casual users ) and downloadable data dumps , with an update stream / APIs , to get iterative updates to the graph ( for larger users )
While the non-profit 's servers and databases will initially be centralized , ensure that the design is such that others can run their own instances , sharing data with each other .
Think ' git ' , not ' svn ' .
Then whose APIs / servers you use is up to you , as a site owner .
Or run your own instance . ¶
For developers who do n't want to do their own graph analysis from the raw data , the following high - level APIs should be provided : ¶ Node Equivalence , given a single node , say " brad on LiveJournal " , return all equivalent nodes : " brad " on LiveJournal , " bradfitz " on Vox , and 4caa1d6f6203d21705a00a7aca86203e82a9cf7a ( my FOAF mbox_sha1sum ) .
See the slides for more info .
Edges out and in , by node .
Find all outgoing edges ( where edges are equivalence claims , equivalence truths , friends , recommendations , etc ) .
Also find all incoming edges .
Find all of a node 's aggregate friends from all equivalent nodes , expand all those friends ' equivalent nodes , and then filter on destination node type .
This combines steps 1 and 2 and 1 in one call .
For instance , Given ' brad ' on LJ , return me all of Brad 's friends , from all of his equivalent nodes , if those [ friend ] nodes are either ' mbox_sha1sum ' or ' Twitter ' nodes .
Find missing friends of a node .
Given a node , expand all equivalent nodes , find aggregate friends , expand them , and then report any missing edges .
This is the " let the user sync their social networking sites " API .
It lets them know if they were friends with somebody on Friendster and they did n't know they were both friends on MySpace , they might want to be .
But more generally , for developers , enabling new kinds of apps we have n't been able to think of yet .
For end-users : ¶ A user should then be able to log into a social application ( e.g. dopplr.com ) for the first time , ideally but not necessarily with OpenID , and be presented with a dialog like , " Hey , we see from public information elsewhere that you already have 28 friends already using dopplr , shown below with rationale about why we 're recommending them ( what usernames they are on other sites ) .
Which do you want to be friends with here ?
Or click ' select - all ' . "
Also every so often while you 're using the site dopplr lets you know if friends that you 're friends with elsewhere start using the site and prompts you to be friends with them .
All without either of you re-inviting / re-adding each other on dopplr ... just because you two already declared your relationship publicly somewhere else .
Note : some sites have started to do things like this , in ad - hoc hacky ways ( entering your LJ username to get your other LJ friends from FOAF , or entering your email username / password to get your address book ) , but none in a beautiful , comprehensive way .¶
Deliver end - user tools ( likely a browser add - on ) to let users manage their social networks ( whether the sites have cooperative APIs or not ) , syncing them with each other , or doing whatever they 'd like , but according to the user 's own policies .
While the tools will most likely add the most value with uncooperative sites , it must always be clear to users what is happening so that no one is ever tricked .
More on this later ... ¶
Make graph data as portable as documents are on a personal computer .
( though likely never using the word ' graph ' to end - users ) ¶
The goal is not to replace Facebook .
In fact , most people I 've talked to love Facebook , just want a bit more of their already - public data to be more easily accessible , and want to mitigate site owners ' fears about any single data / platform lock - in .
Early talks with Facebook about participating in this project have been incredibly promising .
¶
The goal is not to build a social networking site or anything that 's fun for the end -user .
Rather , the goal is to build the guts that allow a thousand new social applications to bloom , like Dopplr , etc .
Do one thing and do it well .
It will be most powerful to instead merge little isolated social graphs into one big social graph and spread it far and wide , for all to enjoy .
¶
The goal is not to replace Plaxo . ¶
The goal is not to replace __________.¶
The social graph contains a combination of public nodes , private nodes , public edges , and private edges .
The focus is only on public data for now , as that 's all you can spray around the net freely to other parties .
While focusing on public data does n't solve 100 % of the problem , it does solve , say , 90 % of the problem at 10 % of the complexity .
Private data can be added later , perhaps at a higher layer .
For now , only public data . ¶
In addition , the focus is primarily on friend data , not data like photos ( see movemydata.org ) , and not Date of Birth , Hometown , Interests , etc .
There are plans on how to model a lot of that public non-content , non-friend profile data in the graph , and the plan is do that later , but that 's definitely Phase Two . ¶
There are both cooperative sites and uncooperative sites .
Almost universally every small site I 've talked to wants to cooperate , realizing their graphs are incomplete and that 's not their speciality ... they just need the social graph to do their thing .
They do n't care where it comes from and they do n't mind contributing their relatively small amount of data to making the global shared graph better .
Uncooperative sites , on the other hand , are the ones that are already huge and either see value in their ownership of the graph or are just large enough to be apathetic on this topic .
Please note that " uncooperative " does n't mean " actively fighting it " , but rather that they might just not prioritize supporting this .
In any case , it must ( and will ) work with both types of sites over time . ¶
The world wo n't switch en masse to anybody 's " social networking interop protocol " , pet XML format , etc .
It simply wo n't happen .
This must all work supporting any and all ways of data collection , change notification , etc .
Cute new protocols and XML / YAML / JSON formats for cooperative sites will help ( and have already started to be deployed with a few early cooperative sites ) , but by and large , most sites wo n't be cooperative at first , and some ( e.g. MySpace ) might not ever ever support this .
This is going to happen one site at a time and without everybody speaking the same protocols .
That said , this project will use open standards , microformats , etc in all data that is republished in , say , widgets ( for those users who like widgets ) ¶
Most users do n't care about XML , protocols , standards , data formats , centralization vs decentralization , silos , lock - in , etc .
You , the reader of this document , are not a normal user .
To reach the normal users , we must provide them value : some functionality , ease , bling , utility that they can't get elsewhere .
Good data begets users , and users begets good data .
There are a bunch of ideas on how to bootstrap this cycle .
More on that later , but fortunately a lot of the good data is already publicly accessible via good APIs and open data formats .
¶
Requiring browser add - ons or other end - user downloads is a nonstarter .
This all must run primarily on the web .
Some functionality for some ( uncooperative ) sites will require a browser plugin , but most wo n't .
¶
While a browser add - on most likely will be used to facilitate friending / defriending and data acquisition on the user 's behalf for certain uncooperative sites , their browser must never be used ( thus their IP address and user - agent string ) to gather and report data that is n't theirs .
For instance , collecting their friends on a site like MySpace ( if they configure it to ) is okay , but scraping their friends - of - friends is n't cool because that is n't their data .
It 's either those friends ' data or MySpace 's ... definitely not the user who downloaded the add - on . ¶
It 's recognized that users do n't always want to auto - sync their social networks .
People use different sites in different ways , and a " friend " on one site has a very different meaning of a " friend " on another .
The goal is to just provide sites and users the raw data , and they can use it to implement whatever policies they want .
¶
got the data to 5 large social networks , modeled them in the graph prototyped working implementations of the APIs above ( lot of room for performance optimizations , caching , and parallelism , but wanted to get correctness first )
Was able to find all my missing LiveJournal and Vox friends , based on my relationships elsewhere .
start of a Firefox plug - in to work with MySpace start of a website to let users declare extra public nodes , node equivalences , and relationships that are n't otherwise automatically picked up ( website to include fun stats and widgets , as enticement for users to go there , as well as browser add - on downloads , to sync different sites , if they choose to do that ) ...
David Recordon has announced that he 's going to SixApart , largely to work on this sort of stuff .
Plaxo is also doing interesting stuff in this regard .
Eventually companies will build free and paid services atop this data , like trust / reputation APIs , which will help Movable Type & Wordpress bloggers with identifying comment spam ( once you have an OpenID - authenticated comment , you have a node , but then use the APIs to find out if that node is good ) .
In any case , a lot of people are working on this lately , and taking different approaches .
It 's quite likely that multiple groups will converge to work on this together , similar to how many groups got together to work on OpenID .
How You Can Help : ¶
You run a social networking site and have some node / edge ( user / friend ) data , or want to beta test some of the APIs ?
Get in touch ... join the Google Group .
End-user who wants to try out the non-techy website and tools ?
You 're here early . :)
Limited beta access for testers will be announced later , by whoever ends up building this .
I 'm excited about this .
Start thinking about how you can take advantage of stuff like this .
It 's going to be cool .

Want to comment ?
Leave your comments on this post , if you 'd like .
Or join the Google Group , which David created .
Join any discussion about unit testing and there 's one question that will invariably come up : how do you test private methods ?
There are a number of answers .
Some people advocate increased visibility .
They say that if you feel that you must test a private method , it 's really no great sin to make it protected , public or package private in order to make it testable .
Other people say that you can use special tools to access private methods .
In Java , at least , you can quite easily rig something up with reflection to give you any kind of access you 'd like .
These are " okay " answers , but really they are missing something .
When I write tests and I have the urge to test a private method , I take it as a hint .
The hint tells me that my class is encapsulating so much that it has ceased to be " understandable " by tests through its public interface .
I listen to the hint , and factor my design differently .
Usually , I end up moving the private method ( and possibly some methods around it ) to a new class where it can be non-private and accessible to tests .
Aiming for testability actually changes your design .
But , is that good ?
The answer for me , so far , has been yes .
There appears to be a synergy between testability ( at the unit level ) and good design .
If you aim for testability and make some good choices , design gets better .
If you aim for good design , your design becomes more testable .
In the end , it all comes down to cohesion and coupling .
If classes are deeply coupled with their neighbors , it is hard to control them in a test or observe them independently .
If a class is n't cohesive , it may have some logic which is not easily exercisable through its public interface .
It seems that reverse is true also .
Classes which are hard to instantiate and use in a test harness are more coupled than they could be , and classes with private methods that you feel the urge to test , invariably have some sort of cohesion problem : they have more than one responsibility .
I suspect that some people reading this might think it is a load of wishful thinking , or that this synergy between testability and good design is just a hypothesis without much to back it .
All I can say is that in the community of people doing test - driven development there are a number of people who have found that this question of testing private methods does n't come up much in their practice .
They target both testability and good design and find that both goals nurture each other .
Is the synergy real ?
I think it is .
When a bit of functionality is not easily understood by a test at the public interface , the chances of it being easily understood by a human are ridiculously low .
And , if there is any universal baseline for good design it has to be understandability .
So , having said all of this , I end this blog with a challenge : Can anyone come up with an example in which there is a private method that they feel that they have to test .. something that they do n't feel comfortable testing through the public interface of the class , but which can't be made testable with a better design ?
Foley likely wo n't be prosecuted , amid failure by media to report on email soliciting male page John Byrne
Published : Friday September 14 , 2007
Print This Email This Paper had questionable emails year before reports Raw Story held emails for want of second source Former Republican congressman Mark Foley , whose e-mails and instant messages caused uproar and became the butt of a thousand jokes , might have scored yet again .
According to ABC , Florida laws may spare the congressman because of the state 's three - year statute of limitations .
Florida did not start a criminal investigation of Foley until November 2006 , making it " nearly impossible to prosecute " an explicit instant message Foley sent to a 17 - year - old high school student in 2003 .
Who 's to blame ?
House Republican leadership , for one , who had knowledge of Foley 's inappropriate behavior for years .
The emails originally leaked out of the office of Rep. Rodney Alexander ( R- LA ) , a Democrat - cum - Republican who changed parties in 2004 .
But the untold story is that the media , too , had a hand in protecting Foley .
The messages first crossed the desk of the St. Petersburg Times in 2005 .
RAW STORY is also aware , through various sources , that ABC had elements of the Foley story a year prior to the article 's release .
The critical instant message conversation cited by law enforcement , however , did not emerge until after ABC published their story in August 2006 .
Harper 's Magazine also admitted they had received the first batch of " over - friendly " emails a month earlier .
St. Petersburg Times Executive Editor Neil Brown defended his decision not to run the Foley story after they received " creepy " messages from a Louisiana page in which Foley was seeking a photograph .
" I led deliberations with our top editors , and we concluded that we did not have enough substantiated information to reach beyond innuendo , " Brown wrote in an October 2006 editorial .
" We could n't come up with a strong enough case to explain to a teenager 's parents why , over their vehement pleas to drop the matter , we needed to make their son the subject of a story - and the incredible scrutiny that would surely follow .
" It added up to this conclusion , " Brown added .
" To print what we had seemed to be a shortcut to taint a member of Congress without actually having the goods . "
Lane Hudson , the former Human Rights Campaign staffer who first posted the emails online -- the posting which spurred ABC into running a story -- said he was not surprised .
" The fact that Foley 's getting away with it is symptomatic of how things work in Washington , " Hudson said .
" Republicans in Congress knew about it for years and did nothing about it , the FBI did nothing about it , and the media failed in its responsibility to properly investigate it . "
In the messages , Foley asks a then - 17 - year - old page detailed information about masturbation .
Maf54 ( 7:47:11 PM ) : good so your getting horny
Xxxxxxxxx ( 7:47:29 PM ) : lol ... a bit

Maf54 ( 8:09:04 PM ) : ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Maf54 ( 8:09:08 PM ) : beautiful Raw Story received emails in weeks before publication
For the first time , RAW STORY will also admit having had the email exchange between Foley and a male page prior to ABC 's publication .
This site did not receive the emails until roughly a week prior to ABC 's release , and was unable to acquire a second source to publish the story .
We did not have the more explicit IM conversations .
And now , Foley will probably get away .
" Barring any extraordinary circumstances , it is very unlikely for charges to be filed in a case once the statute of limitations has run its course , " Aya Gruber , a former federal public defender and professor of law at Florida International University , told ABC News .
" Federal officials turned the case over to Florida after concluding that Foley did not engage in any actual sexual contact until the former pages had turned 18 , and had therefore not violated federal law .
Washington , D.C. law defines the age of consent as 16 , " ABC added .
Florida law stipulates that using the Internet to " seduce , solicit , lure or entice " a minor to commit any illegal act " relating to lewdness or indecent exposure " is a third - degree felony .
This would include email and instant messages .
Mike Rogers , the gay blogger who first suggested Foley was gay on his website blogACTIVE , also said the media had failed .
" Once again , the mainstream media has failed in its role in a great democracy , " he remarked .
" Despite even being given constitutional protection to pursue stories , the papers in Florida not only protected a political career -- most likely so they could have continued access to Congressman Foley -- but they stood in the way of reporting a crime .
With the statue of limitations passed , the blame for Mark Foley 's escape from the law falls squarely upon the heads of the newspapers that had this evidence . "
The House -- led by Democrats -- has also stymied Florida 's investigation .
Lawyers for the chamber blocked investigators ' access to Foley 's computers , saying they were the equivalent of congressional papers , which only Foley could release .
The action followed on the heels of what was later ruled an unconstitutional invasion of Rep. William Jefferson 's ( D - LA ) House office in a bribery inquiry .
ABC was the first to report the action by the House 's lawyers .
Foley resigned hours after more troubling messages with former congressional pages became public via ABC on Sept. 29 , 2006 .
According to Media Bistro , " ABC News ' the Blotter -- which sparked the investigation that exposed lewd instant messages sent by Republican Congressman Mark Foley to a Congressional page and rocked Congress -- won the 2007 National Headliner Award for Television Affiliated Online Journalism for its reporting on the scandal . "
Rogers is a technical consultant for Raw Story .
Sony says it has been using XCP for months
The software , called Extended Copy Protection or XCP , hides itself on your hard drive using techniques normally reserved for viruses , worms and trojans , which use similar " rootkits " to evade detection .
And if you notice it is there and try to remove it you may stop your computer recognising its CD drive .
This is because the cloaking techniques involve making changes to the Windows registry , altering the way device drivers work and generally messing with your installation .
XCP was developed by a UK company called First 4 Internet , and Sony says that it has been using it for months .
It is one of many competing techniques used by record companies to try to stop people making copies of music files from CD as they fear that their customers will then make the music available online without permission .
Mac happy
The existence of the hidden files was noticed by Windows expert Mark Russinovich .
He was scanning his system for security breaches when he noticed something odd going on , and he quickly realised that the suspicious software had been installed when he first listened to the album Get Right With the Man by country rockers Van Zant .
The point of the exercise is to force you to use the supplied music player software if you want to listen to the songs on the album .
And , as you would expect , it also limits your ability to copy the music files to your hard drive or MP3 player .
A spokesman for Sony BMG said the licence agreement on the CDs were explicit about what was being installed and how to go about removing it .
It referred technical questions to First 4 Internet .
Of course , like so many other companies , Sony 's super copy protection only applies to people using Windows PCs .
If you have got a Mac or a Linux box then you can play and even copy you disc happily , because the real WAV files that a CD player uses are there on the disc .
If I was a PC user faced with a disc that insisted on using some non-standard player to let me listen to the music I had just paid for I would have no compunction at all about heading off to the nearest peer - to - peer site to download clean , high - quality copies of the songs I wanted .
I suspect that Sony would be very interested indeed in a version of Windows that controlled music playback without the need for any extra software from them
Sony slated over anti-piracy CD
Of course I would keep the disc , because this is not about getting music for free and depriving artists of their income .
It is about letting record companies know that we have reasonable expectations for what we can do with the music we buy and we will not put up with their games .
Fortunately , it is possible to avoid buying discs like this .
Philips , who defined the CD standard and then made it widely available , has been very clear that these music delivery systems do not count as Compact Discs and cannot use the CD logo .
As far back as 2002 , Philips representative Klaus Petri told Financial Times Deutschland that " those are silver discs with music data that resemble CDs , but are n't " .
And online retailers like Amazon will tell you that what you are buying is a copy - protected data disc that may , just may , play properly in your CD player but will not work as expected on your computer .
What Sony has done is stupid , but I am willing to accept that they did not really understand what they were getting into .
In fact , I would be surprised if anyone at a senior level in Sony 's record division even knows what " cloaking " is or has heard the word ' rootkit ' before they hit the blogosphere .
Copy choice
The executives who signed up to use the Force 4 Internet software probably did not realise that they were unleashing a public relations disaster of biblical proportions , but my pity will not help them .
They have just released a program that will make the files visible , though it still leaves the player software on your system , and First 4 Internet say they have stopped using these techniques .
But there is already talk of a consumer boycott , not only of copy - protected discs but of all Sony BMG discs .
Five years ago this would not have mattered , but there are enough net users and enough blog readers out there to make a difference .
After all , if you are thinking of buying a Van Zant album today and type " van zant cd " into Google , guess what you will find on the first page of hits ?
Mark Russinovich stumbled across the system by accident
But I fear that they are far more likely to look at the way that Microsoft has cosied up to the Hollywood studios in designing Vista , the new version of Windows , and ask for similar privileges .
Microsoft has told technology companies that if they want to develop system - level software that lets Vista play movies then they have to get the approval of at least three of the major studios before it will be included in Windows .
I suspect that Sony would be very interested indeed in a version of Windows that controlled music playback without the need for any extra software from them .
And I fear that the fuss over XCP will prompt them to get in touch with their friends at Microsoft , and then all Windows users will find that they lose the ability to copy music CDs .
Mac users out there cannot look smug about this , since once Apple move to the Intel chipset for the Mac they have said they are going to start using trusted computing features in the hardware that will allow them to exert similar levels of control within Mac OS .
And of course once there is a " technological protection mechanism " in place then it is against the law - both in Europe and the US - to get round it , so open source players for Linux platforms will be illegal .
All in all , it is not looking good for those of us who like to buy and listen to music .

Sex offenders can't live within 2,500 feet of places children might gather
• In an urban area like Miami , this leaves few options for the convicted criminals
• A handful of sex offenders are now living under a bridge
Adjust font size :
MIAMI , Florida ( CNN ) --
The sparkling blue waters off Miami's Julia Tuttle Causeway look as if they were taken from a postcard .
But the causeway 's only inhabitants see little paradise in their surroundings .
Five men -- all registered sex offenders convicted of abusing children -- live along the causeway because there is a housing shortage for Miami 's least welcome residents .
" I got nowhere I can go ! " says sex offender Rene Matamoros , who lives with his dog on the shore where Biscayne Bay meets the causeway .
The Florida Department of Corrections says there are fewer and fewer places in Miami - Dade County where sex offenders can live because the county has some of the strongest restrictions against this kind of criminal in the country .
Florida 's solution : house the convicted felons under a bridge that forms one part of the causeway .
The Julia Tuttle Causeway , which links Miami to Miami Beach , offers no running water , no electricity and little protection from nasty weather .
It 's not an ideal solution , Department of Corrections Officials told CNN , but at least the state knows where the sex offenders are .
Nearly every day a state probation officer makes a predawn visit to the causeway .
Those visits are part of the terms of the offenders ' probation which mandates that they occupy a residence from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m .
But what if a sex offender can't find a place to live ?
That is increasingly the case , say state officials , after several Florida cities enacted laws that prohibit convicted sexual offenders from living within 2,500 feet of schools , parks and other places where children might gather .
( Watch one sex offender describe how he was forced to give up an apartment )
Bruce Grant of the Florida Department of Corrections said the laws have not only kept sex offenders away from children but forced several to live on the street .
" Because of those restrictions , because there are many places that children congregate , because of 2,500 feet , that 's almost half a mile , that 's a pretty long way when you are talking about an urban area like Miami , so it is n't surprising that we say we are trying but we do n't have a place for these people to live in , " Grant said .
For several of the offenders , the causeway is their second experience at homelessness .
Some of them lived for months in a lot near downtown Miami until officials learned that the lot bordered a center for sexually abused children .
Trudy Novicki , executive director of Kristi House , said the offenders ' presence put the center 's children at risk .
" It was very troublesome to learn that across the street there are people who are sex offenders that could be a danger to our children , " she said .
Keeping the rats off
With nowhere to put these men , the Department of Corrections moved them under the Julia Tuttle Causeway .
With the roar of cars passing overhead , convicted sex offender Kevin Morales sleeps in a chair to keep the rats off him .
" The rodents come up next to you , you could be sleeping the whole night and they could be nibbling on you , " he said .
Morales has been homeless and living under the causeway for about three weeks .
He works , has a car and had a rented apartment but was forced to move after the Department of Corrections said a swimming pool in his building put him too close to children .
The convicted felons may not be locked up anymore , but they say it 's not much of an improvement .
" Jail is anytime much better than this , than the life than I 'm living here now , " Morales said .
" [ In jail ] I can sleep better .
I get fed three times a day .
I can shower anytime that I want to . "
Morales said that harsher laws and living conditions for sex offenders may have unintended consequences .
" The tougher they 're making these laws unfortunately it 's scaring offenders and they 're saying , ' You know what , the best thing for me to do is run , ' " Morales said .
A Miami Herald investigation two years ago found that 1,800 sex offenders in Florida were unaccounted for after violating probation .
Florida 's system for monitoring them needs to be fixed , says state Senator Dave Aronberg , who proposed a bill to increase electronic monitoring and create a uniform statewide limit that would keep them 1,500 feet away from places where children go .
' We need to know where these people are at all times , " Aronberg said after CNN invited him to tour the bridge where the sex offenders live .
" We need residency restrictions , but just do n't have this hodgepodge of every city having something different . "
State officials say unless the law changes their hands are tied , and for now the sex offenders will stay where they are : under a bridge in the bay .
Students of the evolution of social behavior got a big boost with the publication of the newly sequenced honeybee genome in October 2006 .
The honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) belongs to the rarified cadre of insects that pool resources , divide tasks , and communicate with each other in highly structured colonies .
Understanding how this advanced state of organization evolved from a solitary lifestyle has been an enduring question in biology .
In a new study published in PLoS Biology , Mindy Nelson , Kate Ihle , Gro Amdam , and colleagues reveal one possible path to community by showing that a single gene controls multiple traits related to honeybee sociability .
First characterized for its role in reproduction , the gene , vitellogenin , is widely found in egg - laying insects , which depend on it for egg cell development .
A honeybee 's lot in life depends on its age , gender , and caste .
Reproduction falls to the queen and drones , while essentially infertile females , the workers , perform all the other duties required to support the colony .
As young adults , workers tend larvae and perform assorted tasks in the hive .
After about three weeks , they switch from domestic chores to foraging , and eventually specialize in pollen or nectar collection .
Scientists began to suspect that the protein synthesized from the vitellogenin gene -- vitellogenin -- might affect these social life history traits in honeybees as it became clear that the protein supported an array of functions not directly linked to egg - laying .
For example , sterile workers synthesize vitellogenin to make the royal jelly they feed larvae .
It can also prolong the lifespan of both workers and the queen by reducing oxidative stress .
As bees undergo the complex behavioral shift demanded by the change in job description , their physiology changes too : they have higher levels of juvenile hormone and lower levels of vitellogenin .
It was speculated that these two physiological factors repress each other to affect the bees ' behavior , with vitellogenin repressing juvenile hormone in younger bees to inhibit the shift from nest to field , and juvenile hormone repressing vitellogenin in bees that have switched to foraging to ensure that they stay true to their task and do not revert to nest jobs .
In a previous study , the researchers also proposed that changes in vitellogenin gene expression early in life could foster the selective behavior that creates the division of labor between pollen and nectar specialists .
To test these proposed roles of vitellogenin in coordinating the social life of the honeybee , Nelson et al. inhibited the expression of the vitellogenin gene with RNA interference ( RNAi ) .
This gene - silencing tool introduces a double - stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) product whose sequence is complementary to a target gene , thereby setting off a series of events that ultimately " knocks down " the target gene .
The researchers injected a vitellogenin dsRNA preparation into the abdomen of a subset of bees and compared their behavior and lifespan to a control group .
( The control group also received a dsRNA treatment designed to mimic the stress of experimental handling without affecting gene expression . )
The bees ' vitellogenin levels were monitored at 10 days , 15 days , and 20 days old to make sure the RNAi effects persisted .
Compared to controls , dsRNA - treated bees had consistently lower levels of vitellogenin protein .
These vitellogenin " knockdowns " started foraging at a younger age than controls -- confirming that vitellogenin affects workers ' occupational fate by repressing the shift from domestic to foraging tasks .
The foragers also showed a preference for nectar , in keeping with evidence that workers genetically predisposed toward nectar have lower vitellogenin levels before leaving the nest , while those predisposed toward pollen have higher levels .
But more directly , the researchers argue , these results show that vitellogenin controls social foraging specialization .
What 's more , the vitellogenin - deficient bees died earlier than the controls , demonstrating the protein's influence on honeybee longevity .
Altogether , these results demonstrate that vitellogenin regulates the organizational structure of honeybee society by influencing workers ' division of labor and foraging preference .
Vitellogenin , the researchers conclude , controls not only when bees start foraging and how long they live , but what they forage .
Higher levels early in life favor pollen ; lower levels favor nectar .
Since current methods cannot yet distinguish the effects of vitellogenin from those of juvenile hormone , the researchers argue that the two physiological factors should be considered as partners in mediating task assignment and specialization .
Since this partnership is uncommon in insects , it suggests that social behavior in honeybees emerged from a makeover of relations between vitellogenin and juvenile hormone .
It also bolsters the notion that factors normally in control of female reproduction can lay the foundation for the transition from solitary life to complex social behavior .

The bigots still have a loud voice and they 're not being shouted down .
On December 21 2005
I was legally bound to the man I love - as is my legal right and my human right .
I wanted to shout about it , but I still felt nervous of the public 's reaction .
I was , therefore , delighted and relieved on leaving the register office in Windsor to find the crowd outside cheering and supporting our union .
I had feared that abusive , banner - waving bigots would try to spoil the occasion .
I felt so proud that day to be British .
However , in some countries my voice would have been drowned out - maybe even stamped out .
For many , basic rights are still a matter of life and death .
Individuals suffer because of their sexuality every day .
Last year William Hernandez had a gun pressed against his neck , as he stood in the street outside the El Salvador offices of his gay rights organisation , Entre Amigos .
William and his colleagues speak out for gay rights in El Salvador and had been protesting against political moves to amend the constitution to formally prevent gay marriage .
" We will kill you before you can get married , " said his attacker .
The offices of Entre Amigos had been broken into and ransacked two nights before .
Nothing of value had been stolen , but details of planned events were taken and written homophobic threats were left in the offices .
It was the seventh such break - in in five years .
These are n't isolated incidents .
Attacks on gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people are commonplace and those responsible are seldom brought to justice .
Men and women are persecuted and attacked every day , all over the world , just because of those they love .
Amnesty International has documented laws which criminalise gay sex in over 80 countries .
Homophobia impacts very badly on health education .
Information that could help prevent the spread of HIV and Aids is suppressed - or those providing it , or seeking it out , are persecuted .
William and his colleagues are targeted partly because they provide sex education for gay people in El Salvador .
In September 2006 , on stage in Warsaw , I made a statement about homophobia : " Twenty - two years ago I came to Gdansk and met Lech Walesa in his home .
At that time he was a hero to everyone in the world as he fought for freedom and his own human rights , " I told the crowd .
" I am just a musician .
I play and I hopefully make everyone 's troubles disappear for a couple of hours ... I am also a gay man ... and I know that in Poland recently there has been a lot of violence towards gay people .
And I urge you ... this is a time for compassion .
There is enough hatred in the world .
Leave gay people alone .
We are just trying to be ourselves .
Love is what it 's all about ... and the Polish people have always been full of love . "
This weekend is my 60th birthday , 40 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality in the UK , and yet sadly outlawed still in many parts of the world .
I want to take this opportunity to shine a spotlight on William Hernandez , his colleagues and the many individuals who stand up for human rights around the world , at great risk to their own safety .
People like William are far braver than I am , because when bigots shout abuse , he shouts back .
With enough support , they 'll shout the bigots down .
My voice has served me pretty well over the years ; I hope maybe it can do him some good too .
But we need more voices .
Whether the bigot is in our local pub or miles away , we should all stand up and speak out for basic human rights .
I want to ask you , today , to add your voice .

When you crash on a motorcycle there are a lot things that can happen , all of them are bad .
Unlike when riding in a car you are n’t protected by safety belts and a roll cage , instead you are ejected from the vehicle .
Here is a list of some of the things you can expect if you crash on a motorcycle , especially if you do n’t wear protective gear .
1. Road Rash :
This is the term used to describe the large swathes of missing skin that occur when you go tumbling over the pavement with no protective gear .
For a better visual it is similar to starting up a belt sander and pressing it over your flesh until it is nice , pink and bleeding , then pouring gravel and small rocks all over the wound .
Imagine doing this to your entire forearm , finger tips , butt , thighs , knees , and ankles .
If you do n’t wear a full face helmet add grinding off your nose , cheeks or lips to the previous list .
In most cases people will rationalize not wearing gear by saying it ’s too hot to wear leathers , or maybe even ‘ scars are sexy ’ .
I do n’t know anyone who thinks looking like a burn victim is sexy .
If you are lucky enough to survive the crash , you may need skin grafts to replace the skin you have lost to the asphalt .
This requires taking portions of healthy skin from other parts of your body , cutting them off , and ‘ medically stapling ’ them to the road rashed portions of you .
Once they do that then you will get to experience the wound vacuum .
Here is a detailed account of the motorcyclist who had to have their skin grafts vacuumed :
“ Wound vac : a slang medical term that will give me goose bumps for the rest of my life .
When a patient receives a skin graft , a suction cup is placed over the completed surgery in order to increase blood flow from under the new skin .
These devices are called wound vacuums , and they ensure that the burn tissue does not die , but rather joins with the new skin to create a layer of dermis where none would have grown without the graft surgery .
It feels like a leech , a constant sucking on the most painful abrasion you ’ve had in your entire life .
Multiply your worst skinned knee as a kid by 50 , add it to 55 percent of your body , and then let someone suck on it with a handheld vacuum for 24 hours a day ; only then will you know what it is to experience a wound vacuum on a fresh skin graft .
Each graft received a dose of the painful sucking and after three weeks I was free from the noisy machines . ”
If you want to read Brittany ’s story of her recovery , check the link .
2. Broken Bones :
When you buy decent quality protective gear they will often come with soft or hard armor at the joints .
This is to protect against the impact of hitting the pavement at speed .
If you crash without protective gear than you are much more likely to suffer broken kneecaps , ankles , collar bones and ribs .
If you are very unlucky then you might even get to see your bone poking out of your skin by suffering a compound fracture .
3. Thrashed Bike :
Even if you manage to come away unscathed for the most part , chances are your bike will be having a worse day than you .
Repairs to a downed bike can easily go into the hundreds , and sometimes thousands of dollars depending on the make and model .
I have a 2001 Kawasaki ZX6R and to replace one piece of the fairings on my bike would cost me over $ 300 , and that ’s just ONE piece .
Generally a motorcycles fairing consists of 2 - 8 separate pieces !
Once you get your bike to a mechanic ( or back to your house if you are your own mechanic ) you are going to have to look over the majority of the bike to make sure everything that was damaged is repaired .
Forks , clutch levers , brake levers , pegs , crankcase covers , headlights and fairings are just some of the things you can expect to replace or repair in a low speed crash .
If your frame is damaged you might as well total the bike rather than risk it twisting or snapping when you are taking a corner at high speed .
I always recommend buying a motorcycle outright , that way you get a better deal .
If you did get a loan to buy the bike I hope you have full coverage because if you crash you will be paying for a bike you ca n’t ride for months and months .
4. Death :
Death is the ultimate price to pay for anything , and while riding a motorcycle you are much more likely to visit the reaper than if you are driving a car .
When you are riding in a car you are surrounded by thousands of pounds of steel , aluminum , and plastic to protect you from the outside world .
If that was n’t enough you also have safety harnesses to keep you in the car , and air bags that inflate in milliseconds to provide a safety cushion against the steering wheel and car doors .
Just to put icing on the cake the car will sacrifice itself since most are designed to crumple in specific spots to absorb the impact of a crash instead of transferring that inertia to you .
Motorcycles in comparison are more dangerous than running with a hypodermic needle filled with the Ebola virus .
You are almost always thrown off the motorcycle when you crash unless you somehow become entangled in the machine and are unable to escape .
When you are flying through the air you have to pray that you hit the ground and are able to slide to a stop before you become crushed or impaled on stop signs , road barriers or other vehicles .
If you land in the roadway you have to decide between staying on the ground and potentially being run over by cars that ca n’t see you , or moving and possibly making any injury your have ( including spinal injuries ! ) even worse .
Anyway you slice it crashing is not a picnic .
5. Dismemberment :
A guard rail is designed to help keep cars on the road , but if a motorcycle crashes into one then it can turn into an axe with the ability to lop off legs , hands , arms , even tear people in two .
6. Bruising / Internal bleeding
Most vehicle accidents will result in bruising of some type , from the mild black eye to internal bleeding so severe that you need surgery to survive .
As a rule is you are bleeding from any place you normally should n’t ( ears , eyes , bloody stool / urine ) then you might be hurt far worse than you think you are .
It is always a good idea to get checked out by a medic or doctor before going home to heal .
Here ’s a video of a guy getting 1200 cc ’s of fluid drained from his lungs after crashing his motorcycle .
Fun !
7. Dislocated Eyeball :
A little known injury to motorcycle and car crash victims is eyes being forced out of their sockets from the impact of a crash .
That makes me shudder even thinking about it .
How would you react if you were fully conscious and your popped out and started to rattle around inside your helmet .
You would be completely disoriented by getting two images in your brain from two different angles , one is your normal eye , the other from your eye hanging down in your helmet .
Ugh .
Although I could n’t find a video of an eye popped out , this rider did break his orbital bones and injured his left eye quite a bit .
Timed Caching Decorator
Here 's the caching decorator I mentioned in my previous blog entry about optimizing the front page of becontrary .com .
It is pretty simple to use , you supply the same parameters to it as timedelata . So @timed_cache( minutes=30 ) would cache the result for half an hour .
It is thread safe , so you can happily use it in the context of a web application , such as Turbogears .
For many things it is a magical one - line speed - up , but there are some issues to be aware of .
You ca n't use it to cache anything where the return value is context sensitive , such as SQLObject class instances -- because they are tied to a database context that wont exist at the second call .
If you do want to cache such objects , then you should copy the information you need to a dictionary .
Genshi templates make the difference completely transparent , so it is not much of a problem .
Another issue is that parameters must be immutable , because they are used as keys in a dictionary .
from datetime import datetime , timedelta from copy import deepcopy from threading import RLock def timed_cache ( seconds = 0 , minutes = 0 , hours = 0 , days = 0 ) : time_delta = timedelta ( seconds = seconds , minutes = minutes , hours = hours , days = days ) def decorate ( f ) : f . _lock = RLock ( ) f . _updates = {} f .
_results = {} def do_cache ( * args , ** kwargs ) : lock = f . _lock lock .
acquire ( ) try : key = ( args , tuple ( sorted ( kwargs . items ( ) , key = lambda i : i [ 0 ] ) ) ) updates = f . _updates results = f . _results t = datetime . now ( ) updated = updates .
get ( key , t ) if key not in results or t - updated > time_delta : # Calculate updates [ key ] = t result = f ( * args , ** kwargs ) results [ key ] = deepcopy ( result ) return result else : #
Cache return deepcopy ( results [ key ] ) finally : lock .
release ( ) return do_cache return decorate if __name__ == " __main__ " : import time class T ( object ) : @timed_cache ( seconds = 2 ) def expensive_func ( self , c ) : time .
sleep ( . 2 ) return c t = T ( ) for _ in xrange ( 30 ) : time .
sleep ( . 1 ) t1 = time .
clock ( ) print t .
expensive_func ( ' Calling expensive method ' ) print " t - %i milliseconds " % int ( ( time .
clock ( ) - t1 ) * 1000 . )
There are some other things to be aware of .
Naturally it will use up more memory , because a copy of the result is stored for each combination of parameters .
And the standard disclaimer applies , that you should check if there is actually a speed - up before using it in production code .

If you ’re one of the millions of homeowners who bought a home in recent years with an adjustable - rate mortgage , and now find yourself over your head with rising mortgage payments , President George Bush recently unveiled a plan that could help you .
Bush announced a proposal to expand the role of the federal government in an effort to stem the wave of mortgage defaults that is causing a ripple effect in the U.S. economy .
The president ’s proposal is targeting the estimated 2 million homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure because of the high payments they face on adjustable - rate mortgages taken out in 2005 , 2006 and 2007 .
These adjustable - rate mortgages , also known as “ variable ” mortgages , or ARMs , do not have set interest rates as do their fixed - rate counterparts .
Instead , these rates fluctuate as market rates fluctuate .
With the steady rise in interest rates , homeowners ’ mortgage payments have also kept pace with the increases .
These loans make it difficult to plan a budget because monthly payments fluctuate .
The initial attractiveness of these mortgages had been that variable rates , now above fixed - interest rates , could have fallen below fixed rates , and saved borrowers money .
Whether or not an adjustable - rate mortgage is a good investment really depends upon luck and how much of a risk - taker you are .
If you know that you will not be able to afford payments if your interest rate rises , then you should not get an adjustable - rate mortgage .
However , taking a chance on an adjustable rate does work out for some people , and you always can refinance your variable - rate mortgage if you wish .
The Bush proposals would help an estimated 80,000 homeowners refinance their mortgages .
Both Republicans and Democrats agree that millions of homeowners could be overwhelmed in the next 18 months as low teaser rates expire on more than 2 million adjustable - rate mortgages , causing monthly payments to increase sharply .
Other black clouds looming over homeowners ’ heads are falling real estate prices and a pullback among mortgage lenders .
These are expected to make it more difficult for overstretched homebuyers to either refinance their way out of trouble or simply sell their houses .
“ This is really just the beginning , ” said Karen Weaver , global director for securitization research at Deutsche Bank .
“ There ’s a big wave of defaults coming over the next 12 to 18 months . ”
Under the Bush plan , the Federal Housing Administration 's mortgage insurance program will be changed to allow more people to refinance with FHA insurance if they fall behind on adjustable - rate mortgages .
People who have missed mortgage payments are now ineligible for FHA insurance .
The president 's plan would allow them to be eligible for FHA insurance if the amount they are required to pay each month increases , as has happened on many adjustable loans with so - called " teaser " introductory rates .
However , Bush is rejecting a wholesale bailout of borrowers and lenders alike , saying it's not Washington 's role to provide such a backstop .
" The government 's got a role to play , " he said , " but it is limited . "
A bailout of lenders , Bush said , would only encourage similar situations in the future .
" It 's not the government 's job to bail out speculators or those who made the decision to buy a home they knew they could never afford . "
But the president said that many homeowners could be helped if their lenders are flexible with mortgage terms and if the government offers them modest help .
" This is not going to reverse things , " David Ader , bond strategist for RBS Greenwich Capital , said in a written statement .
" This proposal is something that may help a small slice of the market , but we do n't see it as a broad solution . "
Many other ideas have been floated in recent weeks to help homeowners who face staggeringly high payments on adjustable - rate mortgages taken out in the past two and a half years .
These include giving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac a bigger role , or even creating a new federal bureaucracy to bail out homeowners .
One of the first steps you can take to get yourself back afloat is learn your options .
These include :
Before you talk to a lender , you should find out what they will see when the view your credit report .
Know beforehand what to expect , and begin to remove negative items before you sit in front of a lender .
In the gym at the NATO base in Kabul , U.S. soldiers hit the treadmills every morning and gaze at TV screens broadcasting Al Jazeera ’s English news channel .
When Osama bin Laden makes news , as he did recently with a statement about Iraq , America ’s finest work out beneath the solemn gaze of their most wanted enemy .
This sounds like a scene from Donald Rumsfeld ’s private hell .
The former secretary of defense dismissed Al Jazeera as a “ mouthpiece of Al Qaeda . ”
He once called the network , which is based in and owned by Qatar , “ vicious , inaccurate and inexcusable . ”
In an indication of what the Bush administration thinks of Al Jazeera journalism ( and habeas corpus ) , it has locked up one of the network ’s cameramen , Sami al - Hajj , in Guantánamo Bay for more than five years without charging him .
The choice of viewing at the NATO gym is a lot wiser than Rumsfeld ’s choice of words or the terrible treatment of Hajj .
America , and not just its front - line soldiers , needs to watch Al Jazeera to understand how the world has changed .
Any other course amounts to self - destructive blindness .
WASHINGTON , Sept. 21 — George W. Bush ran for the White House as a compassionate conservative .
Now he is portraying himself as a conservative of a different stripe — the fiscal kind .
Mr. Bush is headed into a spending battle with Congressional Democrats with the two branches of government as divided on the issue as they have been since the federal shutdown of 1995 .
The president has threatened to veto 10 of the 11 appropriations bills that have passed the House , as well as legislation expanding a popular children ’s health care program .
On Monday , he will step up the fight with a speech accusing Democrats of fiscal irresponsibility .
That might not sound altogether unexpected , given that Democrats , whom Mr. Bush accuses of “ working to bring back the failed tax - and - spend policies of the past , ” now run Congress .
But the president ’s new tough talk on spending has also caught some fiscal conservatives in his own party off guard .
After years lambasting Mr. Bush for letting government spending run out of control , they wonder what has gotten into him .
“ I do n’t know what kind of epiphany he had , ” said Representative Jeff Flake , Republican of Arizona , who fought on Capitol Hill to rein in the federal budget , to little avail .
“ I ’m just glad he had it . ”
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former White House spokesman Scott McClellan says top administration officials -- including President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney -- were involved in his " unknowingly " passing along false information about the leak of a CIA operative 's identity .
Then - White House spokesman Scott McClellan briefs reporters in 2006 .
In October 2003 , as controversy grew about the leak of Valerie Plame 's name , McClellan stood at the White House podium and said that Karl Rove , the president 's top political adviser , and I . Lewis " Scooter " Libby , Cheney 's chief of staff , had not been involved .
" There was one problem .
It was not true , " McClellan writes in his new book , " What Happened , " which is to be released in April .
The excerpt -- three paragraphs from a 400 - page book -- reads in full :
" The most powerful leader in the world had called upon me to speak on his behalf and help restore credibility he lost amid the failure to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
So I stood at the White House briefing room podium in front of the glare of the klieg lights for the better part of two weeks and publicly exonerated two of the senior - most aides in the White House : Karl Rove and Scooter Libby .
" There was one problem .
It was not true .
" I had unknowingly passed along false information .
And five of the highest ranking officials in the administration were involved in my doing so : Rove , Libby , the vice president , the president 's chief of staff , and the president himself . "
McClellan has not given any specifics about how he believes Bush , Cheney , Libby , Rove and then - Chief of Staff Andrew Card were involved in the dissemination of false information .
Asked about the released excerpt , White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said , " The president has not misled his spokespeople , nor would he . "
McClellan , who was White House press secretary from July 2003 until April 2006 , said he 's still writing the book and that his publisher had highlighted the excerpt to build interest .
Peter Osnos , founder and editor at large of PublicAffairs Books , said Wednesday that the book wo n't say Bush deliberately lied .
" Scott 's not suggested that the president was himself party to a conspiracy to mislead .
But it 's pretty damn clear that other people knew what they had done and did n't tell the truth , " Osnos said .
Osnos said the excerpt was released at this time because the company 's book catalog came out Tuesday and reporters had begun asking questions .
Card appeared frustrated Wednesday that McClellan was not releasing more information to clarify the issue .
" I would never , cannot imagine that I would have knowingly asked Scott McClellan to say something that 's a falsehood , " Card said .
Plame , who has filed a civil suit against Cheney , Libby and Rove over the leak , issued a statement saying she was " outraged to learn " that McClellan had confirmed " he was sent out to lie to the press corps and the American public . "
" McClellan 's revelations provide important support for our civil suit against those who violated our national security and maliciously destroyed my career , " she said .
( A federal judge threw the lawsuit out in July on jurisdictional grounds ;
Plame 's husband , Joe Wilson , said they are in the process of appealing , and hope the suit will be heard early next year . )
Wilson said Wednesday the excerpt shows Bush is " out of touch or an accessory of obstruction of justice before the fact and after the fact . "
Watch why Wilson says his wife was a victim of the Bush administration »
Wilson , a former U.S. ambassador who accused the Bush administration of misrepresenting intelligence on Saddam Hussein 's weapons of mass destruction in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq , called for a new congressional investigation .
" I think it would be helpful to have congressional hearings on this matter , " Wilson said .
" This is a betrayal of the national security of the country . "
In March , Libby was convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice for lying to investigators and a federal grand jury about his contacts with reporters concerning Plame .
Just before Libby was to report to a federal prison in July to serve 30 months behind bars , Bush commuted his sentence , although the president stopped short of a full pardon and Libby still had to pay a $ 250,000 fine .
Rove , who left the White House staff at the end of August , was not charged in the case .
His attorney has acknowledged he was one of two sources cited by syndicated columnist Bob Novak , who first disclosed in July 2003 that Plame worked for the CIA shortly after Wilson wrote a critical op - ed piece for The New York Times .
Former Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage has since acknowledged he was Novak 's original source for the information that Plame worked at the CIA , although he said the disclosure was not deliberate and he did not know at the time she was a covert agent .
Because deliberately leaking a CIA operative 's name can be a federal crime , a special prosecutor , Patrick Fitzgerald , was appointed to investigate the case .
No one was charged in connection with the leak itself ; Libby 's charges resulted from statements he made during the investigation .

OK , no frills here :
So Dennis Kucinich offered a privileged resolution to impeach Dick Cheney .
His motion entitled him to read his articles of impeachment into the record and on C - SPAN .
That gave the House leadership two days to figure out what to do , and when to schedule consideration of the motion .
But they decided to act almost right away , by moving to table ( kill ) the resolution .
In order to move to kill it , it had to be read by the clerk first .
So the articles of impeachment got read into the record and on C - SPAN again .
Then Steny Hoyer , in his capacity as Majority Leader , moved to table the resolution .
Everyone expected this to pass easily , as the Democratic leadership remains opposed to considering impeachment , and Republicans ... well , they 're Republicans .
So they held the vote on tabling the resolution , and the vote was held open past the 15 minutes allotted for it , which is not that unusual .
Only it stayed open longer , and longer , and longer .
And then Republicans got mischievous .
They started switching their votes from yes to no , figuring on embarrassing Democrats by forcing them to debate impeaching Dick Cheney , right on national TV in front of everyone .
Republicans believe everything is good for Republicans .
But for some unknown reason , the House leadership kept this vote open longer and longer and longer .
Over an hour , in fact .
During which time , more and more Republican votes migrated into the no column , until in the end , the motion to table was defeated by a vote of 170 - 242 .
Having lost the motion to table , Hoyer went to the next option : a motion to refer the resolution to the Judiciary Committee , where the leadership hopes it will die of neglect .
There was a little procedural hiccup there for a moment , but Hoyer first moved to order the previous question -- a procedural device that ends debate .
A yes vote on the previous question meant that Hoyer could then immediately move to refer the Kucinich resolution to committee .
At that point , the expected order was restored .
The previous question was ordered , Hoyer moved to refer the bill to committee , and the 80 +
Democrats who earlier insisted they did n't want Kucinich 's bill to die on the Speaker 's table instead voted to let it die on Chairman Conyers ' table instead .
Got it ?
So the bill goes to the Judiciary Committee .
Where it will sit next to Kucinich's other resolution calling for the impeachment of Cheney , which was offered through regular channels back in April .
Of interest :
If he wanted to , Kucinich could do this over and over and over again , as often as he wants to .
Anyone who wanted to could .
A motion to impeach is always highly privileged .
MIT students have come up with a way to recharge your laptop without plugging it in .
Rather than consuming electricity , you 'll be burning calories -- your own .
The students designed and built an exercise bicycle that uses " pedaling power " to charge a laptop computer .
As the bike 's instructions note , if you have trouble " squeezing in that daily exercise , " you can now " multitask with no problem - -[ you can ] bike while you work ! "
The pedal - powered laptop began as a class assignment for Course 1.102 , Introduction to Civil and Environmental Engineering ( CEE ) Design ( spring 2007 ) , when students were instructed to design and build a device that converts mechanical power into electrical power .
Class members Piotr Fidkowski , Sebastian Figari , Sara John , Kendra Johnson , Julia Kiberd , Tina Lai and Devon McCorkle teamed up to work on connecting an exercise bike to one of the computers in a dorm 's Athena cluster ( grouped workstations for student use ) .
Encouraged by their instructors -- CEE senior research associate John Germaine , lecturer Jessica Banks , technical instructor Stephen Rudolph and teaching assistant Matthew DeJong - - team leader Johnson contacted Oliver Thomas and Laxmi Rao of Information Services and Technology ( IS&T ) , the MIT office that oversees the Athena computers .
" We were very excited when the students came to us for guidance , " said Rao , who is MIT 's first IT energy coordinator and a member of the MIT Energy Initiative 's ( MITEI ) Campus Energy Task Force .
" It 's the kind of collaboration that the task force would like to encourage , where MIT service providers partner with creative students to take innovative energy - saving projects built in the lab and try them out on the MIT campus . "
After many hours in the lab , the students coupled a laptop donated by Dell to a much - altered exercise bike .
In their design , the motion of the wheel is conveyed through a flywheel , belt and gears to a generator in the back , which charges a conventional 12 - volt battery like that in a car .
A charge controller regulates the electricity coming to the battery to prevent overcharging .
With the aid of a 12 - volt cigarette - lighter adaptor , the battery supplies electricity to the laptop , which rests on a tray atop a swiveling arm in place of the handlebars .
The bike seat is adjustable and the laptop easily moved , so a person of any height can produce an arrangement that 's comfortable and ergonomic for both pedaling and computing .
A cover over the wheel ensures that the rider 's clothing wo n't get caught , and a clear plastic box encloses the electrical components but leaves them visible to curious observers .
In preliminary calculations , the students predicted that a bicyclist should be able to produce up to 75 watts continuously -- far more than the 30 watts needed to power the laptop .
Indeed , in an initial test drive , team member Figari easily generated 50 watts while checking his e-mail .
The pedal - powered laptop was on display last summer in N42 , the building that houses IS&T .
While the students originally intended to place it in an Athena cluster , they are now hoping to install it in the fitness center at the Stata Center .
In moving their project from the lab to the campus , they will encounter some of the real - world challenges of taking a product to the public , from ensuring its safety and reliability to negotiating with facilities that may use it -- a valuable extension of their classroom education .
This project is part of the IT Energy@MIT Initiative .
Begun in March 2007 under the direction of Rao , the initiative aims to support the campus energy - saving goals of MITEI by reducing energy use for information technology across campus .
Among the planned projects : an energy audit of Building N42 by a team of faculty members , graduate and undergraduate students , and personnel from MIT Facilities .

After a decade of relative calm for these animals - the same cannot be said of the humans around them - wildlife officials report at least 10 have been killed this year .
Photographs documenting the slaughter are heartbreaking , mostly because of the peaceful , human - like expressions the dead gorillas wear .
These pictures are part of the tool kit brought to the United States by Arthur Mugisha , a former game warden in Uganda and now manager of the International Gorilla Conservation Programme .
Mugisha acknowledged that the people of Congo can well survive without the mountain gorilla , even though they might not survive the continuing conflict between government forces and rebels in the Virunga National Forest .
But he said the plight of the gorillas was one way to focus attention on the plight of the humans .
" If we were not talking about gorillas ... the story would be very different , " Mugisha said .
" It would be another group of people who are suffering and dying , and the world continues . "
No one really knows why mountain gorillas are being killed now , though jealousy might play a role , said Craig Sholley of the African Wildlife Foundation .
In this area of rich biodiversity , Uganda and Rwanda have been able to capitalise on gorilla tourism , Sholley said , with tourist permits alone accounting for about $ 15 million in annual revenue .
The Democratic Republic of Congo 's unstable Government has been unable to do the same .
" Folks in Congo are taking a look at the successful situation in Rwanda and Uganda , which have revitalised over the last several years , and they 're jealous , " Sholley said .
" A degree of jealousy has led to a degree of institutional breakdown that is causing problems in terms of enforcement on the ground . "
Personal animosity might also be a factor , Mugisha said , with gorilla killings becoming a way to settle scores against those charged with protecting the creatures .
What is clear is that fighting between Congolese military and rebels in the park has left gorillas unprotected as park rangers and civilians flee from violence .
" They live hour by hour , not even day by day , because any time they can die , " Mugisha said of the people living in the area .
" These are communities that are looking for livelihood , but they are not sure if they will be able to see tomorrow , so it 's a very frustrating and empty life that they are living . "
The possibility for change might lie in saving the gorillas and their environment , Mugisha said .
His program works to make sure that , through the gunfire , wildlife professionals are still able to go into the gorilla areas to do their jobs .
The program also encourages such activities as bee - keeping and mushroom cultivation that individual families can do in and around their homes and that can bring in money .
A trans - boundary strategy to protect mountain gorillas has been supported by the political powers in Democratic Republic of Congo , Uganda and Rwanda , he said .
It lets wildlife organisations such as Mugisha 's take a neutral stance to warfare while trying to preserve gorilla populations .
It also aims to save the forests where the gorillas live , rather than clearing the trees for cropland .
For those whose fields lie just outside the forest , the gorillas can be a nuisance .
So Mugisha and others have set up Human Gorilla Conflict Organisations - like neighborhood watch groups , except , instead of keeping the area clear of crime , they aim to keep it clear of crop-raiding mountain gorillas .
" These gorillas are intelligent and they know they are crop- raiding , " Mugisha said .
" So when there is an organised group that comes , we can actually chase them without harming them . "
Though they can appear threatening and are certainly large and strong , mountain gorillas are very timid , Sholley said .
" If you put a force of 10 people between them and the gardens , the gorillas are in no way , shape or form going to go into the gardens , " Sholley said .

Army chiefs of 19 nations hold secret talks in Australia
by Staff Writers
Sydney ( AFP ) Aug 14 , 2007
Army chiefs from 19 countries , including the United States , Japan and India , met secretly in Sydney ahead of an Asia - Pacific summit in the city next month , the country 's army chief revealed Tuesday .
The presence of the military leaders in Sydney , including US General George Casey , at the same time and at the same venue last week was considered too risky to publicise , the Australian Broadcasting Corporation said .
Australia 's Chief of Army , Lieutenant General Peter Leahy , told the ABC it had been judged better not to disclose the meeting , the fifth Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference , at the time .
" We were aware that there 's a lot going on in Sydney and we did n't want to make a fuss , " Leahy said , in a reference to the Asia - Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit in the city on September 8 - 9 .
The summit will be attended by leaders of the 21 members of APEC , including the US , Russia , China and Japan , and Australia is preparing unprecedented security measures to protect them .
But Leahy said the security of the summit was not a particular item on the agenda of the army chiefs ' meeting .
" No , it was an internal conference and we were just sitting around in one of the nice hotels in Sydney , discussing issues , " he said .
The officers had discussed some of the challenges facing modern armies , such as how to prepare for disaster relief , peacekeeping and counter - terrorism operations , he said .
" What we 've all agreed is that we need to look at the methods of education and how we prepare our individuals for the uncertainty of these complex environments that we 're headed into , " he said .
" And I think you 'll see more cooperation into the different armies to make sure that our soldiers are more culturally aware , linguistically attuned and able to deal in these very complex environments . "
The heads of army who attended the conference were from Australia , the United States , Indonesia , Malaysia , Brunei , Cambodia , Canada , Chile , India , Japan , South Korea , Mongolia , Nepal , New Zealand , Philippines , Singapore , Sri Lanka , Tonga , and Vietnam .
The fourth Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference was held in Thailand in August 2005

SYDNEY , Australia ( CNN ) -- Australian opposition leader Kevin Rudd greeted jubilant supporters Saturday night , as he promised changes in environmental , education and workplace policies as Australia 's new prime minister .
Labor Party leader Kevin Rudd has promised to start withdrawing Australian troops from Iraq .
" I will be a prime minister for all Australians , " the head of the center - left Labor Party told the cheering crowd .
" Let us be the generation that seizes the opportunity of today to invest in the Australia of tomorrow .
That 's the mission statement we have as the next government of this country . "
" I want to do it with all of us working together , " said Rudd , 50 .
In his concession speech , Prime Minister John Howard told supporters that he leaves government with Australia " stronger and prouder and more prosperous than it was 11 and a half years ago . "
With less than 75 percent of the vote counted , the Labor Party has won 83 of the 150 seats in Parliament , a net gain of nearly two dozen from the last election , according to the country 's Web site results .
Watch as Rudd calls for a " new page to be written " »
Labor garnered about 53.41 percent of the vote , according to the Web site .
Labor 's victory over Howard 's center - right Liberal - National coalition ends Howard 's quest for a fifth term .
With nearly 12 years in office , he is Australia 's second - longest serving prime minister .
In addition , with one polling place remaining to return results , Howard looked set to lose his suburban Sydney constituency seat to Labor member Maxine McKew , a former television journalist .
Howard , 68 , has been a staunch supporter of President Bush 's decision to go to war in Iraq .
Rudd has said he would immediately begin talks with the Bush administration and the Iraqi government about withdrawing Australia 's 550 combat troops from Iraq by mid-2008 .
He has said Australian troops would remain in Afghanistan .
Also in opposition to Howard and Bush -- the only leaders of industrialized nations not to ratify the Kyoto agreement on greenhouse gas emissions -- Rudd has said he would seek its ratification .
Bush called Rudd and Howard on Saturday evening , said National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe .
" The president and Prime Minister - elect Rudd both said they look forward to working together to strengthen even further the U.S. - Australia relationship , " he said .
" The president told Prime Minister Howard he appreciates his friendship and his strong leadership over the past seven years they have worked together , which has resulted in a stronger U.S. - Australia alliance . "

At White House behest , NYT sat on scoop
When the New York Times published a front page story Sunday about the United States ’ and Pakistan ’s joint clandestine efforts to protect nuclear weapons , the newspaper offered a glimpse into a “ highly classified program ” the Bush administration long objected to seeing in print .
That is , apparently , until now .
Advertisement
In the article ’s 11th paragraph , the Times disclosed that publication was delayed “ for more than three years , ” after the administration argued “ that premature disclosure could hurt the effort to secure the weapons . ”
So after several years , and previous objection , why did the piece now come off the shelf ?
Times executive editor Bill Keller did not respond to several requests for comment about what influenced his decision to now publish the piece .
But David Sanger , the Times Chief Washington Correspondent , who co-authored the piece , told Politico that since 2004 , Pakistani authorities have made statements “ about elements of the program . ”
Indeed , the Times disclosed in its Nov. 18 story that “ late last year ” the head of Pakistan ’s nuclear safety effort “ acknowledged receiving ‘ international ’ help . ”
But that ’s still a year - old revelation .
Sanger also said that “ the new questions the turmoil in Pakistan raised about security of the arsenal warranted a reconsideration of our previous decisions to delay publication . ”
So in the past couple weeks , Sanger , who ’s currently on book leave , contacted Washington Bureau Chief Dean Baquet to revisit the matter
But this time around , as the Times disclosed , the “ White House withdrew its request that publication be withheld . ”
Gordon Johndroe , White House National Security Council spokesman , told the Politico that “ it was determined in 2004 that publication of the information would be harmful . ”
But subsequently , Johndroe said , details of the secret program have “ slowly , over time , become more public . ”
For that reason , he added , “ there was no point in still maintaining our objection to publication . ”
“ We have to be very careful in choosing when to ask a media outlet not to run something , ” Johndroe said .
“ We have a responsibility not to hold them to an agreement when it is no longer necessary . ”
Regarding this change of heart , Baquet said that he believes the administration now understood that “ we were likely to report it anyway . ”
“ If they had maintained their objections , we would have just pushed them aside , ” Baquet said .
“ I think the news value was just so powerful . ”
Since Baquet ’s tenure as bureau chief only stretches back to March 2007 , he was not privy to the discussions in 2004 — which he described as “ a completely different era . ”
And while Baquet added that he does n’t like “ the idea of holding stories , ” he said he is not in a position to judge the circumstances faced by his predecessor .
Of course , the Times ’ three - paragraph disclosure was out of character for a newspaper that has twice publicly flouted similar administration requests .
Most notably , in late 2005 , executive editor Bill Keller , publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , and then - Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman met in the Oval Office with President George W. Bush and high - ranking administration officials , shortly before publishing a contentious front - page story on the N.S.A. ’s warrantless eavesdropping program .
And in June 2006 , the Times reported that the government accessed millions of banking records kept in an international consortium known as Swift .
Keller discussed those decisions to publish against the administration ’s wishes in a 2006 journalism lecture at the University of Michigan , ominously titled “ Editors in Chains : Secrets , Security and the Press . ”
In that lecture , Keller told the audience that the Times has gone the other direction and yielded to requests to withhold publication .
“ My paper has held articles that , if published , might have jeopardized efforts to protect vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear materials , ” Keller said at the time .

Polls show that two - thirds of Americans disapprove of the way the president is handling the war in Iraq ; in a recent New York Times / CBS News survey , a majority said Mr. Bush ’s troop buildup was having no impact , or making things worse .
The White House pays close attention to military families , an important constituency , yet surveys , including a New York Times / CBS News poll in September , have also shown an erosion of support for the war among them .
Yet , White House aides and nine families who have met with Mr. Bush said dissent was rare in the sessions .
The meetings are deeply private — the administration never reveals names of participants — and just one senior official attends , to take notes .
That official , who would speak only anonymously , said the “ overwhelming number of families talk about the good their loved one felt they were doing . ”
This official said families were not screened ; when Mr. Bush is traveling , the Pentagon finds local families for him to meet .
And not all the meetings are cordial ; in 2004 , one mother , Cindy Sheehan , met with Mr. Bush and later complained that he had been dismissive of her .
She went on to start a political crusade against the war .
Other family members have expressed discontent , including Elaine Johnson of Spartanburg , S.C. , who said she asked Mr. Bush in her meeting why soldiers like her son , Darius Jennings , were still dying in Iraq .
She subsequently began speaking out against the war .
Mr. Bush also meets families in connection with Iraq - related ceremonies and speeches , where war supporters make up the audience .
John Ellsworth , vice president of Families United , a support group that backs Mr. Bush , has been invited to three White House events in the past seven months ; each time , he , his wife , Debbie , and their daughter , Jessica , 12 , have met Mr. Bush .
Tears are a big part of presidential family meetings ; Mr. Ellsworth , whose son , Justin , died in Iraq in 2004 , called Mr. Bush “ a big softie . ”
Since the day in September 2001 that he stood on a charred fire truck with a bullhorn in the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center , much has been made of Mr. Bush ’s role as comforter in chief .
He has consoled victims of floods , wildfires and tornadoes .
But in his family meetings , the comforting works both ways .
Kevin Graves of the Northern California town of Discovery Bay waited two hours during a South Lawn picnic to tell Mr. Bush “ it was an honor for my son to serve under you as commander in chief . ”
Amy Galvez of Salt Lake City told Mr. Bush that “ as a mom who lost a son in this war , it ’s easier for me to handle because I believe you are sincere . ”

Generation gap ?
About $ 200,000
The median net worth of people 55 to 64 has climbed to nearly $ 250,000 , while it has dropped to about $ 50,000 for those in their late 30s
Prashant Tungare arrived in the USA in 1984 with a wife , a child and $ 500 in his pocket .
Today , the India - born American citizen is a prosperous computer specialist at Wachovia Bank .
" I 've lived the American dream , " says Tungare , 55 .
He owns a 3,000 - square - foot house in Charlotte and has enough money to retire , but he loves his job too much to quit .
Tungare is part of the wealthiest generation in American history — a group of 67 million people 55 and older who are so affluent that the gap between them and younger people increasingly is making the USA a nation of haves and haves - much - less .
The growing divide between the rich and poor in America is more generation gap than class conflict , according to a USA TODAY analysis of federal government data .
The rich are getting richer , but what 's received little attention is who these rich people are .
Overwhelmingly , they 're older folks .
Nearly all additional wealth created in the USA since 1989 has gone to people 55 and older , according to Federal Reserve data .
Wealth has doubled since 1989 in households headed by older Americans .
Not so for younger Americans .
Households headed by people in their 20s , 30s and 40s have barely kept up with inflation or have fallen behind since 1989 .
People 35 to 50 actually have lost wealth since 1989 after adjusting for inflation , Fed data show .
Older people have always been wealthier than younger ones .
What 's changed is the disparity between the generations .
Old people have been racing ahead , helped by government retirement benefits .
Young people are running in place , partly because they 're delaying careers to get more education .
The growing gap between rich and poor has raised concerns about social justice , the fairness of the tax system and other issues .
Congressional Democrats , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and President Bush have expressed concerns about economic inequality , although there is no consensus about what , if anything , should be done .
Much attention has focused on the multimillion - dollar paychecks of corporate chief executives and hedge fund managers , who 've enjoyed windfalls at a time when the wages of ordinary workers have stagnated .
But the graying of wealth and income may be the most important twist in the new inequality .
The implications are far - reaching and can turn conventional wisdom on its head .
Social Security and Medicare increasingly are functioning as a transfer of money from less affluent young people to much wealthier older people .
Because the older generation has n't set aside enough money to cover promised government benefits , young people will have to make up the difference or older people will face benefit cuts .
The financial shortfalls of Social Security and Medicare over the next 75 years are so large — $ 340,000 per household — that they dwarf the wealth of every age group .
This hidden debt will make it a challenge for young people to accumulate as much wealth late in life as their parents have .
In the USA , income typically peaks at age 57 and wealth tops out at 63 , according to the Fed 's Survey of Consumer Finance .
Wealth describes a person 's net worth — assets minus debts — and reflects a lifetime 's accumulation of income , investments and inheritances .
Income measures how much a person earned in a single year .
Inequality within age groups has n't changed much .
People in their 30s or 60s have roughly the same wealth distribution among themselves as in 1989 .
What 's changed is inequality between age groups .
Older people are thriving in wealth and income .
Younger people are not .
How wealth and income have changed for two age groups , after adjusting for inflation :
• Ages 55 - 59 : Median net worth — the middle point for all households — rose 97 % over 15 years to $ 249,700 in 2004 , the most recent year for which data is available .
Median income rose 52 % .
• Ages 35 - 39 : Median household net worth fell 28 % to $ 48,940 .
Median income fell 10 % .
The increase in the wealth of older people tracks a sharp reduction in elderly poverty that began in the 1960s , when Medicare was introduced and Social Security benefits were improved .
The wealth gap between young and old is about to grow even more extreme .
Baby boomers — 79 million people born from 1946 to 1964 — are entering their years of greatest wealth and maximum government benefits .
Today , the oldest baby boomer is 61 .
The youngest is 43 .
As tens of millions of people head into their years of peak wealth , inequality could soar until baby boomers pass on inheritances to their children or grandchildren .
The inequality debate has focused mostly on the super - rich , who have been getting super - richer .
The top-earning 1 % of taxpayers — those who make more than $ 310,000 annually — collected 17 % of total income in 2005 , up from 13 % in 1989 and 8 % in 1975 , according to Internal Revenue Service data analyzed by economists Thomas Piketty at the Paris School of Economics and Emmanuel Saez of the University of California , Berkeley .
IRS data do n't include information on age , race and education .
A USA TODAY analysis of Federal Reserve and Census data found that demographics — especially age — could be the most important and overlooked factor behind the widening gap .
Most wealth accumulation happens rapidly and late in life — after the kids leave , when income is high , debts drop , 401 ( k ) accounts fatten and home equity swells , according to Fed data .
The safety net — Social Security , pensions and Medicare — also has resulted in big increases in income for the elderly and a sharp decline in the rate at which they dissipate their assets in old age .
Most people over 60 have no mortgage debt , no credit card debt and no car loan .
Trends for younger people have gone in the opposite direction .
Mortgage debt peaks for people in their late 30s , the same time they have the most kids at home .
About 11 % are at least 60 days behind paying on some debt .
Younger generations now delay the start of wealth accumulation .
They postpone careers to get more education .
They marry later ( delaying the financial benefit of a shared household ) , have children later ( delaying the arrival of lower - cost , kid - free days ) and inherit money later ( their parents live longer ) .
Younger people may not look poor .
They have more stuff than ever — more valuable houses , cars and other assets .
But they are so much deeper in debt than their parents — student loans , credit cards , mortgages , car loans — that their net worth has shriveled .
What 's not clear is whether today 's younger people will catch up .
Will they reap financial rewards late in life as their parents did ?
" Young people have a great future ahead of them , but the rules of wealth creation have changed , " says economist Kay Strong of Bowling Green State University in Ohio .
She says young people will have to work longer and switch jobs more often than their parents for financial success .
" The baby boomers were the last generation able to ride the old industrial economy that let you hold one job for a long time and retire with a pension , " says Strong , 54 .
" The new economy is going to require people to adapt , hold more jobs over a lifetime and give up the concept that you will retire at 62 . "
Gary Burtless , a scholar at the Brookings Institution , says the richest and the poorest have improved their standing .
The middle class , however , has lost ground , he says .
The poor have been helped by expanded government programs , including the Earned Income Tax Credit , which provided $ 36 billion to 21 million poor households in 2006 .
The wealthiest have been helped by lower tax rates on income and capital gains .
" The tax system is a lot less burdensome today on the bottom 25 % and the top 10 % .
It 's the middle class that has done less well , " Burtless says .
Bernanke , the Federal Reserve chairman , said in February that a snapshot of income today would find greater inequality than 25 years ago .
But he said the key question is whether economic mobility — the ability to move up the income ladder — is still strong .
Other factors besides age contribute to income inequality .
President Bush in January cited education 's role .
" Income inequality is real ; it 's been rising for more than 25 years , " he said .
" The reason is clear :
We have an economy that increasingly rewards education . "
So far , though , the return on education has paid off for older people , but not for younger generations .
The net worth of households headed by a college - educated person ages 55 - 59 rose to $ 526,300 in 2004 , up from $ 271,515 in 1989 , adjusted for inflation .
This group has enjoyed enormous income gains , too , and had a median annual income of $ 100,634 in 2004 .
By comparison , wealth and income have declined for college - educated people in their late 30s and risen only slightly for college grads in their early 40s .
In short , age has mattered more than education in widening the wealth gap in recent years .
That could change as highly educated younger people — who delayed finishing college , entering the workforce and having kids — move deeper into their careers .
Another often - cited contributor to income inequality is race and ethnicity .
From 1995 to 2005 , median income soared among Hispanics and income inequality among Hispanics declined , the Census Bureau reports .
But this robust trend of upward mobility made the nation more unequal .
Why ?
The growing numbers of Hispanics , who tend to be younger and poorer , may be prospering compared with where their parents started .
But they 're poorer than white baby boomers entering their most affluent years .
Juan Guillermo Tornoe , 38 , an advertising executive in Austin , had an MBA and top newspaper marketing position in Guatemala before moving to the USA in 2002 .
" I am 100 % sure that the upward mobility of Hispanics will continue , " he says .
" I 've seen it in my work .
I 've seen it in the data .
I 've seen it in my own family . "
A cousin who arrived 20 years ago has a good job , nice clothes and a nearly paid - off home .
" She would be lower - middle class in Guatemala , " he says .
" Here , she lives a tranquil , prosperous life . "
Jeff Barham , 33 , who works in human resources in Sterling Heights , Mich . , feels confident about his future .
His college debt is paid off , his employer paid for him to get a master 's degree , and his wife is a schoolteacher .
But he worries whether his generation has enough discipline and opportunity to equal his parents ' economic success .
" I have friends with every new gadget out there , " he says .
" They have a big house , two cars , college loans .
I have no idea how they 're making it on their incomes . "
LIONS : AFRICA'S MAGNIFICENT PREDATORS [ 8.1.07 ]
Photo Essay By Nathan Myhrvold
lion cubs bloody
[ Click on photos to enlarge ]
One of the focal points , if you pardon the pun , of my recent trip to Botswana was lions , Africa 's magnificent predators .
WARNING : some of the photos are a bit gory , and one shows explicit lion sex .
Lions are the only truly social cat , living in groups called prides .
A pride is a set of females , often but not always sisters , along with their cubs and subadult cubs .
There are also one or more males , usually a coalition of two brothers , but sometimes unrelated lions .
Lionesses are the backbone of the pride — they stay together for many years .
Males tend to come and go — the typical time frame for them dominating a pride is just 3 to 4 years .
Upon reaching adulthood female cubs may stay with the pride .
Males never do — they disperse and become nomadic , looking for a pride where they can challenge the dominant male and take over .
lion roaring
lion carrying impala
Male lions really look the part of the " king of beasts " .
Their lives are full of violence , exploitation and sex — in other words just like human royalty through much of history .
Male lions sleep an average 20 hours per day .
The females on the other hand do all of the really hard work — killing the majority of prey , which the males then appropriate for themselves .
The main danger males face is fighting off other males that want to take over their pride and territory .
This is serious business ; most male lions die in such fights .
In between territory fights they are bad tempered and terrorize the females in their pride .
In short , they have the lifestyle of pimps .
silver eye
lioness evil eye
lioness with wounded eye
Females , on the other hand are sleek efficient hunters .
They must kill most of the prey , which is very dangerous work .
I saw three lionesses that had each lost an eye .
One , which the guides call Silver Eye is the most aggressive hunter in her pride .
In another area we saw a lioness dubbed " Evil Eye " who had a similar but much more recent eye problem .
The eye was still swollen , giving her a demonic look , a bit like villains in Japanese Anime .
I also saw a lioness which had lost her eye in the last couple days — the socket was still oozing blood .
Each of the lionesses had lost their right eye , which suggests to me that lions might be right handed — technically this is called laterality .
Presumably right favoring lions would approach prey preferentially from the right , leading to more right side injuries .
Of course , a sample size of three is too small to make a firm conclusion .
lion stalking
One of the places I visited is Duba Plains , an island in the Okavango Delta of Botswana .
The island has a herd of about 600 Cape buffalo , and a pride of ten lions .
Both the buffalo and the lion got there about a decade ago in a year when crossing channels was possible — since then both have pretty much been trapped on the island .
For reasons nobody fully understands , the Duba lions only hunt during daylight — the reverse of the situation in most parts of Africa .
So you go to Duba to see one thing — lions hunting killing buffalo .
I spent five days doing this , and it was quite an experience .
ioness watching herd
Anybody who has seen a documentary " knows " that lions hunt cooperatively to bring down prey .
Unfortunately , nobody seems to have told the lions this .
Indeed , for many years field biologists who study lions have realized that cooperative hunting is an illusion .
The naturalist George Shaller figured this out in the late 1960s with the first quantitative field study .
He found that a single lion has a success rate of 15 % on a given hunt — or about one successful hunt for every seven .
Two lions have a success of 29 % , which is 3 % LESS successful than if the two lions with 15 % individual success hunted by themselves ( 32.2 % ) .
Three lions get 27 % , or 2 % less than two lions .
Four , five and six lions get 32 % - meaning that they are ( finally ) as successful as sending two lions out by themselves .
There is clearly no statistical value to hunting in groups .
More recent studies by Craig Packer and others have looked at higher order statistics — the variance , or the size of the animal .
It all comes out the same way .
If indeed lions hunt in some cooperative and strategic way , then they get no benefit from it statistically .
So , how come the Discovery Channel says they are cooperative ?
Partly it is because these figures are buried in Appendix B of Shaller 's book , or in dense academic papers .
Mostly it is because the story of cooperative strategy in hunting is so endearing to people .
Especially to film editors , which means we are destined to seeing cooperation in every nature documentary .
The cases where the hunting fails due to lack of cooperation end up on the cutting room floor .
Watching lions hunt , the trends are quite obvious .
The primary reason that groups of lions are no more effective than two by themselves is that typically only two lions do the actual hunting .
They all make a show of hunting , but in the cases I watched , in several different prides , there were always a couple females that were the most aggressive and took the lead .
The others hang back for the hard part then rush up at the end after the worst danger is over .
Their primary goal is to be at the kill early so they can eat , not to actually help .
Field studies have confirmed that lions do not seem to keep track of this and punish slackers .
Lions can seem quite inept at hunting , because they have no way to communicate complicated information .
The Discovery Channel case happens when one lion flushes prey in past another for a perfect catch .
More often , what happens is than one lion blows it and scares the game too early , or flushes it in the opposite direction .
After watching hunt after hunt fail , you soon decide that Iions are not very coordinated .
Indeed their only saving grace is that the buffalo can't communicate very well either .
buffalo charging lions
Buffalo are quite impressive animals .
They are very brave and will not hesitate to attack lions when they can .
When one buffalo has been knocked down by lions , the buffalo herd will almost always attempt a rescue — charging in to drive the lions away .
This succeeds a large fraction of the time — even if the buffalo has been down for 30 minutes .
Of course if the buffalo herd surrounded the lions when they were sleeping and just methodically trampled them to death , their whole problem would be over , but there is no buffalo general to lead them in such an endeavor .
Alternatively , if the buffalo had a bit more skill at rounding up the herd , they 'd never leave some separated which is what the lions look for .
lioness in shadow
Even a buffalo separated from the herd has reasonable chances .
At one point we saw a lone bull that was trying to get back to the herd , which was about a half mile away .
In between him and the herd were four lionesses , sacked out asleep .
This looked like the perfect opportunity for a kill , but the buffalo surprised both us and the lions .
He crept up on the sleeping lions , then when he got close he lowered his horns and charged .
The lions awoke , panicked and scattered into the bushes .
The buffalo then trotted victorious back to the pride .
It was a perfect illustration of the adage that the best defense is a good offense .
lioness running
lions bringing down buffalo
In order to catch a buffalo a lion must jump on the buffalo's back , and do to that they need to get past the horns .
It 's the same problem that a Spanish matador faces in bullfighting .
The matador has a huge advantage however — his cape distracts the bull who tries to gore the center of the cape , allowing the matador to slip by .
Lions do n't have capes , and as a result they cannot approach a buffalo from the front — they must jump on the back from the side or behind .
Once on the back , the lion hangs on for dear life , a bit like a cowboy riding a bull .
The goal is to get the buffalo to stumble .
If there is more than one lion hunting this is the point when they will start to pile on .
lion nose biting buffalo
lion bringing down buffalo
Often the buffalo just shrugs the lions off , and that is that .
However if the buffalo falls down , things get much more serious .
Some cats kill instantly with a bite that dislocates cervical vertebrae , severing the spinal cord — for example , cougars in the US .
This is not the case for lions , they are stranglers or suffocators .
They either bite the underside of the neck to collapse the trachea .
Or they put their entire mouth over the prey animal 's nose .
Either way it is a relatively slow suffocation that kills the animal .
This can take 30 minutes , or even an hour for a buffalo because they can't get enough pressure on the huge buffalo neck to close it all the way , or can't get a good seal on the nose .
This is not the quick merciful picture that one sees in nature documentaries .
If the buffalo gets up during that period he or she may get away with only some minor mauling .
lion kill with elephants
At one of the kills a small herd of elephant came in to investigate .
They clearly were thinking about rescuing the buffalo — they trumpeted and the herd matriarch ripped a tree of out the ground to impress the lions .
It certainly impressed me !
The lions were clearly concerned , and if they had been attacking an elephant calf they would have been in trouble .
After a tense showdown the elephants decided it was n't their fight and walked away .
lion male on buffalo
Lions do n't wait to kill the animal before starting the process of eating it — as soon as the buffalo stops thrashing , lions start to eat .
This is much harder than it sounds however , because the hide is very thick .
The prime spot to start is always claimed by the dominant female , or if the male is there , he takes the prime spot .
The prime spot is not what you might thing — it is the rectum .
Believe it or not , the king of beasts starts his dinner by carefully licking the rectum clean .
Since the buffalo defecates while dying this is a bit messy .
The lion then works very hard to gnaw through the skin and get an incision open .
lion male stalking
I was describing this to a friend over lunch in Palo Alto .
As I was describing this the waiter came up behind me to take our order .
I was in the middle of saying " it 's very hard to enter the rectum , but once you do things move much faster " , only to hear the waiter gasp .
Whoops .
I tried to explain saying " well , this is about " but with a horrified look he said " I do NOT want to know what this is about !
Some people are just not interested in natural history , I guess .
lions eating buffalo 1 hour after kill
Once the carcass is opened the lions settle down to eat .
This is punctuated by each lion growling , hissing and sometimes snapping at the lions around it .
Lions are not polite eaters — they grab as much as they can for themselves in a pretty direct competition with the other lions .
Usually one of the pride males shows up and when he does the females give it him a very berth — he can attack or maim them at any moment .
If they want to eat close to him they approach carefully and try to mollify him with some social greeting and flirting .
Cubs are usually a bit more tolerated by the male , but even they risk pushing too far .
Cubs are quite enthusiastic eaters and seem to love a carcrass .
Some enterprising cubs actually crawl inside the carcass and eat it from the inside out , leaving them drenched in blood afterward .
buffalo after 24 hours
Within a few hours the carcass has most of the meat gone , and within a day there is almost nothing left of even a large bull buffalo .
Jackals , vultures and other scavengers move in for the scraps , but if there is a good sized pride of lions there is n't that much for them .
If hyena are in the area then they will come and eat the bones , cracking them with specially adapted teeth to get the marrow and collagen from the bone .
Lion social life is very rich and complicated .
In human terms it is very easy to see them as affectionate , because as social animals we share the practice of greetings with physical contact .
We hug .
They rub noses .
These similarities make it easy to understand what is going on — or perhaps misunderstand because the translation from lion to human is not 100 % .
lion sex
Lion sex is interesting to watch , but I fear that admission may tell you more about me than about them .
So here is why it is interesting .
many mammals , including humans , have regular estrus cycles , but lions have a different system .
After cubs are weaned the female becomes interested in sex again and flirts outrageously with the male , wrapping her tail around his head and other things that are pretty unmistakable , even to a human observer .
The happy couple then starts having sex - over and over and over again .
Lions are stimulated ovulators ; the female does not ovulate until she is stimulated to do so by lots of sex .
As a result lions will mate roughly every 15 to 20 minutes for two or three days — 200 to 300 times in succession .
During that period they are inseparable and will not hunt or eat .
They still need to drink but this is a bit problematic because if the male goes to drink then another male may sneak in .
The regularity of the mating process is great for a photographer , because lion sex is over very fast .
Although they surely win the prize for the number of repetitions , each time only takes a minute or so .
You have to be all ready to get a good picture .
lion male
Lions are very compelling subjects to watch .
This is especially true in Botswana where you are in open land rovers , often just a few feet away from them .
When a wild lion , its face smeared with blood , is only a few feet away from you it is hard to keep your eyes of it — just like it is hard to avoid watching an open flame dance in a campfire .
It 's more than just the visual spectacle — there is something very ancient about our relationship to lions , a fascination with the dark side of nature .
Or perhaps it is that we are both humans and lions are crown predators .
Humans are one of the few creatures that lions fear , and they are of the few things we fear .
Lions are magnificent animals — they can be cruel , brutal and gory , but they 're also beautiful and fascinating .
A bit like people , I suppose .

This pattern of immunity for presidents must stop .
Impeaching George Bush for lying to get us into war will not only protect us from him , but also send an unmistakable message to future presidents :
Never again .
Elizabeth Holtzman , former Congresswoman in the forward to : Constitution in Crisis by Congressman John Conyers , Jr. and Staff
I was recently given an award by the Cranbrook Peace Institute and the ceremonies were held in Detroit , the hometown of Rep. John Conyers .
I was pretty surprised that he agreed to introduce me at the event considering that the last time I saw him I was being hauled out of his office in DC in handcuffs and I have been very outspoken about the Democrats failure to hold BushCo accountable .
I must give the Congressman a lot of credit to always show up to events where he knows he is going to be harassed about impeachment and he gave me a nice introduction reading part of my testimony in Congress regarding the Downing Street Minutes that Rep.
Conyers conducted in a cramped room in the basement of Congress on June 16 , 2005 .
In the intro he called me the “ mother of the modern peace movement . ”
John Conyers and I have had a cordial relationship that goes back to that June day when we believed that we were taking profound first steps in peacefully and lawfully overthrowing the Bush crime regime .
Rep .
Conyers wrote the intro to my first book : Not One More Mother ’s Child ; I am mentioned in his brilliant analysis of the reasons to impeach BushCo and I was with him at the People ’s State of the Union in 2006 just hours before I was arrested at the War Pig State of the Union address for wearing a t - shirt .
Whenever I am in DC , I just have to call his office and he always makes time to see me .
His commitment to our country is decades long : from being a veteran of the military and Civil Right ’s campaigns to serving in Congress for over 40 years .
He is on the right track by seeking universal , single payer health care .
He has been correct on so many issues that progressives hold dear and that ’s why it is so puzzling to me and the so many others in the progressive community why he will not institute impeachment proceedings for the criminals who are only getting worse since Conyers wrote the book on impeachment , not better .
It ’s not as if BushCo has found a new propensity to follow the law and as a matter of fact , the 110th Congress has made a habit of legitimizing and legalizing the crimes .
A brief recount of the reasons Conyers lists for impeachment in his book is : Deception ( lies that led to war ) , manipulation ( of intelligence and the tragic events of 9 - 11 ) , torture ( our new AG is not so sure about torture ) , retribution ( against “ enemies ” i.e. : Valerie Plame and Bunnatine Greenhouse : Halliburton whistleblower ) , illegal surveillance ( which Congress recently approved ) and cover-ups .
All of the charges are brilliantly documented and proved by John Conyers ’ brilliant staff , that has also inexplicably become anti-impeachment along with most of the rest of the failed and failing 110th Congress .
At the peace events in Detroit , I also had the high honor of holding a dialogue with young peace and social justice activists in the Detroit area .
A young Hispanic girl had the floor and she recounted the feeling of hopelessness that she and her peers were feeling about the future .
She cried when she said : “ We feel like we have no future . ”
If BushCo are allowed to continue their crimes against peace , humanity , civil rights , basic human rights and the environment , unchecked , then the young lady may be tragically correct in her analysis .
The Democratic leadership has made a mockery of our Constitution by excising “ awkward ” parts out of it .
For example , by invoking “ Title X ” ( Contempt of Congress ) which is a harsher punishment against protesters that leads to harsher penalties , such as being banished from Capital Hill for a determined amount of time , they have killed the pesky First Amendment Rights to free speech and peaceable assembly .
By confirming Michael Mukasey for Attorney General and approving the Military Commissions Act , Congress has stripped away our Eighth Amendment protections against cruel and unusual punishment .
By suspending habeas corpus we are denied our Sixth Amendment rights to fair and speedy trials and to confront our accusers with an attorney present .
Congress has also abrogated its Constitutionally mandated role of declaring war to a bloodthirsty Executive Branch and have invalidated Article II ; Section 4 which states that a President and Vice - President “ shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of , Treason , Bribery , or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors . ”
We must not let Congress off the hook by allowing them to let BushCo off the hook .
We are collecting handwritten letters to Speaker Pelosi to deliver to her office demanding that Resolution ( H Res 799 introduced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich ) to impeach the cruel and callous puppet master , Dick Cheney , be given the attention and resources that are needed to go forward with an indictment in the house and a trial in the Senate on the crimes outlined by the Resolution .
We already have a couple thousand and we will deliver them to the Speaker when we reach 10,000 .
Let ’s flood her office with letters as if she is Santa and we want impeachment on our Christmas table .
We need to leave the young people of the world with hope that rule of law will be restored in the US and that future presidents will know that their hands are at least restrained by two co-equal branches when it comes to invading countries contrary to international law , US law , and basic human dignity .

Technology Entrepreneurship : 4 Signs You Have What It Takes to Become a Tech Entrepreneur
Believe it or not , there are more than 27 million entrepreneurs running their own businesses in the U.S .
And they all started from the ground up .
While many have gone on to develop successful brands and launch incredible products , they did it because they had the right mindset .
That ’s right … not everyone has what it takes to succeed in technology entrepreneurship .
So , how can you tell if you do ?
Here are a few of the most important characteristics every successful tech entrepreneur has .
1. You ’re Passionate About What You Do
Working with established products is easy .
They ’re handed to you with an easy - to - explain list of benefits and a target customer already chosen .
But with technology entrepreneurship , you ’re starting from scratch .
This means you need to have an intense passion for what you ’re doing .
Without that passion , you ’ll find it hard to grow the brand .
Remember , customers and investors can tell the difference between a business owner that loves what they do and someone who ’s in it for the money .
And who will they back ?
They ’ll go with the passionate entrepreneur every time .
2 . You ’re Not Afraid to Take the Lead … On Everything
You ’re the driving force of your brand .
And when you ’re first starting out , you ’ll probably be the only employee .
This means you ’re the CEO , the CFO , the dedicated marketing expert , and production specialist .
You have to oversee everything on a daily basis .
If you ’re not comfortable taking the lead or prefer to have someone tell you what to do , being an entrepreneur will be incredibly hard .
But if you thrive running your own show and love to take the lead , you have what it takes to succeed .
3. Criticism Makes You More Determined
With any new product or service , you ’ll face harsh criticism .
If you have a thin skin , those complaints , negative reviews , and rejections will sting .
But a true tech entrepreneur uses that feedback to improve .
They take the messages to heart , but they do n’t take them personally .
If criticism makes you feel more determined than ever to get it right , you ’re on the right track .
4 . You ’re Willing to Put In the Work
It ’s a common misconception that technology entrepreneurs are free to relax all day .
People think they travel the world and make money without being on the clock .
But this is far from the truth .
Entrepreneurship takes a lot of hard work and long hours .
You ’re responsible for everything from designing the product to finding investors .
And those tasks take time .
It ’s often more than a full - time job .
You should be willing to eat , sleep , and breathe your business during the startup phase .
If you ’re willing to put in the work and hustle to get things done , you ’ll be able to make it happen .
But remember , it will mean some long days and missed days off , but it ’ll pay off in the end .
Should You Give Technology Entrepreneurship a Try ?
If you ’re driven , determined , and passionate about what you do , technology entrepreneurship might be right up your alley .
But get ready to put in a lot of work to make it successful .
You need to be more than just a business owner .
You need to be the driving force behind the entire operation .
So , where do you start ?

I thought it'd be fun to dig up my first ever Haskell project from about 2 years ago .
I wrote a little about part of it before but I did n't write about what I did with it .
Apologies for some of the formatting , I have n't yet got around to updating every line of this code .
But it definitely still works .
( As usual with old code , I had to fix it in places .
How is it that old code ceases to work ?
Is there some kind of bit rot that sets in if you leave code unused for more than a couple of years ? )
And as usual , this post is written in literate Haskell so you can just run it interacively in ghci .
The idea here was to define a little DSL in Haskell for counting the size of a variety of combinatorial objects .
Rather than start with the theory , I 'm going to look at some examples in action first .
The idea is that I 'll be considering different ways to structure the set { 1,2 , ..., n} ( with n=0 meaning the empty set ) .
Let 's start with the simplest example : the singleton set with one element .
I 'll denote this by the symbol .
Consider how many ways we can structure the set { 1,2 , ..., n} as a one element set .
It 's pretty obvious that you can only structure this set as a one element set if it has one element .
So if we useto count the number of ways of doing things , we expectandfor n equal to anything else .
In fact , let 's defineI have n't told you what valuehas , just how it responds to the count function .
You can now try evaluating Now consider the next function in our DSL , gives the number of ways to form a list of 's from { 1 , ..., n} .
A good example is simplyie .
the number of ways to form a list of n http://sigfpe.blogspot.com/elements.
For example , for n=3 we have [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 1,3,2 ] , [ 2,1,3 ] , [ 2,3,1 ] , [ 3, 1,2 ] , [ 3,2,1 ] .
Obviouslyis n!.
Many of the examples I 'm going to look at are listed in Sloane 's famous encyclopedia of integer sequences .
n! is listed as A000142 Next considerwhich is the number of ways of forming an ordered pair of .
For example , the pairs of lists from { 1,2,3} are ( [ ] , [ 1,2,3 ] ) , ( [ 1 ] , [ 2,3 ] ) , ( [ 2 ] , [ 1,3 ] ) , ( [ 3 ] , [ 1,2 ] ) , ( [ 1,2 ] , [3 ] ) and so on .
With a little work you should count 24 of those .
This is given byConversely we can consider lists of pairs .
Clearly this is zero for n odd .
For n=4 we get terms like [ ( 1,2 ) , ( 3,4 ) ] , [ ( 1,3 ) , ( 2,4 ) ] and so on .
Again there are 24 .
The code is : This DSL also supports constraints .
For example we can redo the pair of lists example with the proviso that the lists are both non-empty :
More generally theoperator can provide any numerical constraint .
For example : Gives the ways of forming pairs of lists of length > =3 .
Clearly this is zero for n < 6 and for n=6 we just get 6 !
At this point I need to point out that these examples all run petty quickly so we 're not simply generating and counting .
The next function is .
A ring is like a list except that cyclic permutations are considered equal .
So [ 1,2,3 ] , [ 2,3,1 ] and [ 3,1,2 ] are the same ring .
How many rings are there on { 1,2 , ..., n} ?
If you evaluateyou may recognise that it 's simply ( n - 1 ) !.
The next useful function iscounts the number of sets of 's you can form from { 1 , ..., n} .
Clearlyis 1 as there 's only one set you can form from { 1 , ..., n} .
So here 's a nice example :
That 's counting the ways of forming { 1 , ..., n} into sets of non-empty rings .
If you applyyou may spot that we have n! again .
There 's a really neat explanation why .
Every permutation of { 1 , ..., n} is a product of disjoint cycles .
The order of the product does n't matter so we have a set ( rather than a list ) of disjoint cycles .
A cycle is obviously non-empty and cycles are just rings .
Socounts permutations .
And the number of permutations on { 1 , ..., n} is n!.
Here 's an old classic ( A000110 ) : This is the number of ways of partitioning { 1 , ..., n} into sets of non-empty sets .
For n=3 we get {{1,2,3}} , {{1} , {2,3}} , {{2} , {1,3}} , {{3} , {1,2}} and { {1} , {2} , {3}} .
In other words , 5 . Another useful function ismeans forming { 1 , ..., n} into either anor aFor example we can count the ways to split a set into a set of singletons and pairs .
For n=3 we have { 1 , ( 2,3 ) } , {2 , ( 1,3 ) } , {3 , ( 1,2 ) } , the previous three with the pair flipped and { 1,2,3} , in other wordsis 7 :
By the way , that 's Sloane 's A047974
Now some more examples just for fun : Partitions into lists of size > = 2 . ( Sloane 's A052845 ) : Partitions into lists of cycles ( Sloane 's A007840 ) : Partitions into an even number of non-empty sets ( Sloane 's A020557 ) : Partitions into sets of non-empty sets of non-empty sets ( Sloane 's A000258 ) : Thirteen examples is enough for anyone .
So how does it work ?
I have n't time to give a crash course on generating functions but I can at least sketch the idea .
In particular , exponential generating functions .
The idea is this : if I have a sequence a , a , a , ... then its exponential generating function is :
So we can represent any sequence of integers as a power series .
For some sequences this series does n't converge .
But that 's not a problem .
We can still formally manipulate the series as long as we do n't try to substitute an actual real number for z .
So we call these formal power series .
The amazing fact is this : the sorts of operations we might perform on power series when performing ordinary arithmetic ( adding hem , multiplying them , finding their logarithms and so on ) turn out to be exactly the kind of operations you would perform on them to solve combinatorial problems .
So many combinatorial problems can be reduced to finding power series for various arithmetical combinations of other power series .
So now we need some code to manipulate power series .
This is such a popular Haskell example that I 'll breeze through the code and give some links to other people 's documentation .
I represent power series simply as a list of coefficients .
When computing with formal power series we frequently require products of the form ( a+a*t+a*t+... )*0
We know the result is zero no matter what the ai are and by immediately returning zero we can eliminate bottomless recursions .
We use the operator *! for this purpose .
!* is the symmetric counterpart of *!
We represent formal power series over an algebraic structure a as infinite list of type a .
Addition and subtraction are straightforward pointwise applications of addition and subtraction in R.Multiplication itself is achieved through the operation of convolution :
If f( z ) and g(z ) are two power series , this computes f( g ( z ) ) : Note how that function fails if the series for g starts with anything other than zero .
A few of my operations will be like that .
They correspond to situations where the operation does n't make sense on a power series ( at least no without some additional structure or assumptions ) .
The ( functional ) inverse of a function : Reciprocal of power series : Division of power series is defined in terms of invert though there is probably a direct definition that is as simple .
Note the special case handling of power series that both start with zero :
Here comes the definition ofthat we 've been using : z = [ 0,1,0,0 , ...] in other words the generator of formal power series .
one = [ 1,0,0 , ... ] , ie .
the multiplicative unit.d computes the derivative of formal power series usingd ( t^n ) = n*t ^( n - 1 ) Integration is simply the inverse of differentiation .
We assume the integral has a zero leading term .
Compute the square of a formal power series :
We apply transcendental functions to formal power series by finding suitable integro-differential representations of the function .
For exp consider : d / dt exp ( f( t ) ) = f'(t ) * exp ( f( t ) ) We can immediately writeexp ( f( t ) ) = integral f'(t ) * ex p ( f( t ) ) This gives a recursive definition of the exponential of a power series .d/ dt log ( f ( t ) ) = f'(t ) / f(t ) which gives the following definition :
We give mutually recursive definitions for sine and cosine :
The inverse trignometric functions are similarly straightforward except for the inverse cosine .
The inverse cosine at zero is transcendental and so might not exist in R .
On the other hand there is no power series for acos ( 1+x ) .
So we can give no formal power series for this function .
The hyperbolic trigonometric functions are similar to the ordinary trigonometric functions.t is the generator of the formal power series .
t' is the generator for formal power series over the rationals .
The ... operator is used to specify a formal power series with known leading terms .
If l is a list of n elements then the first n elements of l ... f are given by the elements of l .
The remaining terms are those of l .
And now we can get back to combinatorics .
The definitions of the functions I gave above are stunningly simple :
How does that work ?
Just about any book on combinatorics will tell you .
I quite like Generatingfunctionology though it does make a mountain out of a molehill in places .
is the number of ways of splitting the set { 1 , ..., n} into two so that one half is a combinatorial structure given by a and the other half is given by b .
It 's definition is amazingly simple :
Now for some more examples .
A tree is , by definition , a single parent node and a set of child trees .
So we have the recursive definition : The [ 0 ] ... is to get the recursion started .
Tryto count the number of trees .
The last example is neat .is the exponential generating function of the number of ways of making a graph from { 1 , ..., n} . ( A006125 ) It 's not too hard to see what 's going on : a graph on a set S is given by a set of edges .
In other words it 's a subset of the set of unordered pairs of elements of S .
If S has size n , there are n( n - 1 ) / 2 such pairs.exp has a really amazing property .
If f is the expnential power series corresponding to counting some structure , say F , on { 1 , ..., n} then exp ( f ) is the power series of the structure consisting of the union of a bunch of non-zero sized F's .
We can put this into practice : all graphs can be decomposed as the union of connected graphs .
So the generating function of connected graphs is given by ( The 1 + is because of the non-zero I just mentioned . )
That was Sloane 's A001187
By the way , this plays a big role in quantum field theory where we have to enumerate Feynman diagrams Anyway , if you did n't previously know about generating functions I hope this whets your appetite to read up on them some more .
They are an almost magical part of mathematics that makes the solution of some very difficult seeming combinatorial problems almost trivial .
They also have countless real world applications ranging from statistics to digital signal processing .

Mukesh Ambani becomes the world 's richest man
October 29 , 2007 19:35 IST
Last Updated : October 29 , 2007 19:55 IST
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani on Monday became the richest person in the world , surpassing American software czar Bill Gates , Mexican business tycoon Carlos Slim Helu and famous investment guru Warren Buffett , courtesy the bull run in the stock market .
Following a strong share price rally today in his three group companies - India 's most valued firm Reliance Industries [ Get Quote ] , Reliance Petroleum [ Get Quote ] and Reliance Industrial Infrastructure Ltd [ Get Quote ] - the net worth of Mukesh Ambani rose to $ 63.2 billion ( Rs 2,49,108 crore ) .
In comparison , the net worth of both Gates and Slim is estimated to be slightly lower at around $ 62.29 billion each , with Slim leading among the two by a narrow margin .
Warren Buffett , earlier the third richest in the world , also dropped one position with a net worth of about $ 56 billion .
Ambani's wealth of about Rs 2,49,000 crore ( Rs 2.49 trillion ) includes about Rs 2,10,000 crore ( Rs 2,10 trillion ) from RIL ( 50.98 per cent stake ) , Rs 37,500 crore ( Rs 375 billion ) from RPL ( 37.5 per cent ) and Rs 2,100 crore ( Rs 21 billion ) from RIIL ( 46.23 per cent ) .
Slim 's wealth has been calculated on the basis of his stake in companies like America Movil ( 30 per cent ) , Carso Global ( 82 per cent ) , Grupo Carso ( 75 per cent ) , Inbursa ( 67 per cent ) , IDEAL ( 30 per cent ) and Saks Inc ( 10 per cent ) .
According to information available with the US and Mexican stock exchanges where these companies are listed , Slim currently holds shares worth a total of $ 62.2993 billion , with more than half coming from Latin American mobile major America Movil .
Slim is closely followed by Gates with a net worth of $ 62.29 billion currently .
Earlier last month , US business magazine Forbes had named Gates as the richest American with a net worth of $ 59 billion , calculated as on August 30 .
The magazine had said that a movement of two dollars in the share price for
Microsoft , the world 's biggest software maker , could " add or subtract a billion dollars " from his wealth .
Since August - end , Microsoft 's share price has risen by $ 6.58 ( based on yesterday 's closing on Nasdaq at $ 35.03 ) , which results into a gain of $ 3.29 billion in Gates ' wealth based on Forbes assumption .
Besides a stake in Microsoft , Gates ' wealth also includes the commission and license fees earned by him and gains through his shares in an investment holding company that invests across the market .
Gates is followed by Buffett at the fourth place in the league of the world 's richest with a net worth of $ 55.9 billion through his holding in his investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway and in other companies .
At the end of August , Buffett 's wealth stood at $ 52 billion , as per the Forbes magazine .
Berkshire Hathaway 's share price has gained by about 7.5 per cent since then .
Earlier on September 26 , Ambani had overtaken steel czar Lakshmi Mittal to become the richest Indian in the world .
Mittal currently ranks as the fifth richest in the world with a net worth of $ 50.9 billion through his 44.79 per cent stake in world 's biggest steel maker ArcelorMittal .
YouTube said it is working with the government to beat bullying
Delegates at the conference of the Professional Association of Teachers ( PAT ) said bullying can continue outside school and work hours .
They said bullies can send abusive text messages or e-mails to victims .
A spokesman for the website YouTube said the vast majority of people used the site responsibly .
At the PAT annual conference in Harrogate , delegates heard that bullies have posted mobile phone videos on websites , showing teachers as well as pupils being attacked or humiliated .
Nobody should be subjected to such humiliation anywhere , let alone in their place of work
Catriona Tait
Teacher
They backed a motion demanding that such websites be closed down .
It was proposed by Kirsti Paterson , from the PAT 's Highland and Western Isles Federation , who said one teacher had been the subject of a death threat which was posted online .
She said a pupil posted a doctored picture of the teacher , headless , with the caption ' You are dead ' .
She added : " In the short term , confronting this problem must be the closure of sites encouraging cyberbullying . "
Catriona
Tait , a newly qualified primary teacher from Dundee , said one in four pupils had experienced online and text bullying at some time .
She said : " Not only are the children and young adults in our care subjected to such torment , it would now appear that members of the profession are becoming victims of cyber - bullying .
' Important issues '
" Nobody should be subjected to such humiliation anywhere , let alone in their place of work . "
A spokesman for the website YouTube said : " YouTube is a community site used by millions of people in very positive ways .
" It 's also used by organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth to reach people on a range of important issues .
" Sadly as with any form of communication , there is a tiny minority of people who try to break the rules . "
He said YouTube had joined the UK government 's bullying task force , working closely with teachers unions and others .
It seems to be easier to type something hateful to a school friend rather than say it to their face
Emma-Jane Cross , Beatbullying
Emma -Jane Cross , chief executive of the charity Beatbullying , rejected the idea of closing down websites .
She said : " Calls for social networking sites like YouTube to be closed because of cyberbullying are as intelligent as calls for schools to be closed because of bullying .
" Cyberbullying is flourishing for two reasons .
First , society is not adequately preventing bullying behaviour .
Instead we celebrate it on television programmes .
" And secondly , it seems to be easier to type something hateful to a school friend rather than say it to their face . "
A spokesman for the Scottish Executive said : " Bullying of any kind is unacceptable .
The executive is committed to supporting schools , authorities and communities to prevent and tackle bullying whenever and wherever it occurs .
" As part of this support , we fund Scotland 's anti-bullying service Respectme , which offers specific advice to parents and teachers on cyberbullying . "
This letter was sent today by the entire Democratic leadership of the US Senate .
This letter is such a major shot across the bow of Disney , it 's not even funny .
It is FILLED with veiled threats , both legal and legislative , against Disney .
US
Senators do n't make threats like this , especially the entire Democratic leadership en masse , unless they mean it .
Disney is in serious trouble .
Read it , then read my analysis of it below :
the manner in which this program has been developed , funded , and advertised suggests a partisan bent
We therefore urge you to cancel this broadcast to cease Disney ’s plans to use it as a teaching tool in schools across America through Scholastic
trustee
Despite claims by your network ’s representatives that The Path to 9/11 is based on the report of the 9/11 Commission , 9/11 Commissioners themselves , as well as other experts on the issues , disagree .
That Disney would seek to broadcast an admittedly and proven false recounting of the events of 9/11 raises serious questions about the motivations of its creators and those who approved the deeply flawed program .
Finally , that Disney plans to air commercial - free a program that reportedly cost it $ 40 million to produce serves to add fuel to these concerns .
Frankly , that ABC and Disney would consider airing a program that could be construed as right - wing political propaganda on such a grave and important event involving the security of our nation is a discredit both to the Disney brand and to the legacy of honesty built at ABC by honorable individuals from David Brinkley to Peter Jennings .
trust
We urge you , after full consideration of the facts , to uphold your responsibilities as a respected member of American society and as a beneficiary of the free use of the public airwaves to cancel this factually inaccurate and deeply misguided program
It seems you owe your brains to your parents .
Inherited variations in two genes are linked with reasoning , memory and brain volume .
One of the genes is also involved in Alzheimer ’s disease , which raises the possibility that other genes with a role in healthy people may also be implicated in diseases of old age .
Sudha Seshadri at Boston University and colleagues assessed the cognitive abilities of 705 healthy adults with standard tests and used MRI scans to measure the volume of their brains .
The researchers also scanned 100,000 single - nucleotide polymorphisms – small variations in the genome sequence – in participants ’
DNA for links to mental performance .
The strongest links were in the genes SORL , involved in abstract reasoning and the processing of amyloid protein in Alzheimer ’s disease , and CDH4 , which seems to predict brain volume .
“ A number of these genes have a role throughout life , perhaps in determining brain volume or the degree of age - related decline , ” Seshadri said at an American Academy of Neurology meeting in Boston on 2 May .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - U.S. physicians who identify themselves as religious are no more likely to care for poor , underserved patients than those who have no religious affiliation , researchers have found .
The study suggests doctors in the United States who see religion as a “ master motive in their lives ” are not more likely to care for the poor than others .
“ Religious physicians are not disproportionately caring for the underserved , ” Dr. Farr Curlin , of the University of Chicago , said in a telephone interview on Monday .
Curlin , who considers himself religious , said he undertook the study because many religions include a call to serve the poor .
“ I was curious about whether doctors who are more formed in their religious beliefs are more likely to take care of patients who are poor , ” said Curlin , whose study appears in the Annals of Family Medicine .
He and colleagues at Yale New Haven Hospital in Connecticut mailed surveys to 1,820 practicing doctors .
Of those , 63 percent responded .
The researchers ranked “ intrinsic religiosity ” according to how physicians answered questions about the role of religion as a motive in their lives .
Physicians also answered questions about how frequently they attended religious services , the extent they considered themselves to be spiritual , and whether they believed the practice of medicine was a calling .
What they found was physicians who were deemed more religious as reflected by intrinsic religiosity or frequency of attendance of religious services were not more likely to report caring for underserved patient populations -- those that tended to be poor , uninsured or on Medicaid , the federal program for the poor .
“ It suggests , I think , that when doctors are making the connection between being people of faith and the practice of medicine , that connection does not seem to lead them ... to an added commitment to caring for the underserved , ” Curlin said .
Hi Folks ,
That makes a lot of sense , looking at the root from the outside .
Any other rootkit attempts generate concerns .
They tend to have to work on a low - level on your system , and the less low - level manipulation you have ( even if in a " good cause " ) the more stable your system .
Also the small group of Russian anti-rootkit technophiles seem to be at war with one another , reading the history of the field does not give me confidence .
I wonder how many of these guys might be " highest bidder " oriented , Microsoft affiliates one month , Thin Line Associates the next .
I like the occasional external view thing , probably using whatever is available in UBCD4 .
And if more is needed there , letting UBCD4 know .
Shalom ,
Steven
For religious reasons , Islamic mutual funds shun nearly half of the stocks in the market , yet they still are among the top- performing U.S. funds .
With Annual Growth rate of 15 % and more in the recent years , the Islamic banking and Investment Industry ranks as one of the faster growing segments of the world ’s financial services industry .
Estimates of the total value of assets managed according to Shari ’a - compliant principles range as high as $ 750 billion , in other words Islamic finance is now a worldwide phenomenon .
The Islamic funds market has developed at a slower pace , but its potential is clearly huge .
There are now more than 400 Islamic funds – four times the number at the turn of the century .
On the whole , the performance of Equity funds has been positive .
Studies have shown that excluding financials , defense , tobacco , alcohol , leisure and entertainment stocks – as these funds must do if they are to remain Shari ’a compliant – is no big disadvantage .
The range of asset classes has mushroomed ; a few hedge funds have also been launched .
The pace of product innovation has picked up in recent years ; there are now a number of multi manager products on the market .
Unit linked savings and retirement plans began to emerge few years ago , but the market is expanding fast and as many as 39 Banks have applied to distribute insurance in Saudi Arabia alone .

The growth in this market has attracted many of the leading names .
The likes of AXA , Allianz , AIG , Aviva to name a few have are already offering financial products in a number of markets .
As in any upcoming venture there are hurdles to overcome .
One is lack of uniform regulation and there are no rules for certifying financial planners and investment advisers in the region .
In a study produced earlier this year by the Islamic Research and Training Institute , the Islamic Development Bank and the Islamic Financial Services Board has predicted that more than half of all financial services delivered within the Gulf Cooperation Council will be Shari ’a compliant by the year 2015 .
Given estimates that suggest Islamic finance products are currently reaching only 10 % of their potential target market , a considerable expansion looks justified .
Local administration officials have called in thousands of staff on their day off in an attempt to engineer a massive and inflated victory for President Vladimir Putin and his United Russia party .
Voters are being pressured to vote for United Russia or risk losing their jobs , their accommodation or bonuses , the Guardian has been told in numerous interviews with byudzhetniki ( public sector workers ) , students and ordinary citizens .
Doctors , teachers , university deans , students and even workers at psychiatric clinics have been warned they have to vote .
Failure to do so will entail serious consequences , they have been told .
Analysts say the pressure is designed to ensure a resounding win for the United Russia party and for Putin , who heads its party list .
The victory would give him a public mandate to maintain ultimate power in the country as " National Leader " despite being unable to stand for a third term as president in March .
In a televised speech yesterday Putin implored the nation to turn out and vote for United Russia , saying : " I count on your support . "
The president enjoys genuine popular backing but a spokeswoman for Golos , an independent organisation monitoring the elections , said " big pressure on voters across the country " was being used to balloon the result for United Russia .
" We are seeing a new phenomenon where voters are forced to get absentee ballots under threat of being sacked or being denied bonuses , " she said .
" People are then instructed to vote at their workplace where everything is tightly controlled . "
The spokesman said the pressure applied to private businesses as well as state - run enterprises .
Students have been told they risk the prospect of failing exams or being removed from courses if they do not vote for United Russia .
Alexander , a journalism student at Oryol State University , said : " It 's been made very clear that students who do n't get absentee ballots and vote the right way could lose their place in the dormitory . "
Anna , 31 , a schoolteacher in Ulan Ude , said : " We were called to the staff room in my school about a month ago and asked to sign a formal declaration promising that we would vote for United Russia .
I told them that I wanted to vote for another party , but they told me to sign it in such a manner that there was no way to refuse .
They hinted I could lose my job . "
A librarian in Buryatia region said she had been promised a premium on her salary if she voted for United Russia .
The Kremlin insists Sunday 's elections will be free and fair , despite inviting only 400 international observers to monitor the poll , which is taking place in 95,784 polling stations across the world 's biggest country .
This month the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe 's office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) cancelled its mission to Russia after Moscow refused to give its experts visas .
Asked whether the Kremlin was planning to manipulate Sunday 's election Vladimir Churov , the head of Russia 's central election commission , told the Guardian : " They will be the most free , most transparent , and most suitable elections for citizens . "
However , while state television has made no mention of electoral violations , websites and independent newspapers outside state control are seething with reports of attempts to pressure voters to turn out for United Russia .
Bloggers on Russia 's most popular social networking site , Livejournal , have posted numerous accounts of intimidation .
One in Murmansk wrote that he was told that if he did n't vote for United Russia " the management would get it in the neck " .
Another in Yekaterinburg wrote : " Today my wife came home in shock .
As the boss of a state company she has been told that all her workers living in different parts of town must take absentee ballots and go to vote in Kirovsky district .
She has to go and sit all day on December 2 and call round everyone in her collective .
Then she has to provide a list of who has voted . "
She then received a directive warning her to add anybody who did n't vote for United Russia to a list , and later those people would be " called to the office " of the local administration .
The Kremlin has cast Sunday 's State Duma vote as a referendum on Putin .
Although Putin is obliged to step down as president next May , a landslide victory may be used to legitimise his return to power , possibly as early as the summer .
The president 's personal popularity remains high .
But support for United Russia is less solid .
Independent experts say the party 's true ratings are around 35 % - well below the 55 % figure suggested by state - controlled opinion polls .
In a leak to Russian media this week , one senior election official said that regional governors had been told to deliver at least 65 % of the vote for Putin 's party , an " unrealistically high " total that could be achieved only through electoral fraud and by compelling people to vote .
" The elections are going to be falsified , " said Mikhail Delyagin , an economist and the director of Moscow 's Institute on Globalisation Problems .
" The elections that took place in the Soviet Union were less falsified than this one . "
He added : " All those who depend on state salaries have been forced to go and vote .
This means workers on all levels of state power working for local government , all the military , and those who are in prison or psychiatric hospitals .
Of course people have the possibility to lie .
But there is enormous psychological pressure . "
Regional election workers would also stuff ballot boxes - as they had done on previous occasions - boosting United Russia 's vote by about 20 % , he estimated .
These results could be refined still further by using the election commission 's central computer .
" You can falsify as much as you want .
But the result must be truthful - looking , " he said .
Putin 's decision to associate himself with United Russia 's election campaign - and to stand as a candidate at the top of the party 's federal list - has contributed to the scale of the fraud , analysts said .
" The scale of pressure is due to nervousness within the Kremlin administration since it announced that this is no longer a parliamentary election but a referendum on Putin , " Fyodor Lukyanov , editor - in - chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs , said .
Lukyanov said he believed the amount of fraud on polling day would be small .
" This is normal in contemporary advanced authoritarian systems .
They are smart enough to organise the vote in quite a proper and correct way , " he said .
Coercing people in advance was a more effective tactic , he added .
" The consequences [ of not voting for Putin ] are not perhaps as bad as they promise .
But there is psychological pressure , of course .
I had thought Russian authoritarianism was much softer .
We will see . "
The squeeze on public sector workers follows numerous rule changes by the Kremlin to Russia 's electoral system .
Under a new law , all parties need 7 % of the vote to enter parliament - up from 5 % last time .
Additionally , several democratic opposition parties have been banned from taking part .
The Kremlin has also abolished constituency voting - in effect wiping out the last critics from the current Duma .
It has also scrapped minimum turnout .
Critics allege that United Russia has received disproportionate media coverage on state - controlled TV while opposition figures have been blacklisted .
Putin 's speech at a US - style election rally in Moscow last week , in which he denounced Russia 's opposition as " jackals " , got 16 minutes on the main evening news .
" These elections are a farce , " said Vladimir Ryzhkov , an independent MP banned from standing .
The Kremlin liquidated his Republican party earlier this year , claiming it did n't have enough voters .
" I call it a Kremlin biathlon .
In a normal biathlon the sportsmen shoot at targets , but in the Kremlin biathlon , not only do the sportsmen shoot at their targets , but the judges shoot at the sportsmen , " Ryzhkov said .
" Half of Russia 's politicians can't run .
It 's selection before election . "
Yesterday the central election commission dismissed suggestions that public sector workers had been told they had to vote .
Churov told the Guardian he regarded the allegation as a " provocation " put about by the opposition .
" This is just propaganda , " he said .
He also claimed it was " not possible " to manipulate results stored in the commission 's central computer , nicknamed Elections .
Voters could find out the result at their individual polling station by dialling 5503 on their mobile phones , he said .
It was n't Russia 's fault that the OSCE had cancelled its mission , he added .
" I was waiting for the head of the ODIHR in Moscow .
But instead he flew off to Washington , " Churov complained .
Kremlin aides openly acknowledge that their aim is to push smaller parties out of parliament .
" We have moved towards the purification of the legislature , " said Putin 's deputy spokesman , Dmitry Peskov .

Bogus FEMA ' reporters ' promoted despite role in fake press conference Jason Rhyne
Published : Friday November 30 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Two FEMA public relations staffers who posed as reporters during a staged news conference about the California wildfires last month no longer have their jobs -- but only because the disaster management agency has promoted them to better ones .
Despite their participation in the bogus presser , FEMA 's former deputy director of public affairs , Cindy Taylor , and another employee , Mike Widomski , are both receiving the promotions they were earlier promised , Washington Post columnist Al Kamen reports .
" On Oct. 23 , the day of FEMA 's now infamous phony news conference , the agency 's former external affairs chief , Pat Philbin , announced plans to promote a number of people in the shop as part of an effort to build a ' new FEMA , ' " writes Kamen , who originally broke the news about the fake press event .
Kamen cites an email from Philbin stating that Taylor was to be tapped to head the organization 's Private Sector Office , and Widomski would be bumped up to assume Taylor 's former position .
" After our item , and an investigation of what Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff called ' one of the dumbest and most inappropriate things I 've seen since I 've been in government , ' " Kamen reports , " we 're happy to announce that Taylor and Widomski appear to have been disciplined , FEMA - style .
They 've received the promotions they were in line to get . "
According to the current External Affairs Weekly report , he says , the two employees are both listed as holding their new jobs -- Taylor as director of the Public Sector Division , and Widomski as deputy director of public affairs .
" Heck of a job , " Kamen concludes .
FEMA had originally instructed its own public relations staff to pose as reporters when no legitimate members of the media arrived in time for a hastily arranged briefing .
" We had been getting mobbed with phone calls from reporters , and this was thrown together at the last minute , " Widomski told the Post at the time .
Philbin , who orchestrated the event , had also been in line for a promotion -- as head of the PR office at the Department of National Intelligence -- but was later denied the job after news of his role in the embarrassing incident broke .
Earlier this week , RAW STORY reported on another press conference controversy .
In 2006 , Julie Myers , the head of the Department of Homeland Security 's Immigration and Customs Enforcement division , took a question from a spokeswoman for that agency who was posing as a reporter .
Myers is currently under scrutiny for awarding a prize to a white employee who wore dark makeup and a prison uniform at an ICE Halloween party .
You might think “ Zero Tolerance ” is a playground issue — just a way for school administrators to deal with violent kids .
If you did , you would be wrong .
ZT is a mindset of black - and - white rules applied to a gray world .
“ We tolerate no disobedience on the topic of [ fill in the blank ] . ”
Thus , a “ no guns ” policy meant to keep firearms off school grounds ( a laudable goal ) gets applied to “ squirt guns ” ( a silly result ) — or even crude crayon drawings of guns ( a ridiculous result ) .
Since these rules are “ black and white , ” that means the punishment is the same : suspension and expulsion .
So in the name of keeping firearms away from schoolchildren , kids are being kicked out of school for drawing pictures — treated the same as a kid who brings a real loaded gun to class .
Outrageous !
The “ punishment ” should fit the “ crime ” — the actual crime .
And kids getting tossed out of school for silly , innocent , childish behavior happens again and again and again .
For just some of the examples reported on in This is True , see my main Zero Tolerance essay .
And the concept is spreading outside the school setting and into the adult world , as the following story from True ’s 26 August 2001 issue demonstrates :
Rule Of Law Detrick Washington , 25 , was at his business partner ’s San Francisco , Calif. , home office when two men forced their way in .
The robbers got $ 3,000 from the safe , but figured there must be more and beat and cut their victims to get them to talk .
“ I ’ll go and kill the kids and that girl if you do n’t give me the rest of the money , ” one of the robbers said .
While they ransacked the home , Washington saw his chance : one robber put his gun down , and Washington grabbed it .
When the robber lunged at him , Washington shot him .
He then handed the gun to his partner to cover the other robber and went to call police .
“ Stay down !
Do n’t move !
Do n’t get up ! ” his friend told the second robber after Washington left the room .
Then Washington heard , “ He ’s getting up , he ’s getting up ! ” and a shot rang out — the second robber was killed too .
“ He took a chance .
I believe we could call him a hero , ” police Inspector Armand Gordon said .
Washington “ basically saved five people ’s lives , including his own ” by grabbing the gun .
Police ruled the shooting justified , yet Washington is in jail : he is on parole from a previous drug conviction , and parole rules say parolees cannot “ possess ” a firearm .
Because Washington grabbed the robber ’s gun , he was in “ possession ” of the weapon and violated his parole .
( San Francisco Chronicle ) … And here you thought “ zero tolerance ” was only for school kids .
Update : the San Francisco Chronicle reported six days later : “ At the time , agents said Washington could be held at San Francisco County Jail for six business days while they reviewed the case , meaning he would have been behind bars until [ Wednesday ] .
Instead , they quietly let him go Friday , after The Chronicle reported he had been jailed . ”
Yep , that ’s a bit hard to calculate — the paper does n’t actually say how long Mr. Washington was in jail for saving several lives .
As near as I can tell , however , it was two days .
No doubt he would have been there much longer if the media had n’t highlighted his outrageous arrest by state parole officers .
Most people readily made the connection — why this was a “ zero tolerance ” story , rather than just an ordinary outrage .
A reader letter — and my response — will help clarify it for you , from Tim in Pennsylvania :
Obviously , we ’re not talking “ zero tolerance ; ” we ’re talking stupidity and narrow - mindedness .
It is truly frightening to consider the number of small - minded , undereducated people who have power over us .
Our schools , our judicial system , businesses , all are rife with these petty power - grabbers who either are incapable of thinking , or are scared to death of it .
This is the type of person who made up , with such enthusiasm and abandon , the SS and the Gestapo ; fortunately , this modern version is too stupid to organize .
What we need , in “ expose ” articles such as this , are the names of the bugwitted individuals responsible .
A little ( direct ) publicity might do wonders .
Tim , you just described Zero Tolerance exactly !
Stupidity ; narrow - mindedness ; scared of thinking for themselves .
That is the ZT mindset !
And unfortunately , they do organize — all to support each other that they ’re “ doing the right thing ” even in the face of evidence that they ’re causing more harm than good .
And as this story shows , we ’re seeing it expand from school bureaucrats into larger society .
ZT is idiocy .
It ’s a lack of judgement in favor of “ following the rules ” even when the rules do n’t make any sense !
Suspending a 6 - year - old child under a ZT “ anti- drug policy ” when he gives candy to friends on the playground makes no sense ( even if the teachers did initially think the candy was cough drops ) , and defending that action when they learned it was n’t cough drops is an outrage .
( Yes , that did happen : see my ZT essay ! )
Similarly , arresting a parolee for “ possessing ” a gun that he wrestled away from a robber so he is n’t killed is ridiculous when investigators all agree that he had to do it to save many lives .
It ’s the exact same mindset , and if reasonable , thinking people do n’t object strongly to it and demand a common sense approach replace it , ZT will continue to spread for the reasons I outlined long ago in my essay .
A Reader Letter on the Story shows that such thinking is not just a bureaucratic thing , and not just a U.S. thing , but rather something that ’s creeping into everyday consciousness ( although some readers think this is more a reflection of political differences between the U.S. and the U.K. ) .
Jay in England writes :
I do not think that Detrick Washington ’s arrest was entirely unjustified .
I respect and admire him for being willing to kill to save the lives of those he cared for .
For risking his own life to save lives .
But at the end of the day , the robbers were killed .
I am not in a position to say if one person ’s life is more or less important than another ’s , except for what we * feel * personally .
That is , without a doubt we value the lives of those we care about higher than those of strangers , or in this case armed robbers and would - be murderers .
However , I do n’t think that it is possible for anybody to ever give up their right to life , no matter what they do .
Put in the same position I would like to think that I would have done exactly what Washington did , but I also like to think that I would not expect to escape punishment .
It is a difficult situation .
Certainly Washington made the right decision — it was a true dilemma for him when both outcomes carried negative repercussions — but I still think that we can not leave killing unpunished .
I do think that it was ridiculous Washington was jailed for parole violation , because he technically was ‘ in posession ’ of a gun , however I do think that killing robbers would also count as parole violation .
No matter how much worse the alternative was — and it would surely be a greater crime to stand by and let innocent people die when it can be avoided — I do think that there needs to be * some form * of punishment .
He saved many lives , and for this he should be rewarded — however I do n’t think it should be ignored that in doing so he took a life .
Under no circumstances do I believe we should ever just let it pass when someone takes a life .
I know that was n’t the point of the piece , but I felt the need to comment and hope I have n’t made myself sound stupid .
I do n’t think Jay is stupid , but man do I think he is misguided !
Punishment is for people who do wrong , either by doing something they know they should n’t have been doing , or ( to some lesser extent ) by their own negligence .
These were robbers who chose to do wrong .
They clearly would not have hesitated to kill their victims — just as they threatened .
Washington just did n’t grab a gun and start shooting , he grabbed their gun and told them to stop .
They did n’t stop : they tried to grab the gun back to continue their crime , so they were shot .
The only people who did something “ wrong ” here , in my opinion , were the robbers .
They got their “ punishment ” ; Washington deserves no punishment if in fact the situation went down as described ( and , to make it clear , the police are satisfied it did happen that way ) .
People who , as Jay said , “ do the right thing ” do n’t deserve punishment !
Even after thinking about it more — and reading my reply to his letter —
Jay did n’t change his mind .
He replied :
You make a good point .
I think we ’ll agree to disagree on whether it is possible to give up your right to life unwillingly .
Yes , Detrick Washington was more than justified in killing to protect himself and his family — this I do not dispute — but I do not think that there should be differences in murder .
But I will not convince you of my case , and I doubt if I would admit it if you convinced me .
Huh ?
No matter what evidence you ’re shown that your argument is wrong , you would n’t admit it if you changed your mind ?!
Admitting you ’re wrong is the first step toward getting it right , Jay .
No one is right all the time .
Several
True readers had plenty to say to Jay in the Comments .
My Conclusion
OK , let ’s cut to the bottom line here : is this story really “ about ” whether or not a parolee was justified in killing a robber ?
No .
To me , it ’s about supposed professionals not using common sense , discretion and reason in doing their jobs , but rather officials with control over other people ’s lives applying rote “ rules ” to situations that do n’t require them ; it is , at its heart , an example of silly schoolyard “ zero tolerance ” expanding into the “ real world ” — not a good trend .
None of us want kids taking guns to school .
None of us want people robbing us at gunpoint .
But neither do I want kids to be treated like criminals because they shared candy at school .
I do n’t want men who save innocent lives to be thrown in jail .
To paraphrase Benjamin Franklin , giving up our rights to marginally increase our security means we deserve neither .
( And , as I discussed in my ZT essay , ZT does not actually increase security ! )
Would you want someone who saved your family from being murdered to be tossed in jail ?
I do n’t .
But if people are “ punished ” for “ doing the right thing , ” they ’ll learn to walk away and do nothing .
We have — plenty of times — heard of people who “ do n’t want to get involved , ” and that attitude is to the detriment of our society .
I want people to “ get involved ” if they see me or my family being held at gunpoint !
Do n’t you ?
Thus , if society starts pressuring us to move in that direction , common sense demands that we speak out against it .
It ’s self destructive .
It ’s uncivilized .
It ’s irrational .
It is wrong .
2010 Update
When this story was featured on its 10 - year anniversary , not a lot had changed when it comes to zero tolerance graduating from schools into the real world .
But I heard back from Jay in England !
He writes :
I do n’t want to discuss the story again , thankfully , but I would like you to know that I wish to distance myself from the comments made by my 20 - year - old self in 2001 .
I was an idiot .
I really really wish I had n’t read the whole thing again again this morning , including the comments .
While there are no doubt intelligent debates to be had somewhere , some other time , in a more suitable forum , about issues such as gun control and capital punishment and everything else , the story was not about these things .
Nor did I did enter any intelligent comments — my comments were just plain stupid and failed to grasp the point .
I just wanted to tell you what I should have said at the time : what was I thinking , of course I was wrong , my comments were stupid .
Although I would like people to distinguish between stupid comments and comments made by a stupid person .
I appreciate that you were kind enough to see me as misguided .
As we ’ve seen over the years , many people I argue with stomp away mad , unsubscribing in protest .
A select few — the brave ones — stay on , continue to read , and ( most importantly ) start to think about their positions .
With this note , Jay has justified my faith in him .
He proved the important difference between “ stupid comments and comments made by a stupid person . ”
This is not to say I ’m always right , of course ; sometimes I ’m the one to rethink things and admit , in public , I was wrong .
( Example . )
Growth happens , and follow - up letters like this help me know it ’s worth it to spend the energy to get people to think .
Thanks ,
Jay !

The chart above is from an article in today's
Detroit News
, illustrating how one Detroit homeowner got into foreclosure trouble : Ethel Cochran refinanced her home 7 different times within a ten - year period at adjustable rates , pulling out more and more equity each time .
30 - year fixed - rate mortgages were available in 1987 for about 10 % , which would mean that Ethel 's original monthly house payment was only about $ 83 ( principal and interest ) , and her mortgage balance today would be less than $ 6,000 with only ten years left to pay off the mortgage .
Now she has a $ 116,000 mortgage that she can't pay , and is being evicted from her house .
What happened to the old - fashioned idea of making payments on your original mortgage , paying it off and having a " mortgage burning party ? "
There 's a perception that it was first - time howeowners who got in trouble with subprime adjustable - rate mortgages , but this story suggests that there were also many existing homeowners who also got in trouble with multiple refinancings , and have probably contributed to the current subprime mortgage crisis .

I do n't get how Microsoft continues to be a Linux distributor after they convey all the vouchers to a 3rd party .
For example , let 's say they sold ( or gave away ) all the vouchers to Dell .
Would n't that constitute the end of Microsoft 's distribution ?

This is interesting but it will only apply to software licensed under the GPL
v3 . The linux kernel is specifically licensed under the GPL v2 , and it will be
very difficult to get * everybody * to agree to going to v3 .
On the other hand , if
this turns out to be true , then it may add more pressure for the kernel
maintainers to at least try to go to v3 .

Surely the critical date is not the date that GPL v3 goes into effect , but the
date on which Novell starts distributing a version of SuSE that includes GPLv3
software .
As long as Novell can keep distributing under v2 , nothing they or Microsoft does
kicks in any v3 terms .
( Although the v3 kicks in with _any_ GPLv3 software
that 's part of the SuSE distro . )
Do the certificates have a ( Suse ) version number ? [ Reply to This | # ]

I wonder if M$ tricked Dell into paying money for those vouchers , or if they were just given away in a frenzied effort by M$ to disassociate themselves from them .
I guess we will never know for sure , but M$ seems to have really shot themselves in the foot .
Much better than anyone else could have , anyway .

I 'm confused .
Let 's assume that someone turns in a voucher for Suse after the date v3 goes into effect .
At that point , all of the software on it has the " v2 or any later version " language in the license .
Therefore , Novell can say it 's distributing under the terms of v2 , which does n't make Microsoft a distributor .
If Suse subsequently contains a single application that explicitly uses the v3 only license , does n't that only mean that users / distributors of that particular package can't be sued ?
So if some other package ( allegedly ) violates a patent , MS can still sue over that , right ?
ca n't be sued ?
So if some other package ( allegedly ) violates a patent , MS can still sue over that , right ?
I do n't understand how MS could be sued under the GPL v3 anyway .
How does their procuring distribution for the code make them a party to the license ?
Suppose I procure distribution of something that violates a copyright - why does that make me a copyright violator ?
I guess I do n't see how this provision of the GPL v3 works ... [ Reply to This | # ]

Get your tin-foil hats , I think there might be a fork risk .
What if , in this contract with Microsoft , Novell agreed not to release any
software under GPLv3 ?
What if Novell agreed to fork the code at the point where GPL v3 takes hold and
begin their own in - house development under GPLv2 .
Novell certainly has the know - how , money and man-power to do it , and with Dell
in bed with MS , they can probably lock them up with Novell 's own forked version
of GPL software .
What about SAMBA ?
Novell stated they got access to protocols from Microsoft as
part of the deal .
Novell also has Miguel de Icaza who probably knows enough
about MS to continue the development of SAMBA .
What about OpenOffice ?
There would be enough in the package that they did n't
have to ship OOo personally , they could simply have Dell do that , or point the
user to OOo if they wanted it .

I 'm sure MS will claim they are not distributing Linux by giving out Novell's
vouchers .
And as for an end to patent agression , my guess is that when Linux is
covered by GPLv3 , Microsoft will find another twist and keep attacking .
Maybe
they will sue RedHat or another distributor whom has refused to enter into the
patent agreement .
The FUD ladies and gentlemen is only going to get worse as

I assume these terms are secret ?
Depending on the terms of their agreement , Novell may in fact be barred from
distributing anything under GPLv3 - regardless of GPLv3 itself permitting them
to distribute , they may be contractually prevented from doing so by their
agreement with Microsoft .
This would be very unfortunate indeed , as the community would win nothing , and
Microsoft would have achieved one of the outcomes it was probably banking on -
one of the major Linux distributors , and possibly the one with the most
corporate cred , will wither into insignificance .
The reason for their demise
will doubtless be spun as the machinations of evil bearded copyright communists ,
and Linux in general could be viewed by suits as a radioactive hazard .
Also , please remind me - I seem to recall that the patent language in GPLv3 was
added as a reaction to Novell 's deal - meaning that it can't be argued that
Novell would have seen this one coming when they signed the deal .
Is that
correct ?
And finally , a possible escape clause - it 's playing silly word games , but seems
to me it might work .
Does anyone know the exact wording of the MS vouchers ?
If
they are for " SuSE Linux Enterprise Server " , and Novell re-brands
future versions of their distro to " SuSE Datacentre - Grade Linux " or
something silly , and only releases GPLv3 software under the newly branded
distro , might that give Microsoft some wiggle room ? [ Reply to This | # ]

What if GPLv3 " comes into effect " in the sense that FSF
gives its approval , but Novell never releases any software
subject to GPLv3 ?
Remember all the the current GPLed
softwhere files have beginning comments that say :
/* project --: C++ frontend for glade ( Gtk+ User Interface
Builder )
* Copyright ( C ) 1998 someone
*
* This program is free software ; you can redistribute it
and / or modify
* it under the terms of the GNU General Public License

and / or modify
* it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by
* the Free Software Foundation ; either version 2 of the
License , or
* ( at your option ) any later version .
The " any later version . " allows someone to re-release
gplv2 code under gplv3 when it comes out .
Some projects
like the Linux kernel do not have this clause in their
headers , which would make it vary difficult for those
projects to goto gplv3 .
In any case their is no requirement that anyone re-release
their code under gplv3 .
All the code out their under GPL
version 2 , does not loose its protection magickly when FSF
puts its stamp of approval on GPL v3 .
Everyone can
continue to use the old GPL v2 code under GPL v2 .
There is
nothing in the GPL v2 that prevents this .
What might happen is that projects like gcc , bash , or
glibc , might re-release the old code with new beginning
comments that say :
* project --: C++ frontend for glade ( Gtk+ User Interface
Builder )
* Copyright ( C ) 1998 someone
*
* This program is free software ; you can redistribute it
and / or modify
* it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by
* the Free Software Foundation ; either version 3 of the
License , or
* ( at your option ) any later version .
If you use this newly released files with the new comments
then you would be stuck with GPLv3 .
But there is nothing that requires Novell to use this new
code !
They could continue using the old code with the old
comments .
Indeed , if they need new features , they could
fork this old code as needed keeping the old v2 comments .
Novell could continue indefinitely into the future this
way .
Indeed , if Novell can not escape the MS - Novell deal ,
this would be the only option for Novell .
Otherwise they
would be a GPL v3 infringer .
If this were to happen , MS
would not become subject to GPLv3 , because of the
certificates , because Novell would not be distributing any
code subject to GPLv3 .
There is another possibility , remember that parts of the
MS - Novell deal are still secret .
Suppose new software
comes out under gplv3 that Novell wants to include in it's
distro .
Suppose the new software is new versions of gcc ,
bash , and glib .
Novell says to MS : " We are activating the
secret escape in the MS - Novell deal .
You may now sue our
customers with respect to any patents you may have in our
gcc , bash , and glib packages .
And by the way , we still
do n't believe that you have any such binding patents ! "
If there is such an escape clause and Novell activated it ,
Novell could put the new gcc , bash , and glib , into it 's
distro .
If there is no such escape clause then Novell's
Lawyers should be shot !
If this were to happen where would
MS stand ?
Would MS then be subject to the GPLv3 as
a " conveyor " ? [ Reply to This | # ]

It 's interesting to take a look specifically at the packages Microsoft says
infringe their patents , and what licenses those packages are distributed under .
Of course , we can't be too specific , because Microsoft wan't .
They mentioned
two specific packages , Linux aka the Linux kernel , and openoffice .
Other
categories were " graphical user interfaces " by which I suppose they
mean kde and / or gnome , " email " which might include thunderbird ,
evolution , and who knows maybe others .
And then there 's " other open
source " which we can't do much with .
I believe gnome , kde , and evolution will go GPLv3 .
( I checked all of 1 kde
source file , and it had the " or later version " line ; gnome and
evolution seem to be GNU products . )
We know Linux kernel probably wo n't , as has been overdiscussed here before .
Openoffice is LGPL ; I dunno if Sun has announced any plans to change this .
Thunderbird is MPL .
So it 's kind of a mixed bag , stuff that probably will go GPLv3 , stuff that
probably wo n't , and stuff that is n't GPL at all .

It seems Microsoft is giving away its patent portfolio to FOSS in more ways than

My first reaction was this is too good to be true .
There must be a catch
somewhere .
Then a thought occurred to me .
How long is the service contract
provided by the coupons ?
Does it include upgrades and patches ?
What if Novell
distributes GPL3 software as an upgrade during the term of the service
contract ?
If Novell wants to , it could be that Microsoft would end up distributing GPL3
software to the _current_ coupons recipient .
No need to wait until a sleeping
coupon pops up like a jack in a box .
This is a golden opportunity for Novell to undo the damage and return into the
good grace of the community .

I have not seen the actual text of the vouchers , but I would expect them to read
something along the lines of " This voucher entitles you to download and run
1 copy of ' Suse Linux Enterprise Server ( SLES ) ' on a single machine and use
Novell Support for this for x years " .
All Novell needs to do is come out with a new package called , say , " SLES
PLUS " ( or " SLES NT " or " SLES XP " ;-) as soon as they
need to update the GNU - Tools to GPL - V3 .
They will then happily ship you a version of the old " SLES " under
GPL - V2 if you turn in your voucher and provide minor bug - fixes for some time .
I do not believe , or dare to hope , Microsoft lawyers would fall for a trap like
this so easily .

According to the section of GPL3 you quoted : " the patent license you grant
is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based
on it " , could n't it be argued that you are granting the license to everyone
you personally distributed the covered work to , and no one else ?
In other words ,
the recipients of the Microsoft coupon are covered by the patent agreement , and
that 's pretty much it .
Yes , works derived on it are also covered , but is it
necessary to prove in court who the father is ?
IANAL and everything .
Just asking a question of my betters .
And maybe this
possibility is covered in language elsewhere in the GPL3 .

If Novell only supplies copies of Suse 10.2 for the coupons , does that trigger

Just as before , Microsoft can file lawsuits or hire friends like SCO to file lawsuits against whomever they do n't like .
This development adds just another to the already long list of reasons why such lawsuits would be bogus .
As SCO proved , it matters not at all how bogus the claims are .
The most bogus IP lawsuit in the world has been demonstrated to cost many years and many tens of millions of dollars to defend against by even the most powerful companies well versed in IP law ( IBM ) .
It proved you do n't need patents or even copyrights to kill any small to mid sized business .
My guess is that Microsoft 's patent war will be as strong as ever even if it never sees a courtroom .
Microsoft will just take execs out to lunch and say " See how much little SCO hurt IBM .
We 've got 280 times as many patents than SCO had " and execs will fold without even giving it a second thought .

I 'd be interested in seeing exactly what Moglen said , but the way it 's being
interpreted here does n't make sense .
The gist of the argument is that Microsoft will be held to the terms of a new
license after the fact of its distribution .
Aside from the fact that I can 't
( as a non-lawyer , admittedly ) see any court holding someone to the terms of a
license imposed after the fact , we really would n't want to set a precedent for
that .
For one , it would surely be used against us ; in addition , it would ensure
that nobody would ever want to touch the GPL again ( that really would make it
viral -- or perhaps retroviral would be a better term : you 're being held
retroactively to changes that you never agreed to ) .
Basically , Microsoft
purportedly faces unlimited liability for changes after the fact .
Microsoft would surely argue that even if what it did counted as distribution
under the GPL , the act of distribution occurred when it distributed the
vouchers .
But not every act of distribution requires a license to begin with :
if you have a legal copy of something , you 're always allowed ( at least in the
US , to the best of my knowledge ) allowed to sell that copy -- you just can 't
make any more copies and sell them without permission .
So Microsoft might
simply argue that it was giving away existing legal copies , and the GPL applied
only to Novell , not to Microsoft .
And whether or not the GPL uses the word
" convey " , it has never purported to impose restrictions beyond those
already imposed by copyright law , so they 'd argue the language is irrelevant --
they never accepted the GPL in the first place , and are only doing what they
would otherwise be allowed to do under copyright law .
Or they 'd simply refuse
to honor the vouchers , or ask Novell to buy them back , or flat out refuse to
grant the patent license , or whatnot .
But the real consideration has to be , is this the right thing to do , and would
we want to live in a legal system that allowed a result like this to happen :
would any of us be happy if the shoe were on the other foot .

As the FSF is fond of saying , the GPL is a license not a contract .
This applies to GPLv2 and GPLv3 .
Both versions allow one to do things that would be otherwise illegal under copyright law .
Name one thing , that MS is doing with respect to Novell that requires a license under copyright law !
Distributing coupons ?
Show me the provision of copyright law that says you need a license to distribute coupons !
So assume , MS does not comply with GLP v 2 or 3 and therefore does not have a license .
Just what does MS need a license for ?

This is unlikely to fly in the form it's in at the moment for several reasons :
1 . It depends on exactly what the voucher says .
If it 's a voucher for Suse 10
then that does n't include any GPL3 software .
2 . If you can put stuff into a license like this , and expect it to be upheld ,
then I can put into a a license that your firstborn child belongs to me and
reasonably expect that I 'll get a pile of firstborns delivered real soon .
Think about it this way , if you give your friend some money to buy a Linux CD
for another friend , then according to the language of this clause , you are can
be bound by the license of the software .
But you have n't handled the software ,
so how can you be bound by the license ?
Microsoft are n't doing any distribution ,
so they can hardly be bound by a license that is relevant to distribution .
What might work is if the license only allowed your friend your friend to give
it to the other friend if you too agreed to the license .
[ Yes , I 've added this
to the GPL3 comments . ]
3 . If MS gives away all the vouchers before GPL3 , it 's unreasonable for them to
be bound by GPL3 .
That 's retrospective activation .
4 . If you use the GPL2 with a clause allowing someone to distribute under GPL2
or later license , you can't reasonably be subjecting yourself to GPL3 if they
choose to distribute under GPL3 .
That 's activation working it's way backwards
through licensees !
And what 's more , in this case it 's jumping to people who
are n't even licensees .
It would be breathtaking if this were upheld .
4. Even if Microsoft are retrospectively governed by GPL3 , the patent clauses
only cover the patents used those exact bits of software distributed .
So all in all , this is just very wishful thinking .

Is it just me , or is MS becoming more and more amateurish and incompetent ?
Not
putting an expiry date on a coupon is just plain stoopit !
But I must share this with you guys : a few weeks ago the MS roadshow visited our
campus to address the students .
It was the typical smoke - and - mirrors fluff --
unfortunately for them , our students are hard - core techies who saw through it
straight away .
At the end of the presentation the MS guy announced with wide
eyes that ..... [ drum roll ] ....
a FREE COPY OF VISTA FOR THE FIRST STUDENT TO
SHOUT !
He was met with a total silence , and then the students simply got up and
walked out .
You should have seen the look on their faces .
Needless to say , all us greybeard tutors were rolling on the floor laughing .
It
was one of the best days of my life .
And before the MS fanbois start their sniping , let me just add that more than
half of these students participated in the Vista Beta testing program .
Their
reactions were n't because of any indoctrination , but from bitter experience .
Needless to say that they all do one paper in Linux in 2nd year ....... :-)
But the difference between our students , who get a good education in IT and NOT
in a particular vendor 's products , and the MS clowns was very visible .
The MS
people just came across as incompetent point - and - click monkeys and struggled to
answer some very basic questions .
Our students wiped the floor with them .

Steve Ballmer was reported today as saying that Microsoft will continue to fully support Open Sores SoftwareTM .
He went on to say that Microsoft had always included Open Sores SoftwareTM in their products and that unlike the GPL ; the Microsoft EULA guaranteed customer full closed access to Open Sores SoftwareTM .

I am guessing that when ms and novell were talking , ms managed to get an 'in
principle ' agreement .
When they got that , they rushed it through and missed bits , and this is the
result .
No one ever anywhere misses out expiry dates on coupons .
I would think it would be the first thing any legal counsel would think of at
the mention of redeemable coupons .
This is what you also get when a company gets so greedy , it takes its eyes

So GPL v3 comes out , and Microsoft distributes a copy of SUSE the next day .
Here 's what the GPL has to say : Each version is given a distinguishing version number .
If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and " any later version " , you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation .
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License , you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation .
At the VERY worst , Microsoft is prevented from distributing any software that is EXPLICITLY licensed under GPL v3 .
However , there is NO current software that fits this definition .
So this does n't really change anything .

Here is another way to turn Microsoft patent threats against itself ( I think ) .
Microsoft is still shipping Subsystem for UNIX - based Applications and has a download page for the associated Utilities and SDK .
The Utilities and SDK download includes gcc 3.3 .
If you download the Utilities and SDK you will notice that in the doc directory there is a copy of GPL v2 , prepended by a list of utilities which it applies to .
Now , what if any of the GPL v2 software in Subsystem for UNIX - based Applications or the Utilities and SDK downloads violated any Microsoft patents ?
The only rights which Microsoft have granted for use of this software are those conveyed by GPL v2 itself .
At the very least it may make it inconvenient for Microsoft to ever upgrade this software to GPLv3 .
There may also be implications even in the case of GPLv2 .
If none of this GPL v2 software violates Microsoft patents , then that is a win for GNU , since there are a fair few GNU utilities included , including gcc .
Worth investigating further , do n't you think ?

There seems to be a lot of ' front porch ' logic being applied to this situation , which , by mischaracterizing the GPL , purports to somehow disprove Eben Moglen 's assertions .
Since ' common sense is neither , ' and IANALJAGWAC ( I am not a lawyer , just a guy with a clue ) , here is the nutshell version :
The vouchers are for ' a GNU / Linux distribution '-- it does n't matter which one .
However , if the v3 license language is n't acceptable to Microsoft / Novell , then they will have to redeem it with an old or forked version ... Which , in MS - speak means : you get this copy of Windows 95 , while the world is on XP .
Your future prospects are extremely limited .
Do n't like the GPL ?
Fine , then do n't use GNU / Linux .

But there is no GPL3 , only a discussion draft .
And the Linux kernel will not be
covered by it .
Unfortunately , the stubbornness of the " Free " software movement in its
insistence in trying to regulate the uses of software ( ie no DRM / confiscating
digital keys ) has made GPL3 unpalatable .

Hello Bill and Steve .
I have a fine busniess plan .
You are going to like it , beacuse frankly , the idea
is just yours .
I know of a little shop in Costa Rica that , you know , has all these fine
products like Microsoft Windows XP , Microsoft Vista , Microsoft Office , Visual
Studio , Bizztalk and lots more available on purple - ish , shiny discs for $ 3 , - a
pop .
Now , what I am going to do , I am going to buy vouchers from these guys .
Next I
am going to open a little office somewhere in Miama and run a litle webshop on
which I sell these vouchers for $ 15 , - a pop .
Users that have bought my vouchers can mail them to Costa Rica and in rerurn
they get a fine purple - ish , shiny disc .
Ofcourse , the BSA and your army of laywers will never arrive at the doorsteps of
my Miama office , because , as you know , I am not distributing these discs , I am
just selling vouchers .
I am glad you nod ' ok ' .
Yep .
Picking up the phone to Costa Rico right now .
Al Capone .
P.S .
Oh , Bill and Steve , now that I think of it , the only reason your army of lawyers
could arrive at my doorstep is because you might have patented this idea .
Or
not , that 's always hard to tell with Microsoft 's Heisenberg patents .
P.S.2
Great Bill and Steve .. admire your recently developed business model .

Just imagine the following case :
Jane did not have a pencil so she asked John who only had a spare pen .
John
asked George who said that he would exchange a pencil for a pen and if someone
brought his pencil back he would give them a pen .
John took George 's pencil and
gave it to Jane who took it back to George when she had finished with it .
Meanwhile George had exchanged John 's pen with one from Mary who had hidden
drugs in it .
George gives the pen to Jane and John is charged with trafficking
in drugs .
John is black so he gets sent down for 25 years without parole .
But change John
for Microsoft with a huge team of lawyers , replace the drugs with GPL v3 code ,
George is Novell , Mary can be FSF or anyone releasing code under GPLv3 , Jane can
just be Jane .
The pencil and pen you can work out for yourself .
Now , seriously , is any court going to find Microsoft ' guilty ' of trafficking in
GPL v3 code ?

This argument seems completely unworkable to me .
Perhaps you can convince the
judge that distributing a voucher to receive a product from an other company
is equal to distributing the product , in some senses .
But it is still that
other company that distributes the product itself , and therefore licenses the
product to the recipient .
The software is simply not licensed from Microsoft ,
in any case .

It seems that folks are speaking as if , were Novell to distribute to a voucher
holder a version of SUSE Linux which contains but a single V3 GPL 'd application ,
then the V3 license terms come to be imposed on MS in general .
What I would
expect is that the V3 terms would apply to MS only with respect to any of their
patents which are infringed by that particular application .
Does not MS's
implied ' threat ' remain a matter of concern for the kernel and any other
applications which remain under V2 in anyone 's distribution ?

Does a voucher have to be re-deemed after the GPL3 comes into effect AND the
SUSE distribution at the time has software covered by the newer license ?
How does this redemption as a point - in - time event work with regards to updates
and patches to current SUSE installations given that current and proposed
licensing is ' timeless ' in contrast to the artificial short life - cycle of
patents ?

The clause says if there are patent agreements , you can't distribute without
giving patent agreements ( paraphrase ) .
When the GPL3 comes out , people are
thinking that will mean Microsoft will convey patent peace to Linux .

A little over three years after Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie , Scotland , Fred D. Thompson provided advice to a colleague about one of his law firm ’s new clients :
The man representing the two Libyan intelligence officials charged in the terrorist bombing .
The colleague , John Culver , a partner at the Washington firm of Arent Fox Kintner Plotkin & Kahn began advising the two suspects ’
Libyan lawyer in February 1992 .
Mr. Thompson , according to a memorandum from that era written by his secretary , held “ discussions with Culver re : Libya ” that same month .
At the time , Libya was facing international outrage for refusing to comply with a United Nations demand that the two suspects be extradited to the West for trial in the 1988 bombing , which killed 270 people .
Revelations that American firms were representing Libyan interests provoked a furor among the Pan Am victims ’ families .
Some law firms refused to represent the country or the suspects , while others withdrew .
The involvement of Mr. Thompson , who worked part - time for Arent Fox as a lawyer and lobbyist from 1991 until shortly before his election to the Senate in 1994 , never became public .
But Arent Fox ’s chairman , Marc L. Fleischaker , confirmed that Mr. Thompson , who is now seeking the Republican presidential nomination , briefly provided Mr. Culver with advice about the suspects ’ case , billing the firm for 3.3 hours of his time .

When asked about her position on impeachment , Nancy Pelosi responded , “ I ’ve always said impeachment ’s off the table .
This is President Bush ’s war , it ’s Vice President Cheney ’s war , and now it ’s become the war of the Republicans in congress . ”
Some might see her response as including a non sequitur .
What does insisting that Bush and the Republicans own an unjustified illegal war have to do with impeachment being off the table ?
However , for those of us who have been following the Democratic leadership ’s justifications for failing to hold this administration accountable , it makes perfect sense .
Pelosi and the Democratic leadership believes that by leaving Bush / Cheney in office , and by continuing ‘ their ’ war , they ’ll drive down Republican support and win the elections in 2008 .
In other words , Pelosi does n’t hold Bush / Cheney accountable because that might stop the war in Iraq .
And the war in Iraq is a good political tool for winning elections .
Therefore , I submit that by failing to pursue accountability , the rule of law , constitutional reinstitution , and subsequently the end to the Iraq war , Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic leadership now own this war .
The Unfairness of ‘ Fair Trade ’
What is so called ‘ fair trade ’ ?
To this day nobody has been able to give me a good ( let alone consistent ) explanation of what ‘ fair trade ’ supposedly means , other than implying that whatever it is , it is good for poor people in developing countries .
Of course this is a very old ( and effective ) tactic of defining something by its supposed outcome rather than by the actions that will produce such outcome .
Who can argue against doing something that will help poor people ?
One also notices how even the exact goals are rather vague and sometimes inconsistent .
Some will claim that ‘ fair trade ’ will somehow help poor farmers make a ‘ proper living ’ from their work , but then some will claim that it will help them move away from farming into more productive work .
In any case , to be able to asses the real consequences and outcomes of so called ‘ fair trade ’ we will need to make some assumptions as to what it actually means in practice .
Amusing peculiarities of the ‘ fair trade ’ industry
One of the central claims is that producers in third world countries are often exploited by middlemen who pay them very little compared to the ‘ real ’ price of the products and keep all the profits .
Then one has to wonder if it is possible for ‘ fair trade ’ practitioners to bypass such middlemen why would n’t anyone have done so already ?
If it is true ( and admittedly there is some evidence that it is the case ) that producers are being paid well below the price goods are sold for , one has to ask why nobody has setup a business which pays better producers and at the same time sells at a lower price to consumers by bypassing the ‘ middlemen ’ .
But this takes us to another ‘ fair trade ’ paradox : ‘ fair trade ’ products are invariably more expensive than their ‘ unfair ’ equivalents ( if anyone has a counter example , please let me know ) .
At first this might seem reasonable , we have to pay more so the producers can get a ‘ fairer ’ pay … but if we think about it carefully , this would mean that the supposed profit margin for the ‘ middlemen ’ ca n’t be as big and ‘ unfair ’ as ‘ fair trade ’ advocates claim .
At best that would mean that it is us consumers who are keeping the profit ( by paying lower prices ) .
Of course it feels better if we blame someone else for what we see as an unjust situation rather than realize we are the main beneficiaries of the situation ( though lower prices ) .
It is also amusing ( and perhaps unsettling ) to see well established companies that have added ‘ fair trade ’ products to their existing product lines , what is the implication here ?
That not only they have been practicing ‘ unfair ’ trade in the past , but that they will still practice it unless you want to pay a premium for their special ‘ fair trade ’ products ?
It almost stinks of racketeering .
Also one has to wonder how can these new ‘ fair trade ’ middlemen accommodate their clear conflict of interests , on the one hand , supposedly giving as much of the profits to the producers , but they are still for profits companies that have to try to maximize their own profits , in a free trade world there would be no such conflict of interests , but fair trade leaves produces at the mercy of the good will of ‘ middlemen ’ and consumers who are expected to give up their natural self interest for the supposed good of producers .
Possible unintended consequences of ‘ fair trade ’
All the peculiarities and inconsistent claims aside , it is reasonable to assume that ‘ fair trade ’ is in essence a subsidy to poor farmers ( by paying them somehow more than the traditional market would ) .
So it is reasonable to ask what are the consequences of such subsidies , and further , how ‘ fair ’ they are .
The consequences of subsidies have been well understood for a long time , they distort the natural market price signals , and cause among other things overproduction and inefficient resource allocation .
What does this mean in practice for farmers in third world countries ?
It means that ‘ thanks ’ to ‘ fair trade ’ more people in developing countries will remain ( or even join ) a farming industry that is inefficient and without long term viability .
And lets not forget all the additional monitoring and regulatory costs of enforcing ‘ fair trade ’ ( whatever that happens to mean ) which would create additional costs and further distort incentives .
Some will still claim that ‘ in the short term ’ farmers will be better off thanks to the extra money they get , but how fair is this ?
how fair it is to tie aid to people who supposedly need it to whatever they farm a certain product that has been subsidized ?
Even given the disadvantages of any kind of aid ( eg. , creation of dependency and deincentivize real self sufficiency ) , it would be much more fair to give aid to anyone who needs it rather than to a rather restricted group of farmers who in many cases might already be way better off than other people in their communities .
At best ‘ fair trade ’ is a rather unfair way to distribute aid to people who might , or might not need it .
It would be interesting also to analyze the impact of ‘ fair trade ’ on local markets in the developing world , one would expect that it would raise the local price of goods ( by moving resources to the production of subsidized products which have to be sold to first world markets ) , which would most negatively impact the poorest sections of such societies .
‘ Fair Trade ’ vs. ‘ Free Trade ’
Perhaps the most fundamental issue with ‘ fair trade ’ is its implication that ‘ free trade ’ is unfair .
Most advocates of fair trade like to blame capitalism and ‘ unfettered free markets ’ for the ills of the world .
But they often like to ignore that what makes the market unfair is not free markets , but the lack of free markets .
It is policies like subsidies , tariffs , quotas , preferential access agreements and so on which create the distortions in the free market which make it less free and more unfair .
At its heart , a free market is a truly fair market , where producers are paid according to the demand for their products , and where consumers pay according to the supply of the goods they want .
As Milton Friedman so eloquently put it :
‘ If an exchange between two parties is voluntary , it will not take place unless both believe they will benefit from it .
Most economic fallacies derive from the neglect of this simple insight , from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie , that one party can only gain at the expense of another . ’
And that is the essence of a free market .
If only advocates of ‘ fair trade ’ would put use their efforts to try to accomplish a more free market rather than trying to undermine it the world , and specially the poor people in developing countries would be much better off in the short , medium and long term .

My universal theory of social networks goes something like this .
There ’s some deep part of your brain that instinctively wants to make connections with other human beings .
Even when you do something as superficial as click a button on a website to confirm that somebody you ’ve already known for ten years is your friend , that bit of your brain experiences a little ‘ ping ’ of happiness .
This is why social networks like Friendster , MySpace and Facebook work .
Once they ’ve tricked you into signing up , you have to find everyone else you know who is also on the service and connect to them .
When you run out of people to connect to , you have to tell everyone you know to get an account so you can connect to them again .
Because it ’s fun .
And it ’s fun because people are fun , even if they ’re people you see every day , and have no need to interact with over the Internet .
Eventually you run out of real friends to add .
At this point you have three options :
Find some other feature of the site to keep you logging in Gradually lose interest , returning every month or two to see if anyone else has added you Radically lower your standards
You can pretty much chart the mass - desertion of Friendster ’s initial userbase on these axes .
Lacking a compelling application beyond building your network , Friendster ’s initial population became divided into those who were just wandering around looking for complete strangers to add to their friends lists , and people who were deserting the service in droves because it had become nothing more than a way for strangers to bug them .
A social network without a compelling reason to bring people back to the site will have a massive churn rate , relying on a constant influx of new blood still in the network - building phase .
As such , social networks are prone to huge and sudden shifts in demographic as trends in which site is ‘ hot ’ change unevenly in different areas .
( See also , Orkut )
( For a year or two , I maintained a Friendster account with two friends , just because I feel obliged to at least try out every new net .
trend .
Recently I instituted a new policy of logging on every so often and approving any new request I ’d received .
This process has led me to understand that the population of the site is now heavily skewed towards South - East Asian jailbait )
Therefore , for social networking sites to maintain a stable population , they have to find some compelling application beyond just building a network .
The good news is that there are a trillion such applications .
Some of them are so compelling that there are entire websites built upon them —
I ’m thinking of Flickr , Livejournal , or even Instant Messaging as a whole — where the social networking aspect is secondary to the application itself .
Conversely , it ’s no coincidence that at all social networking sites include some form of support for blogging , short text messages and photo sharing1 .
Social networks are graphs of interest and trust .
As such they are natural conduits for the flow of information2 .
Anyone looking to write social software has to either build their own network from scratch , or build on top of someone else ’s .
This is why Facebook ’s API is such a smart ( and successful ) move .
Facebook give away access to a valuable resource , their users , and in return third party application developers provide more reasons for users to keep coming back to Facebook ’s site .
Sure , 95 % of the applications are dinky little toys , and the implementation sucks in so many ways3 , but overall it ’s the only thing that can stave off Facebook ’s otherwise inevitable crash .
——
1 On the other hand , I could write an entirely new essay explaining why the core application provided by Linked In provides neither practical nor entertainment value , and the site ’s popularity can only be the result of a mass delusion .
2 And like any public information flow on the Internet , they are ripe for abuse .
The first , clumsy social networking hacks are already being exploited , and it ’s only a matter of time before some spammer cottons on to the simple fact that if someone is listed as your friend on MySpace , you ’re more likely to read an email with their name in it .
3 Firstly it encourages my friends to spam me , which is not really a good way to maintain a friendship .
Secondly , I ca n’t interact with an application on someone else ’s profile without signing up to the application myself , and most of the time I ’m too curmudgeonly to do so .
I think the New York Times has this one right .
" For more than five months the United States has been trying to orchestrate a political transition in Pakistan that would manage to somehow keep Gen. Pervez Musharraf in power without making a mockery of President Bush 's promotion of democracy in the Muslim world .
On Saturday , those carefully laid plans fell apart spectacularly . "
Not since Hamas ' dramatic victory in the Palestinian elections has the disconnect between Bush 's democratic rhetoric and reality of U.S. policy been so starkly exposed .
In the former case , Washington responded to democracy with rejection , and support for the Fatah coup .
How will it respond to Musharraf 's assault on the fading facade of incipient Pakistani democracy ?
Recall that Musharraf toppled the democratically elected president of Pakistan , Nawaz Sharif , in 1999 .
The year before Pakistan had conducted nuclear weapons tests , and been slapped with U.S. sanctions .
Relations with the military dictatorship were cool until 9 - 11 , after which Musharraf became a key U.S. ally in the " war on terror " and recipient of massive U.S. aid .
U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell , through his deputy Richard Armitage , told Musharraf : " Be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age , " if he was unwilling to cooperate in the destruction of Afghanistan 's Taliban regime .
That regime was largely a creation of Pakistani military intelligence , and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia its main supporters .
But Musharraf agreed to break ties , host U.S. forces , and even to suppress any ( democratic ) anti-U.S. demonstrations in his country .
Using Pakistani military bases as part of its campaign , the U.S. swiftly overthrew the primitive Taliban apparatus , chased al - Qaeda and some of the Talibs across the border into Pakistan , allowed the reemergence of the Northern Alliance warlord regime with a Pashtun fig - leaf figurehead , proclaimed a great victory and then without skipping a beat shifted its attention to the wholly unrelated target of Iraq .
In the border area , often described as " lawless " and never fully controlled by the central government of Pakistan , tribal leaders met the routed Afghans as well as the al - Qaeda Arabs with hospitality .
In the interim , the latter have not only survived , regrouped and facilitated military opposition to the Karzai regime in Kabul , but acquired a following within Pakistan .
There is now a Pakistani Taliban movement that in coalition with other anti-government Islamist movements in the country ( alongside " moderate " democratic movements as well ) seriously challenges Musharraf 's regime .
In July , in an effort to crack down on Islamist forces , the government stormed the Red Mosque in Islamabad , killing 183 according to the BBC .
Tensions between the Islamists ( who are well represented in the military ) and Musharraf are at a boiling point , recently obliging him to reach out to political rival former prime minister Banazir Bhutto
The U.S. put Musharraf in a very difficult position .
" You must agree , " it told him in 2001 , " to help us overthrow Pakistan 's own creation , the Taliban . "
After he did , he was told , " You must send your soldiers to places in your country they have never been deployed before , to crush the fleeing Afghans and al - Qaeda terrorists .
Or we will do it for you . "
The region where these forces have taken refuge is , as Eric Margolis recently wrote in an excellent column , " under express constitutional guarantee of total autonomy and a ban on Pakistani troops ever entering there . "
Pakistani army efforts to crush them have met with dismal results , forcing Islamabad to in effect sue for peace a year ago .
In September 2006 the government signed a pact with tribal groups , including the " Islamic Emirate of Waziristan " whereby the latter would prevent cross - border movement of militants into and out of Afghanistan in exchange for the government 's cessation of air and ground attacks against militants in Waziristan .
This met with some concern in Washington , and Voice of America announced that the pact had Mullah Omar 's blessing .
But Bush spokesman Tony Snow at the time said that the agreement was aimed at combating terrorism and that Islamabad had assured the U.S. the accord would n't undermine the hunt for Osama bin Laden .
In any case , the attack on the Red Mosque led to reprisals on government forces in Waziristan and the collapse of the Waziristan Accord .
The National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE ) , the collective product of 16 U.S. intelligence agencies concerning national security issues , was released last July just as the accord broke down .
It declared that al - Qaeda has regained the same strength it had as of the 9 - 11 attacks due to ( 1 ) the " safe haven " it has enjoyed in parts of Pakistan and ( 2 ) its association with " al - Qaeda in Iraq , " which has allowed it to " energize the broader Sunni extremist community , raise resources , and to recruit and indoctrinate operatives … "
That set the neocons chattering about a U.S. attack on Pakistan .
" I think the president 's going to have to take military action there over the next few weeks or months , " Bill Kristol said on Fox News .
" Bush has to disrupt that sanctuary .
I think , frankly , we wo n't even tell Musharraf .
We 'll do what we have to do in Western Pakistan and Musharraf can say , ' Hey , they did n't tell me . ' "
It got the White House talking tough .
Tony Snow answering reporters ' questions refused to rule out striking at targets inside Pakistan .
Asked if the U.S. would seek Pakistan 's permission before a strike , he said " We never rule out any options , including striking actionable targets .
…
Those are matters that are best not discussed publicly . "
He declared that Musharraf is " going to have to be more aggressive " in going after al - Qaeda in Pakistan .
In fact , the U.S. had already conducted strikes .
One in January 2006 a military airstrike targeting the village of Damadola in the Bajaur tribal area of northwestern Pakistan killed at least 18 people , including women and children .
It apparently targeted al - Qaeda leader Ayman al - Zawahiri .
The U.S. government denied responsibility , which suggests this was a CIA operation .
During the same month a missile attack killed eight people in a village in North Waziristan , prompting protests throughout the country and two official letters of protest hand delivered from the Foreign Office to U.S. embassy officials .
His American allies ' disregard for Pakistani sovereignty was becoming an acute embarrassment for Musharraf .
Only July 20 Pakistan 's Foreign Office spokeswoman Tasneem Aslam called US officials ' comments about striking targets along the Pakistan - Afghanistan border " irresponsible and dangerous , " adding , We cannot , nor should we be expect to take indiscriminate action over a large territory without any precise information about any Al Qaeda or terrorist hideout . "
But the following day Bush in his weekly radio address stated he was troubled by the report that al - Qaeda was gaining strength in the Pakistani tribal region .
Then Frances Fragos Townsend , Bush 's homeland security adviser , told CNN that if the U.S. has " actionable targets , anywhere in the world , including Pakistan , then we would respond to those targets .
…
There are no options off the table . "
This produced an immediate angry response from the Pakistani Foreign Minister , Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri , who told CNN : " Some people are talking irresponsibly of attack in the tribal areas by the United States .
People in Pakistan get very upset when , despite all the sacrifices that Pakistan has been making , you have the sort of questions that are sometimes asked by the American media …
[ But ] indiscriminate attacks could only undercut efforts to win hearts and minds . "
On July 25 , Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Peter Verga told an unusual joint session of the House Armed Services Committee and Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence , " If there were information or opportunity to strike a blow " on Pakistani territory " to protect the American people " U.S. forces would act immediately .
On the same day at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing , State Department Undersecretary for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns declared , " Given the primacy of the fight against al - Qaeda and Osama bin Laden , if we have in the future certainty of knowledge , then of course the United States would always have the option of taking action on its own . "
Of course this sort of talk did not go down well in Pakistan , and it had to worry the general .
His goal was to survive assassination attempts and serve a third term as president .
To do that , he had to get the parliament to change the constitution and prevent the Supreme Court from declaring such a move illegal .
Thus , he suspended the Chief Justice in March .
But the judge , Iftikhar Chaudhry , was reinstated by the Court in July , handing Musharraf a setback just as the U.S. was ratcheting up pressure on him .
Thereafter , Condi Rice has been twisting his arm to accept an arrangement whereby Bhutto , back in Pakistan , can organize her Pakistan People 's Party to work with him to support the " war on terror . "
That deal requires that he leave his Army post .
Last month Musharraf won the parliamentary vote for president , but the Supreme Court has yet to rule on whether he can legitimately hold the post without resigning from the army .
Perhaps anticipating a negative decision , he has now declared a state of emergency and is busy locking up political opponents and shutting down the independent press .
He has perhaps determined that to do otherwise he would either ( 1 ) fall to a " People 's Power " type movement coalescing around Bhutto ( no democrat but with some populist appeal ) , or ( 2 ) fall to Islamist forces including some in the military .
He might also feel that the first of these results would lead dangerously to the second , embroiling Pakistan in conflict with the U.S .
Washington forced Musharraf into his present position .
He 's the leader of a nation in which the Taliban 's presence and popularity grows .
This results from no fault of his own but as a result of the " regime change " exercise in Afghanistan six years ago and its failure to destroy either the Taliban or al - Qaeda .
He 's the leader of a nation in which Osama bin Laden 's popularity is far greater than his own .
He 's the leader of a nation appalled ( like most nations ) at the carnage in Iraq , resulting from an invasion based on lies .
He 's the leader of a Muslim nation with a huge Shiite minority ( the second largest Shiite population in the world , next to Iran ) whose adherents will — with likely Sunni support — react with outrage to a U.S. attack on neighboring brotherly Iran .
He 's been put in a very tight spot by the neocons ' wild moves towards the creation of an American Raj in Southwest Asia .
He wants to cooperate , but he 's perhaps reached the point where he feels that to say " Yes , Ma'am " again to Condi will not just mean his own political fall but the rise of others whom the U.S. will target with deadly force .
" Be prepared to be bombed .
Be prepared to go back to the Stone Age . "
According to Musharraf on CBS 's 60 Minutes , that 's what Colin Powell 's deputy told him in 2001 .
Surely such words haunt him , and played a role in his decision to declare the state of emergency , " making , " as the New York Times puts it , " a mockery of President Bush 's promotion of democracy in the Muslim world . "
The U.S. State Department , having reportedly discouraged Musharraf from declaring martial law in the past , pronounces itself " deeply disturbed " by the " extra- constitutional actions " he has taken .
Possibly this just another sniffle of hypocrisy dripping from Pinocchio ’s lengthening nose .
Maybe the move received prior authorization from Musharraf 's patrons in Washington .
Quite possibly the Vice President 's office has a different reaction from the State Department 's ( often the case ) and feels a stronger , more dictatorial Musharraf will be a more useful ally when the missiles hit Iran .
Surely we will soon see how sincere these U.S. expressions of support for the Pakistani constitution and " democracy " really are .

After taking off from Jidda , Saudi Arabia , his C - 47 transport crashed “ in a mountainous , desolate area ” between Asmara and Addis Ababa , killing Mr. Dennett , the pilot , three soldiers and the State Department ’s “ petroleum attaché ” from Cairo .
The crash occurred in a region so remote that “ native runners ” had to bring word of the accident to the nearest town , the paper said .
It was 40 more years before Ms. Dennett rediscovered her father ’s obituary while flipping through a scrapbook in her brother ’s attic .
Something fishy swam through her stomach .
“ I suspected there was more to the story , ” she said .
Working first with the National Archives in Washington , then with the C.I.A. , she managed to obtain hundreds of declassified documents .
But most were drab personnel records , she said .
One was not : a copy of the accident report with pictures of the crash .
The report , she said , declared in no uncertain terms that the accident was precisely that .
Yet she had always heard stories , usually in whispers , that the crash was sabotage .
Her father ’s best friend had always said it .
So did a former spy she said she met one day with the help of the government archivists .
“ When I told him who I was he said , ‘ Oh , Dan Dennett , what a loss . ’
Then he said : ‘ Of course , I know about the plane crash .
We always thought it was sabotage but could n’t prove it . ’ ”
There was no evidence in the record to suggest foul play  except in the twisting logic of intelligence work , which only seemed to enhance her suspicions .
Then there was the fact , Ms. Dennett said , that the documents she had received all seemed to stop around the time of the crash .
“ Here I am , hot on the trail , ” she said , “ and just when I ’m getting to the juicy stuff there ’s nothing . ”
At this point , her struggles with the C.I.A. began .
Requests for information were filed and then denied .
Six years passed in the back - and - forth .
In 2005 , with what she said was reluctance , Ms. Dennett sued the C.I.A. to obtain the entirety of her father ’s secret file .
The West ’s Deal With the Devil

DIGG THIS
BANFF —
This seems to be a month of historic guilt .
Germany just opened a new memorial to Jewish victims of Nazi persecution .
Armenians demand Turkey admit Ottoman - era massacres were genocide .
Japan is being blasted anew for denying wartime atrocities .
Spain is again racked by memories of crimes committee during its bloody civil war .
Yet the greatest crime in modern history , and bloodiest genocide , has almost vanished from our collective memory .
Last week marked the 70th anniversary of the Great Terror in the Soviet Union in which tens of millions were murdered or imprisoned .
Russia ’s president , Vladimir Putin , at least commemorated for the first time what he termed " colossal " Soviet crimes by attending a memorial last week for its victims .
The site was a killing ground south of Moscow where the secret police shot over 20,000 victims .
It was interesting watching Putin , former head of the FSB security service , denouncing crimes of its direct predecessors , KGB and NKVD .
The same Putin who recently called the Soviet Union ’s collapse a " tragedy . "
Still , we applaud his long - overdue recognition of Communist - era crimes .
Putin has at least broken Russia ’s shameful official silence .
The Soviet terror began in the 1920 ’s when Lenin ordered the extermination of Cossacks and opponents of the Bolsheviks .
Next came Catholics of White Russia , and resisters to communism in the Baltic states and Moldova .
Stalin then ordered liquidation of 2 million small farmers , known as " Kulaks . "
In 1932 — 33 , Stalin unleashed genocide against Ukraine ’s independent - minded farmers .
Six to seven million Ukrainians were shot or purposely starved to death .
Starving Ukrainians even resorted to cannibalism .
The man who directed this genocide , Lazar Kaganovitch , the Soviet Eichmann — was made Hero of the Soviet Union and died peacefully in Moscow in 1991 .
When Communist Party bureaucrats delayed Stalin ’s plans to transform the Soviet Union from a backwards rural society into a modern industrial powerhouse , " Koba , " as he was called , had NKVD shoot 700,000 party members .
Thereafter , his orders were promptly obeyed .
Almost all the party and military hierarchy were executed during the Great Purges of 1937 — 38 , which culminated in the notorious Moscow Show Trials that received worldwide attention .
From 1934 — 1941 alone , some 7 million victims were sent to the system of concentration camps known as the " gulag , " including one million Poles , hundreds of thousands Lithuanians , Latvians and Estonians , and half the entire Muslim Chechen and Ingush people .
Volga Germans , Crimean Tatars , Bashkirs , Kalmyks followed .
Stalin ’s gulag did not need gas chambers : cold , disease and overwork killed 30 % of inmates yearly .
To this day , Russian and foreign historians are unsure of the full number of Lenin and Stalin ’s victims .
Estimates range from 20 — 40 million total deaths from 1922 to 1953 — and this awesome figure does not include deaths in World War II .
Stalin committed his worst crimes well before Hitler ’s major atrocities got under way .
His concentration camps were opened and filled with inmates by the early 1930’s .
We have forgotten that Germany alone did not spark World War II , as most people believe .
Germany and the USSR jointly invaded Poland in 1939 ; Stalin then attacked neutral Finland .
Two years later , Britain and the USSR invaded neutral Iran , an aggression as lawless and brazen as the joint German - Soviet invasion of Poland .
History indeed remains the propaganda of the victors .
If we keep hectoring Germany and Japan to admit guilt for events of the 1940 ’s , is it not time the United States , Britain , and Canada admit their own culpability in allying themselves to Stalin , a monster who killed over four times the number of Hitler ’s victims ?
After all , Stalin ’s concentration camps were up and running a decade ahead of Germany ’s .
The murder of millions of Ukrainians and White Russians took place before the world ’s gaze , 6 — 7 years before World War II .
The foolish Roosevelt , who hailed Stalin as " Uncle Joe , " and the cannier Churchill both knew they were allied to the biggest mass murderer since Genghis Khan .
They used a larger devil to fight a smaller , less dangerous one — then paid his price by handing over half of Europe to Moscow .
Remember this when today ’s warmongers wax poetic about the glories of World War II — and call for WWIII .
Western powers should practice what they piously preach to Germany , Japan and , lately , Turkey , by at least apologizing for their sordid deal with Stalin .
Which was every bit as immoral as if they had made a deal with Hitler , as Stalin long feared they would , to destroy the Soviet Union .
The Best of Eric S. Margolis
For a chilling proof that the evil of religious fundamentalism is still alive and well in the Christian tradition today , one need go no further than the website which bills itself as the Society for the Practical Establishment and Perpetuation of the Ten Commandments , run by one Robert T. Lee .
This site , which is a disturbing mix of fire - and - brimstone nightmares , dark hate - filled fantasies , and rants from the depths of a clearly ill mind , claims to advocate a “ rebirth ” of America upon biblical law , and envisions a theocratic state where all religions other than the author ’s extreme fundamentalist Christianity would be outlawed and where atheists and homosexuals , among others , would be executed .
Among other equally spectacular examples , the site mentions its “ divinely established ” responsibility to “ insure [ sic ] the proper punishment of all true criminal heathens who deny God ” ; asks , “ Has a person ever made you so angry you wished he was dead ?
Then why ca n’t you feel and express that same fervency of anger towards true criminals such as atheists , pedophiles , homosexuals , murders [ sic ] , rapists and etc ? ….
What you should wish for these people is that the government put them to death ” ; and boasts an article entitled “ EVIL FREEDOM SHOULD BE DISALLOWED ” .
But as the site ’s title suggests , Mr. Lee ’s main obsession is with the Ten Commandments .
Throughout the site , we are treated to his ravings about how the Ten Commandments are the most perfect laws ever created , how their perfection shows that they could only have been authored by God , how they are far superior to any laws any human ever has written or could write , and so on .
A typical excerpt :
God commands all mankind in the TEN COMMANDMENTS to : “ Honor your father and your mother , ” “ You shall not murder , ” “ You shall not commit adultery , ” “ You shall not steal , ” “ You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor , ” and etc , ( Exodus 20:1 - 17 ) .
Is any atheist , agnostic or unbeliever foolish enough to publicly deny the decorousness of those laws ?
OK , there ’s no disagreement with the fact that those Laws are righteous and honorable .
But since atheists deny God ’s existence , they do n’t have the ability to realize that God is the Author of the TEN COMMANDMENTS .
This forces them to attribute their authorship to a human .
But since atheism is opposed to the decorous TEN COMMANDMENTS , even while being force [ sic ] to deceptively think they were authored by a human , this clearly shows evidence that atheism was and is incapable of authoring , realizing and honoring such decorous and noble laws .
If in the view of the atheist the TEN COMMANDMENTS were authored by a human , and since it is rightly established that those laws are decorous and honorable , but are hated by atheists , and atheists are said to comprise the most “ educated ” segment of the human race , then it would have taken a more decorous and honorable human to author them than even the most highly educated atheist .
– from http://www.tencommandments.org/heathens.shtml
But like many fundamentalists , in his eagerness to prove a point Mr. Lee has charged beyond where the facts allow him to go .
I do , in fact , deny that the Ten Commandments are righteous and honorable .
I do n’t think they ’re all bad , but I do think they could stand some improvement .
As my article “ The Big Ten ” explains , the first four of them are purely religious in nature and intent , serving no purpose other than to show how a primitive tribal culture felt their deity should be worshipped , and the remaining six are simply general moral principles , some of which our society abides by , some of which it does not , and most of which are obvious , common - sense ethical directives that every society in history that did not ultimately destroy itself figured out .
It certainly took no special insight or wisdom to produce them .
Can we do better ?
Can we come up with a new decalogue that would be more relevant and useful for the world today ?
The old ten are showing their age and provincial origin by now ; we need an updated set .
But by the same token , the laws we come up with should be genuinely universal , applicable to all human beings at all times and places , past , present and future , no matter how society or culture may change .
Laws must address pressing concerns to be relevant , but they must be enduring and all - encompassing to be just .
Therefore , it seems clear that what we must do to produce a new ten commandments is to consider all of human history up to this point and abstract from it those principles of human behavior that span the ages – the moral lessons that apply across space and time , regardless of society or circumstance .
From these general universal maxims we can distill the rules that will become a true decalogue for the modern world .
In compiling such a list , we have several advantages over the ancient Hebrews .
First and foremost , we have the advantage of experience – we can look back on their own experiment in creating a decalogue and evaluate what the results have been , to see where their rules worked and where they did n’t .
Nor are we limited to their insular tribal knowledge , but can look back across the grand sweep of human history to draw lessons from many cultures .
Secondly , and at least as if not more importantly , we have come far enough to learn that the world is a rational place after all – that it is not inhabited by thundering deities or malevolent spirits who will cause misfortune and disaster if not appeased , but that the cosmos runs according to the regularities of the laws of science and nature .
Human fortune depends not on following the inscrutable whims and dictates of a supernatural pantheon , but on our actions here in this life and the simple laws of reaction and consequence .
We should behave morally not because it pleases the gods , but because we , as human beings , owe it to ourselves and to each other .
Finally , we have better templates to draw on than those long - ago authors did .
In the millennia since the Ten Commandments were first conceived and codified , many great human thinkers and philosophers have offered their own visions for an ideal society , some of which have been implemented in practice and tested against the real world .
We can draw upon the thoughts of these great men and the outcomes of their experiments to help us produce a moral code that will guide humanity and outlast the ages .
Presented below in this article are the results of one atheist ’s attempt to accomplish this – my humble proposal for a new decalogue that truly would be universal and truly could serve as the basis for a rational and enlightened state .
But first , a few introductory remarks :
The first thing to notice about this list is that there are no “ Thou shalt nots ” .
That time - worn phrase is too dogmatic , too authoritarian ; it conveys all too well the idea of a stark list of laws chiseled in stone .
Secondly , and related to this , the new decalogue contains no prohibitions of any specific acts , no injunctions against killing or stealing or adultery .
This too is intentional .
Murder , theft and false witness do not even come close to exhausting the possibilities for human depravity , and if we were to try to forbid every immoral action a person could ever engage in , this list would run far longer than ten rules .
Since we are trying to distill the wisdom of all human ethics into a concise decalogue , we are back where we started .
Besides , as a perusal of this list will show , to outlaw specific crimes would be beside the point .
One can never improve a person by simply dumping a list of edicts on them ; if we are to lift up humanity , we must do it by weeding out the ultimate source of immoral behavior .
We are aiming not to control people ’s actions , but to change their hearts , and such cannot be accomplished with a hard list of decrees handed down from on high , to be obeyed or else .
Only through peaceful and rational persuasion can we hope to permanently alter behavior for the good .
Finally , readers will notice that the new decalogue is secular , omitting any reference to deities or how to worship them .
This is a long - overdue and badly needed improvement .
The intent of this list is to unite , and any rule relating to religion – either for or against – would inevitably serve only to divide .
As long as one ’s faith does not direct one to harm others , one ’s choice of religion ( or lack thereof ) is a private and individual matter , protected by the right to freedom of conscience , which no one else has any right to forcibly interfere in .
To mandate that a specific god be worshipped , or that it be done in a specific way , is nothing more than a tyrannical attempt to impose a particular belief system on others – especially if such religious laws are mixed with secular ones , a dangerous first step toward the always disastrous intermingling of church and state .
Rules such as these have no place in a free , enlightened and pluralistic modern world .
Without further ado , we now present the new set of ten commandments , a revised decalogue for this society and all societies to come .
Each entry is supplemented by commentary , along the lines of the Jewish Talmud or Islamic hadith , to expound on the meaning of the rules and give suggestions as to how they should be applied .
First Commandment :
Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you .
The new ten commandments are divided into two equally important major categories , the “ moral five ” and the “ intellectual five ” .
To use an ancient metaphor , the first five deal with the heart , and the second five with the brain .
The former category , and the list itself , begins with the single greatest , simplest , and most important moral axiom humanity has ever invented , one which reappears in the writings of almost every culture and religion throughout history , the one we know as the Golden Rule .
Moral directives do not need to be complex or obscure to be worthwhile , and in fact , it is precisely this rule ’s simplicity which makes it great .
It is easy to come up with , easy to understand , and easy to apply , and these three things are the hallmarks of a strong and healthy moral system .
The idea behind it is readily graspable : before performing an action which might harm another person , try to imagine yourself in their position , and consider whether you would want to be the recipient of that action .
If you would not want to be in such a position , the other person probably would not either , and so you should not do it .
It is the basic and fundamental human trait of empathy , the ability to vicariously experience how another is feeling , that makes this possible , and it is the principle of empathy by which we should live our lives .
The intent of this commandment is not to forbid the administration of justice , however .
Those who freely violate it themselves , who do not let empathy deter them from harming others , may be punished in turn without having their own feelings taken into account .
A judge about to sentence a convicted criminal to prison is not expected to empathize with the fear and distress experienced by the criminal upon hearing the sentence pronounced .
At its best , the Golden Rule can build a humanistic society based upon compassion and mutual respect .
But in circumstances such as the one just described , there is a cold reciprocity to it .
Those who would be shown compassion must also show it to others .
Second Commandment :
In all things , strive to cause no harm .
Any immoral actions that slip through the net of the first commandment will hopefully be caught by this one .
Its intent is to encourage people to live their lives causing as little suffering as they possibly can , weighing the likely consequences of each of their actions and choosing a course to follow based on that evaluation .
Actions that cause pain and harm to other beings should always be avoided , unless there is no other choice or unless an even greater evil would ensue if such an action were not performed .
Again , this is a simple , obvious rule that virtually all religions and cultures have independently invented , even if most fall regrettably far short of abiding by it .
The intent of this rule is truly all - encompassing , encouraging people to choose an action based not only on what actual pain and suffering may occur as a result , but what potential pain and suffering may also be produced down the line .
Eastern mystics who believe in the principle of karma often view it metaphorically as a wheel , a turning circle that returns the consequences of an action to the initiator of that action .
While I do not believe in such a force , I do feel that the concept of karma is a helpful guide for choosing a course ; however , I believe that a more appropriate and relevant metaphor for karma would be a tree , rooted at the point of action , branching off endlessly into the future .
By our actions , we can choose to plant either a tree of good or one of evil , and our smallest decision may have consequences we cannot begin to guess .
Therefore , the new second commandment instructs , strive always to take actions that bear good consequences , in order that the net amount of good in the world may be increased , and that evil in the form of pain and suffering may be decreased as much as possible .
Third Commandment : Treat your fellow human beings , your fellow living things , and the world in general with love , honesty , faithfulness and respect .
Where the first two commandments instruct actions , this one instructs an attitude .
The two are not truly separable , however – the empathy required to imagine yourself in the position of another , and the desire to avoid causing harm based on that understanding , can come only from a mind that views the world as made up of equals deserving of the four qualities outlined in this commandment .
This commandment also extends the reach of the new decalogue , making it clear that the intended target of the first and second commandments is not just one ’s fellow human beings .
Our fellow living things that share this planet with us , many of which can feel pain and suffering just as we can , are equally worthy of our empathy and our compassion .
Even the planet itself – especially the planet itself , that precious and irreplaceable world where we came into being and still the only place in the cosmos where we can survive – is deserving of our respect and our protection , and should not be seen as useful only insofar as it assists the designs of people .
The qualities demanded by this commandment deserve some further explanation .
“ Love ” in this context does not mean romantic love or affection , but an appreciation for the unique qualities a thing possesses , and a recognition of its inherent value based on those qualities .
“ Honesty ” means being truthful and open , refraining from falsehoods or misleading statements .
( Honesty is a high moral value , but not supreme , and may be supervened by other , more important considerations ; for example , dishonesty may be required to keep an innocent person from harm , or to avoid needlessly hurting the feelings of another . )
“ Faithfulness ” is similar to honesty and implies an ethic of consistency , of keeping one ’s promises and being ready and willing to help those who require it .
“ Respect ” mandates treating others as inherently valuable , not using them as tools or means to an end that may be cast aside and discarded once they have made their contribution .
Together , these four qualities are the watchwords of ethical behavior as laid out by the first five of the new ten commandments , and complex moral decisions may be resolved by using whichever potential solution combines them in the highest overall measure .
Note that this commandment does not prevent us from punishing the evil , the malicious and those who cause suffering .
Loving and respecting those who do wrong – which we should do – does not mean passively standing aside , but rather stopping them from committing such deeds , in the hope that they may be rehabilitated and become fully functioning , ethical human beings .
For more on this issue , see the next commandment .
Fourth Commandment :
Do not overlook evil or shrink from administering justice , but always be ready to forgive wrongdoing freely admitted and honestly regretted .
The fourth commandment contains several distinct instructions , but all united under one heading : the issue of how to deal with those who run afoul of the other rules .
And , make no mistake , there is a strong and consistent message of action here .
The new , humanist ten commandments reject the Christian dictum of turning the other cheek when someone slaps you ; they deny the Taoist instruction that the best way to eliminate evil is to not oppose it .
Such naively pacifistic moral codes only encourage wrongdoing by allowing it to proliferate unchecked , and send the impression that being ethical means standing idly by , complacent and unprotesting , while evil people run rampant over the rights of others .
This commandment , by contrast , recognizes that there will always be those who will not respect the rights of others , and states that it is the responsibility of ethical individuals to stand up to such people , to oppose them firmly and steadfastly , and to prevent them from causing harm to others .
If the potential harm is imminent and great , then it is moral to use all necessary force – but no more – to prevent it from coming to pass .
Once the immediate danger has passed , the wrongdoer should be made to give restitution for whatever harm he has done , and should be punished , to discourage him from transgressing again – not cruelly or excessively , but by using the minimum possible amount of force consonant with this goal .
Justice requires no more and no less .
It should always be kept in mind that the purpose of punishment is not simply to make the offender suffer , but to bring him to an appreciation of the wrongness of his deed , and this is where the second half of this commandment enters .
It says that , if the offender recognizes that what he did was wrong , offers his sincere apologies and vows not to repeat his act , then his transgression should not be held against him in the future .
Of course , the offender ’s contrition must be sincere , and we are perfectly justified in asking for further evidence of such sincerity if an apology is suspected to be less than heartfelt or the person is a known recidivist .
Nor is an apology , however sincere , any reason to skip punishment altogether – misdeeds should not go unpunished , and to do otherwise sends the wrong message to both the offender and society at large .
Fifth Commandment : Live life with a sense of joy and wonder .
The first four of the five morality commandments apply to one ’s behavior toward one ’s fellow human beings and the world at large .
The final morality commandment addresses a subject that is very different , but at least as important : one ’s behavior toward oneself .
The greatest and most wonderful mystery of the universe is that it exists at all .
But no less a wonder is that we are alive in this universe , that we are conscious of it , and more , that we can understand it .
If a humanist can believe in anything that might be called a miracle , these things surely qualify .
Even the fact that you , personally , exist is a rare chance .
Out of all the countless googolplexes of ways that human DNA can align – out of all the countless trillions of ways to mix characteristics , all the immense multitudes of people who could potentially have existed – the one that did come into existence was you .
Each human being currently alive on this planet embodies a mix of qualities that has never come into existence before and will never come into existence again .
We are , every one of us , more unique and therefore more precious than the finest diamonds , more diverse than the stars that glitter in the night sky .
These things are gifts whose value is beyond all measure .
What is the appropriate attitude in recognition of such awe - inspiring truths ?
Humility , to be sure , but it goes beyond that .
To squander this unparalleled chance , to fail to recognize the awesomeness of what we possess , is a senseless and tragic waste of a thing priceless beyond priceless .
We have a responsibility – almost an obligation – to live our lives in consciousness of what we have been given , and the only response such recognition can possibly provoke is joy and wonder , just as a man might be joyful and wonder - struck upon discovering a trove of buried treasure .
This commandment does not demand that everyone be happy all the time , for life is a journey through realms of great darkness as well as times and places of light .
Instead , it confronts people with the truth that , except in cases of severe and incessant agony , merely being alive is such a joy in and of itself that it outweighs all the lesser suffering that accompanies it .
It challenges people to use that knowledge to pull themselves through such difficult times , and denies that depression or hopeless pessimism can ever be the right way to view the world , as appropriate as they may sometimes seem .
Life is something to be cherished , not spurned , and gladness is the proper response to each new day and the chances it offers .
Sixth Commandment : Always seek to be learning something new .
Of all the threats to morality and incentives to evil , perhaps the greatest is dogmatism , the invincible certainty that you are right and that the opinion of anyone who disagrees with you is worthless and can be rejected out of hand .
The greatest crimes in history have been committed by those who possessed such certainty , whether it appears in the context of religious belief or not .
From the belief that a person ’s opinion is worthless , it is only a small leap to the conclusion that the person themself is as well .
Likewise , the belief that any one person is fallible and the weight of the evidence must always be the ultimate arbiter of what is true – something known in its institutionalized form as the scientific method – has driven the greatest and most rapid progress humanity has ever known .
Therefore , the second five of the new ten commandments are designed to counter the threat of dogmatism and encourage continued human progress by training people to use their intellect in the best way and to the fullest extent .
This commandment has two purposes .
First , in teaching that one should always seek to be learning , it promotes full use of the human capabilities to learn and understand – and why are we here if not to fulfill our potential ?
( It also makes it easier to fulfill the fifth commandment – the joy of understanding is always more sublime than the bliss of ignorance , and knowledge can only enhance one ’s appreciation for the wonders of the cosmos . )
Second , in teaching that one should always seek to learn something new , it teaches that there always is something new to learn – which is the case .
The world we live in is a vast and beautifully complex place , one whose smallest facet holds enough detail for a lifetime of study .
Existence is far too grand for any single mind to comprehend all of it in depth .
The spirit of intellectual humility engendered by this realization is a powerful antidote to zealous dogmatism .
Seventh Commandment :
Test all things ; always check your ideas against the facts , and be ready to discard even a cherished belief if it does not conform to them .
Nature is not malicious , but it is subtle , and in the process of intellectual inquiry errors are virtually inevitable .
Just about everyone will , at some point in their life , believe something which turns out to be false .
This is regrettable , but no blame attaches to it ; we are all human , and we are all fallible .
However , what is blameworthy is when a person zealously guards an erroneous belief – perhaps because they find its consequences comforting , or because they have an emotional investment in the idea of being right – by refusing to test it to see if it is borne out by the facts , or by refusing to expose it to evidence that could prove its downfall .
This path leads only to self - delusion and dogmatism .
Truth can only be discovered through careful scrutiny and thorough fact - checking , carried out in a spirit of honesty and intellectual objectivity that divorces the consequences of a proposition ’s being right or wrong from the question of whether it is supported by the evidence .
That is what this part of the decalogue commands .
Eighth Commandment : Never seek to censor or cut yourself off from dissent ; always respect the right of others to disagree with you .
This commandment continues in the vein of the previous one .
It is desirable to live our lives and conduct ourselves according to what is true , and therefore we should seek to discover truth .
But often , due to our own expectations or the idiosyncrasies of our thinking , we may fail to perceive a flaw in our reasoning that is obvious to others ; other times , we may make decisions based on faulty or incomplete evidence , when someone more knowledgeable would have been able to guide us to the correct path .
( As the sixth commandment points out , no one person can know everything . )
Therefore , if we are to discover what is true , it is far better to seek the advice and counsel of others than to toil in isolation – to work in a climate of free speech , mutual correction and open debate , where fellow thinkers can scrutinize and correct each other ’s work , and where any individual mistakes or biases can therefore be canceled out to produce a whole greater than the sum of its parts .
It is the mark of dogmatic belief and prejudice that it cannot abide such correction and instead seeks to stifle and condemn those who disagree with the prevailing wisdom .
In reality , such heavy - handed protectionism is never justifiable .
The truth will survive honest inquiry , but falsehood – never .
And if a belief is false , should it not be discarded ?
Ninth Commandment : Form independent opinions on the basis of your own reason and experience ; do not allow yourself to be led blindly by others .
Though dogmatism and prejudice may arise , they can cause no harm if they are not widely shared .
Hence , the ninth commandment of the decalogue seeks to halt the spread of such errors by exhorting people never to accept the claims of another without sufficient proof .
As well , this commandment is meant to counteract another human failing – the tendency of the governed to unquestioningly accept the pronouncements of their government .
In all cases , we are told to be critical thinkers , sifting the words of others for truth , accepting their statements only after rigorous skeptical examination .
If anything , it is even more vital to do this in times of crisis than in times of peace , because the decisions made in times of crisis have more potential to cause harm if mislaid and so must be studied all the more carefully .
This commandment does not call on us to ignore the research or the conclusions of those who have delved more deeply or studied more widely in a particular field than we have , however .
On the contrary , one lifetime is not enough to learn everything , and for humanity as a whole to advance we must have specialists who can devote their time to investigating specific subjects .
Instead , what this commandment instructs us to do is to accept the conclusions of these experts to the degree that they can marshal evidence to support them , not simply because they are the experts .
Their function is to provide the facts to convince us , not to flatly state that some proposition is true and expect us to take their word for it , and we should not be shy in demanding that the evidence be strong enough to shore up any proposition in whose support it is deployed .
Tenth Commandment : Question everything .
Nothing is so sacred that it is beyond questioning , no belief so well - supported that it does not need any more reexamination .
That is the thrust of the tenth and final commandment .
Truth emerges from scrutiny unscathed ; only error shows itself in need of correction .
And since human history bears witness to the fact that even beliefs thought true for hundreds of years can be overturned by new discoveries , the older and apparently more solid bricks in the structure of our understanding need continual recertification just as the newer ones do .
This commandment does not call for an epistemologically hopeless solipsism or a nihilistic skepticism where all knowledge dissolves into a fog of uncertainty .
On the contrary , we should recognize that there are some truths that , while they cannot be proven , are so basic and important to our knowledge of the world ( for example , the efficacy of induction ) that it would be futility itself to discard them .
Instead , this commandment calls for the questioning of everything that can be profitably questioned , every proposition that has the potential to be replaced with something better .
Indeed , this includes these commandments themselves .
Any set of rules that is never questioned can only stultify into tyranny , but rules that are continually reevaluated will remain living and vibrant .
Likewise , since the new ten commandments are simply general principles that do not prescribe specific actions , questioning will always be required to figure out exactly how they should be applied .
No set of rules can ever remove the need for a rational and moral person to think for himself and make decisions using his own best judgment .
There is an incident in the New Testament where Jesus is asked to distill the Ten Commandments down to their essence , and he replies that the two greatest commandments are for people to love God and love their neighbor .
Likewise , the new ten commandments can be condensed into one single dictum , one universal and overarching maxim :
Be human .
For , indeed , this is all that morality consists of or needs .
Morality is not complicated , nor does it need to be supported by dense philosophical arguments .
We , as human beings , are intelligent , social primates who inherently possess the theory of mind that allows us to understand the feelings and thoughts of others and the inquisitiveness that gives us the drive to understand the world we live in .
Compassion , empathy , curiosity , intellectual inquiry – these things come naturally to us .
They are part of our nature and of our heritage .
To be human is simply to exemplify these qualities that all of us at least potentially possess .
The new ten commandments are not meant to be bars laid across our behavior , but rather signposts that guide us to this understanding which lies at the heart of morality .
We are not innately evil or misguided , the new ten commandments tell us – we are human beings , with the potential to do good as well as the potential to do evil , and we have the power to make this a better world if only we choose to use it .
Clinton labor secretary : ' Bought out '
Democrats wo n't raise taxes on rich Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday October 25 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Americans are facing skyrocketing costs to fuel their cars , heat their homes and visit their doctors as government spending continues to run up huge federal deficits , leading one economist to ask :
Why are n't Democrats upping taxes on the rich to fill the country 's financial hole ?
" Taxing the super - rich is not about class envy , as conservatives charge , " argues Robert Reich , secretary of labor under Bill Clinton , in a Salon essay Thursday .
" It 's about the nation having enough money to pay for national defense and homeland security , good schools and a crumbling infrastructure , the upcoming costs of boomers '
Social Security ( the current surplus has masked the true extent of the current budget deficit , but it wo n't for much longer ) and , hopefully , affordable national health insurance . "
All the top Democratic presidential candidates have said they would roll back President Bush 's tax cuts , returning the tax rate for top earners to 38 percent from the 35 percent it sank to during the Bush years .
But Reich argues this approach is small potatoes compared to what 's needed to fund necessary programs , and he said Democratic fealty to raising taxes creates the appearance that " the rich have bought them out . "
The widening income gap has put 21 percent of the country 's income into the hands of the top 1 percent of Americans , while the bottom 50 percent of workers earn just 12.8 percent of wages , creating the highest concentration of wealth since the 1920s .
" The biggest emerging pay gap is actually within the top 1 percent of all earners , " Reich notes ( emphasis his ) .
" It 's mainly a gap between corporate CEOs , on the one hand , and Wall Street financiers -- hedge - fund managers , private - equity managers ( think Mitt Romney ) and investment bankers -- on the other . "
Several hedge fund managers take more more than $ 1 billion per year , and their income is treated as capital gains -- not income -- so they pay a 15 percent tax rate , which is lower than that paid by most middle - class Americans , Reich notes .
" At the very least , you might think that Democrats would do something about the anomaly in the tax code .
...
But Senate Democrats recently backed off a proposal to do just that , " he writes .
" Why ?
It turns out that Democrats are getting more campaign contributions these days from hedge - fund and private - equity partners than Republicans are getting .
In the run-up to the 2006 election , donations from hedge - fund employees were running better than 2 - to - 1 Democratic .
The party does n't want to bite the hands that feed . "
Reminding readers that the top marginal tax rate reached 91 percent under Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower , Reich said Democrats need to do more to force the wealthy to pay their fair share .
He called for a 50 percent tax rate on those earning more than $ 500,000 per year , and he said Democrats need enough backbone to stand up to their corporate backers to advance the public interest .
" You say the rich will leave the country rather than face a marginal tax of 50 percent ? " he asks .
" Let them , and take away their citizenship . "

A Texas company has sued AOL , Google , Microsoft , and Yahoo , claiming that all four web giants have infringed its patent " for conducting business transactions over the Internet " .
Performance Pricing Inc. filed suit last week in the Eastern District of Texas , Marshall Division , a popular place for patent infringement suits .
The company insists that four of the biggest names on the net are stepping on its patent with their ad technologies , including Google AdWords , Microsoft adCenter , Yahoo !
Search Marketing , and the Google - powered AOL Search Marketplace .
" Defendants have used , and continue to use , Plaintiff Performance Pricing 's patented technology methods and systems that they make , use , sell , and offer to sell , without Plaintiff 's permission , " the suit reads .
" Plaintiff seeks damages for patent infringement and an injunction preventing Defendants from making , using , selling , or offering to sell technology claimed by the patent without Plaintiff 's permission . "
Think that 's dodgy English ?
Wait 'til you read the patent .
Dubbed " Systems and methods for transacting business over a global communications network such as the Internet , " the patent describes a method " for conducting business transactions over the Internet , allowing buyers to reduce the price of the selected product / service based on the buyer 's performance during a collateral activity . "
Yes , this is a business process patent .
Paying the ultimate price
" Sellers offer the product / service within a specified price range , and buyers accept the offer , in exchange for the opportunity to close the transaction at the lowest price offered by achieving a high score during the collateral activity , " the patent continues .
" The ultimate price is within the agreed upon range , but is determined based upon the buyer 's performance during the collateral activity . "
The patent also says that this process can be applied all sorts of activities - both online and off - including video games , electronic board games , sports betting , and card games .
According to Eric Goldman , Santa Clara University law professor and tech law blogger , the suit resembles the sort of " lawsuits that we 're concerned about when we worry about patents being used as a way of shaking down people for cash as opposed to advancing social interests " .
Congress is considering a bill that would overhaul patent litigation , and both Google and Microsoft have lobbied in its favor .
The bill would make things more difficult for plaintiffs like Performance Pricing - but it might undermine legitimate startups as well . ®
To hear the critics tell it , the warrantless wiretapping law passed by Congress this weekend is an immoral license for a mad President Bush and his spymasters to eavesdrop on all Americans .
For those willing to believe such things , mere facts do n't matter .
But for anyone still amenable to reason , the deal is worth parsing for its national security precedents , good and bad .
The next Democratic President might be grateful .
The good news is that the new law will at least allow the National Security Agency to monitor terrorist ...

They were a lonely band of rebels until just a few weeks ago , backing the darkest of dark horse presidential candidates .
But with Republican Rep. Ron Paul 's fundraising on the rise - $ 4.2 million raised on the Internet in one day this month - and his poll numbers jumping , the Texas congressman might no longer be a " who ? " but a potential problem for leading Republican presidential candidates in key states such as New Hampshire .
And in California , the state where the 72 - year - old doctor - politician has raised the most money , those who call themselves part of the " Ron Paul Revolution " could n't be happier .
Paul 's backers are people such as Brad Sanford , 29 , a Silicon Valley tech worker who said he never had been involved in politics or campaigns until this year .
Sanford , attending a Paul campaign Bay Area " meetup " event this week , said he first caught Paul 's appearances on cable programs like " The Bill Maher Show , " " The Daily Show With Jon Stewart " and " The Colbert Report . " '
Since then , Sanford has registered Republican for the first time to vote in the California presidential primary on Feb.
5 while " maxing out " his political donation budget with $ 2,300 to Paul 's campaign .
Sanford now is walking precincts for Paul - another first - because he said the candidate is strongly against the war in Iraq and can appeal to millions who believe that America has " strayed too far from our values " and fundamentals laid out in the Constitution .
" For young people , it 's the war ; for older people , it 's a straight common - sense approach " to taxes , the economy and values , said Holly Clearman , California field coordinator for the Paul campaign .
Clearman said the life of a Ron Paul supporter used to be a lonely undertaking .
" I thought there were only 10 of us , and nobody I knew , " she said .
But that changed in recent months as the candidate raised $ 9 million this quarter , and " the cat is out of the bag . "
Indeed , the meetup group has swelled in recent weeks to more than 400 .
At a meeting Monday night , a diverse assortment of hip , 20 - something techies , Financial District professionals and graybeard Baby Boomer activists jammed into a San Francisco yoga and massage studio to plan strategy in the decidedly unorthodox presidential campaign .
Paul followers are buoyed by the latest polls from CNN and the New York Times showing that their candidate has jumped ahead of former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee in New Hampshire , the site of the nation 's first 2008 primary on Jan. 8 .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Arizona Sen .
John McCain still dominate the race in that independent - minded , " Live Free or Die " state .
But Paul 's recent rise has prompted pundits to acknowledge that the Texan - once dismissed as a fringe candidate - could have an impact on the presidential race .
Paul 's eclectic mix of fiercely libertarian and conservative values has created a passionate support base that might be unlike any other candidate in the 2008 presidential race .
The former practicing obstetrician , who has served in the House about 20 of the past 35 years , is vehemently anti-abortion - voting against federal funding of abortion , stem cell research and even family planning funding in U.S. foreign aid - and strongly pro-gun rights .
His views have gained him high ratings from conservatives and groups such as the Christian Coalition and the National Rifle Association .
Paul also is seen as strongly anti-environmental by groups such as the League of Conservation Voters , which gave him just a 5 percent legislative rating on his voting record .
But Paul also appeals to progressives on a number of issues :
He supports repealing most federal drug laws , including those against medical marijuana , is against the death penalty , vigorously opposes the war in Iraq and is against the Patriot Act and free trade agreements such as NAFTA .
Indeed , some political analysts suggested he is the 2008 campaign 's political ink blot test - able to represent whatever voters see in him .
" Ron Paul is the perfect place for Republicans who are upset to park their anger , " said Sacramento - based GOP consultant Patrick Dorinson .
Paul , he said , appeals to some voters who are looking for a candidate who " goes against the grain ... like Ross Perot . "
Dorinson predicted that , like Perot 's campaign , the Ron Paul Revolution " will fizzle after the first shots are fired in January .
He has no organization ... it 's one thing to say to a pollster what you will do - and another to actually do it . "
Gloria Nieto , a South Bay Democratic activist , said that she 's seen " so much grassroots activism going on for Ron Paul ; it 's really plugged in .
They feel really strongly that he 's the answer . "
But she noted that " it 's interesting spectrum ... anti-war to anti-choice .
Who are these people ? "
Some Republicans said Paul 's campaign is the antidote to the disappointments of the Bush presidency and what they call a straying from core GOP values .
" The last six years of GOP rule in Washington , D.C. , is something most Republicans would like to forget about , " wrote Alan Bartlett , a blogger on the popular California GOP Web site , Flashreport.org .
" Unfortunately for us , the voters have n't forgotten about it , and they threw us out of office in 2006 .
We have a chance to get it right again , though , by supporting Ron Paul . "
That was echoed inside the Ron Paul meetup among eager volunteers armed with " Ron Paul , Hope for America " signs .
Stephanie Burns , 50 , a construction manager from Sausalito who helps arrange biweekly Bay Area meetings in support of Paul , said the Texas congressman 's campaign - like Democrat Howard Dean 's in 2004 - has skillfully utilized the Internet to reach out to voters who might otherwise never be connected .
" And ever since the $ 4.2 million , it has changed things , " she said .
" There 's a lot more recognition by the media . "
Burns motioned around the room to some of the people the Internet has brought to Paul 's cause .
" I 've never even been interested in politics my whole life , " Brandy Alexander , 34 , a UCSF researcher , told the group .
But after she and her boyfriend , William Newby , 28 , a computer programmer , watched Paul slam U.S. involvement in the Iraq war and expound on his views during the televised GOP debates , they were hooked .
Thanks to Paul , she said , " Now , I find myself borderline obsessed with it . "

I know quite a few political conservative Americans who have made a conscientious switch from being Republican to become a Democrat in the last five years .
I have watched carefully over the past few years as it dawned on the American people that the leader they elected was leading the country to ruin .
Moreover , this phenomenon of conservative Americans turning to the Democratic Party for guidance is not occurring in a trickling state , but as a waterfall .
Although this trend has been going on for a few years now , it was last week when I talked to my brother that I realized just how serious this could be for the Republican Party .
If someone wanted to know how to define a conservative American , my brother would be the perfect example .
He is a God-fearing man from America ’s heartland whose principles line up with that of the Republican Party .
Just a few short years ago my brother would rather have eaten dirt than to say Hillary Clinton should be in the White House .
Although my brother is very smart , I never gave him credit for being able to see the impact U.S. policy has beyond the shores of America .
While talking on the phone the other day , he made a startling statement to me that caused me to rethink my brother as a person .
My brother – the strict conservative Republican – intends to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2008 if she gets the nomination .
For someone like my brother to decide to vote for a Democrat ( and Hillary at that ! ) in the next national election means that a new day has truly dawned in the U.S.
This means that even the staunchest of Republicans are realizing that a great wrong has been done and it is up to the voters to make it right again .
It is one thing for a woman or a loyal Democrat to say that one intends to vote for Hillary Clinton .
It is a whole other story for a highly conservative white man from Middle America ( like my brother ) to declare that he believes Hillary Clinton is the only one who can save our country from the disaster Bush and his administration has created .
I have seen many people make this switch from the Republican Party to be a Democrat .
I have seen those in the military make the switch in droves .
Even the July 9 issue of Fortune Magazine declared on its front page , “ Business Loves Hillary . ”
In smaller letters below the headline and in parentheses it then said , “ Who Knew ? ”
Indeed , who would have ever thought big business would support a Democrat as a candidate since the Dems are typically known for championing the plight of the poor and middle class .
The rich have always despised the Democrat candidates .
What a switch !
I made the switch as well , but mine was made early on when it was apparent that Bush intended to start an unprovoked war regardless of what the American people wanted .
I was one of those voters looking around in disbelief that such a leader could get voted back into office to cause more harm after the last elections .
Hillary Clinton is just one of the many viable Democratic presidential candidates .
There are a handful of potentials to choose from – each just as qualified as the next .
My astute brother pointed out to me that it was not worth the time to even browse the poor selection of Republican candidates .
I still cannot seem to fathom that my conservative brother is voting as a Democrat .
It would appear that Bush is the best thing that has happened to Democrats in a very long time .
During the congressional elections last November , the American people gave the Democrats control of Congress and as a result , this week the poorest of the nation have seen the first rise in minimum wage in ten very long years .
Hillary Clinton ’s response to the fact that big business supports her candidacy was that CEOs and other business leaders “ know I ’m trying to figure out how we can have shared prosperity . ”
Let me get this straight , Clinton is suggesting shared prosperity and big business is still supporting her ?
I am completely convinced that because of Bush , there is nothing the Democratic leaders can do wrong at this point .
Morgan Stanely CEO , John Mack , is a long - time Republican who has been won over by Clinton as well .
Morgan Stanely is a U.S. multi-billion dollar investment company that has over 55,000 employees .
When conservative Americans , like my brother , and big business CEOs , like John Mack , voice their obvious support for a Democratic presidential candidate , it is clear that the very foundation of American politics is changing .
Although I loathe the way this change has come about – with the lives of so many by way of Bush ’s unjustified war in Iraq – it is encouraging to know that people are willing to change even their core belief systems if they recognize a leader intends to use their loyalty for evil purposes .
I am very comforted that my own brother , someone whom I always viewed as immovable when it came to politics and religion , is actually far more open - minded than I could have ever dreamed .
I do not even want to think of what this world would be like if people like my brother continued to believe the government ’s lies .
It gives me hope to know that so many are willing to change their entire political orientation to do what is right for the nation and for the world .

Here ’s how high Trita Parsi thinks the stakes are getting on the Iran question : “ In the next couple of months , we may end up in a military conflict between these countries , ” the Iranian - American scholar said in San Francisco last week , referring to the United States , Israel , and Iran .
Parsi , who supports diplomacy and thinks it has a fair shot , believes this type of conflict “ would be an absolute shame , ” not to mention what a war between these nations would actually mean .
For any attack to effectively reverse Iran ’s nuclear capability , Parsi said , “ you would have to kill 6,000 Iranian nuclear scientists . ”
Speaking to a full house at the World Affairs Council just up Sutter Street from Mother Jones ‘ headquarters , Parsi unpacked the thesis of his new book , Treacherous Alliance : The Secret Dealings of Israel , Iran , and the United States , which came out in August .
The book provides reason for hope that we are n’t — or at least do n’t need to be — bound for World War III .
His thesis is that rhetoric and ideology , while important , have been overemphasized in most analyses of Iranian - American - Israeli relations .
The key to understanding both the present and history of the trilateral relationship , instead , is good old - fashioned geopolitics .
Iran is not Nazi Germany reincarnate , Parsi argues ; it is not hell - bent on destroying America .
Why , he offers as one example , did the Iranians assist the U.S. “ tremendously ” in Afghanistan after 9/11 ?
Well , Iran had been supporting the Northern Alliance for over a decade .
And it was in their strategic interest to get rid of the Taliban .
That “ showed that when neither the United States or Iran are trying to exclude the other from the process , they could actually work well together , ” Parsi said .
He lays out some important points in a recent Nation article .
And before you pigeonhole Parsi as a man of the left , read his essay on Mideast power politics in the American Conservative .
Parsi has lately been filling a gaping void in the commentariat for a sensible Iran expert who understands that it ’s 2007 , not 1938 .
In just the past few weeks he ’s been quoted in the New York Times and the Los Angles Times , been interviewed on Diane Rehm and Morning Edition , and garnered links online .
Parsi has sterling establishment credentials as well .
( Interestingly , his doctoral thesis adviser at John Hopkins was ex-neocon Francis Fukuyama . )
But more importantly , Parsi is articulate and TV - ready .
And , as a charismatic young Iranian - American , he is a visible reminder that Bush & Co. ’s tough talk is aimed at a real country populated by real people .
Here ’s to hoping we start seeing Parsi ’s friendly face much more often .

Heading for the hills ?
Planning on taking a rifle with you ?
With the system described below , and currently available armed / unmanned drone technology , a lethal and autonomous response to trespassers / intruders / enemy combatants / etc. is easily possible .
Right now .
Autonomous acquisition and engagement of human targets is old news .
See Israel ’s robotic gun turrets .
Picking out individuals for termination from a crowd will take a few years ( requires human middleware for now ) , but to have a robot autonomously kill people in a specified area is easily doable now .
Drones could orbit a huge area , looking for heat signatures on their own , or waiting to respond to a target picked up by one of these ferrous metal detecting ground sensors .
If the operators wish , the weapon system could acquire and terminate the target autonomously , keep it under surveillance or have a human pull the trigger .
The point is to automate the lockdown .
The military has used ground sensors for decades .
I do n’t follow the specifics , but I ’d be surprised if they have n’t used something like this for a long , long time .
I ’m mentioning this because the technology is now using ubiquitous , civilian grade gear .
Off the shelf .
Internet based .
Inexpensive .
Coming to a wilderness retreat near you .
Ahhh , maybe the Blackwater boys will run some of these hunter killer networks .
One merc , a few drones and a BIG area .
Via : MIT Technology Review :
The closest that park officials often get to catching poachers is stumbling across carcasses days or weeks after the culprits have fled the scene .
Now a new surveillance system may help locate , track , and intercept poachers before they strike .
The system consists of a network of foot - long metal detectors similar to those used in airports .
When moving metal objects such as a machete or a rifle trip the sensor , it sends a radio signal to a wireless Internet gateway camouflaged in the tree canopy as far as a kilometer away .
This signal is transmitted via satellite to the Internet , where the incident is logged and messages revealing the poachers ’ position and direction are sent instantly to park headquarters , where patrols can then be dispatched .
“ [ This system ] is a force multiplier , ” says Steve Gulick , an electrical engineer and director of Wildland Security , a Brooklyn - based organization that develops antipoaching technology .
“ It could potentially make the patrols more efficient .
They would know where to go and could mount a real - time response . ”
The Halo Effect : When Your Own Mind is a Mystery
• Next article in this series : How and Why We Lie to Ourselves : Cognitive Dissonance • Previous article :
The idea that global evaluations about a person bleed over into judgements about their specific traits .
The ‘ halo effect ’ is a classic finding in social psychology .
It is the idea that global evaluations about a person ( e.g. she is likeable ) bleed over into judgements about their specific traits ( e.g. she is intelligent ) .
Hollywood stars demonstrate the halo effect perfectly .
Because they are often attractive and likeable we naturally assume they are also intelligent , friendly , display good judgement and so on .
That is , until we come across ( sometimes plentiful ) evidence to the contrary .
In the same way politicians use the ‘ halo effect ’ to their advantage by trying to appear warm and friendly , while saying little of any substance .
People tend to believe their policies are good , because the person appears good .
It ’s that simple .
But you would think we could pick up these sorts of mistaken judgements by simply introspecting and , in a manner of speaking , retrace our thought processes back to the original mistake .
In the 1970s , well - known social psychologist Richard Nisbett set out to demonstrate how little access we actually have to our thought processes in general and to the halo effect in particular .
Likeability of lecturers
Nisbett and Wilson wanted to examine the way student participants made judgements about a lecturer ( Nisbett & Wilson , 1977 ) .
Students were told the research was investigating teacher evaluations .
Specifically , they were told , the experimenters were interested in whether judgements varied depending on the amount of exposure students had to a particular lecturer .
This was a total lie .
In fact the students had been divided into two groups who were going to watch two different videos of the same lecturer , who happened to have a strong Belgian accent ( this is relevant ! ) .
One group watched the lecturer answer a series of questions in an extremely warm and friendly manner .
The second group saw exactly the same person answer exactly the questions in a cold and distant manner .
Experimenters made sure it was obvious which of the lecturers alter - egos was more likeable .
In one he appeared to like teaching and students and in the other he came across as a much more authoritarian figure who did n’t like teach at all .
After each group of students watched the videos they were asked to rate the lecturer on physical appearance , mannerisms and even his accent ( mannerisms were kept the same across both videos ) .
Consistent with the halo effect , students who saw the ‘ warm ’ incarnation of the lecturer rated him more attractive , his mannerisms more likeable and even is accent as more appealing .
This was unsurprising as it backed up previous work on the halo effect .
Unconscious judgements
The surprise is that students had no clue whatsoever why they gave one lecturer higher ratings , even after they were given every chance .
After the study it was suggested to them that how much they liked the lecturer might have affected their evaluations .
Despite this , most said that how much they liked the lecturer from what he said had not affected their evaluation of his individual characteristics at all .
For those who had seen the badass lecturer the results were even worse – students got it the wrong way around .
Some thought their ratings of his individual characteristics had actually affected their global evaluation of his likeability .
Even after this , the experimenters were not satisfied .
They interviewed students again to ask them whether it was possible their global evaluation of the lecturer had affected their ratings of the lecturer ’s attributes .
Still , the students told them it had n’t .
They were convinced they had made their judgement about the lecturer ’s physical appearance , mannerisms and accent without considering how likeable he was .
Common uses of the halo effect
The halo effect in itself is fascinating and now well - known in the business world .
According to ‘ Reputation Marketing ‘ by John Marconi , books that have ‘ Harvard Classics ’ written on the front can demand twice the price of the exact same book without the Harvard endorsement .
The same is true in the fashion industry .
The addition of a well - known fashion designer ’s name to a simple pair of jeans can inflate their price tremendously .
But what this experiment demonstrates is that although we can understand the halo effect intellectually , we often have no idea when it is actually happening .
This is what makes it such a useful effect for marketers and politicians .
We quite naturally make the kinds of adjustments demonstrated in this experiment without even realising it .
And then , even when it ’s pointed out to us , we may well still deny it .
So , the next time you vote for a politician , consider buying a pair of designer jeans or decide whether you like someone , ask yourself whether the halo effect is operating .
Are you really evaluating the traits of the person or product you thought you were ?
Alternatively is some global aspect bleeding over into your specific judgement ?
This simple check could save you voting for the wrong person , wasting your money or rejecting someone who would be a loyal friend .
Or perhaps , even if you do check , you ’ll still never know … Gulp .

Atkin ’s Architecture Group recently won the first prize award for an international design competition with this stunning entry .
Set in a spectacular water filled quarry in Songjiang , China , the 400 bed resort hotel is uniquely constructed within the natural elements of the quarry .
Underwater public areas and guest rooms add to the uniqueness , but the resort also boasts cafes , restaurants and sporting facilities .
The lowest level runs with the aquatic theme by housing a luxurious swimming pool and an extreme sports centerf or activities such as rock climbing and bungee jumping which will be cantilevered over the quarry and accessed by speciallifts from the water .
With a stunning visual presentation as shown here , it ’s no wonder this project took home the first prize .
This is a fine example of an ultra modern facility co-existing amongst its natural environment .

California sued the Environmental Protection Agency to force it to decide immediately on the state ’s application to impose strict limits on emissions of heat - trapping gases from cars and light trucks .
The application for a waiver from federal law to allow tougher air quality rules than those mandated by the E.P.A. has been pending for nearly two years .
Automakers oppose the rules , saying they are unattainable at reasonable cost .
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a Republican , said the federal government had no basis to deny the waiver .
“ Our health and our environment are too important to delay any longer , ” he said .
Fourteen other states , including New York , New Jersey and Connecticut , joined California in seeking the new emissions rules , which would require automakers to reduce emissions from current levels by 30 percent or more by the 2016 model year .
The nation 's centralized watch list has grown to include 755,000 names suspected of having terrorist ties , resulting in nearly 20,000 positive matches of persons against the list in 2006 , according to a new report from Congress 's investigative reporting arm .
Since the list is now used in nearly all routine police stops and for domestic airline travel , Americans made up the bulk of those matches .
The Government Accountablity Office 's report was presented in a hearing to the Senate 's Homeland Security Committee Wednesday , causing senators to express concern about the size and effectiveness of the list .
The GAO report ( full pdf , html summary ) included a few new details about the list 's size and operation but much of this was reported by Wired months ago .
The Terrorist Screening Center runs the list , which is created from nominations from a wide array of government agencies via the National Counter Terrorism Center .
The watch list entries are used to check persons seeking visas , travellers entering or leaving the country , domestic airline passengers and persons stopped by state , local or federal law enforcement .
Most of the positive matches on the list came from police routinely checking persons , such as speeding motorists , against the list , according to the Government Accountablity Office 's report ( .pdf ) .
The TSA is responsible for resolving mismatches , which can happen when an innocent person 's name is similar or the same as different , watch listed person .
The number of individuals on the list may be significantly less than three quarters of a million , since the name count include aliases .
Since list entries are coded with varying suspected threat levels , simply being on the watch list does n't mean one will be arrested .
In fact , being on the watchlist is n't even enough to ensure that a person is denied a visa or entry into the country , according to the report .
The GAO , at the request of the feds , removed information about how often the list has been used to arrest suspected terrorists or keep them out of the county .
It also does n't report the number of times people were falsely matched to the list .
But the report says the feds say it is effective .
Our analysis of data on the outcomes of encounters revealed that agencies took a range of actions , such as arresting individuals , denying others entry into the United States , and most commonly , releasing the individuals following questioning and information gathering .
TSC data show that agencies reported arresting many subjects of watch list records for various reasons , such as the individual having an outstanding arrest warrant or the individual ’s behavior or actions during the encounter .
TSC data also indicated that some of the arrests were based on terrorism grounds .
Individuals who believe they are on the list erroneously or because of a confusion over their name can apply for help through the DHS Advise system , but it is not set up to allow people to contest the information that got them on the list .
Homeland Security officials defended the list 's size and said they were working to make sure that watch listed individuals did not get past airline checks , according to the Voice of America .
Homeland Security Assistant Secretary of Policy , Paul Rosenzweig : " We have made great strides , " he said .
" More work needs to be done , but the improvement is quite noticeable . "
The chairman of the Senate committee , Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut , expressed concern about the growth of the terrorist watch list , which the GAO report says has grown from 158,000 in June 2004 to 860,000 today .
" With the list likely to go over one million names in the near future , we need to know that there are clear standards for placing names on it and of course taking them off it , " he said .
But Leonard Boyle , director of the Terrorist Screening Center , says the list is actually much smaller than described by the GAO because some people may be on the list more than once if their names are listed under multiple spellings .[...]
Boyle says federal agencies have agreed to a set of procedures to allow people who believe they were wrongly added to the watch list a timely , fair and accurate review of their cases .
Other adjectives that apply to the DHS review process include one - sided , secretive , administrative , and non-reviewable .

It is still not known why Israel carried out the strike or what was hit
Syria accused Israel at the time but Israeli officials refused to comment , and the Israeli military censor imposed a strict blackout on information .
The censor 's office has now allowed some details to be released .
On Monday , Syrian President Bashar al - Assad told the BBC that a Syrian military construction site was hit in the Israeli air strike on 6 September .
President Assad said the raid demonstrated Israel 's " visceral antipathy towards peace " - and Syria reserved the right to retaliate .
Syria and Israel are formally at war .
Israel has occupied the Golan Heights since 1967 .
Peace talks between them collapsed in 2000 .
Mystery remains
In the early hours of 6 September a number of Israeli jets appeared to enter Syrian airspace from the Mediterranean Sea .
Later , unidentified drop tanks , which may have contained fuel from the planes , were found on Turkish soil near the Syrian border , indicating a possible exit route .
Witnesses said the Israeli jets had been engaged by Syrian air defences in Tall al - Abyad , north of Raqqa and near the border with Turkey .
It is still not known why Israel carried out the strike or what exactly was hit .
On Tuesday , Israeli Army radio reported that Israeli planes had attacked a military target " deep inside Syria " , quoting the military censor .
No further details were given .
Some US officials have linked the raid to suspicions of secret nuclear co-operation between Damascus and North Korea , suggesting a fledgling research centre may have been the target .
Damascus and North Korea have denied any nuclear ties .
Other reports suggested that the raid may have targeted Iranian arms bound for the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah , or materials going in the other direction , to Iran .
Another theory is that it was simply an Israeli test of Syria 's improving air defences .
Correspondents say there has been some suggestive leaking from Washington , but that the usual diplomatic sources have been uncharacteristically quiet over the incident .
Syria ' may retaliate '
The incident is still shrouded in mystery , says the BBC 's world affairs correspondent , Nick Childs .
Was Israel just sending a message , he wonders , and if so , to whom ?
And are others now exploiting the ambiguities in all this to peddle their own political agendas - for example , to unnerve Syria or Iran , or to discredit North Korea ?
If nothing else , it is all a reminder of what a volatile mixture of interrelated tensions is present in the region , our correspondent says .
Syria 's president told the BBC that Syria reserved the right to respond to the attack - but he did not say how .
" Retaliate does n't mean missile for missile and bomb for bomb .
We have our means to retaliate , maybe politically , maybe in other ways .
But we have the right to retaliate , " Mr Assad said .

There are some historical mysteries that may never be solved .
Sometimes , that 's because the relevant excavated material has been lost or an archaeological site has been destroyed .
Other times , it 's because new evidence is unlikely to come forward or the surviving evidence is too vague to lead scholars to a consensus .
The lack of answers only makes these enigmas more intriguing .
Here , Live Science takes a look at 10 of these historical questions that may never have definitive explanations .
Who was Jack the Ripper ?
( Image credit : Pyty / Shutterstock.com )
In 1888 , Jack the Ripper killed at least five women in London , mutilating their bodies .
A number of letters , supposedly from the Ripper , were sent to police taunting officers ' efforts to find the Ripper .
( Whether any of them were actually written by the Ripper is a matter of debate among scholars . )
The name " Jack the Ripper " comes from these letters .
Needless to say , the Ripper was never found , and over the years , dozens of people have been brought up as possible candidates .
A recent book suggested that a woman named Lizzie Williams was the Ripper , although other Ripper experts cast doubt on it .
It appears unlikely that the true identity of the Ripper will ever be known for sure .
Where is Jimmy Hoffa ?
( Image credit : Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication )
The teamster union leader known for his involvement in organized crime disappeared in Oakland County , Michigan , on July 30 , 1975 , and is now presumed to be dead .
The identity of his killer (s ) and the location of his body are ongoing mysteries .
Police and forensic anthropologists have searched a number of sites in Detroit and Oakland County to no avail .
One popular theory was that Hoffa 's body was buried beneath Giants Stadium in New Jersey .
However , this theory has been debunked .
The identity of his killer is also unclear .
Before his death in 2006 , Richard " The Iceman " Kuklinski , a hit man , claimed to have killed Hoffa and dumped his body in a scrap yard .
An author named Philip Carlo visited Kuklinski in prison before he died and wrote a book on Kuklinski's confessions .
After the book came out a number of police officers cast doubt on the confession in media interviews .
As the years go by , it appears increasingly unlikely that Hoffa 's remains will ever be found .
Where is Cleopatra 's tomb ?
( Image credit : Public Domain )
Ancient writers claim that Cleopatra VIIand her lover , Mark Antony , were buried together in a tomb after their deaths in 30 B.C. The writer Plutarch ( A.D. 45 - 120 ) wrote that the tomb was located near a temple of Isis , an Egyptian goddess , and was a " lofty and beautiful " monument containing treasures made of gold , silver , emeralds , pearls , ebony and ivory .
The location of the tomb remains a mystery .
In 2010 , Zahi Hawass , Egypt 's former antiquities minister , conducted excavations at a site near Alexandria now called Taposiris Magna , which contains a number of tombs dating to the era when Cleopatra VII ruled Egypt .
While many interesting archaeological discoveries were made , Cleopatra VII 's tomb was not among them Hawass reported in a series of news releases .
Archaeologists have noted that even if Cleopatra 's tomb does survive to this day , it may be heavily plundered and unidentifiable .
Who killed JFK ?
( Image credit : Walt Cisco , Dallas Morning News ; Public Domain )
This is probably the biggest mystery in American history that will never be resolved to everyone 's satisfaction .
On Nov. 22 , 1963 , President John F. Kennedy was shot in Dallas by Lee Harvey Oswald ( although some speculate that he was n't the only one shooting ) .
On Nov. 24 , 1963 , before Oswald could stand trial , Oswald was fatally shot by nightclub owner Jack Ruby .
Ruby died of lung cancer on Jan. 3 , 1967 . [ 10 Persistent Kennedy Assassination Theories ]
The most widely accepted explanation is that Oswald killed JFK on his own and Ruby killed Oswald , on his own volition .
Ruby 's stated motivation was to spare Jacqueline Kennedy " the discomfiture of [ Oswald ] coming back to trial . "
However there are still a significant number of professional historians , along with many amateurs , who do not agree with this explanation and since JFK 's death , numerous alternative explanationshave been brought forward by historians and amateurs .
Given that significant new evidence is unlikely to appear , a firm consensus will probably never be reached .
Is there a money pit on Oak Island ?
( Image credit : Public domain )
For more than two centuries , stories have circulated that Oak Island , located off Nova Scotia , Canada , held a money pit of buried treasure — supposedly left by the pirate Capt.
William Kidd( 1645-1701 ) .
Over that time , numerous expeditions costing millions of dollars have traveled to the island searching for the lost treasure , to no avail .
[ The 10 Most Notorious Pirates Ever ]
Despite centuries of searching no treasure has been found on Oak Island .
Nevertheless that does n't stop people from trying to find it .
A History Channel show called the " Curse of Oak Island " follows a modern - day expedition ; the show was just renewed for a fourth season in 2016 .
Is the Copper Scroll treasure real ?
( Image credit : Public Domain )
Another treasure tale that will probably never be resolved is more ancient .
In 1952 a copper scroll was found by archaeologists in a cave , along with other Dead Sea Scrolls , at the site of Qumran .
As its name suggests , the writing was engraved onto a copper scroll .
The scroll records a vast amount of hidden gold and silver treasure — so much , in fact , that some scholars believe that it is impossible for it to exist .
[ Gallery of Dead Sea Scrolls : A Glimpse of the Past ]
The scroll dates back more than 1,900 years to a time when the Roman Empire controlled the Qumran area .
There were a number of revolts against Roman rule at the time the scroll was written , and scientists have hypothesized that the treasure was hidden to prevent its capture by Roman forces .
Whether the treasure is real , where exactly it was hidden , whether it was ever found and whether it could still exist today are all mysteries that will likely never be solved .
What 's the fate of the Ark of the Covenant ?
( Image credit : Photo by I. Vassil , released into public domain through Wikimedia )
In 587 B.C. , a Babylonian army , under King Nebuchadnezzar II , conquered Jerusalem , sacking the city and destroying the First Temple , a building used by the Jewish people to worship god .
The First Temple contained the Ark of the Covenant , which carried tablets recording the 10 Commandments .
The fate of the Ark is unclear .
Ancient sources indicate that the ark was either carried back to Babylonor hidden before the city was captured .
It 's also possible that the ark was destroyed during the city 's sacking .
In any event , the ark 's location is unknown .
Since the disappearance , a number of stories and legends about the ark 's fate have been told .
One story suggests the ark eventually made its way to Ethiopia , where it is kept today .
Another story says the ark was divinely hidden and will not appear until a messiah arrives .
Were the Hanging Gardens of Babylon real ?
( Image credit : garanga / Shutterstock.com )
Ancient writers describe a fantastic series of gardens constructed at the ancient city of Babylonin modern - day Iraq .
It 's not clear when these gardens were built , but some ancient writers were so impressed by the gardens that they called them a " wonder of the world . "
Around 250 B.C. , Philo of Byzantium wrote that the Hanging Gardens had " plants cultivated at a height above ground level , and the roots of the trees are embedded in an upper terrace rather than in the earth . "
So far , archaeologists who have excavated Babylon have been unable to find the remains of a garden that meets this description .
This has left archaeologists with a question :
Did the hanging gardens really exist ?
In ­2013 , Stephanie Dalley , a researcher at the University of Oxford , proposed in a book that the gardens were actually located at the Assyrian city of Nineveh .
Over the past two decades , both Babylon and Nineveh have suffered damage from wars and looting , and it seems unlikely that this mystery will ever be fully solved .
Is there a City of Atlantis ?
Writing in the fourth century B.C. , the Greek philosopher Plato told a story of a land named Atlantisthat existed in the Atlantic Ocean and supposedly conquered much of Europe and Africa in prehistoric times .
In the story , the prehistoric Athenians strike back against Atlantis in a conflict that ends with Atlantis vanishing beneath the waves .
While no serious scholar believes that this story is literally true , some have speculated that the legend could have been inspired , in part , by real events that happened in Greek history .
One possibility is that the Minoan civilization ( as it's now called ) , which flourished on the island of Crete until about 1400 B.C. , could have inspired the story of Atlantis .
Although Crete is in the Mediterranean , and not the Atlantic , Minoan settlements suffered considerable damageduring the eruption of Thera , a volcano in Greece .
Additionally , archaeologists found that the Minoans were eventually overcome ( or forced to join with ) a group of people called the Mycenaeans , who were based on mainland Greece .
It 's unlikely that this debate will ever be fully settled .
What was Jesus really like ?
( Image credit : Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike 3.0 Unported )
The earliest surviving gospels date to the second century , almost 100 years after the life of Jesus ( although recently , it was announced that a possible first - century fragmenthad been found ) .
The lack of surviving first - century texts about Jesus leave biblical scholars with a number of questions .
When were the gospels written ?
How many of the stories actually took place ?
What was Jesus like in real life ?
Archaeological investigations of Nazareth , Jesus ' hometown , reveal more about the environment where he grew up .
More recently , scientists discovered a first - century housethat , centuries after Jesus ' time , was venerated as being the house that Jesus grew up in , but whether it was actually Jesus ' house is unknown .
Although new research will provide more insight , scholars think it 's unlikely they will ever fully know what Jesus was really like .

It looks like those complaining of problems with the iPod touch 's screen were n't seeing things , as Apple has now reportedly confirmed that at least some early units did indeed ship with defective screens .
That bit of news comes at the tail end of a review of the player by none other than Walt Mossberg , who reports that Apple says the problem affected a " small number of units " and that it is " being remedied . "
Exactly what that remedy entails , however , is unclear , as is the exact number of units affected .
In related news , there 's also been a few unconfirmed reports cropping up of similarly dim screens on newer iPhones , with the problem seemingly traced to units released after the now infamous price cut .
No word from Apple on that , but if your new iPhone 's display looks a little off , feel free to let us know .

LOLCode.net - Now your LOLCats can use the CLR !

The past few days , I 've been working on a .NET compiler for the LOLCode language .
LOLCode is an emerging esoteric ( and hilarious ) language based on the dialect used in LOLCats images .
It 's been siezed upon by a group of people ( myself included , now ) , and is being expanded into a real , workable , turing complete esoteric language ( though nobody has proven its turing completeness yet ! ) .
The LOLCode .NET compiler is now working , and as a nearly - free bonus for using the .NET platform , you can even debug it in Visual Studio : I still can't believe I 'm looking at LOLCode and its x86 disassembly in Visual Studio .

The people who control AACS , the copy protection technology used on HD - DVD and Blu-ray discs , are apparently trying to shut down websites that publish a certain 128 - bit integer .
The number is apparently a “ processing key ” used in AACS .
Together with a suitable computer program , the key allows the decryption of video content on most existing HD - DVD and Blu-ray discs .
I wo n’t publish the key here but you can spot it all over the Web .
It ’s a long string starting with “ 09 F9 ” .
The key has been published on a few websites for months , but in recent days the AACS “ Licensing Authority ” ( AACS LA ) has taken to sending out demand letters to websites that publish the key , claiming that the key is a circumvention technology under the DMCA .
News of these demand letters , and the subsequent disappearance of content and whole sites from the Net , has triggered an entirely predictable backlash , with thousands of people reposting the key to their own sites .
The key will inevitably remain available , and AACSLA are just making themselves look silly by trying to suppress it .
We ’ve seen this script before .
The key will show up on T - shirts and in song lyrics .
It will be chalked on the sidewalk outside the AACS LA office .
And so on .
It ’s hard to see the logic in AACS LA ’s strategy here .
Their end goal is ( or should be ) to stop unauthorized online distribution of high - def video files ripped from HD - DVD or Blu-ray discs .
The files in question are enormous and cumbersome to store and distribute , containing more than a gigabyte of content .
If you ca n’t stop distribution of these huge files , surely there ’s no hope of stopping distribution of a little sixteen - byte key , or even of decryption software containing the key .
Whatever tactics can stop distribution of the key should be even more effective against distribution of movies .
My guess is that AACS LA miscalculated , thinking that a few demand letters would succeed in suppressing the key .
As the key spread , it seemed natural to continue sending letters – to do otherwise would be an admission of defeat .
Now the key is spread so widely that there ’s no point in sending any more letters .
The next question is whether AACS LA will try to sue somebody who defied a demand letter .
There ’s no real strategic point to such a suit , but even big organizations act out of spite sometimes .
Mitt Romney thinks it 's just awful that Barack Obama has been honest about past experience with alcohol and illegal drugs :
" It 's just not a good idea for people running for President of the United States who potentially could be the role model for a lot of people to talk about their personal failings while they were kids because it opens the doorway to other kids thinking , ' well I can do that too and become President of the United States , ' " Romney told an Iowa audience today .
" I think that was a huge error by Barack Obama … it is just the wrong way for people who want to be the leader of the free world . "
[ FOXNews ]
But , um , you can do drugs and become the President .
This has been proven time and again as of late and it's actually a terrible idea to suggest otherwise .
Young people need to know that they can make mistakes and still be successful .
Heck , young people should even know that drug use is often not a mistake if done responsibly at the appropriate age .
The problem with convincing them that drug use ruins your future is that they might believe you and just give up .
Really , there is nothing more harmful and destructive than attempting to educate children about drugs by lying about your own experiences .
Young people need someone to talk to .
They need to know that you understand , and the best way to create that environment is by being honest .
If you do understand , do n't pretend not to .
That 's insane .
The truth here is that Barack Obama 's experience with drug use is typical .
He experimented , aged out of it , and went on to pursue a rewarding career .
There 's nothing miraculous or shocking about his failure to become a walking after - school special .
Most people do n't .
But if Barack Obama has been unlucky enough to get arrested , I doubt we 'd even know his name .
Indeed , drug use wo n't disqualify you from a high profile career , but the drug war will crush your dreams every time .
If we want to send children the right message about drugs , let 's stop threatening to arrest and ruin them for things so many of us did without consequence .

I ’ve seen numerous posts on different discussion boards posted by new Mac users wanting to learn to write code for the Mac .
The main complaint is that Interface Builder is too different from the existing documentation , including Aaron Hillegass ’s excellent Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X ( which actually remains very relevant , by the way .
You can wait for some updated books to come out , but Aaron ’s book still provides a lot of concepts and even methods that apply .
You just need to know what ’s changed in XCode 3 and Objective - C 2 ) .
So , I ’m going to do a quick tutorial here .
FULL DISCLOSURE : I learned this from Marcus Zarra , so credit where credit is due . ;-)
Here are some points that you should keep in mind before moving ahead :
Do n’t use Interface Builder to generate code .
Create your code in XCode and let Interface Builder work with it .
This is n’t absolutely necessary , but as Marcus told me , it ’s just easier to get in this habit as the XCode 2 method of creating your controller , instantiating it , and generating your code files from Interface Builder simply is n’t available in the same way in XCode 3.0 .
I ’ve come to see what Marcus is saying .
It makes sense , but you ’ll have to get into the process yourself to fully understand it .
We ’ll get to that in a minute .

We ’ll get to that in a minute .
Understanding Cocoa programming is much simpler if you learn MVC .
You can probably step through code examples and figure some things out without learning MVC ( Model , View , Controller ) , but I would n’t recommend it .
Go Google it and read up on it .
I will say as an introduction to it for those who are not familiar that it should probably be called ( Model Controller View ) or ( View Controller Model ) as the controller always sits between the other two .
Your controller is either telling your model to update its data or it is telling the view to update its display .
That ’s the crux of the whole paradigm .
The details run much deeper , but that ’s how I would nutshell it for you .
Create Your Application
Let ’s get started .
Create a Cocoa Application using the following steps :
Select File > New Project … and choose Cocoa Application in the ensuing dialog .
Click Next Enter ‘ FirstApp ’ as the project name .
Click Finish
You should see a project workspace like the following :
The next thing you should do is create a class to act as your controller or delegate .
Delegate == Controller
The words delegate and controller can be used synonymously .
You ’ll see later that we delegate the work of the different controls we create in Interface Builder to a delegate or controller class .
This should all make perfect sense momentarily .
First , create your controller / delegate class using the following steps :
Option - Click on the Classes folder in your workspace and select ‘ Add File … ’
Choose Object - C Class in the ensuing dialog and click Next
Name the file ‘ AppDelegate .m ’ and click Finish
A new code window will display with your ‘ AppDelegate ’ interface code ( .h file ) .
Add an outlet for a text field and a label , and an action to the code so that it looks like this : @interface AppDelegate : NSObject { IBOutlet NSText
Field * text Field ; IBOutlet NSText
Field * label ; } - ( IBAction ) clickButton :( id ) sender ; @end Now switch over to your implementation file for ‘ AppDelegate ’ ( .m file ) .
Add the clickButton implementation code so that the file looks like this : @implementation AppDelegate - ( void ) clickButton :( id ) sender ; { } @end
We will actually add some code to do something in the clickButton handler , but first we need to hook it up to the user interface in Interface Builder .
Interface Builder And Controller / Delegate Implementation
Now that you ’ve specified the outlets –two NSText Fields , one a text field and one a label in this case–and an action called clickButton , you will see these items available for connecting to the UI in Interface builder .
Let ’s open Interface Builder and make the connections we need using the following steps :
In your XCode workspace , expand the folder in the tree view called NIB Files and double click the file called ‘ MainMenu.nib ’ .
This will open the nib file in Interface Builder
Once Interface Builder loads select the NSObject item and drag it into the ‘ MainMenu.nib ’ window .
Then rename it to ‘ AppDelegate ’
Making Connections ( Pay Attention Here )
These next two steps are critical for your understanding .
You now need to tell Interface Builder the following :
What object you want to use as a File ’s Owner .
You will delegate actions to a delegate / controller object .
You tell the application which object to use by setting the File ’s Owner delegate .
.
You will delegate actions to a delegate / controller object .
You tell the application which object to use by setting the File ’s Owner delegate .
What type of object this delegate is .
Before you can specify which object to use as the File ’s Owner you have to set the object type .
A regular NSObject does n’t provide any implementation for your app .
You need to tell Interface Builder that you want your NSOBject to actually be an object of type ‘ AppDelegate ’ .
You can achieve this by completing the following steps :
If you have n’t already , open the Inspector in Interface Builder by selecting Tools >
Inspector Click on your NSObject that you named ‘ AppDelegate ’ and then click on the Identity tab in the inspector .
Change the class to type ‘ AppDelegate ’ which will be available in Interface Builder as it has been able to obtain the class information from XCode .
You should also notice at this point in the Class Actions and Class Outlets sections of the Inspector , your action , clickButton : and your outlet , the NSText Field are now visible .
We ’ll hook those up in just a minute .
Control - Click the File ’s Owner object in the ‘ MainMenu.nib ’ window and drag it to the ‘ AppDelegate ’ object .
A pop -up list will display .
Select delegate .
Design The User Interface
Now you simply need to add the controls to the main window in Interface Builder and then we can connect the action and outlet accordingly .
To finish the interface , complete the following steps :
Drag a TextField , a Label , and a Button to the main window so that the user interface looks like the screenshot below :
Control - Click and drag from the Buttonto your ‘ AppDelegate ’ object in the ‘ MainMenu.nib ’ window .
A pop-up will display .
Select clickButton :
Control - Click the ‘ AppDelegate ’ object and drag it to the text field in the main form .
A pop-up will display .
Select textField
Control - Click the ‘ AppDelegate ’ object and drag it to the label in the main form .
A pop-up will display .
Select label
That ’s it for Interface Builder .
You can quit interface builder and return to XCode .
We have one more piece of code to add and then our application will be finished .
Finishing Up
When the button is clicked , it will simply grab the text from the text field and place it into the label .
That ’s all the application does .
Here ’s the code you need .
Just make your implementation in the ‘ AppDelegate . m ’ file look like this :
@implementation AppDelegate - ( void ) clickButton :( id ) sender ; { NSString * text = [ text Field stringValue ] ; [ label setStringValue : text ] ; } @end
Now all you need to do is click “ Build and Go ” .
When the application runs , type some text into the text field and click the button .
You will see the label update with the text from the text field .
When I originally tried to build this application , I had to get Marcus ’ help .
Then he showed me a great way to have the label update in real time as you type text into the text field .
It was accomplished using the new @synthesize method in Objective - C 2.0 .
I wo n’t go into the details of that now , but needless to say there are a lot of different ways to achieve what you want for your app .
Further Discussion
It has been most helpful for me while learning to write code for the Mac that from an interface standpoint , there are two entities that you need to be concerned with–actions and outlets .
Outlets are normally UI controls such as text fields , list boxes , and buttons while actions are , well , actions –the action you want to happen when some event from a control is triggered .
If you connect all of your outlets to their declarations in your controller / delegate code implementation , you do n’t have to do any control object instantiation in code .
There may be times when this is desirable , however , most of the time you can just connect and go .
Just use your controls as all of the instantiation / initialization is handled for you by the framework .

Monday , November 5 , 2007 Free Headline Alerts U.S. Fifth Fleet in Gulf exercise for possible war in Iran ABU DHABI — The U.S. Navy launched a series of exercises in the Gulf to enhance skills required in any war with Iran which , according to British press reports , could occur in early 2008 .
The U.S. Fifth Fleet conducted a crisis response exercise that included amphibious , air and medical forces .
The five - day exercise by the USS Wasp , led by Commander Task Force 59 , was scheduled to end on Nov. 5 . The U.S. Fifth Fleet has been operating two strike groups in the Gulf .
The USS Enterprise and USS Kearsarge have also been training in the region .
Also In This Edition Britain plans to send an aircraft carrier , HMS Illustrious , to the region in early 2008 .
Illustrious would be accompanied by the Type 42 destroyer HMS Edinburgh and the Type 23 frigate HMS Westminster .
A British Defense Ministry spokesman said the Royal Navy deployment was not linked to the emerging Western crisis with Iran .
But the London - based Daily Telegraph asserted that the ships might be preparing for war with Teheran in the first half of 2008 .
" The purpose of the exercise is to continually improve the Fifth Fleet skills in completing complex missions that require capabilities broader than one ship or unit , " U.S. Fifth Fleet commander Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff said .
" Naval forces deployed here contribute to building stronger relationships that in turn help underwrite security and stability . "
Officials said the exercise would evaluate the capability of the USS Wasp to respond to oil spills or damage to a coalition ship in the Gulf .
Under the scenario , the Wasp , an assault vessel , would rush personnel and supplies to a targeted area within 72 hours .
" The scenario is challenging but prepares us for a real - world event , " CTF planning officer Cmdr. Jay Chambers said .
" From the table - top discussions , which drew up plans for how our forces will assist , to turning those plans into action , this exercise allowed us to examine the best way to proceed , and to proceed quickly , with providing assistance to any requesting nation . "
The U.S. Navy also said it would deploy the Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group in the Middle East .
The navy said the Truman would be accompanied by the guided missile destroyers Oscar Austin and Winston S. Churchill as well as the guided missile cruiser San Jacinto and the submarine Montpelier .
Britain and Canada would also join the U.S. strike group , the navy said .
" Observers believe that the spring is the last possible moment for President George W Bush to order military strikes against Iran 's nuclear programme , " the Telegraph said .
" The imminence of America 's presidential election may make it impossible for Washington to carry out an attack any later . "

Once a fishing village , the Ernavoor slum is now a refugee hutment – and an easy hunting ground for kidney brokers .
View Slideshow CHENNAI , India – For two years , Maria Selvam was the most respected man in Tsunami Nagar , a desperately poor refugee camp for tsunami survivors in India 's Tamil Nadu province .
As the village 's only elected official , he was the closest thing they had to a celebrity .
His photograph was plastered on the sides of buildings and the entrances to the community .
But lately his popularity has been on the wane .
Rocks have been thrown through most of his posters and local youths have carved away his eyeballs from the images on their walls .
" It used to be that only one woman a month would sell a kidney to a broker , but lately it has gotten a lot worse , " Selvam said .
" Before the meeting , it was two women a week and I knew I had to do something . "
Surgeons , Slums and Money : Organ Trafficking in India Black - Market Scandal Shakes India 's Ban on Organ Sales
Inside ' Kidneyville ' : Rani's Story
Why a Kidney ( Street Value : $ 3,000 ) Sells for $ 85,000
The Case for Mandatory Organ Donation
Portrait : A Land Ravaged by Tsunami and Kidney Brokers
Infographic : Where in the World Can I Buy a Heart ?
In the last three months , 52 Indian hospitals have come under investigation by the Department of Medical Services in one of the country 's broadest crackdowns yet on illegal organ sales .
Of those facilities , two have had their licenses revoked , and 13 remain under investigation .
Selvam is at the center of the firestorm .
After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , it fell to him to represent his village in front of high courts that determined how much aid his community of 2,500 survivors was entitled to .
But for the most part , he says , the government did nothing .
He campaigned tirelessly for what he thought were basics .
He wanted fishing nets so the men of the community could start earning a living again and a small three - wheeled rickshaw to haul the community 's catch to market .
His pleas fell on deaf ears and in January – two years after the tsunami – Selvam decided to play the only card he had left at a meeting scheduled to take place in front of one of Chennai 's most powerful high court justices .
Kidney brokers had long preyed on Tsunami Nagar , and he planned to use the testimony of poor women who were forced to sell their organs to shame the court into finally administering aid .
Even though kidney brokers had plagued his community since before the tsunami , he was sure members of the court would empathize when they heard the stories .
Things did n't go according to plan .
The judge listened carefully , but said he did n't have any aid to distribute .
To make matters worse , the 500 men and women in the audience nearly rioted when they realized that Selvam had betrayed their secret .
Youths shouted that he had dishonored the women of his community by exposing what should have been a private matter .
When he came back to Tsunami Nagar , a gang of young men assaulted him and his son and told him he would never be safe in the town again .
The situation got worse when teams of reporters descended on the village and photos of the women 's scars began to appear on TV .
Some villagers have accused Selvam of taking bribes to arrange the visits .
Regardless of his denials , every television appearance set off a new round of beatings .
Last month , he was forced to flee .
" In other parts of India , people say that they are going to Malaysia or the United States with a glimmer of hope in their eyes , " he told Wired News in a recent interview .
" In Tsunami Nagar people speak that way about selling their kidneys . "
Little more than a decade after enacting a toughly worded ban on human organ sales , India is rethinking its transplant stance amid one of the nation 's worst organ scandals .
The police crackdown in January , instigated in part by Selvam 's charges , has thrown a spotlight on the enormous economic incentives that have kept the kidney farms open , despite all efforts at reform .
And now , the threat of prosecutions has spurred a political backlash from Tamil Nadu 's wealthy and politically connected medical class – many of whom are under investigation – giving new life to long - standing calls for legalization .
It 's too early to read the chances of a significant policy swing .
But , in 13 years , the battle has never been more public , and medical ethicists around the world are watching the political situation closely .
A shift in organ - sale policy here could send shock waves through the international kidney black markets , where prices already appear to be falling in some regions thanks to increased global competition among a growing number of donors eager to escape poverty .
( See our related story on international organ markets . )
Early gains for the legalization side came last month , when the Ministry of Health convened doctors from around the state to offer a solution to the problem .
The majority of doctors who attended were transplant surgeons under investigation for facilitating organ brokering .
The unsurprising – if controversial – resolution was to legalize paid organ donations and hamstring future police efforts to curb organ trafficking .
The stark failures of the current system are partly driving the legalization push .
But not everyone believes opening up kidney sales is the right course , and a bitter fight over the issue is shaping up .
In a recent meeting of the state assembly , Health Minister Ramachandran seemed ambivalent , reiterating his agency 's commitment to enforcing the law , while hinting that greater permissiveness might be desirable .
" While the government is taking all steps to prevent illegal operations , it should also keep in mind the conditions of the patients who badly require kidneys for transplantation , " he said .
Others take a harder stance .
" The argument that law is not able to curb organ trafficking is no justification for allowing organ sale , " said R.R. Kishore , an advocate on the Supreme Court of India and Delhi High Court who helped sign the Transplantation of Human Organs
Act into law in 1994 .
The legalization fight comes as India wrestles to contain an organ scandal that has rocked the medical establishment and drawn worldwide attention .
In February , Wired News reported that more than 500 people across Tamil Nadu were allegedly cheated by kidney brokers who promised to pay several thousand dollars for a kidney , but absconded with the profits after the surgeries .
The news received widespread media coverage when 90 women in Ernavoor , the town where the tsunami refugee camp is located , came forward to tell their tales of poor medical care and exploitation .
A member of the Transplant Authorization Committee , which is in charge of enforcing the ban on commercial transplants , admitted to Wired News on condition of anonymity that the government colluded with brokers to circumvent the laws and authorize thousands of illegal transplants .
He claimed it was the only way to save lives .
Identifying herself only as Rani in a Wired News interview , a woman said her surgery was performed at Devaki Hospital , a major transplant center currently under investigation .
The hospital is expected to escape punishment .
She still keeps all her medical records from the transplant in a chest by her bed – each piece of paper signed by doctors at the hospital .
The facility is run by transplant surgeon K.C. Reddy , one of the most renowned critics of the ban on paid organ donations .
Before the ban was enacted , Reddy ran a clinic that was famous for performing thousands of kidney transplants and making sure donors were well compensated and cared for after the operation .
He has written about overturning the ban on paid donors in scholarly journals and in The Economist ( subscription required ) .
But since police ordered him in January to hand over his transplant records from the previous decade , he has become media shy – he declined to comment for this story .
( In the past he has been quoted as saying : " It is far better to accept , regulate and contain the malpractice in the organ trade rather than to legislate against it – this will only drive the business underground to the ultimate detriment of the donor and the patient . " )
Regardless of the long - term prospects for legalization , few here believe the recent police crackdown will dent live donor sales for long .
Quite simply , the legal supply of organs is woefully inadequate to meet demand .
In Chennai alone , hospitals performed some 2,000 live - donor transplants in 2006 , observers estimate .
Of those , at least 50 involved foreign nationals buying cheap donor organs and paying on average $ 7,000 for a transplant according to the Indian news site Tehelka that cited an unnamed source in the health ministry .
By contrast , a representative of one of the country 's biggest legal cadaver donor programs says the group is hard - pressed to procure more than a dozen organs per year .
" In the long term there is just no doubt that we need to rely more heavily on cadaver donations , but the truth of the current situation is that we are a long way from establishing a system that will work , " said Sumana Sundaram , project coordinator at the Mohan Foundation .
" The supply ( of legal organs ) is n't even close to the demand . "
( See our ( https://www.wired.com/medtech/health/news/2007/05/india_transplants_donorpolicy).)
Even after the police crackdown , some brokers have continued to arrange organ sales with impunity , running high - profile rackets and even maintaining websites advertising their services .
Deeraj Bojwani runs an all - inclusive kidney brokering service out of Mumbai that boasts a smoothly designed service that can circumvent any ethics committee .
Part of why it 's so easy for Bojwani and others to get around the law is because some states stipulate that only relatives or individuals with " love and affection " for the recipient can donate an organ .
So while it 's a stretch to imagine that 's the case between an American from Oklahoma receiving a kidney from a slum dweller in Mumbai , it could also be difficult to prove otherwise .
That ambiguity seems to serve both sides of the debate , offering public approbation while keeping open wide legal loopholes to serve the needs of a lucrative and growing – albeit ostensibly illegal – industry .
As a result , the status quo could well survive intact after a few public trials for the sake of appearances .
" The kidney rackets have been operating in this community for a long time , " admitted V.K. Subburaj , deputy secretary of health and family welfare , in his inaugural address .
" Ninety percent of the donors we know about come from below the poverty line , and 90 percent of those donate for money . "
Meanwhile , Selvam says the government has still given no word about his fishing nets and rickshaw .

Fareed Zakaria deserves a medal for breaking with the mainstream media pack to slap down , with the requisite rudeness , the hysteria over Iran being manufactured by the neocons , opportunist Israeli politicians and the Bush Administration .
Perhaps stung by having participated in a secret Bush Administration policy discussion to help shape the Iraq war policy before the invasion , Zakaria is acting with honor now to prevent another disaster .
This while much of the rest of the media is futzing around asking the wrong questions on Iran and getting the answers that only the wrong questions can produce .
Exhibit A : The Washington Post editorial suggesting that the only “ alternative ” to harsh new sanctions that most of the international community opposes is war , and then scolding “ those who say they oppose military action — including a couple of the second - tier Democratic presidential candidates — to portray the sanctions initiative as a buildup to war by Mr. Bush .
We ’ve seen no evidence that the president has decided on war , and it ’s clear that many senior administration officials understand the package as the best way to avoid military action .
It is not they but those who oppose tougher sanctions who make war with Iran more likely . ”
If and when a war with Iran , with all its terrible consequences that leaves many thousands dead and the U.S. in an even weaker position than it is now , those looking for explanations will do well to remember how their media failed them — with some honorable exceptions .
Of course , the hysteria is being fed by the fact that it ’s an election season here , and a bunch of mediocre candidates is trying to outdo one another by talking tough on Iran , which , as CNN tells us , has become the new Iraq as far as the presidential campaign is concerned .
Of course the push for tougher sanctions shortens the distance to war , and make it more likely , for a simple reason :
Those pushing for them see the sanctions as a “ last hope ” for something they curiously dub “ diplomacy ” , failing which force becomes the “ only alternative . ”
But there wo n’t be tougher sanctions , and not because of the commercial interests of those like Russia and China that oppose them .
The reason there wo n’t be tougher sanctions is that most of the international community recognizes two things :
The balance of power in the region is such that Iran is unlikely to respond to pressure and ultimatums over its nuclear program ( nor , for that matter , is it likely to be deterred by air strikes , for which it will surely retaliate and extract a heavy price from the U.S. and its allies ) .
Second , and , even more important , most of the international community rejects the very premise that Iran ’s nuclear program represents an imminent threat that can only be dealt with by tougher sanctions or military action .
It is , frankly , shocking , that the media allows to pass largely unchallenged remarks such as the one by Condoleezza Rice when announcing new sanctions on Iran , that “ Unfortunately the Iranian government continues to spurn our offer of open negotiations , instead threatening peace and security by pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon , building dangerous ballistic missiles , supporting Shia militants in Iraq and terrorists in Iraq , Afghanistan , Lebanon and the Palestinian territories , and denying the existence of a fellow member of the United Nations , threatening to wipe Israeli off the map . ”
Offer of open negotiations ?
The Bush Administration has made no such offer ; it is the Iranians who have offered unconditional negotiations with the U.S. ( in 2003 ) , only to be given the brush - off by a Bush Administration drunk on its misperception of success in Iraq .
Today the Administration offers talks with Iran , but only if Iran first heeds the U.S. demand that it end its uranium enrichment activities .
That ’s not diplomacy .
In fact , listening to Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail , you get this bizarre definition of “ diplomacy , ” which she uses interchangeably with sanctions .
If you pursue sanctions , you ’re pursuing diplomacy , according to Hillary , not war .
But sanctions are not diplomacy , they ’re simply a non-violent form of punitive action .
Diplomacy involves talking the other side about the most vexed and divisive issues .
Any grownup can see that such a conversation — which has not happened , nor has the Administration shown any inclination to make it happen — would be the very foundation of a diplomatic solution .
( But , of course , by “ diplomatic solution ” Bush simply means that the Iranians surrender without him having to fire a shot . )
Zakaria has distinguished himself by taking this fight into the mainstream media , with a passion and righteous indignation all too rare in its columns and broadcasts .
Whereas the mainstream media appears to have taken as read largely unsubstantiated claims about Iran ’s nuclear program representing an existential threat to Israel and others , and similarly unsubstantiated claims about Iran ’s role in Iraq ( which has lately become the Bush Administration ’s fallacy d’jour in explaining its failures there ) , more sober heads begin the discussion by asking whether Iran ’s nuclear program actually represent a threat , and if so , is it a threat of sufficient magnitude to justify the risk of potentially catastrophic consequences that military action would carry .
And if not , are there options besides war and sanctions for responding to Iran ’s undoubted growth as a regional power in the wake of — and as a result of — the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan .
Israel ’s foreign minister , Tzipi Livni , has acknowledged behind closed doors that even if Iran had nuclear weapons , they would not , repeat NOT , pose an existential threat to Israel .
Other top Israeli security officials have said the same thing .
Yet Bush and the neocons are left unchallenged when they spin this line .
In an outstanding column in Newsweek two weeks ago , Zakaria did what few mainstream media figures are prepared to do when the President glibly tells Americans that the sky will fall unless they do his bidding — eschewing the deference that so often characterizes the media corps ’ approach to the Bush Administration , Zakaria leaves his readers in no doubt that he thinks the President of the United States is a bullshitter , and a dangerous one at that .
To quote :
At a meeting with reporters last week , President Bush said that “ if you ’re interested in avoiding World War III , it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing [ Iran ] from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon . ”
These were not the barbs of some neoconservative crank or sidelined politician looking for publicity .
This was the president of the United States , invoking the specter of World War III if Iran gained even the knowledge needed to make a nuclear weapon .
The American discussion about Iran has lost all connection to reality .
Norman Podhoretz , the neoconservative ideologist whom Bush has consulted on this topic , has written that Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is “ like Hitler … a revolutionary whose objective is to overturn the going international system and to replace it in the fullness of time with a new order dominated by Iran and ruled by the religio- political culture of Islamofascism . ”
For this staggering proposition Podhoretz provides not a scintilla of evidence .
Here is the reality .
Iran has an economy the size of Finland ’s and an annual defense budget of around $ 4.8 billion .
It has not invaded a country since the late 18th century .
The United States has a GDP that is 68 times larger and defense expenditures that are 110 times greater .
Israel and every Arab country ( except Syria and Iraq ) are quietly or actively allied against Iran .
And yet we are to believe that Tehran is about to overturn the international system and replace it with an Islamo - fascist order ?
What planet are we on ?
Amen to that .
The “ knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon ” in this instance is the technology of uranium enrichment , which is also an integral part of a full - cycle civilian nuclear energy program .
And that ’s what Iran is accused of building , which of course , it claims is its right as a signatory to the Non Proliferation Treaty .
Tehran insists it has no intention of building nuclear weapons , and the IAEA has repeatedly made clear that it has seen no evidence that Iran ’s program is intended for weaponization .
( The issue between the IAEA , and then the UN Security Council , and Iran is its failure to comply properly with transparency requirements over its past activities .
Although the Security Council has demanded that Iran cease uranium enrichment until those concerns are resolved , it has not demanded that Iran abandon its right to enrich uranium , because that would contradict the NPT . )
So the issue , really , is that the U.S. and its allies do n’t trust Iran enough to allow it a full - cycle nuclear energy program , because this gives it the potential to build nuclear weapons if it opted out of the NPT .
In its own negotiating efforts via the Europeans , Tehran has previously sought to find a formula under which it would abrogate its right to opt out of the NPT , although those negotiations are going nowhere right now .
Still , assume for a moment Iran did actually use its nuclear energy infrastructure to build a weapon — which it could potentially do , although it would probably take more than five years from now — even then , is Iran really a doomsday threat ?
Zakaria has systematically demolished the claims by the war lobby that Iran is beyond negotiation and deterrence , because it is somehow driven by nutty apocalyptic religious zeal , and pointed out that it is the U.S. that has actually refused to negotiate when the Iranians have made decent offers .
He writes :
The one time we seriously negotiated with Tehran was in the closing days of the war in Afghanistan , in order to create a new political order in the country .
Bush ’s representative to the Bonn conference , James Dobbins , says that “ the Iranians were very professional , straightforward , reliable and helpful .
They were also critical to our success .
They persuaded the Northern Alliance to make the final concessions that we asked for . ”
Dobbins says the Iranians made overtures to have better relations with the United States through him and others in 2001 and later , but got no reply .
Even after the Axis of Evil speech , he recalls , they offered to cooperate in Afghanistan .
Dobbins took the proposal to a principals meeting in Washington only to have it met with dead silence .
The then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , he says , “ looked down and rustled his papers . ”
No reply was ever sent back to the Iranians .
Why bother ?
They ’re mad .
Last year , the Princeton scholar , Bernard Lewis , a close adviser to Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney , wrote an op -ed in The Wall Street Journal predicting that on Aug. 22 , 2006 , President Ahmadinejad was going to end the world .
The date , he explained , “ is the night when many Muslims commemorate the night flight of the Prophet Muhammad on the winged horse Buraq , first to ‘ the farthest mosque , ’ usually identified with Jerusalem , and then to heaven and back .
This might well be deemed an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and if necessary of the world ” ( my emphasis ) .
This would all be funny if it were n’t so dangerous .
Actually , it did get pretty funny when the PBS Newshour put Zakaria on in a live debate with the ideologically incontinent Norman Podhoretz , dean of neoconservatism and a soothsayer that still gets invited to brief Bush and candidate Giuliani despite having been wrong , by Chicken Little proportions , about every “ threat ” on which he ’s ever sounded his battered alarm bell .
No need to quote more — you can read a transcript of the exchange here .
Any scientist will tell you that the answers you get in any inquiry are first and foremost shaped by the questions you ask — and in any process of peer review , it is as important to interrogate those questions , and the assumptions on which they rest , as to examine how the answers were derived .
If the question is “ how can we force Iran to stop enriching uranium , ” the choice will inevitably be between harsher sanctions , and war .
Neither is likely to succeed , of course , but those who pose the question in this way paint themselves into a corner where not taking military action is equivalent to tolerating the intolerable — a message driven home by the Podhoretzes and Gingriches and Netanyahus ( now there ’s a Halloween gallery for you ! ) braying about Hitler and Chamberlain and 1938 all over again …
What Zakaria is arguing , imminently reasonably , is that the Bush Administration managed to climb down off its hysterical perch on North Korea and cut a deal that has substantially diluted any danger represented by Pyongyang , by compromising on its ( the Administration ’s ) own ideological aversion to recognizing the odious regime of Kim Jong - il .
And the world — even Israel — would be a lot safer if the Administration would grow up and recognize that it has no alterantive but to seek a grand bargain with Iran .
And it ’s the absence of real diplomacy by the Administration , not some false choice between sanctions or air strikes , that should be the focus of the media ’s — and the Democratic presidential candidates ’ — discussion of Iran .

BBC World Affairs Editor , in Baghdad
US President George W Bush announced last week that he would settle for " nothing less than complete victory " in Iraq .
Bold words .
But he knows the real battleground is public opinion in the US .
Anything less than total confidence would have brought a serious setback .
More than 2,000 US troops have died since the invasion of Iraq
If this were a regular war , against an army in the field , the Americans would win it hands down .
The US forces here in Iraq have the firepower to destroy any formal enemy outright .
But the qualities that make them the most effective fighting force in the world - ferocity , first - class training and superb logistical ability - do n't necessarily help them win a low - intensity conflict like this .
In an all - out war , the loss of 10 US marines outside Falluja last Thursday evening would have been relatively insignificant in political terms .
But in a war of public relations , at a time when the president was promising complete victory , it was an awkward blow .
Which was presumably why the Pentagon kept the news of the deaths secret for 24 hours .
If it had come out in the usual way , Americans would have heard it on radio or television at pretty much the time they were reading about Mr Bush 's confidence in complete victory in their morning newspapers .
Not at all good for public opinion .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This demonstrates how poorly thought through the post- invasion phase has been
Tom Sugden , Yorkshire , UK

Victory is an elastic term .
If Mr Bush can withdraw big numbers of troops from Iraq , cut down the American death - rate , and get the war off the news bulletins , then US public opinion might interpret that as victory of a kind .
Iraq would then be left to sink or swim , with a relatively small number of American soldiers working alongside Iraqi troops .
Even if the Iraqis were not up to the job , and the insurgents either won the war outright or had to be brought into the government , the main American involvement would be long finished .
But all this depends on the ability of the Iraqi forces to fight a successful war .
How good are they ?
Infiltration
The Iraqi army of Saddam Hussein 's time had mostly Sunni officers , many of whom had had the experience of fighting three wars , as well as crushing the Kurdish and Shia resistance .
It was , relatively speaking , tough and disciplined - not up to fighting the Americans , but more than able to deal with an insurgency .
Paul Bremer , during his time as head of the provisional administration in Iraq , disbanded the army because it was too close to Saddam Hussein and the old Baath Party .
He has defended his decision by saying the army had evaporated anyway .
True - but the officer corps could easily have been lured back .
No - one knows how many recruits in the Iraqi army secretly support the insurgency , but there must be plenty
Gen David Petraeus , who had the task of training the Iraqi forces until earlier this year , argued that middle - ranking and junior officers from Saddam 's army should be reinstated , because the Iraqi forces needed their expertise .
But it did n't happen .
Gen Petraeus , a man of considerable vision - " America 's last , best hope in Iraq , " one American newspaper called him in 2004 - was reassigned to the United States .
Those who volunteered for the new Iraqi army did so for all sorts of reasons .
Most joined because it was the only way they could earn decent money .
Others were encouraged to infiltrate the army on behalf of particular political groups .
There are many entire units which are purely Shia or purely Kurdish - a real danger if civil war were eventually to break out .
For all its firepower , the US military has failed to break the insurgency
Some soldiers show high morale , and face the daily dangers with remarkable cheerfulness .
More do their job unenthusiastically .
It 's hard to generate much enthusiasm in your army if you do n't pay your soldiers on time .
And if you do n't give them proper protection .
American soldiers drive around in heavily armoured vehicles , and wear body armour .
Iraqi soldiers have little to shield them against ambush and roadside bombs , and their rate of death and injury is far greater .
Some soldiers sell their ammunition , presumably to people who pass it on to the insurgents .
In September , according to the senior US ground commander in Iraq , only one Iraqi battalion out of 120 was capable of operating independently of US forces .
And the problem the Iraqi soldiers face is arguably worse than ever .
The US military , despite its ferocious tactics , has not succeeded in neutralising the insurgency in any of the major population centres in the Sunni heartland .
That includes Falluja .
It also includes Ramadi , where a group of insurgents paraded in front of the cameras of the APTN and Reuters agencies last week , patrolling one or two streets in broad daylight and firing their rockets .
It certainly does not mean the insurgents control the city ; they do n't .
But it also means the Americans do n't either .
For the insurgents , too , this is a war for public opinion .
The history of this kind of conflict , which includes Algeria 's war of independence and Vietnam , strongly favours the insurgents .
Last week , despite Mr Bush 's confident words , the insurgents certainly seemed to have the better of it .

The requests for such data showed up a dozen times , using nearly identical language , in records from one six - month period in 2005 obtained by a nonprofit advocacy group , the Electronic Frontier Foundation , through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that it brought against the government .
The F.B.I. recently turned over 2,500 pages of documents to the group .
The boilerplate language suggests the requests may have been used in many of more than 700 emergency or “ exigent ” national security letters .
Earlier this year , the bureau banned the use of the exigent letters because they had never been authorized by law .
The reason for the suspension is unclear , but it appears to have been set off in part by the questions raised by the inspector general ’s initial review into abuses in the use of national security letters .
The official said the F.B.I. itself was examining the use of the community of interest requests to get a better understanding of how and when they were used , but he added that they appeared to have been used in a relatively small percentage of the tens of thousand of the records requests each year .
“ In an exigent circumstance , that ’s information that may be relevant to an investigation , ” the official said .
A federal judge in Manhattan last week struck down parts of the USA Patriot Act that had authorized the F.B.I. ’s use of the national security letters , saying that some provisions violated the First Amendment and the constitutional separation of powers guarantee .
In many cases , the target of a national security letter whose records are being sought is not necessarily the actual subject of a terrorism investigation and may not be suspected at all .
Under the Patriot Act , the F.B.I. must assert only that the records gathered through the letter are considered relevant to a terrorism investigation .
Some legal analysts and privacy advocates suggested that the disclosure of the F.B.I. ’s collection of community of interest records offered another example of the bureau exceeding the substantial powers already granted it by Congress .
“ This whole concept of tracking someone ’s community of interest is not part of any established F.B.I. authority , ” said Marcia Hofmann , a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , which provided the records from its lawsuit to The New York Times .
“ It ’s being defined by the F.B.I .
And when it ’s left up to the F.B.I. to decide what information is relevant to their investigations , they can vacuum up almost anything they want . ”
Matt Blaze , a professor of computer and information science at the University of Pennsylvania and a former researcher for AT&T , said the telecommunications companies could have easily provided the F.B.I. with the type of network analysis data it was seeking because they themselves had developed it over many years , often using sophisticated software like a program called Analyst ’s Notebook .
“ This sort of analysis of calling patterns and who the communities of interests are is the sort of things telephone companies are doing anyway because it ’s central to their businesses for marketing or optimizing the network or detecting fraud , ” said Professor Blaze , who has worked with the F.B.I. on technology issues .

Child obesity rates are soaring
Some doctors now believe in extreme cases overfeeding a young child should be seen as a form of abuse or neglect .
The BBC contacted almost 50 consultant paediatricians around the UK to ask if they believe childhood obesity can ever be a child protection issue .
The British Medical Association is due to debate a motion on this issue at its annual conference at the end of June .
Earlier this year the case of one obese child hit the headlines when social workers became involved .
Dr Tabitha Randell , a consultant paediatrician from Nottingham , is one doctor who believes some parents are killing their children with kindness .
In her clinic it has become more common to see children entering puberty before the age of 10 because of their obesity .
Obesity is a public health problem , not a child protection issue
Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health
In one extreme case Dr Randell saw a child aged two and a half who weighed more than four stone ( 25.4 kg ) .
" They said she was big - boned and they were too .
I think the perception of parents is a very real problem .
" If you see every other child in the playground with their belly hanging over their trousers you think that 's normal . "
Some health professionals think it is unhelpful to see childhood obesity as potential neglect .
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said : " Obesity is a public health problem , not a child protection issue .
" There may be a few families that give cause for concern where there are other matters of neglect or emotional harm and this is where a paediatrician might have discussions with social services . "
Diet advice
Some parents feel they face an uphill struggle to convince their children to eat healthily in a society where there are many high fat choices on offer .
At the children 's centre in the deprived Meadows area of Nottingham parents are offered support to improve their children 's diet .
I 've seen a 10 - year - old who could only walk a few yards with a walking stick
Doctor 's quote
A group of mothers has just signed up for a six - week course , learning how to prepare healthy food from scratch .
The mothers say it is too easy to blame parents .
Vikki Sansom , who has two young children , said : " I think there is a big difference between not feeding and overfeeding .
" It 's really hard for parents and it's wrong to say that 's neglect " .
But at the end of June the BMA will be asked to consider the motion : " The government should consider childhood obesity in under - 12s as neglect by the parents and encourage legal protection for the child and action against those parents . "
Doctors ' concern
Dr Matt Capehorn is the Rotherham GP who put forward the motion as a result of his own experience of running an obesity clinic .
HAVE YOUR SAY Obesity can be a psychological problem
Joe , Hitchin
Send us your comments
He told the BBC : " My colleagues and I were concerned because we noticed a discrepancy in the way society , the medical profession and the courts treat an obese child compared with a malnourished child .
" There is outrage if a child is skin and bone but it only happens in extreme cases with obese children . "
Doctors speaking anonymously to the BBC said overfeeding a child should be considered neglect in extreme cases :
UN Official Says 1.5 Million Need Assistance and Protection in Somalia
By Joe De capua
Washington
01 November 2007
In Somalia , the statistics tell the tale of the humanitarian crisis .
The United Nations says one and a half million people need humanitarian assistance and protection , 800 - thousand people have been displaced and 34 - hundred civilians have been wounded since January .
The situation has prompted the UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Somalia to write an open letter to the warring parties and international community .
From Nairobi , Christian Balslev -Olesen spoke to VOA English to Africa Service reporter Joe De Capua about the reasons for the letter .
“ First of all because of the desperate situation in and around Mogadishu .
For the past four or five days , we have seen an additional 90,000 people , desperate , leaving Mogadishu .
This is a crisis that we have not seen for quite some time .
And therefore , we are trying our best to reach out to all Somalis , all authorities , all parties involved in the present fighting in Mogadishu , ” he says .
Balslev - Olesen says that many people are being “ caught in the crossfire , with over 100 people admitted to hospitals for weapons - related injuries in just two days . ”
He adds , “ There seems to be an operation going on inside Mogadishu in specific districts .
That means people have been trying to get away from certain parts of Mogadishu at a point in time where markets seem to be closing down , where it ’s difficult to get access to your basic food and supply . ”
However , people fleeing the capital are heading to areas already overcrowded with displaced people , who themselves are badly in need of aid .
Humanitarian agencies have been unable to reach many of them .
“ That ’s the reason why we are crying out to all parties in Mogadishu to make sure that they do protect civilian populations .
That they make sure there is access for the humanitarian aid to these people , ” the UN official says .
However , aid agencies face numerous obstacles reaching those in need .
Balslev - Olesen says , “ We have an extreme security situation … in many parts of Somalia with checkpoints , with harassments , with taxations and so on .
So it ’s difficult … simply to reach out to the people . ”
It is not the first time an appeal has been made to the warring parties to respect and protect civilians and aid workers , yet the security problems continue .
So , why make another appeal ?
Balslev - Olesen says , “ This is the only tool that we do have …each and every Somali has a very difficult situation … coping mechanisms in Somalia , in the central and southern part of the country , are not any longer there to supply the basic … protection for people .
What do we have left ? ”
As for Somalia ’s food security crisis , he says , “ We have malnutrition at a level you will not find in any other places in the world , including Darfur . ”
find is one of the most useful Linux / Unix tools in the toolbelt , but most people use only a fraction of its power .
Many Linux / Unix questions seen online can be solved using the find command alone , getting familiar with its main functionality is one of the best things you can do for yourself in the long - term .
find lets you do anything from finding all your .jpg files to seeing “ all of Michael ’s text documents that have the execute bit set and have been modified since yesterday . ”
And when combined with exec or xargs , a properly constructed command can make quick work of some very heavy tasks .
First thing we need to do is understand how find works .
Here are some of the key options :
-o : the OR operation to string multiple search criteria together
: the OR operation to string multiple search criteria together - name : find files by name
: find files by name - iname : find files by name , ignoring case
: find files by name , ignoring case - type f : find only files
: find only files - type d : find only directories
: find only directories - size : find by size
: find by size - mtime : find by modified time
: find by modified time - mtime : find by modified time
There a number of variations of these , which we ’ll talk about more below .
It ’s also possible to combine queries , like so :
Combine the - name and - type options
find .
- name nasa - type d
It ’s important to note that when searching using - name or - iname you need to by default specify the whole name to get a match , e.g. : searching for “ disc ” will not find “ discovered ” , but you can use common techniques ( * ) to widen the search .
Expand your searches using the *
find .
- name * disc *
Let ’s start simple by looking for things by name .
Remember that the first argument you give find is where to look .
Find by name
find .
- name “ *.jpg ”
... ./ Pictures / iPhoto Library / Data/2006 / Roll 20/00697_bluewaters_1440x900.jpg ./ Pictures /iPhoto Library / Data/2006 /Roll 20/00705_cloudyday_1440x900.jpg ./ Pictures /iPhoto Library / Data/2006 /Roll 20/00710_fragile_1600x1200.jpg ./ Pictures /iPhoto Library / Data/2006 /Roll 20/00713_coolemoticon_1440x900.jpg ./ Pictures /iPhoto Library / Data/2006 /Roll 20/00714_cloudyday_1440x900.jpg ...
Note that by default when you give a location to start from ( in our case “ . ” ) , the find command starts there and drills all the way down during its search .
So in this case I started from my home directory and it found the files all the way down in “ ~ / Pictures / iPhoto Library / Data /2006 / Roll 20 ” as well .
[ Placing quotes around the search criteria avoids issues with wildcard characters and is probably a good habit to get into .
You can also use - iname instead of - name ; it ’s the same but it ’s case insensitive ]
You can also define another search location which will be evaluated recursively as well .
Search the entire filesystem for a file
find / - name “ *.jpg ”
Figuring out what a user is trivial using lsof .
Simply provide the username and see everything they ’re doing on the system .
Find out what a given user is up to
find .
- user daniel
... ./ Music / iTunes / iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/01 Intolerance.m4a ./ Music/iTunes / iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/02 Prison Sex.m4a ./ Music / iTunes /iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/03 Sober.m4a ./ Music/iTunes /iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/04 Bottom.m4a ./ Music/iTunes /iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/05 Crawl Away.m4a ./ Music/iTunes /iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/06 Swamp Song.m4a ./ Music/iTunes/iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/07 Undertow.m4a ./ Music/iTunes/iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/08 4 Degrees.m4a ./ Music/iTunes/iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/09 Flood.m4a ./ Music/ iTunes /iTunes Music / Tool / Undertow/69 Disgustipated .m4a ...
[ Also works for groups ( - group ) ]
You can also look for files or directories separately .
Find only directories
find .
- type d
... ./ Development / envelope ./ Development / mhp ./ Development / mservers ./ Development/mservers/fortune100 ./Development/mst ./Development/mst/nmap ./ Development/mst/services ...
Those are all directories , and to look for the others ( files , links , or sockets ) , just substitute f , l , s for the d in the command above .
It ’s often useful to find things on your drive that are taking up space and need to be dealt with .
Find everything over a megabyte in size
find ~/ Movies / - size +1024M
... / Movies / Comedy / Funny.mpg /Movies/Drama/Sad.avi ...
[ +M indicates that you ’re searching in megabytes , but you can also search in bytes or kilobytes if so desired . ]
You can also search based on when something was last updated or modified .
find also has a number of options that help one answer forensics - oriented questions such as when a file ’s contents or permissions were last changed .
Show me what content owned by root have been modified within the last minute
find /etc / - user root - mtime 1
... /etc/ passwd /etc/shadow ...
The checks you can use here are :
- atime : when the file was last accessed
: when the file was last - ctime : when the file ’s permissions were last changed
: when the file ’s permissions were last - mtime : when the file ’s data was last modified
These searches are done in 24 hour increments and followed by a number n .
If you want to match the exact 24 hour period you use n by itself .
More frequently , however , you ’ll want to say everything since yesterday , or everything “ more than 3 days ago . ”
This is accomplished using the -n and +n options respectively .
There are also minute versions of the atime , ctime , and mtime arguments :
- amin : when ( in minutes ) the file was last accessed
: when ( in minutes ) the file was last - cmin : when ( in minutes ) the file ’s permissions were last changed
: when ( in minutes ) the file ’s permissions were last - mmin : when ( in minutes ) the file ’s data was last modified
Another option is to find things based on what permissions they have .
This is especially helpful when looking for content on your system that is too wide open from a security standpoint .
Find everything in my home directory with wide open permissions
find ~ - perm 777
... ~/testfile.txt ~/lab.rtf ...
Find all files on your system that are world writeable
find / – perm -0002
You can also use some options to search for things related to forensics .
- nouser : shows output that ’s not associated with an existing userid
: shows output that ’s not associated with an existing userid - nogroup : shows output not associated with an existing groupid
: shows output not associated with an existing groupid - links n : file has n links
: file has links - newer file : file was modified more recently than file .
: file was modified more recently than file .
- perm mode : file has mode permissions .
What ’s the fun in finding a bunch of stuff if you ’re not going to do something with it ?
While it ’s interesting to say , “ find me stuff ” , it ’s far more useful to say , “ Take every text file owned by ex-employee Jason that ’s has n’t been accessed in 60 days and move it to a remote backup folder . “
Many use find in conjunction with exec , which then runs on the results .
This is usually acceptable , but I prefer to use xargs because it executes more elegantly .
xargs , unlike exec , executes all arguments as a single command instead of running multiple commands .
So if I run > :
find .
- name something - exec ls -l {} ;
… I will ultimately be running ls as many times as there are contents in my home directory .
But if I run this instead :
find .
- name something | xargs - 0 ls
… I will only run ls once , with the directory contents as arguments .
While on modern computers the performance gain on this is often trivial , I simply prefer the aesthetic of it .
[ NOTE :
The - print0 option terminates results with a null character instead of the default newline , making it cleaner and less likely to balk in many cases related to spaces , special characters , etc. in the input . ]
Here are some examples .
Delete all files now owned by valid users
find / - nouser | xargs - 0 rm
Find image files and move them to the pictures directory
find ~/ Desktop - name “ *. jpg ” -o - name “ *.gif ” -o - name “ *. png ” - print0 | xargs - 0 mv –target - directory ~/ Pictures
Correct the permissions on your web directory
find / your / webdir / - type d - print0 | xargs - 0 chmod 755 ;
find / your / webdir - type f | xargs chmod 644
Find files that have been modified within the last month and copy them somewhere
find /etc / - mtime - 30 | xargs - 0 cp /a/path
Just as with any good unix / linux command , the real power comes in combining options .
You can combine find arguments using and , or , and not .
By default if you use two different arguments you ’re and ‘ing them .
If you want to use or you give the -o option , and if you want to get everything except something , you use the ! option .

Kudos .
Her fighting spirit was all the more impressive because so many of the positions she was defending were virtually indefensible .

That would have been disturbing even if she had not attacked the idea of “ rushing to war ” twice more in the next 60 seconds .

KHARTOUM ( Reuters ) - Sudan will host hundreds of Palestinian refugees who have been stranded for months in terrible conditions on Iraq ’s border with Syria and Jordan , the Foreign Ministry said on Monday .
“ It ’s a few hundred .
The president ( Omar Hassan al - Bashir ) agreed to the request of both Hamas and Fatah to accommodate them and we are going to inform the Arab League and then make our preparations , ” said a senior Foreign Ministry official , who declined to be named .
Iraq had 30,000 registered Palestinian refugees before the U.S. - led invasion in 2003 .
The community became the target of attacks partly because of the Baghdad government ’s support for the Palestinians under Saddam Hussein ’s rule .
An estimated 15,000 Palestinians remain in Baghdad where they are vulnerable to murder , kidnapping and threats , according to the U.N. refugee agency ( UNHCR ) .
Some 1,550 Palestinians have been trapped in al Waleed and al Tanf refugee camps on the Iraqi side of the Syrian border for months , UNHCR has said .
Conditions in the camps , where temperatures can reach 50 degrees Celsius in the Iraqi desert ( 122 degrees Fahrenheit ) , are poor .
Syria stopped taking in Palestinian refugees after accepting 250 in 2006 , though Damascus allowed four seriously ill refugees to enter for treatment in August .
Sudan itself has hundreds of thousands of refugees in neighboring countries and a huge diaspora because of decades of multiple civil wars .
Brad Wardell :
There probably wo n't be a sequel to Galactic Civilizations II for quite a long time .
You 've probably noticed that we tend to add a lot to our expansion packs , so you can imagine how long our feature list would be for a sequel and we just wo n't be able to get to it anytime soon .
We had always planned on having at least two expansion packs to Galactic Civilizations II in order to complete the Dread Lords trilogy , but we were worried that we would n't have time to go back to Galactic Civilizations for a long while once we are full - bore on the fantasy strategy game we 're working on .
Wardell :
The biggest features would have to be the per-civilization technology trees .
Let me emphasize that feature -- we 're not talking about a couple of unique technologies per civilization .
I am saying each civilization gets its own complete technology tree , complete with its own ship components and planetary improvements .
Another big feature will be " Terror Stars . "
These are units that can destroy entire star systems .
Then there 's the multitude of new ship components that affect fleets and just provide a lot of new strategy items for players .
A feature I 'm really looking forward to is tournaments .
Players play a particular map or scenario and then can submit their score so we can have apples - to - apples comparisons .
I want to see how I can do compared to other players against the computer AI .
Wardell : The Terror Star destroys entire star systems .
It 's quite handy , especially late game , for ... finishing off entrenched players .
They are very expensive to build and quite vulnerable so only players who have significant military superiority can really benefit .
Classic turn - based " 4X " - style conquer - the - world strategy are n't exactly cluttering up store shelves at the local Electronics Boutique .
Fortunately , a few holdouts continue to hold the flame for a community of budding digital despots .
One of the best in the business is Brad Wardell and his team at Stardock .
In the past few years , they 've built thefranchise into the gold standard of the genre .
In February 2007 , , the latest expansion pack for , took an already stellar game and turned it into a classic .
It 's a mark of the dedication of the Stardock team that they decided to not rest on their laurels and instead givefans a little surprise this upcoming November .
is the second expansion pack forand a quick glance over its feature list reveals that this expansion just might shake up the series as much asdid .
We sat down to talk with Brad Wardell about the latest addition to the game .
Your last expansion pack came out this February to rave reviews .
Why another expansion pack so soon ?
What are the big features this time around ?
Tell us about the Terror Star .
The inspiration is obvious , but what will it cost to make such a thing and do you really think it 'll get used very much ?
On Friday , Stevens University hosted a Security and Privacy Day , organized in conjunction with Columbia University and IBM Research .
Two of the speakers — one each from Stevens and Columbia — spoke in detail about the issues facing those who are trying to defend against malware .
The take - home was pretty grim ; it 's simply easier for malware authors to mount an attack than it is to defend against one .
But some degree of defense is possible , and that may be enough to secure at least some networks .
Sven Dietrich of Stevens discussed the prospects for detecting the activity of botnets and tracing them back to their source .
Early versions of networked malware followed a design similar to client - server , with standard point - to - point TCP connections back to a central controller .
These were relatively simple to defend against .
" That was easy , thinking back now , " Dietrich reminisced , " although at the time , it did n't seem easy . "
Malware writers ' first adaptation was to use IRC communications to control the botnets , so that the network traffic looked legitimate and the controlling computers could hide behind the IRC servers .
Since then , communications have moved off TCP entirely and into acknowledgment - free protocols such as UDP , and the content is often encrypted .
Botnets now communicate on a peer - to - peer basis , either using common methods ( Storm uses the eDonkey UDP protocol ) or with custom code ( as is the case with SpamThru ) .
Professor Dietrich thinks that these developments have made traditional anti-malware tactics largely ineffective .
It 's no longer realistic to expect to be able to identify controllers of botnets so that new instructions can be blocked or traced back to a source .
The use of encryption to deliver payloads and instructions also makes it much harder to determine what a given botnet is up to .
The encryption issue was the main focus of a talk by Salvatore Stolfo of Columbia University .
Stolfo's focus is content - based anomaly detection ; in practice , this means protecting computers by recognizing network traffic that could pose a threat before it reaches the computer , even in cases where the code does n't match any existing malware signatures .
Stolfo described a system , called Anagram , that generates a hash of a portion of the incoming traffic and checks it against known safe and malware signatures .
Anything that 's unknown gets sent to a " shadow server " where it is observed while running in a sandbox to evaluate its safety .
To work without an excessive number of false positives , however , this system requires that the malware hashes occupy a finite amount of space .
This is where Stolfo's bad news comes in : malware writers are now compressing their payloads , and there are an immense number of ways to express a specialized decompression algorithm in about 30 bytes .
Using a genetic ( evolutionary ) algorithm , he and his coworkers could easily produce millions of decompressors that showed no detectable pattern .
He also described how some malware inserted safe - looking content ( such as images ) into the payload so that the typical hash generated by scanning them would indicate that they 're safe .
Neither Dietrich or Stolfo offered any suggestions on how to ensure security from the computer science perspective , but both suggested that cultural aspects of the current malware scene were key to future security .
Dietrich pointed out that our success against earlier malware came in part because the hackers , both black - and white - hat , were willing to talk with computer scientists .
Now , most malware is the product of organized crime networks , primarily based overseas .
They 're not talking to us and , unless we make some effort to understand their culture , Dietrich suggests that we 're going to have a hard time combatting them .
Stolfo thinks that we know enough about the culture to know one thing : it 's all about the money .
Even if we can't produce effective network security , we can at least make it more difficult and therefore expensive to attack a network by adopting some of the hacker 's own techniques .
He favors randomizing the use of a number of techniques for filtering content , so that individual malware vectors will sporadically stop working .
By changing the challenge involved in compromising systems , the whole malware economy is changed .
Stolfo also took a positively Darwinian view of how much change was needed , suggesting that security only had to be good enough to make someone else 's system look like a more economical target .
Overall , the talks were pretty depressing , given that the operating systems and software we rely on will probably never be truly secure .
The process of blocking malware that takes advantage of this insecurity appears to be entering the realm where true security has become one of those problems that requires massive amounts of computing power and an inordinate amount of time .
The Democratic presidential candidates continued to raise significantly more money during the last three months than their Republican counterparts , according to official and unofficial third - quarter fund - raising tallies that were released yesterday .
Senator Barack Obama , the Illinois Democrat , raised at least $ 20 million over the summer , more than $ 19 million of which could be spent on the primary — showing that he continued to be a formidable fund - raiser .
It was unclear whether he still led in fund - raising , as he did this spring , because Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton did not release her tally .
( Her aides had said that they expected to raise a similar amount . )
John Edwards raised $ 7 million , and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico raised $ 5.2 million .
By comparison , Mitt Romney , who has been one of the strongest Republican fund - raisers this election , raised only about half of what Mr. Obama raised this summer , according to a senior adviser who was granted anonymity to discuss the campaign ’s finances .
The adviser said that Mr. Romney brought in about $ 10 million from donors , and that he used more than $ 6 million of his own money for his campaign .
Rudolph W. Giuliani , who replaced his chief fund - raiser at the end of the quarter , did not release a tally , but said over the weekend that he thought he would “ do as well as the other Republicans — maybe we will do better than some . ”
Fred D. Thompson raised at least $ 8 million in his first quarter as a candidate , according to people involved with the campaign — less than the other leading candidates raised early in their campaigns .

Based on Free and Open Source Software , GNOME provides all of the common tools computer users expect of a modern computing environment , as well as a flexible and powerful platform for software developers .
2. What 's New For Users
The GNOME Project 's focus on users and usability continues in GNOME 2.20 with its hundreds of bug fixes and user - requested improvements .
The sheer number of enhancements make it impossible to list every change and improvement made but we hope to highlight some of the more exciting user - oriented features in this release of GNOME .
2.1 . Email and Calendar GNOME 's email and groupware client , Evolution , has several new features .
The new attachment warning could mean the end of those " Sorry , I forgot to attach the file " emails .
If you try to send an email that contains the word " attachment " ( or similar words ) , but do n't actually attach a file , you will see a helpful warning .
Figure 1 Evolution 's attachment warning .
Evolution now shows an icon in your panel 's notification area when you have new email .
Note that , because this is currently only a plugin which is not yet fully integrated into the main preferences , you need to disable the plugin itself if you would like to disable this feature .
Figure 2 Evolution 's new notification icon .
Moving your configuration and Email archive to a new computer is now much easier thanks to the new Backup / Restore feature .
Figure 3 Evolution 's backup feature .
The new " Magic Space Bar " support is hard to find , but useful - it means you need just one key to read new mails in all your folders .
Just press the space bar to scroll the message preview window to the end of the email , then press it again to view the next unread email in that folder .
When you 've read all the emails in that folder , press it again to show the first unread email in the next folder .
Evolution 's calendar feature also has some useful improvements .
The search interface allows advanced searches such as those already available for email and address book searches , and you can save your searches to run them again later .
The Show drop - down now provides quick access to the next 7 day 's appointments and to active appointments .
Figure 4 Evolution 's 7 day events view .
In addition , the Email client now moves threads to the top of the list when a thread has a new Email , when using the threaded view .
uses the standard GTK + printing system , using the same dialog windows as other applications , while providing more printing options than before .
allows you to choose the Spam plugin ( SpamAssassin or BogoFilter ) via its preferences .
And SpamAssassin will now actually learn when you mark emails as Junk or Not Junk .
Users of Microsoft Exchange will welcome improvements to Evolution 's Exchange support , which include : Access to Exchange 's delegation feature so that a colleague can handle your work while you are away .
Faster use when offline .
Faster loading of folders .
2.2 . Web Browser GNOME 's integrated web browser , Epiphany , has been subtly but significantly improved .
For instance , inline completion in the address bar is now more intuitive .
When you use the cursor keys to select from the drop - down list , the current selection is shown immediately in the entry box , so it 's easier to see what address will be used when you press enter .
This drop - down menu lists addresses from both your history and bookmarks , and it now shows the web site icons ( favicons ) for history items , as it already did for bookmark items .
Figure 5
The web browser , showing bookmarks and history in the address bar , with favicons .
By popular request , there 's a new " smooth scrolling " preference that makes it easier to see where to continue reading when scrolling large web pages .
It is not enabled by default because several users have reported that it can cause eye strain .
2.3 . Image Viewing GNOME 's image viewer , eog , is now faster and more stable .
The new image properties dialog provides easy access to basic information and metadata for your images , and now includes XMP ( Extensible Metadata Platform ) data that your camera or software might store in your image files , along with the existing EXIF data .
This might include location , copyright information , license , and tags .
And you can now easily open an image in another application , such as the GIMP , by using the new " Open with ... " menu item .
When you 've made your changes and saved the file then your picture will be updated in the image viewer automatically .
This is also available in the new right - click menu in the image collection pane , at the bottom of the window , along with other useful actions .
That image collection now has large vertical buttons at the left and right , making it easier to browse through your pictures .
Figure 6 The Image Viewer , with the properties dialog and the Open With menu .
2.4 . Document Viewer GNOME 's
Evince viewer , for PDF and Postscript files now supports interactive PDF forms , allowing you to enter information into a PDF that you receive , to save or print .
Page rendering in the new version is now noticeably faster .
Figure 7 The Document Viewer , editing a form .
You can also now save images from PDF documents and print documents with multiple PDF pages per sheet .
2.5 . Sound and Video
Not all distributions like to install all multimedia codecs by default , due to the need to obtain patent licenses for some codecs in some countries .
This means that applications can not always read every file format by default .
But applications such as GNOME 's video player , Totem , can now offer these new codecs to the user for installation .
This is actually implemented by your distribution , which may make its own decisions about how to obtain the codecs .
Here 's how it looks in Ubuntu : Figure 8
The video player offering download of a codec .
Totem 's support for embedded videos in web pages has also improved , supporting more web pages , showing a pulsing play button when you need to press play to start the video , and now allowing you to go into full - screen mode from the web page .
2.6 . Note - Taking Tomboy , the GNOME note taking application , has also added some significant new features , the first of which is note synchronization .
Tomboy can now use WebDAV or ssh to connect to a remote server and synchronize all the notes that a user has made .
This allows for users who use multiple computers to keep one set of synchronized notes between all the machines .
Simple conflict resolution between the server and the Tomboy clients ensures that there is no data loss in case of a note conflict .
Figure 9 Tomboy with notes synchronized between two computers .
Furthermore , Tomboy now remembers your open notes , showing them again when you restart the application .
2.7 . Text Editing GNOME 's simple but powerful text editor , gedit , has an all - new syntax - highlighting system which now supports syntax highlighting for scripting languages such as PHP and Ruby even when embedded in HTML , as well as highlighting of text such as " TODO " or " FIXME " inside code comments , and highlighting of gtk - doc source code documentation .
You can even choose from several color schemes in case you are already familiar with the colors used by a different text editor .
Figure 10
The text editor 's color schemes .
2.8 . File Management
The file chooser dialog now shows the recent files list and can use desktop search systems such as Beagle or Tracker , making it easier to find your files when you need them , without interruption .
Figure 11 Performing a search in the file chooser dialog .
The Nautilus file manager now shows more information in the " Properties " window for drives , including a pie graph that easily shows how much space is left .
In addition , you can now see the overall disk usage in the Disk Usage Analyzer utility .
Figure 12
The properties dialog for a hard drive .
( Observant users will notice the bug with the type , size , and mime type information in that screenshot .
We hope to have that fixed for GNOME 2.22 . )
The file manager also now uses the EXIF camera information in some image files to rotate its thumbnails when appropriate .
This means that , when you take a picture with your camera and import it into GNOME , the orientation of the thumbnail will be correct , whether it was taken as landscape or portrait .
Figure 13
The file manager showing correctly orientated image thumbnails .
The file - roller archive manager can now open and save archives from networked locations , such as mounted ssh:// servers , by using the same gnome - vfs system that is already used by other GNOME applications .
It is also now possible to copy / paste and drag - and - drop files between archives .
2.9 . Panel The GNOME Panel can be seen at the top and bottom of your screen in most distributions .
It has some small but helpful improvements in GNOME 2.20 .
For instance , the Window List applet no longer resizes its buttons whenever the length of window titles change .
This avoids annoying resizes when changing tabs in your web browser .
And the Window Selector applet now sorts its drop - down list by workspace .
Users of " floating panels " ( which do n't expand to fill the whole screen width ) might notice that these panels now remain in the correct position and alignment when changing screen resolution .
More work to improve the repositioning of panel applets when changing screen resolution is planned for GNOME 2.22 .
2.10 . Control Panel For GNOME 2.20 , the control panels have been reorganized slightly to reduce the number of control panels , making it easier to find what you need .
For instance , this release marks the debut of the new Appearance control panel applet .
The Theme , Background , Fonts , and Interface applets have been merged to create this new applet , simplifying the Preferences menu .
Figure 14 The Appearance control panel .
In addition , some of the Accessibility preferences have been moved to a new tab in the Preferred Applications control panel .
Figure 15 The Accessibility tab in the Preferred Applications control panel .
Wireless users may also welcome the new support for WPA encryption in the Network control panel .
2.11 . Password Management
The GNOME Keyring system remembers your passwords for networked servers and web sites .
In GNOME 2.20 , the keyring is unlocked automatically when you login and when you unlock your screen , avoiding the need for an extra password prompt .
Note , however , that this feature requires some work by your distribution .
You can now also change your keyring 's master password via the Encryption Preferences control panel , in the GNOME Keyring tab .
Figure 16 The Keyring tab in the Encryption Preferences control panel .
The Password and Encryption Keys utility now shows more notification details when you import keys , and allows you to choose the archive type when encrypting multiple files .
Figure 17 Encrypting multiple files .
2.12 . Help System
This release has seen some large changes in the infrastructure of the GNOME help browser ( yelp ) , improving the style and layout .
In addition , the colors now better match your current theme .
Help pages also now appear more quickly , as individual pages are now loaded on demand instead of the entire manual being parsed unnecessarily .
Figure 18
The help browser .
2.13 . Power Management GNOME 's Power Manager now saves profile information about your batteries over time , to provide a far more accurate estimation of the time remaining , even with old worn - out batteries .
It even knows about many battery models that have been recalled by their manufacturers .
Figure 19
The power manager warning about a worn - out battery .
Several parts of GNOME , such as the volume mixer have also been corrected to remove unnecessary polling , resulting in power savings .
2.14 . Login and Screensaver Users could already choose their preferred language when logging in to GNOME , but now they can even see the login screen in their own language as soon as they choose it , thanks to an improved GDM ( Gnome Display Manager ) .
The GNOME Screensaver now allows people to leave you a note while your screen is locked , by clicking the " Leave Message " button .
You 'll see these messages when you login .
Figure 20 Notes left for you while your screensaver was active .
2.15 . Right - To - Left Languages Languages such as Arabic and Hebrew are written from right to left .
Users of these languages expect most user interface elements to be similarly mirrored , compared to left - to - right user interfaces .
GNOME 2.20 improves the support in the following ways when using these languages : Window title buttons ( such as minimize , maximize , and close ) appear in mirrored order .
Window title menu items are now aligned to the right .
The alt - tab window switcher lists and moves through windows from right to left .
The ctrl - alt - arrow workspace switcher lists and moves through workspaces from right to left , Figure 21 Switching windows when using Arabic .
Notice the reversed buttons in the window title bars .
The U.S. Public Service Academy will be America ’s first national civilian university , a flagship institution designed to build a “ more perfect union ” by developing leaders of character dedicated to service in the public sector .
Modeled on the military service academies , the Public Service Academy will provide a rigorous undergraduate education followed by five years of civilian service to the country .
It will develop young leaders with the character , intellect , and experience necessary to meet the challenges of the twenty - first century .
Join us as we build our generation ’s defining public institution .

LATEST NEWS
Rudy Giuliani has been having a bad week .
Or , as he might put it , suffering persecutions never seen upon this planet since Mel Gibson was tortured on the rack , castrated , disemboweled and beheaded in “ Braveheart . ”
As Michael Cooper reported in The Times , New York ’s ex-mayor is prone to exaggeration on the campaign trail , stretching facts or replacing them with more dramatic , more interesting , more untrue ones .
Still , nobody would deny the last several days have been a downer .
First , Rudy looked bad in that debate in Florida .
The protégé he promoted for homeland security secretary , Bernard Kerik , kept showing up on TV in news clips captioned 16 - COUNT FEDERAL INDICTMENT .
Then Ben Smith reported on Politico.com about the peculiar accounting practices the Giuliani administration had used for security details that guarded Rudy when he was out of town pursuing nonmayoral ventures such as golf and adultery .
The bills were stashed away under the budgets of obscure city agencies like the Loft Board and — oh , dear — the Office for People With Disabilities .
Rudy said the story sounded like a “ hit job ” to him , aimed at reminding primary voters about his divorce - studded private life .
Actually , LoftBoardgate is a reminder not of what Rudy does behind closed doors , but of his inability to keep them shut .
When he was mayor , his sex life spilled into weird press conferences and court fights over who got custody of Gracie Mansion .
Lately , he ’s contented himself with interrupting his speeches to accept strange cellphone calls from the latest wife .
Preface :
After writing for over three years , I consider this to be the most important Op - Ed I have ever written ; forget who I am and please concentrate on the facts and the evidence contained herein - and then form your own opinion .
I am only the messenger , but the facts speak for themselves , and our nation faces a grave crisis that the majority of the population does n’t even know exists .
Countless millions of Americans are asking themselves , their Congress , and even their local newspapers why Congress seems to be in collusion with The Bush administration , even though they have violated our Constitution , The Bill of Rights , our Rule of Law , stand in utter contempt of Congress , violate international laws and treaties with impunity – yet a Congress that is empowered and has the duty to impeach these traitors and tyrants still abdicate their sworn duty to uphold the very constitutional values they were voted into office to protect – yet they stand mute and appear to be complicit with the eventual downfall of our democratic republic ;
Why ?
Millions are asking these questions , voicing their outrage , and still nothing of substance is being accomplished to halt our nation from falling into tyranny and utter chaos – and most of us stand in disbelief while Bush and Cheney shred everything that once made the United States the great nation it used to be , and now we watch as our economy is literally falling apart !
LINK
Until a few days ago , I was one of those Americans that were asking all of these questions , and more - even editorializing on Nancy Pelosi ’s idiotic stand on “ taking impeachment off the table ” and generally condemning our Congress for their lack of courage and inaction as we face the downfall of the world ’s foremost democratic society .
LINK LINK
We know that Bush ’s illegal wiretapping began the second month he was in office , and now because of a patriotic Whistle - blower who had the courage to tell the truth , we also know that the Bush administration was not tracking so - called Internet traffic and calls that were based in other countries , but that ALL Internet and possibly phone communication as well within the United States was being quietly fed into NSA ’s surveillance system (s ) , and yes , that includes privileged information from attorneys , Congressmen / women , and every other citizen of the United States !
LINK
Even before the 2006 Mid-term elections , I had a firm belief that President Bush , aided by Cheney and his co-conspirators in the NSA were wiretapping members of Congress and actually blackmailing them into submission .
Then , it was a suspicion , and as a matter of public record , I had already secretly provided a Democrat in Florida with conclusive evidence that CIFA was in violation of their mandated functions , and I was assured that information and evidence was forwarded to members of Congress in late 2005 or early 2006 .
Then , after I interviewed Joe Roberts , who was running against Jeff Miller in the Florida Panhandle region , my suspicions were also mirrored by a Democrat running for office in the US Senate .

Unfortunately , I wish that was the only serious issue we must deal with , however , just a few days ago I found , quite by accident , or because of the clever actions of Rob Kall , the Editor of Op - Ed News , who included a link on an article that had nothing to do with politics in a piece I had written on CNN and their oversimplification of the Super - Volcano at Yellowstone National Park .
LINK
( Or so I thought …
Rob knows that I ’m extremely inquisitive , and that I ’d follow a link that did n’t appear to relate to my article - so to him I am grateful that he inspired this important editorial . )
The link that Rob Kall associated with my story was this :
NSPD -51 and the Potential for a Coup d’Etat by National Emergency By William H. White October 30 , 2007 Can you think of anyone better than George W. Bush with whom to entrust the dictatorial powers hinted at in NSPD - 51 ?
Or perhaps you are unwilling to trust anyone with such powers , even Bush .
That is not a option in NATIONAL SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE 51 ( NSPD - 51 ) , signed by Bush and released without comment by the White House on May 9 , 2007 .
To quote from NSPD - 51 : “ This policy establishes ‘ National Essential Functions , ’ prescribes continuity requirements for all executive departments and agencies , and provides guidance for State , local , territorial , and tribal governments , and private sector organizations in order to ensure a comprehensive and integrated national continuity program that will enhance the credibility of our national security posture and enable a more rapid and effective response to and recovery from a national emergency . ”
What one would expect , but for some additional details .
Under NSPD - 51 , only limited ‘ National Essential Functions ’ of government will continue , which may or may not include Congress and the courts .
NSPD - 51 assures us : “ Enduring Constitutional Government means a cooperative effort among the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of the Federal Government , coordinated by the President , as a matter of comity with respect to the legislative and judicial branches … ”
This “ matter of comity , ” which usually refers to the informal and voluntary recognition of jurisdiction among courts , is a troublesomely ambiguous phrase in this context wherein the president determines this as he “ coordinates . ”
Unfortunately , NSPD - 51 provides limited “ guidance ” to state and local governments , because it revoked the then existing Presidential Decision Directive 67 of October 21 , 1998 ( ” Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations ” ) , including “ all Annexes thereto . ”
And replaced them with NSPD - 51 , along with : “ Annex A and the classified Continuity Annexes , attached hereto . ”
But then the rabbit disappears as NSPD - 51 soldiers on : “ This directive and the information contained herein shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure , provided that , except for Annex A , the Annexes attached to this directive are classified and shall be accorded appropriate handling , consistent with applicable Executive Orders . ”
In other words , all the details are secret and even the non secret “ Annex A ” remains undisclosed by the White House .
MUCH MORE
If you do n’t read another word of this editorial , above all , please follow the above link and read the article in its entirety , as it is the foremost threat to our way of life and the very essence of freedom as we know it in the United States !
Also , it vividly offers an extremely valid assumption / speculation / hypothesis on why Congress may be actually afraid to instigate actual impeachment proceeding ’s against President Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney .
In fact , there is one more paragraph which must be reproduced to urge anyone reading this article to keep reading to understand the extreme jeopardy this unholy directive places our entire society in jeopardy - and could end freedom as we know it and allow President Bush to become nothing less than a dictator with the sole power to rule our country with the iron fist of tyranny - effectively destroying our democracy , probably irreparably , and for that reason , this is a must - read paragraph :
This almost entirely secret directive can be invoked when the president decides “ any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions ” occurred .
Bush alone will decide when he must assume this burden , though surely only upon prayerful contemplation during the time saved not having to consult Congress .
In addition , because of a change to the Insurrection Act of 1807 , enacted as part of the 439 - page 2007 Defense Authorization Bill signed into law in October 2006 , Bush need no longer obtain a governor ’s consent to take control of a state ’s national guard units .
This same bill overturns the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which limited the use of US military forces within the United States for law enforcement .
In addition , Bush issued an executive order on July 17 , 2007 authorizing the government to seize the assets of anyone “ undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq ” under provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act .
Could this include critics of the Iraq war , whom Bush has repeatedly accused of undermining the war effort ?

If you take into consideration that President Bush has again circumvented the checks and balances demanded by our Constitution and rule of law , and that this directive is so secretive that even members of Congress are barred from viewing it - who doubts that it contains items that Congress would immediately disapprove of and demand they be quashed ; no President has the legal authority to bypass the US Congress , nor does he have the right to make directives so draconian that in an effort to keep his plans hidden , he is again defying Congress and refusing to comply with the law of the land .
When you start comprehending the actual danger our democratic republic is in , after reading the directive ( or what we have been able to ascertain of its contents ) it ’s obvious the implied threat of this secret directive is having a negative impact on our Congress , and I strongly believe it ’s not a stretch that Bush will attempt to enact this directive if a serious effort is made at impeaching him , and Congress appears to be “ hoping ” that he will step - down after the 2008 elections rather than addressing this issue and attempting to negate its possible impact .
First and foremost for the people to consider is that President ’s do n’t create directives if they are n’t expecting to someday place them into motion , and when one is written so that Bush can enact it purely at his sole discretion - especially when such an air of secrecy has been attached that could make Bush an instant Dictator , effectively taking - over our country .
It is true , detention camps are being built and renovated across the United States , and we the people have to question why so many are being built , and especially the secrecy that surrounds the entire project :

The replacement was a piece on spiders , which did n't turn out too badly , considering , although I forgot to include some advice I 'd been given : apparently spiders have an aversion to conkers , so if you collect a load of conkers , and scatter them round your house , the eight - legged bastards stay away .
Have n't seen one since , though that may be a coincidence .
( Incidentally , I recommend conker - gathering as an afternoon activity that instantly makes you feel 10 years old again , even if an ecologically conscious passer - by did accuse me of " killing a tree " just because I was thrashing at the branches with a long stick . )
Anyway , the spiked piece was rejected on the grounds that it was offensive and made me sound crazy .
The first line was , " Here 's a sentence rarely used to open newspaper columns : why do n't the vast majority of people just blow their own heads off ? " and it continued in a similar vein throughout .
I thought it was life - affirming , in a nihilistic , cackling - into - the - abyss kind of way , but there you go .
Perhaps I 'm ill .
Doubtless it would 've provoked complaints .
So the piece about spiders was printed instead .
It also appeared on the Guardian 's Comment is free site , where readers can leave comments , for free , like it says on the tin .
And the very first comment read : " Come on .
A boring piece of fluff about spiders ?
Where 's the passion and intensity ?
Sort it out . "
You can't win .
Ironically , I first came to the attention of the " mass media " because I wrote a website jam - packed with " passion and intensity " - alongside bad language , grotesque mental imagery , and extreme scatological humour .
Today , as part of the " mass media " , those final three are the three tools I 'm not allowed to employ , because the " mass " sadly encompasses " the humourless " .
None the less , there is n't a week that goes by when I do n't try to sneak all three elements in , because they make me giggle .
These excesses get cut before making it to print .
My words go through a filter that 's out of my control .

No paper wants to gratuitously offend the reader .
Pity , because gratuitous offence , when performed with aplomb , is the funniest thing in the world .
There 's more unpretentious joie de vivre in a single issue of vintage - era Viz than most artists or singers manage in a lifetime .
I 'd like nothing better than to fill the rest of this page with an unnecessarily florid description of something utterly disgusting happening to a well - known public figure - an 850 - word fantasy in which , say , David Miliband unexpectedly develops extreme and explosive diarrhoea while entertaining a group of foreign dignitaries in a pod on the London Eye on the hottest day of the year , to take just one example .
But I can't , because a tiny handful of you would complain .
In my view , the delight such an unnecessary and puerile description would give to myself and others far outweighs the pain it would cause these oversensitive life - spoiling idiots .
The offended people .
I hate offended people .
They come in two flavours - huffy and whiny - and it's hard to know which is worst .
The huffy ones are self - important , narcissistic authoritarians in love with the sound of their own booming disapproval , while the whiny , sparrowlike ones are so annoying and sickly and ill - equipped for life on Earth you just want to smack them round the head until they stop crying and grow up .
Combined , they 're the very worst people on the planet - 20 times worse than child molesters , and I say that not because it 's true ( it is n't ) , but because it'll upset them unnecessarily , and these readers deserve to be upset unnecessarily , morning , noon and night , every sodding day , for the rest of their wheedling lives .
Note I used the word " sodding " there , because even though every single one of you knows precisely what word I meant to use , I 'm not allowed to use it in print in case the whiny / huffy Axis of Feeble decides to piddle its pants with dismay at the sight of a commonplace assembly of letters .
And they must be appeased at all times .
What these nitpicky , sexless complainists fail to realise is that sweary tastelessness is a celebration of life , as soaring and majestic as a gospel choir in full flow , and no amount of tedious squeamishness can alter that .
Potentially offended reader - you are the offence .
In fact you 're a four - letter word beginning with " c " and ending in " t " .
Yes .
That 's right .
You 're an absolute clot .

I had expected to be as irritated by Michael Behe ’s second book as by his first .
I had not expected to feel sorry for him .
The first — “ Darwin ’s Black Box ” ( 1996 ) , which purported to make the scientific case for “ intelligent design ” — was enlivened by a spark of conviction , however misguided .
The second is the book of a man who has given up .
Trapped along a false path of his own rather unintelligent design , Behe has left himself no escape .
Poster boy of creationists everywhere , he has cut himself adrift from the world of real science .
And real science , in the shape of his own department of biological sciences at Lehigh University , has publicly disowned him , via a remarkable disclaimer on its
Web site : “ While we respect Prof .
Behe ’s right to express his views , they are his alone and are in no way endorsed by the department .
It is our collective position that intelligent design has no basis in science , has not been tested experimentally and should not be regarded as scientific . ”
As the Chicago geneticist Jerry Coyne wrote recently , in a devastating review of Behe ’s work in The New Republic , it would be hard to find a precedent .
For a while , Behe built a nice little career on being a maverick .
His colleagues might have disowned him , but they did n’t receive flattering invitations to speak all over the country and to write for The New York Times .
Behe ’s name , and not theirs , crackled triumphantly around the memosphere .
But things went wrong , especially at the famous 2005 trial where Judge John E. Jones III immortally summed up as “ breathtaking inanity ” the effort to introduce intelligent design into the school curriculum in Dover , Pa .
After his humiliation in court , Behe — the star witness for the creationist side — might have wished to re-establish his scientific credentials and start over .
Unfortunately , he had dug himself in too deep .
He had to soldier on .
“ The Edge of Evolution ” is the messy result , and it does n’t make for attractive reading .
We now hear less about “ irreducible complexity , ” with good reason .
In “ Darwin ’s Black Box , ” Behe simply asserted without justification that particular biological structures ( like the bacterial flagellum , the tiny propeller by which bacteria swim ) needed all their parts to be in place before they would work , and therefore could not have evolved incrementally .
This style of argument remains as unconvincing as when Darwin himself anticipated it .
It commits the logical error of arguing by default .
Two rival theories , A and B , are set up .
Theory A explains loads of facts and is supported by mountains of evidence .
Theory B has no supporting evidence , nor is any attempt made to find any .
Now a single little fact is discovered , which A allegedly ca n’t explain .
Without even asking whether B can explain it , the default conclusion is fallaciously drawn : B must be correct .
Incidentally , further research usually reveals that A can explain the phenomenon after all : thus the biologist Kenneth R. Miller ( a believing Christian who testified for the other side in the Dover trial ) beautifully showed how the bacterial flagellar motor could evolve via known functional intermediates .
Behe correctly dissects the Darwinian theory into three parts : descent with modification , natural selection and mutation .
Descent with modification gives him no problems , nor does natural selection .
They are “ trivial ” and “ modest ” notions , respectively .
Do his creationist fans know that Behe accepts as “ trivial ” the fact that we are African apes , cousins of monkeys , descended from fish ?
I really wish I was n’t in this position this morning .
Not the one where I ’m hunched over my laptop at my kitchen with Unistone Quartz desk , but the one where I ’m asking you ( yes you ! ) to actually DO something about our nation ’s energy policy .
I ’d much rather have you sit back with an interested smirk on your face as you glean over state , federal , and local solar incentives , read about such - and - such cool solar installation in Spain , or even watch in amusement at Dave ’s complete lack of skills at being an investigative solar reporter .
Here ’s the deal though , here ’s why we ’re pissed , and here ’s why we ’re looking for you to jump up from your seat , throw a concerned citizen cape on , and pick up your telephone :
Congress is failing us , our planet , and is about to screw us out of being the front - runners in the burgeoning green energy industry .
Two days ago the SEIA has issued a warning that our lawmakers are considering dropping investment tax credits ( ITCs ) for those of you intending to go solar .
This is unconscionable .
ITCs currently are at low rates ( $ 2,000 for installing your own solar / 30 % of system tax credit for homes and businesses ) and now our government littlewhigs are poised to eliminate them altogether .
Unfortunately , that ’s not all .
There ’s also growing concern that they will throw a national energy standard off the table as well .
This standard calls for at least 15 % of the nation ’s electricity generated from renewable sources by 2020 .
What ?!
We ca n’t meet that ?
Of course we can .
There ’s just a lot of old oil and coal interests here that do n’t want that .
So , pick up that phone and politely urge your congressperson and / or senator to grow the balls to stand up for the planet , our economy , and progressive thought patterns .
If they so happen to be on the same page as you , great .
However , urge them to speak the f*ck up in front of other representatives !
It ’s like we ’ve got a whole bunch of these guys running the show :
WTF !?
If you want some more ammunition for your phone call or if you need some further encouragement to actually make that phone call , here are 3 more issues that just popped into mind to consider :
About a week ago , Warren Buffet was willing to wager $ 1,000,000 with any Forbes 400 executive that their percentage paid in income taxes was less than the average rate of all of their secretaries .
Nobody took that bet .
Billions of dollars in farm subsidies ( going mainly to multimillionaire landowners who do n’t even farm anymore or never did ) are artificially supporting the production of products detrimental to the environment , our health and sucks the livelihood from our international trade partners .
The amount we are spending on the Iraq war ( can we still call this a war ? ) dwarfs that which we are investing in renewable energy research and development .
For a thoughtful review on just what we could purchase with all those war dollars , please check out this NYTimes article and this SolarPowerRocks article .
Be strong !
Pick up the Phone !
Let us know you did !
They ’re voting next week :
( 202 ) 225-3121
After hearing President Bush beseech members of Congress for $ 68B more dollars for the war in Iraq tonight , I got myself to thinking .
If we ’re already spending $ 120B a year on this war and we simply decided to bring our troops home , how far could we get in meeting our nation ’s energy demands solely with sunshine and that extra $ 68B dollars ?
Well according to an article in the Green Wombat last month , a solitary solar thermal plant sized at 92 x 92 miles could take care of our entire energy demand .
That ’s the size of land that purple square takes up in the above map .
Granted , for security purposes it would be a dumb idea to go and build a lone solar plant like this , so let ’s do some more realistic math .
The land area cited in that article was 92*92 mi = 8464sq. miles .
Let ’s say we intend to create 16 solar thermal power plants and scatter them about really sunny areas of our country such as the southwest , Texas , and areas of Florida .
8464/16 = 529sq. miles for each solar thermal power plant .
It just so happens that the square root of 529 gives a clean 23 !
So we are in search of sixteen 23 by 23 mile plots of sunny land to power the entire country .
We ’ve got $ 68 Billion dollars to spend on all of them , or $ 4,250,000,000 for each one .
Since the Nevada Solar
One project cost roughly $ 240,000,000 , produces 64MW of power and amounts to 1 mile by ½ mile ( pictured above – thanks to googlemaps ) of concentrating thermal solar , let ’s just say we use that extra war money to purchase as much solar energy as we can afford .
Pictured below is the Nevada Solar Two plant ( which I created in MsPaint .. Long live MsPaint ! ) .
As you can see , this hypothetical solar thermal plant is about 3 miles by 3 miles , is constructed of 18 Nevada Solar Ones , would produce 1,152MW and would cost at most $ 3.2B ( 200 million * 18 ) .
I say “ at most ” here because you ’ve got all the equipment going to one place and there are bound to be efficiencies with economy of scale , etc. to bring the megaplant ’s cost down a bit from the original $ 240 M to $ 200 M .
But we have enough cash from the proposed war spending to build about 20 of them ( $ 68B/20 = $ 3.2B ) .
So we ’re at 9sq miles * 20 Nevada Solar Twos = 180sq miles of solar thermal energy and 23,040 MW .
That ’s a bit of a far cry from the 8464sq miles needed to satiate the demands of the entire country .
We ’re just over 2 percent there .
While this might sound like a marginal amount of energy , consider that 23,040 MW of energy is equivalent to the amount produced by 19 nuclear power plants ( 1,200 MW apiece ! ) !
23,040 MW of energy could power 14,400,000 homes .
That ’s the number of households in New York City , Los Angeles , and Chicago – combined !
If you really want to shake things up , consider that since the Iraq war began , we are now roughly $ 9 Trillion dollars in debt .
Many people , including myself , do n’t have any concept of how much money that really is .
Well , that ’s $ 9,000,000,000,000 dollars .
Remember those 16 plots of 23 × 23 miles we needed to satiate the nation ’s thirst for energy ?
Well 9 Trillion dollars would be enough to purchase about 2,813 Nevada Solar Twos !
That ’s 9sq. miles * 2,813 = 25,317 sq. miles of solar thermal energy – more than triple the land area in solar power plants to satisfy the energy demands of our entire country !
It truly is depressing to imagine what the other 2/3rds of that $ 9 Trillion could have been used for .
Universal health care ?
Education ?
Ugh !

Perception , reality clash in racially torn Jena Many say tales of segregation , nooses and bigotry are distortions
The town of Jena , La. , confronts a racial nightmare that has brought global focus after claims of injustice against six black youths charged in the beating of a white teen .
The town of Jena , La. , confronts a racial nightmare that has brought global focus after claims of injustice against six black youths charged in the beating of a white teen .

JENA , LA . —
It 's got all the elements of a Delta blues ballad from the days of Jim Crow : hangman 's nooses dangling from a shade tree ; a mysterious fire in the night ; swift deliberations by a condemning , all - white jury .
And drawn by this story , which evokes the worst of a nightmarish past , they came by the thousands this past week to Jena , La. — to demand justice , to show strength , to beat back the forces of racism as did their parents and grandparents .
But there are many in Jena who say the tale of the " Jena 6 " — the black teenagers who were charged with attempted murder and conspiracy for attacking a white classmate at Jena High School last December — is not as simple as all that .
Black and white , they say that in its repeated retelling — enhanced by omissions and alterations of fact — the story has taken on a life of its own .
It has transformed a schoolyard stomping into an international cause celebre , and those accused of participating in it into what one major Southern daily came to describe as " latter - day Scottsboro Boys . "
And they say that though their town 's race relations are not unblemished , this is not the cauldron of bigotry that has been depicted .
' Blown out of proportion '
To Ben Reid , 61 , who set down roots in Jena in 1957 and lived here through the civil rights era , " this whole thing ain't no downright , racial affair . "
Reid , who is black , presently serves on the LaSalle Parish council .
He reads the papers .
He hears the talk outside of church on Sundays about how the Jena 6 business is dividing his hometown down racial lines .
He does n't buy it .
" You have good people here and bad people here , on both sides .
This thing has been blown out of proportion .
What we ought to do is sit down and talk this thing out , ' cause once all is said and done and you media folks leave , we 're the ones who 're going to have to live here . "
Clearly , something bad occurred in Jena — population 2,971 — an old sawmill town in LaSalle Parish that , once upon a time , was Ku Klux Klan country .
And , as most white and black residents readily agree , there is no good reason for embracing what unfolded here .
But what happened , exactly ?
The story goes that a year ago , a black student asked at an assembly if he could sit in the shade of a live oak , which , the story goes , was labeled " the white tree " because only white students hung out there .
The next day , three nooses dangled from the oak — code for " KKK " — the handiwork of three white students , who were suspended for three days .
Much of that is disputed .
What happened next is not :
Two months later , an arsonist torched a wing of Jena High School .
( The case remains unsolved . )
Two fights between blacks and whites roiled the town that weekend , culminating in a schoolyard brawl Dec. 4 that led the district attorney to charge the Jena 6 with attempted murder .
The lethal weapon he cited to justify the charge : the boys ' sneakers .
In July , the first to be tried , Mychal Bell , was convicted after two hours of deliberations by an all - white jury on reduced charges of aggravated battery and conspiracy to commit it .
( It was widely reported that Bell , now 17 , was an honor student with no prior criminal record .
Although he had a high grade point average , he was , in fact , on probation for at least two counts of battery and a count of criminal damage to property .
His conviction was overturned because an appeals court ruled he should not have been tried as an adult . )
Rumors and innuendoes
There is , however , a more nuanced rendition of events — one that can be found in court testimony , in interviews with teachers , officials and students at Jena High , and in public statements from a U.S. attorney who reviewed the case for possible federal intervention .
Consider :
• The so - called " white tree " at Jena High , often reported to be the domain of only white students , was nothing of the sort , say teachers and school administrators ; students of all races , they say , congregated under it at one time or another .
• Two nooses — not three — were found dangling from the tree .
Beyond being offensive to blacks , the nooses were cut down because black and white students " were playing with them , pulling on them , jump - swinging from them , and putting their heads through them , " according to a black teacher who witnessed the scene .
• There was no connection between the September noose incident and December attack , according to Donald Washington , an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department in western Louisiana , who investigated claims that these events might be race - related hate crimes .
• The three youths accused of hanging the nooses were not suspended for just three days — they were isolated at an alternative school for about a month , and then given an in - school suspension for two weeks .
• The six - member jury that convicted Bell was , indeed , all white .
However , only one in 10 people in LaSalle Parish is African - American , and though black residents were selected randomly by computer and summoned for jury selection , none showed up .
About 225 miles and a world apart from racially mixed New Orleans , Jena ( pronounced JEE - nuh ) is a throwback .
Here , one refers to elders as " Sir , " and " Ma'am . "
Children still pull catfish from creeks ; couples court at Jena Bears football games ; families rope goats and calves at weekend rodeos .
In a place where per capita income is $ 13,761 , there are n't any swank , French restaurants , but rather , family eateries such as the Burger Barn , Ginny 's and Maw & Paw's .
Most of Jena 's 14 - odd churches stage Easter egg hunts .
On summer afternoons , sweet tea and lemonade on a neighbor 's front porch are obligatory .
Past still influences present
Not all vestiges of the past are beloved , or quaint , of course .
There are no black lawyers , no black doctors and one black employee in the town 's half - dozen banks .
( The employee is male , an accountant who works out of public view . )
Economics play a role in this ; with the closure of the sawmills in the ' 50s , the town now relies heavily on the exploitation of oil and natural gas , offshore .
There are relatively few good - paying jobs in what is gradually becoming a retirement community , and some point out that African - Americans with higher educations tend to leave the parish .
Cleveland Riser , 75 , who began working in Jena as a teacher and then rose to become an assistant superintendent of schools in LaSalle Parish , says blacks have long had trouble getting ahead in Jena .
" In my experience , the opportunity for advancing in my profession was denied , in my opinion , because I was black — not because I was unprepared professionally , or because of my performance . "
Billy Wayne Fowler , a white school - board member , said , " If I could take you back to 60 years ago , and then fast forward to today , you 'd have to say we 've come a long way . "
Most townsfolk , he says , interpreted the events of last year pretty much the same way — that a small minority of troublemakers , both black and white , got out of hand , and that the responses from authorities were n't always on the mark .
The boys who hung the nooses " probably should have been expelled , " Fowler says , and the charges brought against the black teenagers were " too harsh , too severe . "
' No innocent prank '
Tommy Farris , 27 , an oil driller , and his wife , Nikki , 29 , a registered nurse , concur — to a point .
" Those boys should have expelled , " says Nikki , who is white .
" It was no innocent prank .
I think those boys knew what they were starting by hanging those nooses from a tree . "
Tommy , who is black , agrees .
But free the Jena 6 ?
" That 's not going to happen , " he says , adding that he thinks the black teenagers are being given a fair chance to defend themselves against the charges .
Reed Walters , the LaSalle Parish district attorney who is prosecuting the cases of the Jena 6 , insisted the case " is not and never has been about race .
It is about finding justice for an innocent victim and holding people accountable for their actions . "
Huey Crockett , 50 , lives with his wife , Carla , 45 , in a heavily wooded , predominantly black district just beyond Jena 's limits , an area known as " The Country . "
The Crocketts , who are black , have complained to police that Bell and other youngsters were causing trouble in their neighborhood — scratching cars with keys , breaking the windows of parked cars , spraying property with paint .
The authorities , Crockett says , were always slow to respond .
" But as soon as he had a run-in with a white boy , they came down on him like a hammer .
That 's not right . "

**********************************************
NEW YORK – Armies of invisible creatures are spreading across the planet , infesting local communities and claiming the lives of innocent children in their wake .
And the attackers are immune to some of the world 's best weaponry .
It sounds more like a sci - fi movie plot than reality , but " superbugs " — deadly microbes that can resist drugs designed to wipe them out — are far from imaginary .
Schoolchildren in several states recently have died from infections caused by MRSA bacteria , otherwise known as methicillin - resistant Staphylococcus aureus , and medical recordkeeping shows such cases are increasing annually .
MSRA spreads via surface - to - surface contact , developing into a staph infection if conditions are right .
The first symptoms can include pimple - like sores on the skin where the bacteria launch their attack , while rarer but more advanced infections can enter the bloodstream , attack organs and lead to death .
But need the masses live in fear of stubborn yet deadly microbes such as MRSA as their numbers rise worldwide , or are we overreacting ?
Most medical experts think superbug diseases are here to stay but offer a major caveat :
Only a fraction of the population need worry a little , if at all .
The numbers
An estimated 18,650 Americans died in 2005 from MRSA , a microbe whose defenses have benefited from decades of assault by antibiotics .
" The spread of MRSA is n't a flash in the pan .
It 's been around for about 50 years now , " said Dr. Cyrus Hopkins , an infectious diseases specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital .
Healthy people are hardly its favorite customers and rarely meet the microbe .
About 77 percent of deaths from MRSA in 2005 occurred in people 65 or older , according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association , an age bracket known for weakened immune systems .
For people younger than 65 , the chances of dying from a lightning strike ( about 1 in 600,000 ) are greater .
" I think people should understand that the chance of being exposed to a superbug is very small , " Hopkins said .
" Even if they are exposed , the chance they 'll get sick from it is very small .
And if they do get sick , most healthy people survive . "
The chances are low , Hopkins explained , because the body 's immune system can fight dangerous invasions ; in addition , populations of " friendly " microbes living inside of our bodies easily out - compete invaders .
Twenty - five to 30 percent of people , in fact , carry harmless S. aureus bacteria inside their nose as " natural flora . "
The principle of natural flora explains how most Escherichia coli strains live peacefully within our intestines .
Eat some spoiled or improperly cooked food , however , and a bigger dose of those or other more foreign bacteria can lead to diarrhea or infection if the microbial visitors to your gut are virulent , as were E. coli strains contaminating spinach earlier this year .
Evolution on drugs
But where do the harmful , drug - resistant nemeses come from ?
Experts think the answer lies in how we combat diseases with antibiotics .
Antibiotics shut down unruly bacteria directly , police them until the immune system can rid of them or both .
And each new antibiotic on the market works well — at least for a few years , said Dr. Martin Blaser , a professor at New York University 's School of Medicine and former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America ( IDSA ) .
Medical experts such as Blaser think the forces of evolution start working as soon as patients carrying a dangerous microbe receive antibiotics .
" Anyone who does n't believe in evolution just has to look at MRSA , " Blaser said of the microbe 's growing arsenal of drug resistance .
Kill off millions or billions of harmful bacteria with an antibiotic , and some stragglers with a life - saving genetic change carry on their heritage .
If a similar drug is used again , it 's much less effective than before ; repeat the cycle , and eventually microbes like MRSA make news headlines .
Making matters worse , Blaser said , is that drug companies have little incentive to create new antibiotics — they are expensive to test , and the customer turnaround is quick and unprofitable .
" Until we develop new antibiotics and change our usage — we use antibiotics like water — these problems will persist , " said Blaser , who is lobbying congress with other IDSA members to offer monetary incentives to develop new antibiotics .
But recent victims of virulent S. aureus strains that killed schoolchildren have many medical experts on edge , as most victims were healthy .
Blaser said the responsible MSRA strains probably did not come out of hospitals , which are well - known breeding grounds for drug - resistant diseases .
" It 's not just affecting previously ill people , " Blaser said .
" It 's football players , wrestlers and just plain healthy kids . "
Blaser thinks the microbial attackers somehow evolved to be more invasive than their more bashful in - laws .
Sustained attack
The growing world population may be the force whacking the evolutionary beehive for virulence , a measure of a microbe 's ability to infect something .
People used to live in small , spread - out communities , so when super - aggressive diseases did appear , Blaser said they could n't get very far .
" Every time a virulent disease popped up , it was ' end of story . '
They had nowhere else to go , " he said .
But today , populations are immense , tightly connected around the globe and contain growing elderly populations as well as carriers of immune - weakening diseases such as HIV .
Blaser said the combination is a recipe for disaster , and his group 's new model of that recipe was detailed the Oct. 18 issue of the journal Nature .
" We did not make the laws of nature , " Blaser said .
Even though we may not like them , we need to understand them to better control infectious diseases . "
Chamber of wisdom Trying to understand infectious diseases is what engineer Clive Beggs has built his career around — quite literally .
The medical technology professor at the University of Bradford in England has helped build one of only a few chambers in the world that can precisely study the hospital environments in which microbes tend to infect people .
" If you look at a common laboratory , you 'll find microbes in Petri dishes or in a broth , but that tells you little about how they really behave in realistic environments , " Beggs said .
The 2,825 - cubic - foot ( 80 - cubic - meter ) climate - controlled room goes online in November and contains a mock - up of a hospital ward .
The research team made of doctors , engineers , mathematicians and other specialists hopes to study how microbes " get from A to B and what they do in between , " Beggs said .
" We want to see how nurses tear down patients ' beds , for example , and find out how that might help spread microbes like C. diff , " Beggs said , referring to Clostridium difficile — a drug - resistant microbe that is currently ravaging hospitals in Europe .
" It 's difficult to do the research we 'd like to do in a real hospital , " he said .
" There are bureaucratic issues in gaining access to hospitals , and there 's a huge amount of variables we can't control . "
In addition , Beggs said follow - up clinical studies are long and expensive — so having the most accurate and reliable information possible before taking the plunge is crucial .
Before the researchers investigate how best to clean hospital rooms , however , they will first focus on how humidity affects superbugs .
" A few studies suggest the drying effects of ( air conditioning ) could control the spread of some microbes , " Beggs said .
" But overall , there 's little research in this area .
We want to change that and possibly help people . "
Beggs said such environmental countermeasures to prevent bacteria 's spread are extremely important , especially if there are fewer new antibiotics in the pipeline .
" In general , hospitals are doing everything they can to maintain clean and safe facilities , but we do n't fully understand how ward environments affect the spread and development of superbugs , " he said .
Stopping a superbug
While research groups such as Beggs ' come up with new ways to thwart dangerous microbes and others seek new antibiotics , some experts think vaccines are as important as ever .
Problem is , the disease - preventint injections are as financially unattractive as new antibiotics .
" Nobody will invest in a vaccine to fight a disease that is n't very widespread , " said Donald Kennedy , a medical professor at St. Louis University 's School of Medicine .
If vaccine development could get a boost , however , Kennedy thinks microbes like MRSA could get the boot , much like smallpox , or at least be set back as measles , polio and hepatitis B are in the United States .
" Vaccination strategies have eliminated or reduced those diseases , not treatment strategies , " he said .
" It 's a challenge , but if we 're smart enough we could do it .
Most people would rather not catch a disease than take drugs while they have one . "
Until more advanced solutions come along , people are sticking to tried - and - true advice any doctor would offer :
Wash your hands , and wash them often .
" That 's what our school is recommending our students do , " said Tricia Gordon , a public high school teacher in Manassas , Va. , where MRSA outbreaks have occurred .
" We 've sent out public health warnings and information .
We 're also now requiring kids who play sports to get cleared if they have any sores and we 've updated our cleaning supplies to handle ( MRSA ) . "
Gordon said most people use the information responsibly , but some seem to be acting a little paranoid .
" Some people think the situation is a bit extreme , with kids thinking they have it when with every little pimple that shows up , " she said .
" Knowledge is power , but you have to keep your head screwed on and act on common sense . "
To do that , Hopkins said following up on public health warnings is crucial .
" Do n't react to the 11 o'clock news and get scared .
Go to your health department 's Web site for detailed information , " Hopkins said .
" And do n't forget to wash your hands . "

BitDefender , a computer security company based in Bucharest , Romania , has also detected the Ron Paul spam offense .
Here 's what they found :
BUCHAREST , Romania – October 29 , 2007 – BitDefender® , an award - winning provider of antivirus software and data security solutions , today found that a large wave of unsolicited e-mails exhorting the qualities of Ron
Paul as a candidate for the U.S. presidency are being captured by
BitDefender spam filters .
The spam e-mails originate from many different computers , with a wide geographical distribution , making BitDefender specialists suspect that the spammer is using a “ bot ” network for his " run . ”
The e-mails appear to have false “ To : ” fields – a hallmark of spam –
making it highly unlikely that this is part of a legitimate campaign .
" We have n't observed any previous cases of using spam to try and influence a presidential campaign , in the USA or elsewhere , ” declared
Vlad Valceanu , head of BitDefender ’s antispam unit .
“ It remains to be seen what impact ( if any ) this incident has on the outcome of the election , but it 's certainly a worrying incident , as people of other political inclinations may feel compelled to counter with some spam of their own . ”

Lots of people seem to like dumping on Mahalo and Jason Calacanis .
For example , Andrew Baron recently posted about Why Mahalo is Fundamentally Flawed .
Try Googling Mahalo sucks and you ’ll get about 232,000 hits .
Take your pick of the highly critical coverage .
Some of the negative commentary on Mahalo is probably due to professional and personal jealousy .
Some of it is due to the fact that it ’s early days yet .
And I think some of it may be due to Jason happily telling people to look left while he goes right .
How can Jason raise money for Mahalo at valuations north of $ 100 M ?
Surely there must be a revenue plan that holds water ?
If you want to argue that Mahalo is a failure and that Jason is simply a ceaseless self - marketer full of hot air , you ’ll need to argue that some of the same things are true of Mahalo ’s investors .
Or maybe we ’re in a bubble and they ’ve all simply lost it .
Here ’s what I think is going on .
Firstly , I think Jason is using a little smoke and mirrors when he calls Mahalo a search engine and frequently compares Mahalo ’s “ search ” results to Google ’s .
With few exceptions , everyone seems to be buying it !
With few exceptions , people compare Mahalo with Google – presumably because Jason tells them to and because he talks about being a search engine .
And , with few exceptions , the technorati tell us that Mahalo is a pretty crappy search engine .
I agree , because Mahalo is not a search engine .
Putting a box labeled “ Search ” on your web site to dig hits out of your own content does not make you a search engine – if it did , millions of sites would qualify .
Passing queries off to Google and showing the results does not make you a search engine , either .
Telling people to compare your content with Google ’s results does not make you a search engine .
Nor does putting the words “ search engine ” in your company ’s strapline .
Mahalo will never be a search engine , and almost certainly does not want to be a search engine .
That would be suicidal .
I believe their strategy is entirely different and that the relevant comparison is not with Google , but with Wikipedia .
Mahalo is a rapidly growing collection of carefully curated content .
Mahalo is Wikipedia with a different model of control , ownership , and content creation .
It ’s a benevolent dictator with a purchase agreement instead of a loose anarchy with the GNU Free Documentation License .
If you want to compare Mahalo to something , compare it to Wikipedia .
Jason is a huge fan of Wikipedia .
And here he is begging Jimbo Wales not to leave $ 100 M / yr on the table .
Interesting .
Right now Mahalo has roughly 25 K pages .
Google has information on , let ’s say , 10 billion pages .
By this simplistic measure , Google is about 400,000 times bigger than Mahalo .
You ’re not going to catch or compete with Google using people to make content .
Yes , you can use Google for things you do n’t have static pages for , as Mahalo does .
But Mahalo is not a search engine .
Never will be .
Now consider Wikipedia .
Wikipedia has 1.2M English pages .
That means that , in English , Wikipedia is a mere 48 times larger than Mahalo !
Now we ’re talking .
Mahalo are currenly adding something like 1,000 pages a week .
Suppose Jason manages to double that quite soon .
That would be 100K pages a year , or about 8.3 % of Wikipedia annually .
So I think it ’s conceivable that Mahalo could catch Wikipedia .
Even if they keep a steady ship and only gain linearly they could easily be 35 - 40 % the size of Wikipedia in 4 years ’ time .
But sheer number of pages is only part of the story .
Because the distribution of search requests will follow some kind of power law , you can pick up ( say ) half of all search requests by only covering a small number of them , and , as always , leave the long tail to Google .
So with a small finite amount of work , you can cover a very large chunk of Wikipedia .
And I think that ’s exactly what Mahalo are aiming to do .
A few weeks ago I pulled down all of Mahalo ’s URIs for another project .
Here ’s a tiny sample – and I really did pick this out at random :

So what ?
you might ask .
Well , let ’s replace www.mahalo.com with en.wikipedia.org / wiki in the above .
We get :

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Tech_Report

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Salmond
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Merkel
And guess what ?
All those URIs actually work !
See below for a possible reason for this uncanny coincidence .
Research question : what percentage of Mahalo URIs work as Wikipedia URIs with the above simple substitution ?
I may do this test when I get a little more time .
I bet the answer is high .
Ask yourself again : does Mahalo look more like Google or more like Wikipedia ?
The idea of Mahalo - as - search - alternative - to - Google is just Jason operating Mahalo in stealth mode in broad daylight .
“ Hey , Rocky , watch me pull a search engine out of my hat !
Oops !
That ’s not a search engine .
I swear there was a search engine in there somewhere . ”
How is Mahalo different from Wikipedia ?
A big one is that Mahalo owns all its content .
If Mahalo puts one of your pages on its site , you ’ll first sign a purchase agreement in which the
Seller hereby irrevocably sells , grants , assigns , conveys and transfers to Mahalo , exclusively and forever , Seller ’s entire right , title and interest in and to the SeRPs
and in which you warrant that the content is legit , in which you fully indemnify Mahalo , and in which you agree to let them be your agent and attorney should they need to take some action to obtain or protect the content .
In consideration you get $ 10 - $ 15 which you can have in cash .
Or , in a wonderfully ironic and masterful gesture , you can have your earnings donated to the Wikimedia Foundation !
That ’s just brilliant , I love it .
How can you not be in awe of that ?
The guy ’s a genius .
Talking of genius , just look at the language on the payment details page at Mahalo : “ A Greenhouse Guide begins their career in the Greenhouse … ” .
You see ?
Writing articles for Mahalo is the beginning of a career .
George Lakoff would probably count that as a classic example of framing ( also see here ) .
Unlike Wikipedia , Mahalo owns every word of its content .
That means they can sell it .
That they can be acquired .
But who would want to acquire Mahalo ?
Wait .
What other differences are there between Wikipedia and Mahalo ?
Another big one is the millions of links on the internet that point to Wikipedia pages .
Those little tubules that make up the internets , with Google ’s PageRank worming its way down each and every one , assigning and passing on credit .
There are two things here : 1 ) the links themselves and 2 ) the high consequent position Wikipedia ’s pages have on Google .
Can Mahalo get large numbers of people to link to their pages ?
If the pages are any good ( and they are ) , then why not ?
Plus , it may be that Mahalo can catch Wikipedia in terms of how many people link to them .
According to the Netcraft October 2007 Web Server Survey , the number of servers on the net has been growing at an amazing 5 % per month !
That ’s just the rate of increase of new servers , not the rate of new pages being put onto existing sites .
Let ’s assume the Netcraft server number is n’t too far from the overall growth , and that the web roughly doubles in size every two years .
That means if the size today is X , then in 4 years , towards the end of Jason ’s horizon , it will be size 4X .
If so , there are 3X pages yet to come into existence .
The creators of these will have a choice to point links at Wikipedia or Mahalo .
If popular momentum can be shifted to Mahalo , it can grab a large chunk of the link pie graph .
All of which brings us , inevitably , to Google .
Quick survey question : when you need to find something that you know you ’d be happy to read in Wikipedia , do you first go to Wikipedia , find English ( or your language ) , find their search box , enter your query , and click on the link ?
Or do you go to Google and take its Wikipedia link ?
I thought so – you use Google .
It ’s a uniform way to get to things , it ’s likely integrated into your browser , and they generally do a better and faster job of indexing sites ’ content than the sites do themselves .
So the existence and massive popularity of Wikipedia drives traffic to Google .
And Google of course drives traffic to Wikipedia .
The two of them are dating .
But Wikipedia is not the perfect lover : they stubbornly refuse to put ads on their pages , to share the love .
Along comes Jason Calacanis , then at AOL , to whom this is all very clear .
He tells Wikipedia in no uncertain terms that with all that traffic they could make $ 100 M per year from ads on just the home page .
He points to a conservative estimate of the worth of Wikipedia at $ 600 M , and his own estimate is $ 5B .
Hmmmmm .
What ’s an entrepreneur to do when he sees someone leaving that much value on the table ?
Back to Google .
They would like to have more content .
Traditionally , when you got back a page of their search results , you would n’t see links to pages on Google – that would n’t make sense : there were no pages on Google , after all .
Google was supposed to point you to other pages .
It was an index to help you find the things you actually wanted to look at .
That was the old model .
These days , Google is buying content ( e.g. , YouTube ) and pointing their search results at their content , neatly taking the ad revenue in both places .
All the better if the content comes with indemnification .
You can see where I ’m going .
Mahalo already does advertising with Google .
In fact , they ’re already a premium adsense publisher to the surprise of some .
If ads on the single front page of Wikipedia could generate $ 100 M annually , what could ads on all Mahalo pages generate if Mahalo grows to rival Wikipedia ?
And … who weighs the importance of links ( and other unknown factors ) in Google ’s results page ?
Yes , of course , Google does .
According to this Fast Company article , Mahalo gets 65 % of revenue Google makes when it sends its users into Google .
And Google makes money when it sends its users into Mahalo .
If there ’s really ( say ) $ 1B of value to be had by building a successful commercial version of Wikipedia , you can see why Google might have some interest in nudging links to Mahalo a little higher in its results .
Maybe even higher than the equivalent page for Wikipedia .
Now would be a good moment to remember that I illustrated above just how trivial it can be to match up equivalent Mahalo and Wikipedia pages …
Got it ?
User enters a query , Google does the search and finds a highly - linked Wikipedia page , then in an instant they can make and instead display a link to the equivalent Mahalo page , optionally displaying the Wikipedia page below the fold .
Would that qualify as evil ?
All of which leads to a very clear answer to my “ who would want to acquire Mahalo ? ” question .
Interestingly , Google will want to wait until Mahalo is big ( they will know exactly when , supposing Mahalo keeps using adsense ) .
They want Mahalo to be independent and with strong momentum before they turn the corporate intake valve in the Mahalo direction .
Can Jason build a viable alternative to Wikipedia ?
I bet he can .
He has the lessons of Wikipedia .
He does n’t have the anarchy factor .
He has no spam .
He knows what he ’s doing , and he ’s in control .
It ’s a content play , and Jason is a content guy .
An editor with a track record of building valuable content in this way .
He ’s playing to his strengths .
The engineering is not nearly as daunting as building a Google .
He has the money .
As he ramps it up he ’s going to have more money .
Who ’s going to stop him ?
Certainly not Google – that ’s not in their interest at all .
Almost certainly not Wikipedia – unless they start putting up ads and funneling large amounts of money back to Google .
And Jason is unlikely to shoot himself in the foot either – quite the reverse .
So if that ’s the strategy , and if he ’s on track with content ( as he seems to be ) , and if the content is passably good , or better ( which it is ) , and if he has a good understanding with his “ friends at Google ” ( which you can bet he does — let ’s not forget the Sequoia factor either ) , and if the revenue numbers are about right , then a $ 175 M valuation for an upcoming round to accelerate things might look like a steal .
Along the way , Jason gets to have a quiet inner smile at all the people whining about how Mahalo is a crap search engine .
He feeds the fire all the while , telling them to go ahead , make his day , and compare Mahalo ’s results to Google ’s ( but not Wikipedia ’s ) .
Misdirecting attention towards Google and having people write him off probably suits him just fine .
Meanwhile , they ’re getting on with the real mission .
After the long debate over raising the debt ceiling , the party politics and all the political posturing , one would think it would have had stronger consequence on the economy .
Settling this issue should have investors breathing a deep sigh of relief and going back to business , status quo .
That picture could n’t be more false .
The historic deal was shortly followed by the S&P 500 index suffering its biggest one day fall in over a year .
Treasury bonds fell to their lowest rate in nine months , too .
So , what went wrong ?
What ’s the matter here ?
We were led to believe that raising the debt ceiling was the panacea to all our economic problems .
Can it be that the debt ceiling has only helped set the stage for further economic stagnation ?
By refusing to cut entitlement programs and raising taxes on the highest earners , has the government simply placed a sloppy Band - Aid on wound that is hemorrhaging ?
There are several factors at work : government statisticians have recently revised their numbers to show that the 2008 recession was much deeper than originally thought and our recovery considerably weaker .
Our GDP is weak : over the past year it has grown at 1.6 % , a pace that traditionally has led the country into a recession .
These statistics leave consumers wondering if the recession ever really ended , or if perhaps we are about to enter into a new recession .
Consumer confidence , as well as consumer spending , has dropped off this summer .
Fears of a “ double dip ” recession grow daily .
Our saving hope is that some politician from one side of the fence will come forward and tell the American people the truth , even if it hurts .
That truth is this : it ’s going to take some tough cuts , at every imaginable economic level , if we are ever going to really kick this recession .
The odds of that happening are slim : both sides have their favorite children that they wo n’t abandon to the wolves .
There was some encouraging news today , however .
The Labor Department ’s numbers for July far exceeded the economists ’ predictions of 75,000 added jobs .
The actual number reported was 117,000 .
June ’s number was also revised to add 46,000 jobs .
The unemployment rate squeaked down to 9.1 & from 9.2 % : job openings in the manufacturing industry and healthcare pushed the increase .
And in a perversity of government accounting , those with expired unemployment benefits also helped lower the unemployment number .
In the current economy , an old maxim holds true : the only certainty is uncertainty .
Americans are uncertain and they have reason to be .
While we wait for the recession to lift , Americans can take the time to utilize some of the things that a sluggish economy offers .
Low interest rates on mortgages and credit cards are an upside , for one .
Low prices on new homes , especially when combined with the low interest rates , can add up to real savings in the long run- for those who can afford to make such a move at this time .
The rest of us can just sit tight and hope that the only double dip we see is on our ice cream cones !
Among the questions still to be answered , the official said , is whether at any time nearby Iraqi security forces began firing , possibly leading the Blackwater convoy to believe it was under attack and therefore justified in returning fire .
It is also possible that as the car kept rolling toward the intersection , the Blackwater guards believed it posed a threat and intensified their shooting .
Blackwater has said that its guards were fired upon and responded appropriately .
Witnesses close to the places where most of the Iraqi civilians were killed directly facing the Blackwater convoy on the southern rim of the square all give a relatively consistent picture of how events began and unfolded .
The Blackwater convoy was in the square to control traffic for a second convoy that was approaching from the south .
The second convoy was bringing diplomats who had been evacuated from a meeting after a bomb went off near the compound where the meeting was taking place .
That convoy had not arrived at the square by the time the shooting started .
The events in the square began with a short burst of bullets that witnesses described as unprovoked .
A traffic policeman standing at the edge of the square , Sarhan Thiab , saw that a young man in a car had been hit .
In the line of traffic , that car was the third vehicle from the intersection where the convoy had positioned itself .
“ We tried to help him , ” Mr. Thiab said .
“ I saw the left side of his head was destroyed and his mother was crying out : ‘ My son , my son .
Help me , help me . ’”
Another traffic policeman rushed to the driver ’s side to try to get her son out of the car , but the car was still rolling forward because her son had lost control , according to a taxi driver close by who gave his name as Abu Mariam ( “ father of Mariam ” ) .

Then Blackwater guards opened fire with a barrage of bullets , according to the police and numerous witnesses .
Mr. Ahmed ’s father later counted 40 bullet holes in the car .
His mother , Mohassin Kadhim , appears to have been shot to death as she cradled her son in her arms .
Moments later the car caught fire after the Blackwater guards fired a type of grenade into the vehicle .

Vance , a trapper boy , 15 years old .
Has trapped for several years in a West Virginia coal mine at 75 cents a day for 10 hours work .
All he does is to open and shut this door : most of the time he sits here idle , waiting for the cars to come .
On account of the intense darkness in the mine , the hieroglyphics on the door were not visible until plate was developed .
September 1908 .

One trapper 's description of the job , which paid about $ 1.60 a day :
Trappers were responsible for opening and closing the underground ventilation doors .
In those old mines , they had a system of doors between sections to direct the flow of air .
Air was supposed to go up the main haulage and back to the fan .
So a trapper sat all day by his door with an oil lamp on his cap .
There was a " manhole " - a shelter hole in the wall by the track .
The motorman would blink his light at me , and I 'd throw the switch and open the door for him .
Then , I 'd jump into the manway until he was past , and run out and close the door .
A trip would come along about every hour .
Was I bored or lonely ?
Well , it was my job .
Description :
• Has the white working class abandoned the Democratic Party ?
No .
White voters in the bottom third of the income distribution have actually become more reliably Democratic in presidential elections over the past half - century , while middle - and upper - income white voters have trended Republican .
Low - income whites have become less Democratic in their partisan identifications , but at a slower rate than more affluent whites – and that trend is entirely confined to the South , where Democratic identification was artificially inflated by the one - party system of the Jim Crow era .
•
Has the white working class become more conservative ?
No .
The average views of low - income whites have remained virtually unchanged over the past 30 years .
( A pro-choice shift on abortion in the 1970s and ‘ 80s has been partially reversed since the early 1990s . )
Their positions relative to more affluent white voters – generally less liberal on social issues and less conservative on economic issues – have also remained virtually unchanged .
•
Do working class “ moral values ” trump economics ?
No. Social issues ( including abortion ) are less strongly related to party identification and presidential votes than economic issues are , and that is even more true for whites in the bottom third of the income distribution than for more affluent whites .
Moreover , while social issue preferences have become more strongly related to presidential votes among middle - and high - income whites , there is no evidence of a corresponding trend among low - income whites .
•
Are religious voters distracted from economic issues ?
No .
The partisan attachments and presidential votes of frequent church - goers and people who say religion provides “ a great deal ” of guidance in their lives are much more strongly related to their views about economic issues than to their views about social issues .
For church - goers as for non-church - goers , partisanship and voting behavior are primarily shaped by economic issues , not cultural issues .
It is reported that 50 % of people in London are worried about security and sleep with some form of self - defence to hand , for use against intruders .
The ' Safe Bedside Table ' has a removable leg that acts as a club and a top that doubles as a shield for self - defence .
This is for people who are willing to take on an intruder , providing an extra sense of security whilst in bed .
Voters in three dozen Vermont towns want Congress to begin an impeachment probe of Pres. George W. Bush and Vice Pres. Dick Cheney .
Two towns , Clarendon and Dover , voted the measure down .
Nearly a half dozen towns agreed to not take up , or table , the resolution .
There are 251 towns in Vermont , but not all hold town meetings .
More than a dozen towns passed measures calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq , and to care for them when they were back on U.S. soil .
Dover also rejected the troop measure .
About 20 towns had one of the items warned on their town meeting ballot , while many others took up the issue during “ other business ” at the end of the meeting .
The votes come after a whirlwind , four - day tour of Vermont with antiwar icon Cindy Sheehan and three Vermont Iraq War veterans , along with organizers of the resolutions .
Sheehan testified before a state Senate committee on Friday , along with war supporters .
“ I ’m happy with it .
I think we ’ve got a very good number of towns that have reported so far and passing it , and it ’s pretty overwhelming that did n’t pass .
And , just one that voted it down , ” said Jimmy Leas , a South Burlington lawyer who crafted the troop withdrawal resolution .
Newfane Selectman Dan DeWalt is the major organizer of the impeachment resolutions .
His effort has drawn global media attention and scorn .
Last year , six towns passed impeachment resolutions .
The impeachment resolutions have passed so far in Bristol , Burke , Calais , Craftsbury , Dummerston , East Montpelier , Greensboro , Guilford , Grafton , Hartland , Jamaica , Jericho , Johnson , Marlboro , Middlebury , Montgomery , Morristown , Newbury , Newfane , Peru , Plainfield , Putney , Richmond , Rochester , Roxbury , St. Johnsbury , Springfield , Stannard , Sunderland , Townshend , Tunbridge , Vershire , Warren , Westminster , Wilmington , and Woodbury , according to organizers .
Organizers based their information on reports from people in each town .
DeWalt said organizers will use these votes to urge state lawmakers to take up a measure in the House calling for Bush ’s impeachment .
The bill is currently in the House Judiciary Committee .
“ This is clearly not a cry of protest , but the start of action — an impeachment insurrection that will lead to the reclamation of our Constitution , ” said DeWalt .
“ Vermonters are angry and energized .
We are taking the power that is sovereign in us and will use it to restore the Constitution .
We will show the world that America has not sunk to the depths of violent madness that is the Bush administration . ”
Several towns voted to not take up the measure : Bakersfield , Londonderry , Dorset , Stamford , and Walden .
Additionally , 20 towns approved a measure calling for troops to be withdrawn from Iraq : Bristol , Calais , Cornwall , Greensboro , Guilford , Hardwick , Jamaica , Jericho , Johnson , Marshfield , Middlebury , Newfane , Peru , Plymouth , Rockingham , Roxbury , St. Johnsbury , Townshend , Waldon , and Woodbury .
According to a Guardian reader , in Pomfret the impeachment resolution was moved under “ other business , ” but a voter countered with an amendment not to vote on the resolution because many of the town ’s residents had already left the meeting .
Voters agreed and voted to table the resolution was 43 to 28 .
In this context , the troop resolution was not moved .
Supporters of the measure , however , will raise the issue again .
In Middlebury , where Gov. Jim Douglas , a Republican , is the town moderator voters approved both the impeachment and troop withdrawal measures .
Douglas , ironically , was the chairman of Bush ’s 2000 election committee and 2004 reelection committee in Vermont .
Ellen McKay , a backer of the impeachment measure , said some members of the Middlebury select board and Douglas tried to limit debate to one minute per person .
Douglas also questioned whether something that was not warned should warrant a vote .
“ But , there were a lot of people in Middlebury who understood what other business was going to mean and this huge issue for our community , ” said McKay , who says the Iraq War , proportionally , has cost Middlebury $ 8 million to fund the war .
In Dover , the impeachment topic sparked a heated debate .
“ I do not want my senators or representatives for the next two years trying to bring down this president .
I want them to focus on bringing the best possible outcome to the chaos that is now in Iraq , ” said Laura Sibilia , a school board member , and sister of four brothers currently in the armed forces .
Sabilia trembled as she spoke , and at times had tears running down her face .
“ I do not believe that demanding that our troops come home now will help and I will not debate this with anyone . ”
A supporter countered that the impeachment resolution was n’t about the war , but the Constitution .
“ We have to stand up and respect the constitution that our [ founding fathers ] stand for .
Our troops will not come home during their time in office , and as far as impeachment goes , it only means they are investigated and whatever happens off it will happen , ” said Sue Rand .
“ It ’s not about removing Bush and Cheney but investigating . ”
Gloria Levine , the person who brought up the resolutions up at town meeting , was dumbfounded by the rejection .
“ I ’m not disappointed , I ’m just absolutely dumbfounded at how the things said today came in light of the facts that nine more military personnel were killed in Iraq , ” said Levine .
In Jericho , home of Democratic House Speaker Gaye Symington , who is not supportive of the impeachment measure , voters approved the impeachment resolution 88 - 67 , as well as the troop withdrawal measure .
Leas and other backers hope the impeachment and troop withdrawal measures will help to focus Vermont ’s congressional delegation on ending the war , and investigating Bush and Cheney for what h they believe were deliberate lies to get the nation into the war .
“ This war is going to continue for another year or two years if this funding request is approved , and we do n’t have confidence that they will vote to end the war , ” said Leas .
“ It ’s time for the people to get involved and the people have to push what may not be on their agenda — that ’s our leadership . ”
The Vermont Legislature recently approved measures in both the House and Senate calling for an immediate and orderly withdrawal of troops from Iraq .
In Stamford , voters tabled both articles .
Helen Fields , a co-organizer of the Stamford effort to get the resolutions on the warning , was disappointed but hopes to bring the issue up again in the near future .
“ We have parents in our town with [ sons in Baghdad ] that are at risk , so our town has a lot of people that very much want this war to be over and do n’t quite understand why their children ’s lives are at stake , ” said Fields .
“ It ’s hard for me to say that this vote was a vote for or against the articles .
I think this vote was for or against discussion on a very debatable topic .
People have very strong feelings whether or not the president should be impeached and we have very strong feelings about pulling out of a war that many soldiers and soldiers ’ families have made the ultimate sacrifices for . ”
Here is the text of each of the two resolutions :
IMPEACHMENT RESOLUTION
Whereas George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney have :
1. deliberately misled the nation about the threat from Iraq in order to justify a war ,
2. condoned the torture of prisoners in violation of the Geneva Convention and US law ,
3. approved illegal electronic surveillance of American citizens without a warrant , and ,
Whereas these actions have undermined our Constitutional system of government , damaged the reputation of America , and threatened our national security ,
Therefore , the voters of the town of _____________________ call upon the U.S. House of Representatives to investigate these charges , and if the investigation supports the charges , vote to impeach George W. Bush and Richard B. Cheney as provided in the Constitution of the United States of America .
This resolution shall be signed by the Town Clerk and forwarded to both the Speaker and the Clerk of the US House of Representatives , and Representative John Conyers of the House Judiciary Committee .
SOLDIERS HOME NOW RESOLUTION
“ Shall the voters of the town of ____________________ advise the President , Congress and Vermont ’s state and federal officeholders that _____________________ and its citizens strongly support the men and women serving in all branches of the United States Armed Forces in Iraq and believe that the best way to support them is to bring each and every one of them home now and take good care of them when they get home . ”

Soon to get the chop ?
BAGHDAD is plainly one of the most dangerous places in the world , not least for Americans .
So the record of Blackwater USA , an American private military company , in ensuring the safety of all those it protects is striking .
The trouble is , its aggressive tactics have too often led to the death of innocent Iraqis .
On September 16th , according to the Iraqi government , a Blackwater convoy opened fire indiscriminately at a busy Baghdad crossroads , killing 17 bystanders .
The government rejects Blackwater 's claim that its men had come under fire .
Although Blackwater was allowed to resume operations , Iraqi officials say they want the company to leave within six months .
Some are demanding an $ 8 m payment for each victim 's family .
In a separate incident on October 10th , a Dubai - based firm called United Resources Group was accused of firing randomly and killing two women in Baghdad .
The company said its men shot at an approaching car that had ignored repeated warnings to stop .
Iraq has an estimated 20,000 - 30,000 private security contractors , usually guarding VIPs and convoys .
They are formally immune from Iraqi law yet are rarely disciplined by the Western governments that employ them .
Often disliked by Iraqis more than foreign troops , they provide a popular cause for the fragile Iraqi government to assert itself .
Democrats in charge of the American Congress have also taken aim at them .
The House of Representatives passed a bill making all government contractors accountable under American law , and telling the FBI to prosecute offenders .
According to a report by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , Blackwater was involved in 195 shootings in just over 32 months .
On four out of five occasions the guards fired first and asked questions later , if ever .
The incidents have usually been hushed up , with the payment of compensation if necessary .
Blackwater has secured more than $ 1 billion in American government contracts , mainly to protect American diplomats .
Its founder , Erik Prince , a former Navy SEAL , told the committee that “ no individual protected by Blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured ” , while 30 of its staff had died .
By the same token none of its staff has been prosecuted , though 122 have been sacked , including a drunk employee who killed a bodyguard of an Iraqi vice - president and was spirited out of Iraq .
A Department of Justice investigation has yet to decide whether he will be charged .
Blackwater paid $ 15,000 in compensation .
According to emails made public , the American chargé d'affaires had initially suggested paying $ 250,000 , but his own security officials said such “ crazy sums ” would set a bad precedent , and “ cause incidents with people trying to get killed by our guys to financially guarantee their family 's future ” .
Blackwater , they said , “ do an exceptional job ” .

Yesterday Jewcy published an exchange on the topic of evolution between author Neal Pollak and Discovery Institute senior fellow David Klinghoffer .
Jason Rosenhouse , a professor at James Madison University and host of Seed Magazine 's Evolution Blog , sends us this response .
I do not know what you do for a living , but I suspect you are pretty good at it .
You probably trained for years to learn the basic elements of your craft , and then honed those skills through more years of on - the - job experience .
Now imagine that someone without that training and experience presumes to discourse on your profession .
Worse , they make assertions and arguments that are obvious nonsense to anyone versed in the subject .
Not an altogether uncommon experience for you , I suspect , but one that is no less annoying for that .
Now suppose that after ignoring your best attempts to explain things , your interlocutor goes running off to the press .
It is alleged that your entire profession is corrupt and shot through with religious and political agendas .
Then he goes running to the local school board to pressure them into teaching his view of things despite its complete lack of acceptance among knowledgeable people .
Then he gives public presentations , announcing he is going to blow the lid off the scandal in your profession .
Are you there ?
Are you really picturing it ?
That , you see , is what scientists contend with in confronting proponents of intelligent design ( ID ) .
For more than a century every branch of the life sciences has reported that all of the considerable available evidence points to the conclusions that modern species are related through common descent , and that natural selection is an especially important mechanism guiding that descent .
Scientists applying evolutionary thinking to their work have been met with a nearly unbroken string of successes in solving the practical problems they face in the field and the lab .
Pretenders like ID , on the other hand , have led to precisely nothing .
That is why ID folks spend very little time arguing with scientists , preferring instead to take their case directly to a public unlikely to be familiar with the minutiae of genetics or biochemistry .
Tell a roomful of mathematicians that some back of the envelope probability calculations are enough to refute evolution , and they will rightly laugh in your face .
But I know from sad experience that such arguments are rhetorically effective .
Tell a physicist or an engineer that Darwin runs afoul of the Second Law of Thermodynamics , and watch how quickly you are sent to a remedial course .
Tell a gathering of paleontologists that there are no transitional forms , and the most polite among them will simply refer you to an elementary textbook .
Yet ID folks routinely parrot these bogus arguments , and many others besides .
Just came back from my two weeks in Bodrum .
I like doing some light reading on vacation .
Business novels are especially go well under the sun since they are both enjoyable easy - reads and still can help you learn and grow .
The first business novel I read was The Goal couple of years ago .
It was a great read and very thought provocative .
After that I tried to find and read as many business novels as I can .
Unfortunately , there are not many in this genre .
I also did not find any web resources on business novels .
So , today I am sharing the best business novels I have read .
If you know any good ones missing below please feel free to post on the comments section .
5. Gung Ho ! – Ken Blanchard
This is a great quick read that you will probably finish at one sitting .
Gung - ho means “ enthusiastic ” in Chinese and this novel is about increasing the productivity of workers .
Our hero has a mentor who shows how to accomplish this using three principles of Gung - Ho :
The Spirit of the squirrel : Worthwhile work driven by goals and values .
The Way of the Beaver : Putting workers in control of achieving the goal .
The Gift of the Goose : Cheering each other on .
4 . It ’s Not Luck , Critical Chain and Necessary But Not Sufficient – Eliyahu M. Goldratt
I did not want to fill up the top 5 list with Goldratt , although he would certainly deserve it .
Goldratt ’s Theory of Constraints basically describes how to find the major constraints and critical paths in any kind of project and optimizing them .
If you are a programmer , it is kind of similar to Profiling software .
It happened to me many times .
You first use profiling to find the slowest parts of an application , then with couple of small fixes or caches , everything suddenly runs so much smoother .
Same applies to Business .
You can and should optimize it .
But be careful , exactly like software , premature optimizations does not work and it can actually harm your critical path .
Goldratt ’s books are rational but emotional , complex and very satisfying .
When you finish one , you are happy and sad .
Both because they are so freaking good .
3. The Deadline : A Novel About Project Management – Tom DeMarco
I have read other books by Tom DeMarco .
He has basically put his ideas into a novel and he did it well .
If you are a software developer or manager , you must read the Deadline .
It would n’t compare to Goldratt ’s books though .
I found the ideas and teaching great but the story was lacking .
He is certainly not a novelist and it is showing .
2. Selling The Wheel – Jeff Cox , Howard Stevens
This is a fiction about marketing and sales .
Our hero literally invents the wheel .
The story goes on in ancient Egypt .
I was pretty skeptic about the story line but it turned out to be pretty good .
It was n’t too simplified as I was afraid of .
Our heroes show how sales should differentiate depending on where your product is on the technology curve .
1. The Goal – Eliyahu M. Goldratt
This is a story about Alex Rogo who manages a plant and his mentor Jonah .
They have productivity and scheduling problems on the plant .
So , Jonah teaches Alex how to use the Theory of Constraints to solve their problems .
Instead of trying to optimize everything , the idea is to focus on finding the main constraints that optimizing them .
This may sound like pretty basic stuff , but it is so easy to forget about it .
The book also have pretty interesting creative problem solving techniques such as Evaporating Cloud .
It is an educational , entertaining and thought provoking book .
I would highly recommend it .
Congress Switchboard : 202-224-3121
" Rob Kall 's writings on the " bottom - up " revolution have real potential to show people that they can hold power accountable and improve justice .
A book on this subject could help to repair the economic , legal , social , and political fabric of the United States . "
Paul Craig Roberts , former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , former editor and columnist for the Wall Street Journal , Business Week and Scripps Howard News Service .

It 's surreal is n't it ?
Is this how you pictured it ?
With forty - three days left in the year , AMD is finally letting us publish benchmarks of its long awaited Phenom microprocessor .
The successor to K8 , AMD 's most successful micro-architecture to date , and the cornerstone of AMD 's desktop microprocessor business for 2008 : Phenom is here .
But should n't there be fireworks ?
Where 's the catchy title ?
The Star Wars references were bound to continue right ?
Why were there no benchmarks before today , why are the next several pages going to be such a surprise ?
AMD had been doing such a great job of opening the kimono as its employees liked to say , giving us a great amount of detail on Barcelona , Phenom and even the company 's plans for 2008 - 2009 .
The closer we got to Phenom 's official launch however , the quieter AMD got .
We were beginning to worry , and for a while there it seemed like Phenom would n't even come out this year .
At the last minute , plans solidified , and we received our first Socket - AM2 + motherboard , with our first official Phenom sample .
What a beautiful sight it was :
These chips are launching today , with availability promised by the end of the week .
Phenom today is going to be all quad - core only , you 'll see dual and triple - core parts in 2008 but for now this is what we get .
The architecture remains mostly unchanged from what we 've reported on in the past .
This is an evolutionary upgrade to K8 and we 've already dedicated many pages to explaining exactly what 's new .
If you need a refresher , we suggest heading back to our older articles on the topic .
The Long Road to Phenom
Ever wonder why we did n't have an early look at Phenom like we did for every Core 2 processor before the embargo lifted ?
Not only are CPUs scarce , but AMD itself did n't really know what would be launching until the last moment .
At first Phenom was going to launch at either 2.8GHz or 2.6GHz ; then we got word that it would be either 2.6GHz or 2.4GHz .
A week ago the story was 2.4GHz and lower , then a few days ago we got the final launch frequencies : 2.2GHz and 2.3GHz .
Then there 's the pricing ; at 2.2GHz the Phenom 9500 will set you back $ 251 , and at 2.3GHz you 'd have to part with $ 283 ( that extra 100M Hz is pricey but tastes oh so good ) .
The problem is , and I hate to ruin the surprise here , Phenom is n't faster than Intel 's Core 2 Quad clock for clock .
In other words , a 2.3GHz Phenom 9600 will set you back at least $ 283 and it 's slower than a 2.4 Ghz Core 2 Quad Q6600 , which will only cost you $ 269 .
And you were wondering why this review was n't called The Return of the Jedi .
AMD could n't simply get enough quantities of the Phenom at 2.4GHz to have a sizable launch this year ( not to mention a late discovery of a TLB error in the chips ) , and the company was committed to delivering Phenom before the holiday buying season as these are tough times and simply waiting to introduce its first quad - core desktop parts was just not an option .
Rather than paper launch a 2.4GHz part , AMD chose to go with more modest frequencies , promising faster , more competitive chips in Q1 2008 .
It 's not the best PR story in the world , but it 's the honest truth .
Two more quad - core Phenoms will come out in Q1 : the 9900 and 9700 , clocked at 2.6GHz and 2.4GHz respectively .
The Phenom 9900 will be priced below $ 350 while the 9700 will be a sub -$ 300 part .
As you can probably guess , the introduction of those two will push down the pricing of the 9600 and 9500 , which will help Phenom be a bit more competitive .
It 's worth mentioning that in the 11th hour AMD decided to introduce a multiplier - unlocked version of the Phenom 9600 sometime this year that will be priced at the same $ 283 mark .
Whether or not it 's called a Black Edition is yet to be determined .
