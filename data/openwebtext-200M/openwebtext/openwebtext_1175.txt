The RIAA has updated its Music Rules ! school program — which contains blatant falsehoods about copyright .
The new version asks kids to act as unpaid PR staff : " Take your campaign a step further by contacting the editor of your community newspaper or the director of your community cable television station to see if you can submit an article or video about your campaign . "
Last week , the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) announced an update to Music - Rules ! , its flagship " curriculum " for teaching copyright law to schoolkids .
We wrote about Music - Rules ! and similar industry propaganda efforts in May , outlining some of their falsehoods and biases .
For instance , the RIAA tells kids , " Never copy someone else 's creative work without permission from the copyright holder " — omitting the important right to make creative fair use of existing content .
It also coins a misleading term , " songlifting , " ( which the curriculum says is " just as bad as shoplifting " )
[ Ed : if only !
The penalties for shoplifting are so much lighter than they are for file - sharing ! ] .
Perhaps most disturbing of all given that the curriculum is supposed to be adopted by schools , it teaches kids bad math as part of its lessons on peer to peer file - sharing .
The updated curriculum goes a step further and asks kids to contact their local media and act as the RIAA 's own unpaid public relations staff .
In 1798 , the legislatures of Virginia and Kentucky approved resolutions that affirmed the states ’ right to resist federal encroachments on their powers .
If the federal government has the exclusive right to judge the extent of its own powers , warned the resolutions ’ authors ( James Madison and Thomas Jefferson , respectively ) , it will continue to grow — regardless of elections , the separation of powers , and other much - touted limits on government power .
The Virginia Resolutions spoke of the states ’ right to “ interpose ” between the federal government and the people of the state ; the Kentucky Resolutions ( in a 1799 follow - up to the original resolutions ) used the term “ nullification ” — the states , they said , could nullify unconstitutional federal laws .
These ideas became known as the “ Principles of ’ 98 . ”
Their subsequent impact on American history , according to the standard narrative , was pretty much confined to South Carolina ’s nullification of the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 .
That is demonstrably false , as I shall show below .
But it is n’t just that these ideas are neglected in the usual telling ; as I discovered not long ago , these principles are positively despised by neoconservatives like Max Boot and the leftists at the New York Times ( or do I repeat myself ? ) .
Neither one , in their reviews of The Politically Incorrect Guide to American History , so much as mentioned Jefferson ’s name in connection with the Principles of ’ 98 .
It is hard to view such an omission as anything but deliberate .
To mention Jefferson ’s name is to lend legitimacy to ideas that nationalists of left and right alike detest , so they simply leave him out of the picture .

Jefferson once wrote , “ When all government , domestic and foreign , in little as in great things , shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power , it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another , and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated . ”
To resist this centralizing trend , the sage of Monticello was convinced , the states needed some kind of corporate defense mechanism .
Our betters have already told us that the only reason anyone might wish to vindicate the cause of states ’ rights is for the purpose of defending slavery or upholding some lesser form of local oppression .
What follows is the tip of the iceberg of the history that , by what I shall assume is an entirely well - meaning and innocent oversight , these great scholars of American history consistently fail to acknowledge .

The Embargo of 1807 — 1809
In retaliation against British and French depredations against American neutral rights on the seas , the federal government under Thomas Jefferson in late 1807 declared an embargo , according to which no American ship could depart for any foreign port anywhere in the world .
( The rationale was that trade with the U.S. was a key ingredient in British and French prosperity , and thus that economic pressure might persuade them to change their policies . )
The U.S. Navy was granted the power to stop and search any ship within U.S. jurisdiction if its officers had “ reason to suspect ” the ship was violating the embargo .
Likewise , customs officials were “ authorized to detain any vessel … whenever in their opinions the intention is to violate or evade any provisions of the acts laying an embargo . ”
Such standards fell far short of the “ probable cause ” requirement that generally governed the issuing of warrants for searches .
New England was especially hard hit by the embargo because so many of its people were employed either directly in foreign commerce or in proximate fields , and it was there that opposition to the policy was concentrated .
In 1808 a federal district court , in the case of United States v. The William , ruled the embargo constitutional .
The Massachusetts legislature begged to differ .
Both houses declared the embargo acts to be “ in many particulars , unjust , oppressive , and unconstitutional . ”
“ While this State maintains its sovereignty and independence , all the citizens can find protection against outrage and injustice in the strong arm of the State government , ” they said .
The embargo , furthermore , was “ not legally binding on the citizens of this State . ”
In the midst of the crisis , a New York congressman , giving his explicit sanction to the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions , said , “ Why should not Massachusetts take the same stand , when she thinks herself about to be destroyed ? ”
“ If any State Legislature had believed the Act to be unconstitutional , ” asked a Connecticut congressman , “ would it not have been their duty not to comply ? ”
He added that the state legislatures , “ whose members are sworn to support the Constitution , may refuse assistance , aid or cooperation ” if they regarded an act as unconstitutional , and so could state officials .
Meltdown : A Free - Marke ...
Thomas E. Woods Best Price : $ 0.25 Buy New $ 20.00 ( as of 02:20 EST - Details )
Connecticut governor Jonathan Trumbull shared these views .
“ Whenever our national legislature is led to overleap the prescribed bounds of their constitutional powers , on the State Legislatures , in great emergencies , devolves the arduous task — it is their right — it becomes their duty , to interpose their protecting shield between the right and liberty of the people , and the assumed power of the General Government . ”
Connecticut ’s General Assembly passed a resolution that , among other things , directed all executive officials in the State not to afford “ any official aid or co-operation in the execution of the act aforesaid . ”
The General Assembly furthermore declared : “ Resolved , that to preserve the Union , and support the Constitution of the United States , it becomes the duty of the Legislatures of the States , in such a crisis of affairs , vigilantly to watch over , and vigorously to maintain , the powers not delegated to the United States , but reserved to the States respectively , or to the people ; and that a due regard to this duty , will not permit this Assembly to assist , or concur in giving effect to the aforesaid unconstitutional act , passed , to enforce the embargo . ”
Rhode Island , when the embargo was at its end , declared that her legislature possessed the duty “ to interpose for the purpose of protecting [ the people of Rhode Island ] from the ruinous inflictions of usurped and unconstitutional power . ”
Interposition — the language of the Principles of ’ 98 .
The War of 1812
During the War of 1812 , Massachusetts and Connecticut were ordered to call out their respective militias for the purpose of defending the coast .
The call derived from the federal government ’s authority to call the state militias into service “ to execute the Laws of the Union , suppress Insurrections and repel invasions . ”
Massachusetts Governor Caleb Strong , however , maintained that the states reserved the power to determine whether any of these three conditions held .
At Strong ’s request , the Massachusetts Supreme Court offered its opinion .
That court agreed with the governor : “ As this power is not delegated to the United States by the Federal Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the states , it is reserved to the states , respectively ; and from the nature of the power , it must be exercised by those with whom the states have respectively entrusted the chief command of the militia . ”

Remember this scene from Trainspotting ?
Watching it makes you more prone to harsh moral judgements ( Image : Miramax / Everett / Rex )
WILL these hands ne ’er be clean ? ” asks Lady Macbeth , as she obsessively tries to wash away the guilt she feels for her role in the murder of King Duncan .
Her feelings of self - disgust , we are led to believe , have manifested themselves as a sensation of physical dirtiness .
It is not only in the language of playwrights such as Shakespeare that complex emotions like guilt , grief or loneliness are compared to physical sensations .
These metaphors crop up in everyday phrases , too , in many languages .
In English , for example , we talk of being “ left out in the cold ” when we feel socially excluded , a sentiment echoed in the Japanese saying “ one kind word can warm three winter months ” .
At face value , these connections seem purely symbolic .
In real life , loneliness does n’t really send us shivering , and guilt does n’t really make us feel dirty .
Or do they ?
Recent research has found that these physical sensations can often accompany our emotions .
It works the other way too – by provoking a feeling of disgust , a scene from the film Trainspotting shaped the way subjects in an experiment made moral judgements .
Many now believe that this reflects the way complex emotions arose in our evolutionary past .
As our brain evolved to process more and more complex emotions , the theory goes , there was no need for new neural machinery : our emotions simply piggybacked onto the circuits that handle basic sensory perceptions .
Here are some of the most striking experiments linking physical sensations with emotions and behaviour . …
Django comes with a lot of great built - in functionality .
One of the most useful contrib apps is authentication , which ( among other things ) provides views for login , logout , and password reset .
Login & logout are self - explanatory , but resetting a password is , by nature , somewhat complicated .
Because it ’s a really bad idea to store passwords as plaintext , you ca n’t just send a user their password when they forget it .
Instead , you have to provide a secure mechanism for users to change their password themselves , even if they ca n’t remember their original password .
Lucky for us , Django auth provides this functionality out of the box .
All you need to do is create the templates and hook - up the views .
The code you need to write to make this happen is pretty simple , but it can be a bit tricky to understand how it all works together .
There ’s actually 4 separate view functions that together provide a complete password reset mechanism .
These view functions are
password_reset password_reset_done password_reset_confirm password_reset_complete
Here ’s an Information Architecture diagram showing how these views fit together , using Jesse James Garrett ’s Visual Vocabulary .
The 2 black dots are starting points , and the circled black dot is an end point .
Here ’s a more in - depth walk - thru of what ’s going on , with a fictional user named Bob :
Bob tries to login and fails , probably a couple times .
Bob clicks a “ Forgot your password ? ” link , which takes him to the password_reset view .
Bob enters his email address , which is then used to find his User account .
If Bob ’s User account is found , a password reset email is sent , and Bob is redirected to the password_reset_done view , which should tell him to check his email .
Bob leaves the site to check his email .
He finds the password reset email , and clicks the password reset link .
Bob is taken to the password_reset_confirm view , which first validates that he can reset his password ( this is handled with a hashed link token ) .
If the token is valid , Bob is allowed to enter a new password .
Once a new password is submitted , Bob is redirected to the password_reset_complete view .
Bob can now login to your site with his new password .
This final step is the one minor issue I have with Django ’s auth password reset .
The user just changed their password , why do they have to enter it again to login ?
Why ca n’t we eliminate step 6 altogether , and automatically log the user in after they reset their password ?
In fact , you can eliminate step 6 with a bit of hacking on your own authentication backend , but that ’s a topic for another post .

WASHINGTON  President Obama said Thursday that he “ would love to have more Republicans engaged ” in the health care negotiations under way in Congress , but expressed doubt that a bipartisan compromise could be reached because he suspected the party ’s leadership was intent on defeating his signature domestic priority .
“ I think early on , a decision was made by the Republican leadership that said , ‘ Look , let ’s not give him a victory , ’ ” Mr. Obama said , accusing his rivals of trying to reprise the efforts that went into derailing the Clinton health care agenda .
“ There are some folks , ” he added , “ who are taking a page out of that playbook . ”
But one lawmaker who participated Thursday night in a conference call among six Republican and Democratic senators trying to reach bipartisan agreement on a health care plan said the senators agreed to keep working together and asked staff members to focus on making health coverage more affordable while holding down medical costs .
“ We are hanging in there , ” said Senator Kent Conrad , Democrat of North Dakota , after the telephone conference of almost one hour and 40 minutes .
“ Is it easy ?
No .
But I tell you , I have never seen a group with a greater sense of purpose than this group . ”
Introduction

2009 was The FreeBSD Project 's fifth year of participation in the Google Summer of Code .
We had a total of 17 successful projects .
Some GSoC code will be shipping with FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE and others will be integrated into future releases .
The FreeBSD GSoC admin team would like to thank Google and our students and mentors of another great year !

The code has been extracted from NetBSD and has been transformed into an independent shared library .
The basic encodings are well supported .
Almost all forward conversions ( foo -> UTF - 32 ) are compatible with GNU but the reverse ones are not so accurate because of GNU 's advanced transliteration .
Some extra encodings have also been added .
There are two modules , which segfault ; they need some debugging .
I can keep working on this project as part of my BSc thesis , so I hope to be able to solve the remaining issues .
Improved GNU compatibility is also very desired ( extra command line options for iconv ( 1 ) , iconvctl ( ) , private interfaces , etc. ) .
Open tasks :
Fix segfaults in Big5 and HZ modules Improve transliteration in reverse encodings Improve GNU compatibility by implementing extra features Verify POSIX compatibility Verify GNU compatibility Check performance

This project was started as part of Google Summer of Code 2008 but there is still a bit of work to complete some missing parts .
The BSD - licensed grep implementation is feature - complete and has a good level of GNU compatibility .
Our only current concern about the BSD - licensed version is to improve its performance .
The GNU variant is much more complex , has about 8 KSLOC , while BSD grep is tiny , has only 1.5 KSLOC .
GNU uses some shortcuts and optimizations to speed - up calls to the regex library ; that is why it is significantly faster .
My point of view is that such optimizations must be implemented in the regex library , keeping the dependent utilities clean and easy to read .
BSD grep is so tiny that there is hardly any optimization opportunity by simplifying the code , so the regex library is the next important TODO .
There is another issue with the current regex library .
It does not support some invalid regular expressions , which work in GNU .
We need to maintain compatibility , so we cannot just drop this feature .
Actually , BSD grep is linked to the GNU regex library to maintain this feature but due to the lack of the mentioned shortcuts , it is still slower than GNU .
Anyway , if we can live with this little performance hit until we get a modern regex library , I think grep is ready to enter HEAD .
As for the regex library , NetBSD 's result of the last SoC is worth taking a look .
The sort utility has been rewritten from scratch .
The existing BSD - licensed implementation could not deal with wide characters by design .
The new implementation is still lacking some features but is quite complete .
There is a performance issue , though .
Sorting is a typical algorithmic subject but I am not an algorithmic expert , so my implementation is not completely optimal .
Some help would be welcome with this part .
The bc / dc utilities have been ported from OpenBSD .
They pass OpenBSD's and GNU 's regression tests but they arrived too late to catch 8.X , so they will go to HEAD after the release .
Open tasks :
Improve sort 's sorting and file merging algorithms Complete missing features for sort
Get a modern regex library for FreeBSD

FreeBSD 's ext2fs had some parts under GPL .
The aim of my project was to rewrite those parts and free ext2fs from GPL .
I have been successful in rewriting the parts and NetBSD 's ext2fs was a great help in this .
Certain critical parts under GPL were also removed due to which the write performance suffered .
I also implemented Orlov Block Allocator for ext2fs .
Currently I am planning to make ext2fs Multiprocessor Safe ( MPSAFE ) .
My work resides in truncs_ext2fs branch of Perforce .
Open tasks :
Ext4 support for FreeBSD Directory indexing for ext2fs Journaling in ext2fs using gjournal

The libnetstat ( 3 ) project provides a user - space library API to monitor networking functions with the following benefits :
ABI - robust interface making use of accessor functions in order to divorce monitoring applications from kernel or user ABI changes .
Supports running 32 - bit monitoring tools on top of a 64 - bit kernel .
Improved consistency for both kvm( 3 ) and sysctl ( 3 ) when retrieving information .
The supported abstractions are as follows :
Active sockets and socket buffers
Network interfaces and multicast interfaces
mbuf ( 9 ) statistics
bpf ( 4 ) statistics
Routing statistics , routing tables , multicast routing
Protocol - dependent statistics
There is a sample application , called nettop ( 8 ) , which provides a simple ncurses - based to p ( 1 ) - like interface for monitoring active connections and network buffer allocations via the library .
A modified version of netstat ( 1 ) has also been created to use libnetstat ( 3 ) as much as possible .

Pefs is a kernel level filesystem for transparently encrypting files on top of other filesystems ( like zfs or ufs ) .
It adds no extra information into files ( unlike others ) , does n't require cipher block sized io operations , supports per directory / file keys and key chaining , uses unique per file tweak for encryption .
Supported algorithms : AES , Camellia , Salsa20 .
The code is ready for testing .
Open tasks :
Implement encrypted name lookup / readir cache Optimize sparse files handling and file resizing

The BSD # Project is devoted to porting the Mono .NET framework and applications to the FreeBSD operating system .
During the past year , the BSD #
Team continued to track the Mono development and the lang / mono port have almost always been up - to - date ( we however had to skip mono - 2.2 because of some regression issues in this release ) .
Most of our patches have been merged in the mono trunk upstream , and should be included in the upcoming mono - 2.6 release .
In the meantime , a few more .NET related ports have been updated or added to the FreeBSD ports tree .
These ports include :
www/xsp and www / mod_mono that make it possible to use FreeBSD for hosting ASP.
NET application ;
lang / boo , a CLI - targeted programming language similar to Python ;
lang / mono - basic , the Visual Basic .
NET Framework for Mono ;
devel / monodevelop , an Integrated Development Environment for .
NET ;
and much more ...
Open tasks :
Test mono ports and send feedback ( we are especially interested in tests where NOPORTDOCS / WITH_DEBUG is enabled ) .
Port the mono - debugger to FreeBSD .
Build a debug live - image of FreeBSD so that Mono hackers without a FreeBSD box can help us fixing bugs more efficiently .

The clang@FreeBSD team presents the status of clang / LLVM being able to compile FreeBSD system .
The current status is :
i386 - kernel boots , world needs little hacks but works
amd64 - kernel boots , world needs little hacks but works
ppc - broken because of unknown RTLD bug
other - unknown
All other platforms are untested .
A lot has happened over the spring / summer : amd64 got proper mcmodel=kernel support , compiler - rt has been introduced ( paving the way for libgcc replacement ) , we have run two experimental port builds to see how clang does there .
The C++ support is able to parse devd.cc without warnings .
We have got the kernel working with - O2 .
FreeBSD has been promoted to be an officially supported plaform in LLVM .
As a result of all this work , many parts of FreeBSD that did not compile before now build without problems .
Open tasks :
The " ClangBSD " branch of FreeBSD got a little stale and has not been updated for a while .
We also need to get some important fixes into LLVM to get libc compiling and some other smaller issues .
We can still appreciate more testers on minor platforms ( mostly on ARM , PPC and MIPS , but testing on other platforms is also welcome ) .

This work 's purpose is a generic and flexible framework for systems equipped with Time Division Multiplexing ( TDM ) units , often found on embedded telecom chips .
The framework is designed to support various controllers and many types of TDM channels e.g. voiceband , sound and miscellaneous data channels .
Currently , voiceband infrastructure is being developed on Marvell RD - 88F6281 reference board .
It will serve as an example of how to use the TDM framework for other channel types .
The direct objective of using TDM with voiceband channels is bringing a FreeBSD based VoIP system , capable of bridging analog telephone world with digital IP telephony .
Together with third party VoIP software ( e.g. Asterisk ) , the design can serve as VoIP Private Branch Exchange ( PBX ) .
Current state highlights :
TDM controller interface
TDM channel interface
TDM channel API for kernel modules
codec interface
voiceband channel character device driver
TDM controller driver for Marvell Kirkwood and Discovery SoCs
Si3215 SLIC driver
Si3050 DAA driver
Open tasks :
Develop demo application showing example usage of voiceband channel .
Integrate voiceband infrastructure with Zaptel / DAHDI telephony hardware drivers .

We have ported libdispatch , Apple 's Grand Central Dispatch event and concurrency framework to FreeBSD :
Added new kqueue primitives required to support GCD , such as EVFILT_USER and EV_TRIGGER
Created autoconf and automake build framework for libdispatch
Modified libdispatch to use POSIX semaphores instead of Mach semaphores
Adapted libdispatch to use portable POSIX time routines
Jordan Hubbard has also prepared a blocks - aware clang compiler package for FreeBSD .
When compiled with clang , libdispatch provides blocks - based , as well as function - based callbacks .
The port was presented at the FreeBSD Developer Summit in Cambridge , UK in September , and slides are online on the devsummit wiki page .
A FreeBSD port is now available in the Ports Collection .
After FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE has shipped , the new kqueue primitives will be MFC'd so that libdispatch works out of the box on FreeBSD 8.1 - RELEASE .
Open tasks :
Complete porting of libdispatch test suite to FreeBSD .
Investigate pthread work queue implementation for FreeBSD .
Evaluate performance impact of some machine - dependent and OS - dependent optimizations present in the Mac OS X version of libdispatch to decide if they should be done for other platforms and OS's .
Explore whether FreeBSD base operating system tools would benefit from being modified to use libdispatch .

The libprocstat project is an ongoing effort to develop a library that can be used to retrieve information about running processes and open files in the uniform and platform - independent way both from a running system or from core files .
This will facilitate the implementation of file - or process - monitoring applications like lsof ( 1 ) , fstat ( 1 ) , fuser , etc .
The libprocstat repository contains a preliminary version of the library .
It also includes rewrites of the fstat and the fuser utilities ported to use this library instead of retrieving all the required information via the kvm ( 3 ) interface ; one of the important advantages of the versions that use libprocstat is that these utilities are ABI independent .
Open tasks :
Implement KVM - based namecache lookup to retrieve filesystem paths associated with file descriptors and VM objects .
Analyze possible ways of exporting file and process information from the kernel in an extensible and ABI - independent way .

I have been working recently on writing a new debugger , primarily for the FreeBSD platform .
For various reasons , I have been writing it in a relatively obscure C - like language called D .
So far , I have a pretty useful ( if a little raw at the edges ) command line debugger which supports ELF , Dwarf debugging information and ( currently ) 32 bit FreeBSD and Linux .
The engine includes parsing and evaluation of arbitrary C expressions along with the usual debugging tools such as breakpoints , source code listing , single - step etc .
All the code is new and BSD licensed .
Currently , the thing supports userland debugging of i386 targets via ptrace and post - mortem core file debugging of the same .
I will be adding amd 64 support real soon ( TM ) and maybe support for GDB 's remote debugging protocol later .

During Google Summer of Code 2008 , I have implemented native support for NFSv4 ACLs for both ZFS and UFS .
Most of the code has already been merged to CURRENT .
NFSv4 ACLs are unconditionally enabled in ZFS and the usual tools , like getfacl ( 1 ) and setfacl ( 1 ) can be used to view and change them .
I plan to merge the remaining bits ( UFS support ) this month .
It should be possible to MFC it in order to ship in FreeBSD 8.1 - RELEASE .
Open tasks :
UFS changes review Support for NFSv4 ACLs in tar (1 )

Some time ago I started writing a new driver for the FreeBSD kernel called vt ( 4 ) , which is basically a replacement of syscons .
There is still a lot of work that needs to be done but it is probably useful to mention what it does ( and what does not ) .
Right now there are just two graphics drivers for vt ( 4 ) , namely a VGA driver for i386 and amd64 and a Microsoft Xbox graphics driver ( because it was so easy to implement ) .
I still have to figure out what I am going to do with VESA , because maybe it is better to just ignore VESA and figure out how hard it is to extend DRM to interact with vt ( 4 ) .
Some random features : it already supports both Unicode ( UTF - 8 ) input and output , it is MPSAFE and supports per-window graphical fonts of variable dimensions , containing an almost infinite amount of glyphs ( both bold and regular ) .
Open tasks :
Research needs to be done on DRM 's codebase .
Syscons should already be migrated to TERM=xterm to make switching between drivers a bit easier .

We continue to classify PRs as they arrive , adding ' tags ' to the subject lines corresponding to the kernel subsystem involved , or man page references for userland PRs .
These tags , in turn , produce lists of PRs sorted both by tag and by manpage .
The list of PRs recommended for committer evaluation by the Bugbusting Team continues to receive new additions .
This list contains PRs , mostly with patches , that the Bugbusting Team feel are probably ready to be committed as - is , or are probably trivially resolved in the hands of a committer with knowledge of the particular subsystem .
All committers are invited to take a look at this list whenever they have a spare 5 minutes and wish to close a PR .
A full list of all the automatically generated reports is also available at one of the cited URLs .
Any recommendations for reports which not currently exist but which would be beneficial are welcomed .
Gavin Atkinson gave a presentation on " The PR Collection Status " at the EuroBSDCon 2009 DevSummit , and discussed with other participants several other ideas to make the PR database more useful and usable .
Several good ideas came from this , and will hopefully lead to more useful tools in the near future .
Discussions also took place on how it may be possible to automatically classify non-ports PRs with a view towards notifying interested parties , although investigations into this have not yet begun .
Mark Linimon also continues attempting to define the general problem and investigating possible new workflow models , and presented work on this at BSDCan 2009 .
Since the last status report , the number of open bugs has increased to around the 5900 mark , partially because of an increased focus on getting more information into the existing PRs , in an attempt to make sure all the information required is now available .
As a result , although the number of open PRs has increased , they are hopefully of better quality .
As always , more help is appreciated , and committers and non-committers alike are always invited to join us on # freebsd - bugbusters on EFnet and help close stale PRs or commit patches from valid PRs .
Open tasks :
Work on suggestions from developers who were at the EuroBSDCon DevSummit .
Try to find ways to get more committers helping us with closing the PRs that the team has already analyzed .

The ports count has soared to over 20,700 .
The PR count had been driven below 800 by some extraordinary effort , but once again is back to its usual count of around 900 .
We are currently building packages for amd64 - 6 , amd64 - 7 , amd64- 8 , i386 - 6 , i386 - 7 , i386 - 8 , sparc64 - 7 , and sparc64 - 8 .
There have been preliminary runs of i386 - 9 ; however , to be able to continue builds on - 9 , we will either need to find places to host a number of new machines , or drop package building for - 6 .
The mailing list discussion of the latter proved quite controversial .
We have added some new i386 machines to help speed up the builds , but this only makes up for the disk failures on some of our older , slower , i386 nodes .
We also appreciate the loan of more package build machines from several committers , including pgollucci@ , gahr@ , erwin@ , Boris Kochergin , and Craig Butler .
The portmgr@ team has also welcomed new members Ion-Mihai Tetcu ( itetcu@ ) and Martin Wilke ( miwi@ ) .
We also thank departing member Kirill Ponomarew ( krion@ ) for his long service .
Ion -Mihai has spent much time working on a system that does automatic Quality Assurance on new commits , called QAT .
A second tinderbox called QATty has helped us to fix many problems , especially those involving custom PREFIX and LOCALBASE settings , and documentation inclusion options .
Ports conformance to documented features / non-default configuration will follow .
Between pav and miwi , over 2 dozen experimental ports runs have been completed and committed .
We have added 5 new committers since the last report , and 2 older ones have rejoined .
Open tasks :
We are currently trying to set up ports tinderboxes that can be made available to committers for pre-testing ; those who can loan machines for this should contact Ion- Mihai ( itetcu@ ) with details regarding the hardware and bandwidth .
Most of the remaining ports PRs are " existing port / PR assigned to committer " .
Although the maintainer - timeout policy is helping to keep the backlog down , we are going to need to do more to get the ports in the shape they really need to be in .
Although we have added many maintainers , we still have almost 4,700 unmaintained ports ( see , for instance , the list on portsmon ) .
( The percentage is down to 22 % . )
We are always looking for dedicated volunteers to adopt at least a few unmaintained ports .
As well , the packages on amd64 and sparc64 lag behind i386 , and we need more testers for those .

The Release Engineering Team continues to work on FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE .
Public testing has turned up quite a few problems , many related to the low - level network ( routing / ARP table ) changes and their interactions with IPv6 .
Progress continues to be made on fixing up the issues that have been identified during the public testing .
At this point in time we are shooting for two more public test builds ( RC2 and RC3 ) followed by the release late October or early November .

TCP appropriate byte counting ( RFC 3465 ) support has been merged into the FreeBSD 8 branch and will ship in FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE .
The reassembly queue auto - tuning and SIFTR work was not ready in time to safely integrate for 8.0 - RELEASE .
Padding has been added to necessary TCP structs to facilitate MFCing features back to the 8 - STABLE branch after 8.0 is released .
Candidate patches against FreeBSD - CURRENT will be ready for wider testing in the coming weeks .
The freebsd - net mailing list will be solicited for testing / feedback when everything is ready .
Open tasks :
Solicit review / testing and integrate the ALQ kld and variable length message support patch into FreeBSD - CURRENT .

The patch has received some significant rototilling in the past few months to prepare it for merging to FreeBSD - CURRENT .
Additionally , I completed an implementation of the CUBIC congestion control algorithm to complement the existing NewReno and H - TCP algorithm implementations already available .
I have one further intrusive change to make , which will allow congestion control modules to be shared between the TCP and SCTP stacks .
Once this is complete , I will be soliciting for review / testing in the hope of committing the patch to FreeBSD - CURRENT in time to be able to backport it for 8.1 - RELEASE .
Open tasks :
Abstract the congestion control specific variables out of the TCP and SCTP control blocks into a new struct that can be passed into the API instead of the control block itself .

The network stack virtualization project aims at extending the FreeBSD kernel to maintain multiple independent instances of networking state .
This allows for networking independence between jail environment , each maintaining its private network interfaces , IPv4 and IPv6 network and port address space , routing tables , IPSec configuration , firewalls , and more .
During the last months the remaining pieces of the VIMAGE work were merged by Marko , Julian and Bjoern .
Robert Watson developed a vnet allocator to overcome ABI issues .
Jamie Gritton merged his hierarchical jail framework that now also is the management interface for virtual network stacks .
During the FreeBSD Developer Summit that took place at EuroBSDCon 2009 in Cambridge , UK , people virtualized more code .
As a result SCTP and another accept filter were virtualized and more people became familiar with the design of VImage and the underlying concepts .
Finally getting more hands involved was a crucial first step for the long term success of kernel virtualization .
The next steps will be to finish the network stack virtualization , generalize the allocator framework before thinking of virtualizing further subsystems and to update the related documentation .
Along with that a proper jail management framework will be worked on .
Long term goals , amongst others , will be to virtualize more subsystems like SYS -V IPC , better privilege handling , and resource limits .
In the upcoming FreeBSD 8.0 Release , vnets are treated as an experimental feature .
As a result , they are not yet recommended for use in production environments .
There was lots of time spent to finalize the infrastructure for vnets though , so that further changes can be merged and we are aiming to have things production ready for 8.2 .
In case you want to help to achieve this goal , feel free to contact us and support or help virtualizing outstanding parts like two firewalls , appletalk , netipx , ... as well as generating regression tests .

SCTP continues to have minor fixes added to it as well as some new features .
First and foremost , we now have VIMAGE and SCTP working and playing together .
This goal was accomplished with the help of bz@ , my new mentee tuexen@ and myself working together at the FreeBSD DevSummit in Cambridge , UK .
Also the non-renegable SACK feature contributed by the university of Delaware was fixed so that now its safe to turn on ( its sysctl ) .
If you are using SCTP with CMT ( Conncurrent Multipath Transfer ) you will want to enable this option ( CMT is also a sysctl ) .
With CMT enabled you will be able to send data to all the destinations of an SCTP peer .
We welcomed a new mentee ( soon to be a commiter ) to FreeBSD .
Michael Tuexen is now a mentee of rrs@ .
Michael has been contributing to the SCTP work for quite some time and also moonlights as a Professor at the University of Muenster in Germany ( when not doing SCTP coding ) .

Noteworthy developments regarding FreeBSD / sparc64 since the last Status Reports are :
Cas ( 4 ) , a driver for Sun Cassini / Cassini + , as well as National Semiconductor DP83065 Saturn Gigabit NICs has been committed and thus will be part of FreeBSD beginning with 8.0 - RELEASE and 7.3 - RELEASE , respectively .
This means that the on - board NICs found in Fire V440 , as well as the add - on cards based on these chips , are now supported , including on non-sparc64 machines .
Unfortunately , the cas ( 4 ) driver triggers what seem to be secondary problems with the on - board NICs found in B100 blades and Fire V480 , which due to lack of access to such systems could not be fixed so far .
Initial support for sun4u machines based on the " Fire " Host - PCI - Express bridge like Fire V215 , V245 , etc. has been completed ( including support for the on - board ATA controller , which caused several problems at first , and MSI / MSI - X ) .
Some code like the quirk handling for the ALi / ULi chips found in these machines needs to be revisited though and no stability tests have been conducted so far .
If all goes well , the code will hit HEAD some time after FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE has been released .
In theory , machines based on the " Oberon " Host - PCI - Express bridge , at least for the most part , should also be supported with these changes , but due to lack of access to a Mx000 series machine the code could not be tested with these so far .
Some bugs in the snd_t4 dwave ( 4 ) driver have been fixed , as well as some special handling for sparc64 has been added so it does 32 - bit DMA and now generally works with the on - board ALi M5451 found for example in Blade 100 and Blade 1500 .
Unfortunately , it was only tested to work correctly in two out of three Blade 100 .
Why it still does not work correctly in the remaining one is currently unknown but at least no longer causes IOMMU - panics so testing snd_t4dwave ( 4 ) on sparc64 is no longer harmful .
These changes will be part of FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE and 7.3- RELEASE .
Ata-marvell ( 4 ) has been fixed to work on sparc64 ( actually also on anything that is not x86 with less than 4GB of RAM ) .
These fixes will be part of FreeBSD 8.0 - RELEASE and 7.3- RELEASE .
A proper and machine - independent fix for the old problem that the loader leaves the NIC opened by the firmware , which could lead to panics during boot when netbooting , has been developed but not committed yet .

Andreas Tobler made the classic mistake of sending us a lot of powerpc and sparc64 related patches .
The usual punishment , of giving him a commit bit to the Gecko repository , has been applied .
We currently have some old ports in the ports tree :
www / mozilla is 5 year old now , no longer supported upstream , and has a lot of security vulnerabilities .
We can use www / seamonkey instead .
www / xulrunner is superseeded by www / libxul .
A patch that includes the following changes has been tested on pointyhat and is ready for commit :
Remove references to www/mozilla/Makefile.common and www/mozilla/bsd.gecko.mk
Switch USE_GECKO= xulrunner firefox mozilla to USE_GECKO= libxul and remove www / xulrunner
We are also working on Firefox 3.6 ( Alpha 2 ) , Thunderbird 3.0 ( Beta 4 ) , new libxul 1.9.1.3 and Seamonkey 2.0 ( Beta 2 ) ports .
All of them are already committed to our Gecko repository .
A current status and todo list can be found at http://trillian.chruetertee.ch/freebsd-gecko/wiki/TODO.
Open tasks :
Remove mozilla , xulrunner and firefox2 from the ports tree .
The www / firefox35 port should be moved to www / firefox .
The old ( and somewhat stale ) Gecko providers mozilla , nvu , xulrunner , flock and firefox also need to be removed .

I am currently seeking funding for further development work on portmaster .
There are several features that are regularly requested by the community ( such as support for installing packages ) that I would very much like to implement but that will take more time than I can reasonably volunteer to implement correctly .
There is information about the funding proposal available at the link above .
Meanwhile I have recently completed another round of bug fixes and feature enhancements .
The often - requested ability to specify the -x ( exclude ) option more than once on the command line was added in version 2.12 .
Also in that version I added the -- list - origins option to make it easier to reinstall ports after a major version upgrade , or install the same set of ports on another system .

The Valgrind suite in the FreeBSD ports collection has been updated to version 3.5.0 ( the latest available version ) .
Most of the issues of the previous version should be resolved now : we expect memcheck , callgrind and cachegrind to be fully functional on both i386 and amd64 platforms as well as for i386 binaries running on amd 64 system .
DRD / hellgrind should work too , though they generate a lot of false - positives for now , so their output is a bit messy .
Open tasks :
Port exp - ptrcheck valgrind tool and fix outstanding issues that show up in memcheck / helgrind / DRD in the Valgrind regression tests suite .
More testing ( please , help ) .

Problem :
Over the years the FreeBSD locale database ( share / colldef , share / monetdef , share / msgdef , share / numericdef , share / timedef ) has accumulated a total of 165 definitions ( language - country - code - character - set triplets ) .
The contents of the files for Western European languages are often low - ASCII but for Eastern European and Asian languages partly or fully high - ASCII .
Without knowing how to display or interpret the character - sets , it is difficult to make sure by the general audience that the local language ( language - country - code ) definitions are displayed properly in various character - sets .
Suggested approach :
With the combination of the data in the Unicode project ( whose goal is to define all the possible written characters and symbols on this planet ) and the Common Locale Data Repository ( whose goal is to document all the different data and definitions needed for the locale database ) , we can easily keep track of the data , without the need of being able to display the data in the required character sets or understand them fully when updates are submitted by third parties .
Current status : Conversion of share / monetdef , share / msgdef , share / numericdef , share / timedef to the new design is completed .
The Makefile infrastructure is converted .
Regression checks are done .
Most of the tools are in place , waiting on the import of bsdiconv to the base system .
Open tasks :
At this moment the system is not self - hosted yet , because of the lack of an iconv-kind of program in the base operating system .
Gabor@ is working on bsdiconv as a GSoC project and once that has been imported we will be able to perform a clean install from the definitions in Unicode text format to the required formats and character sets .

Since their public launch in November 2008 , the FreeBSD Forums ( the most recent addition to the user community and support channels for the FreeBSD Operating System ) have witnessed a healthy and steady growth .
The user population is now at over 8,000 registered users , who have participated in over 6,000 topics , containing over 40,000 posts in total .
The sign - up rate hovers between 50 - 100 each week .
The total number of visitors ( including ' guests ' ) is hard to gauge but is likely to be a substantial multiple of the registered userbase .
New topics and posts are actively ' pushed out ' to search engines .
This in turn makes the Forums show up in search results more and more often , making it a valuable and very accessible source of information for the FreeBSD community .
One of the contributing factors to the Forums ' success is their ' BSD - style ' approach when it comes to administration and moderation .
The Forums have a strong and unified identity , they are neatly divided into sub-forums ( like ' Networking ' , ' Installing & Upgrading ' , etc. ) , very actively moderated , spam - free , and with a core group of very active and helpful members , dispensing many combined decades ' worth of knowledge to starting , intermediate and professional users of FreeBSD .
We expect the Forums to be , and to remain , a central hub in FreeBSD 's community and support efforts .
The tools , samples and other resources presented here are no longer under active development or support .

This development , that the Federal Reserve has hired one Linda Robertson , former Enron lobbyist and Summers / Rubin protege , to manage relations with the Hill , strikes me as a tacit admission that the Fed thinks it has an Enron scale problem brewing ….
From Bloomberg ( hat tip reader Matt S ) :
The Federal Reserve intends to hire a veteran lobbyist as it seeks to counter skepticism in Congress about the central bank ’s growing power over the U.S. financial system , people familiar with the matter said .
Linda Robertson currently handles government , community and public affairs at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , and headed the Washington lobbying office of Enron Corp. , the energy trading company that collapsed in 2002 after an accounting scandal .
She was also an adviser to all three of the Clinton administration ’s Treasury secretaries .
Robertson would help the Fed manage relations with lawmakers seeking greater oversight of a central bank that has used emergency powers to prevent Wall Street ’s demise .
While she was n’t tied to Enron ’s fraud , her association with the firm may raise questions , analysts said .
“ Some members of Congress think there are votes in attacking the Fed ” after it “ unnecessarily and unwisely entangled monetary policy with fiscal policy , ” said former St. Louis Fed President William Poole .
“ The Fed is going to have a tricky time of unwinding what has been done ” and will need to “ keep in touch with members of Congress more thoroughly , ” said Poole .

There can be no real recovery without the private sector , and credit is collapsing for consumers and business .
These two charts show the businesses are not able to borrow and consumers are not able to get credit .
On the consumer side , overall credit is declining at 5%/ yr and revolving credit ( credit cards ) is declining even faster at 8 % .
Business loans are down 12 % yearly , and in the last three months a frightening drop of 19 % annualized for total loans and a 28 % annualized in commercial loans .
This means the credit crunch is accelerating .
One of my investments is living this nightmare .
Their sales will triple this year in a bad market for retail products , but they have a difficult time getting a line of credit even when backed by real assets - receivables - and have to pay an effective rate of 15 % .
The public looks at the extremely low Treasury interest rates & deposit interest rates , and presumes that businesses can borrow close to them .
Instead , normal everyday commercial credit is run up to usurious levels .
And almost everyone knows someone who has faced seemingly rapid and arbitrary increases in credit card rates to a stunning 28 % .
New accounting rules which are supposed to enhance transparency may make consumer credit even harder to get .
The reason for the worsening crisis is the way the Fed has handled the situation , as described the Run on the Dollar post : by burying the toxic debt inside the Fed , they have postponed the day of reckoning for the banks but have not cured it .
You can see in the chart how much the Fed has buried , inside their Maiden Lane vehicle and using the TALF program .
Total bank reserves have hit an all time high .
A huge chunk of it ( 70 % ) are " non borrowed reserves " which as best as I can figure from the Fed 's gobbleygook are the reserves burined int he Fed .
They are not being used for active lending .
This postponement has consequence .
The banks have apparently taken their reprieve and used it to speculate in bonds and equities - the current Obama Hope Rally .
Yet they are still tightening credit and pulling back on lending because the buried reserves lock up lending capacity .
After all , at some point the Fed will swap them back !
And then the banks will have a much harder time avoiding insolvency , since these assets will have to be marked down due to their lack of liquidity and the underlying distress of the assets lent against ( primarily real estate ) .
1 Samuel Trivia :
1 Samuel 15
The Amalekite ( incomplete ) Genocide
15:1-9 15:1-9
15:1 Samuel also said unto Saul , The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people , over Israel : now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD .
15:2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts , I remember that which Amalek did to Israel , how he laid wait for him in the way , when he came up from Egypt .
15:3 Now go and smite Amalek , and utterly destroy all that they have , and spare them not ; but slay both man and woman , infant and suckling , ox and sheep , camel and ass .
God made you king .
Obey him .
This is what he says : I remember what Amalek did to Israel . [ 1 ]
Now go smite the Amalekites .
Destroy everything that they have .
Kill them all : men , women , infants , sucklings , ox , sheep , camel , and ass .
Samuel said to Saul ,
15:4 And Saul gathered the people together , and numbered them in Telaim , two hundred thousand footmen , and ten thousand men of Judah .
15:5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek , and laid wait in the valley .
15:6 And Saul said unto the Kenites , Go , depart , get you down from among the Amalekites , lest I destroy you with them : for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel , when they came up out of Egypt .
So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites .
So Saul sent 210,000 soldiers to kill the Amalekites .
15:7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur , that is over against Egypt .
15:8
And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive , and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword .
15:9 But Saul and the people spared Agag , and the best of the sheep , and of the oxen , and of the fatlings , and the lambs , and all that was good , and would not utterly destroy them : but every thing that was vile and refuse , that they destroyed utterly .
Saul killed all the Amalekites , except for the king ( Agag ) and some of the more valuable animals . [ 2 ]
God rejects Saul as king ( for not killing all the Amalekites )
15:10 -31 15:10-31
15:10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel , saying , 15:11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king : for he is turned back from following me , and hath not performed my commandments .
And it grieved Samuel ; and he cried unto the LORD all night .
15:12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning , it was told Samuel , saying , Saul came to Carmel , and , behold , he set him up a place , and is gone about , and passed on , and gone down to Gilgal .
God said to Samuel , I regret making Saul king , since he disobeyed my commandment . [ 3 ]
And Samuel cried to God all night .
And Samuel cried to God all night .
15:13 And Samuel came to Saul : and Saul said unto him , Blessed be thou of the LORD : I have performed the commandment of the LORD .
I did what God commanded me to do .
The next day when Samuel and Saul met , Saul said ,
15:14 And Samuel said ,
What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears , and the lowing of the oxen which I hear ?
Samuel replied , Oh really ?
Why do I hear sheep bleating and oxen lowing ?
15:15 And Saul said ,
They have brought them from the Amalekites : for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God ; and the rest we have utterly destroyed .
Saul said ,
We kept the best sheep and oxen to sacrifice to God .
We killed everything else .
15:16 Then Samuel said unto Saul , Stay , and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night .
And he said unto him , Say on .
15:17 And Samuel said ,
When thou wast little in thine own sight , wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel , and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel ?
15:18 And the LORD sent thee on a journey , and said , Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites , and fight against them until they be consumed .
15:19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD , but didst fly upon the spoil , and didst evil in the sight of the LORD ?
15:20 And Saul said unto Samuel , Yea , I have obeyed the voice of the LORD , and have gone the way which the LORD sent me , and have brought Agag the king of Amalek , and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites .
15:21 But the people took of the spoil , sheep and oxen , the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed , to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal .
15:22 And Samuel said , Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices , as in obeying the voice of the LORD ?
Behold , to obey is better than sacrifice , and to hearken than the fat of rams .
Samuel said , God commanded you too utterly destroy the Amalekite sinners .
Why did n't you obey him ?
15:23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft , and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry .
Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD , he hath also rejected thee from being king .
15:24 And Saul said unto Samuel , I have sinned : for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD , and thy words : because I feared the people , and obeyed their voice .
15:25 Now therefore , I pray thee , pardon my sin , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD .
15:26 And Samuel said unto Saul , I will not return with thee : for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD , and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel .
Because you rejected the word of God , God rejects you as king . [ 4 ]
15:27 And as Samuel turned about to go away , he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle , and it rent .
As Samuel turned to go away , he tore his skirt
15:28 And Samuel said unto him ,
The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day , and hath given it to a neighbour of thine , that is better than thou .
God has torn his kingdom from you today and has given it to a neighbor that 's better than you .
Samuel said to Saul ,
15:29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent : for he is not a man , that he should repent .
God is not a man ; he does n't lie or repent . [ 5 ]
15:30 Then he said , I have sinned : yet honour me now , I pray thee , before the elders of my people , and before Israel , and turn again with me , that I may worship the LORD thy God.
15:31 So Samuel turned again after Saul ; and Saul worshipped the LORD .
Samuel hacks Agag to death before the Lord
15:32-35 15:32-35
15:32 Then said Samuel , Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites .
And Agag came unto him delicately .
And Agag said , Surely the bitterness of death is past .
Bring Agag to me .
Agag said to Samuel , Surely the bitterness of death has past .
Samuel said , Agag said to Samuel ,
15:33 And Samuel said ,
As the sword hath made women childless , so shall thy mother be childless among women .
And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal .
15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah ; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul .
As the sword has made women childless , so your mother will be childless .
Then Samuel hacked Agag in pieces in front of God. [ Samuel said , Then Samuel hacked Agag in pieces in front of God . [ 6
15:35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death : nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul : and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel .
One year ago today Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy .
The weeks that followed are among the most dramatic in U.S. history .
They led to a massive government intervention in the financial system — an intervention that will likely change that system forever .
Many people say that letting Lehman fail was the mistake that caused the financial crisis .
To them , the lesson is that the government should never allow any " systemically important " financial institution to fail .
If only Lehman ...

Experts are warning child care centres to drastically limit the amount of time children spend watching television or ban TV altogether .
Research by the Royal Melbourne Children 's Hospital suggests children under the age of two should not watch any TV at all .
The researchers have now written guidelines for the Federal Government as part of the Get Up and Grow guidelines to reduce childhood obesity .
They are designed specifically for child care centres but also provide some advice for parents .
Statistics show that four - month - old infants watch on average 44 minutes of TV each day and children under the age of four with pay TV at home spend at least three hours a day in front of the screen .
A senior lecturer in Child Development at the University of South Australia , Glenn Cuppitt , says the new guidelines are a measure of desperation to encourage children to be active and to interact with others .
" [ Children ] need to be physically active and if parents and if child care centres are simply placing them in front of a television and leaving them there , then it cuts down the amount of time that they are actually involved in other healthy activities , " he said .
The brief also calls for TV to be limited to one hour a day for children aged between two and five .
Lee Burton , an independent media researcher and commentator , is in favour of a complete ban of TV for toddlers and child care centres .
" At the moment there are no rules and regulations .
Each child care centre has its own particular set , " he said .
" Many do n't have a television at all .
Some have a television and may seek advice from the parents or permission from the parents to show , for example , Play School or some other education program .
" Some child care centres unfortunately have a television running all the time and that is very damaging to a young child 's growth , particularly the under twos and threes .
" I think this is aimed at helping people to understand the effects of television watching on very young children and to advise them this is not a good thing . "
To ban or not to ban ?
Tina Garland , who has an 18 - month - old son , has not banned her child from watching television .
" I do let him watch TV , even though I do it with big pangs of guilt because I know you are not supposed to let little ones watch TV , " she said .
" He 's got a habit , too , of standing right in front of the screen as well and it is hard to keep him at a good distance away from it .
" I think it does make parents feel guilty when they do have it on , especially for a long period of time .
" He loves it .
If there is a cartoon on TV that I know he likes and he is getting excited and he 's watching it and he is pointing to things and saying things , I think 'oh , you know , maybe it is not such a bad thing ' . "
Lachlan Comyns says he tries to limit the amount of television his son watches .
" I do n't like my son watching any TV .
He is 18 months and sometimes we put on children 's videos for him but when he is around , I do n't have the TV on at all , " he said .
" My wife sometimes puts the TV on when she 's busy and he kind of goes into a bit like a zombie or something . "
The Get Up and Grow report is expected to be officially released next week by Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon .
It is fashionable these days to decry the quality of American leaders , and why not ?
Not long ago , we celebrated our CEOs as the new masters of the universe ; some paid themselves as if they thought so , too , and their faces graced the covers of magazines everywhere .
But last year , that universe imploded , and taxpayers were forced to come to the rescue .
As Bill George of the Harvard Business School argues , we have come to realize that the economic crisis was less a matter of subprime mortgages than subprime leadership .
Washington has fared only a little better than Wall Street .
A new Congress pledged to working together swiftly returned to old patterns of bickering and rank partisanship .
With the public continuing to give members failing marks , political strategists warn of another " wave election " in 2010 that could sweep away many incumbents .
Perhaps the biggest puzzle involves America 's new president .
Barack Obama fired the imagination of the country in the campaign a year ago , and his Inauguration Day was magical .
Millions of citizens revere him still , thankful that he — not his predecessor — is in the White House and convinced that he remains our greatest hope .
Yet the glow of Inauguration Day has clearly faded .
Less than a year into office , the country is as sharply divided as under George W. Bush .
Obama 's critics argue that he is rushing too fast with too much government and too much debt ; his supporters vigorously defend him in public , but in private some worry that he has not yet made the transformation from campaigner to chief executive .
Controversy rages on many fronts .
Crisis of confidence .
This is not the first season that Americans have felt disgruntled with their leaders .
Months before the economy cracked and Obama rose to prominence , some three quarters of Americans said we faced a leadership crisis .
Indeed , confidence in government plummeted back in the '60s and ' 70s and has never really recovered .
It was nearly four decades ago that John Gardner first observed that at the founding , with a population of 3 million , the republic spawned a dozen world - class leaders — Washington , Jefferson , Franklin , Adams , Madison , and Hamilton among them — but today , with a population nearly 100 times that , we struggle to produce even one or two .
That the leadership deficit now seems so chronic suggests that the problem goes deeper than the quality of the individuals who come to power .
There is something in the culture that makes leadership even tougher and more perilous than it should be .
Why , asked Thomas Jefferson , did the American Revolution create a budding democracy while the French Revolution — coming at virtually the same time and with similar values — ended in tyranny ?
The answer , he thought , could be traced as much to the quality of the followers as to that of the leaders : American citizens were more accustomed than the French to responsible self - government .
Our leaders today are discovering , with a vengeance , how much followers matter .
When the economic bubble burst last year , a powerful , angry uprising swept the country and moved into Washington .
Obama privately told bank CEOs , " My administration is the only thing that stands between you and the pitchforks . "
Obama himself was the target of a second populist uprising that came in tea parties , town halls , and public marches .
Hatred hung in the air , and some worried about violence .
The president and his supporters have tended to blame the blogosphere and 24 - hour news channels that feature extreme voices and manufacture artificial controversies .
They have a point .
There was a time in the lives of many today when the culture and the media environment were more civil and the country was more united .
The 1940s , '50s , and early '60s had ugly moments — remember McCarthy ?
And Dallas ?— but the overall tone was more positive .
Was it any accident that those years also spawned Truman , Marshall , Eisenhower , and Kennedy ?
The occasion of America 's Best Leaders gives us a chance to pause and reflect on where and why we have slipped off track .
Fortunately , it also provides a welcome opportunity to salute those who are actually succeeding in this environment — men and women who are persevering against the odds and are lighting candles for others .
These leaders are a remarkable lot and each an inspiring story .
And they are living proof that if we can retain the spirit of the early republic , giants may walk among us again .

freshman Rep. Grayson
DOESN'T ANYBODY WANT THIS NOMINATION ?
The reason that no one has joined the race against Congressman Grayson is because they know the Democratic Party will beat them to a pulp .
In other words , they 're scared .
I just got off the phone with Dan Webster , who still says he is undecided on running for Congress .
Here is my take on the conversation : Dan has no intention of running .
He is a big family man and his family , including five grandkids , is here .
He would be a commuter congressman , and we saw how well that worked with Mel Martinez .
I get the impression his family is n't keen on him running .
He says his wife told him : " The problem is you might win . ''
A better fit for Dan would the mayoral race and he is interested .
Instead of taking on a strong incumbent like Grayson , he would be entering a wide - open race with no favorite .
But he has to act soon .
As for the congressional race , Dan says he " would like " to announce it today .
Webster , a Christian conservative who served nearly three decades in the Florida legislature and served as House Speaker , said in a statement that despite encouragement from supporters he was prompted to “ follow a principle that has always served me well : ‘ When in doubt , do n’t . ’ ”
“ I do firmly believe that in every public office there needs to be a resurgence of the basic principles on which this Republic was founded , and a return to our original standards of integrity and character , ” he said .
" I can take this , but they can 't , " Pierce said .
With the recent exit of former state Sen .
Dan Webster , R - Winter Garden , from the roster of GOP hopefuls , that leaves a pair of Tea Party activists -- Patricia Sullivan from Eustis and Dan Fanelli of Orlando -- and recent Orlando resident Armando Gutierrez Jr. , as likely Grayson foes , so far .
THE POLITICS OF BELIEVING IN SOMETHING

TAKE OFF YOUR PAJAMAS , BLOGGERS !
" SHOW ME THE MONEY "

Back in March , a post on the 's political blog The Buzz noted a Rothenberg Political Report that in Orlando - area FL - 08 , the normally Republican congressional district wrested from tarnished incumbent Ric Keller in 2008 by unabashed liberal Alan Grayson , " There is little doubt they ’ll compete " in 2010 .
The report , citing as possible GOP candidates former state House Speaker Dan Webster and Orange County Mayor Rich Crotty , drew some interesting comments , including one signed " An observer , " which argued that Republicans disaffected with Keller had allowed him to go down in 2008 , knowing that year 's election was going to be a Republican rout , clearing the path for a new candidate in 2010 .
" Grayson is nothing more than a place - holder , " the commenter continued , " albeit a Huffington Post , Dailykos.com delusional place - holder , but a place - holder none the less .
Dan Webster will beat Grayson by larger than a 10 point margin . "
Until recently , withtaking his place as perhaps the House 's most outspoken ( and effective ? ) progressive , the " Just Say No " Republicans thought FL - 08 was practically back in their column .
All they had to do was keep hammering away at the president and making their maximum effort of obstruction with every utterance and he made , while hammering away at the " extreme " liberal congressman .
So when Grayson made his now - famous declaration that the Republican health care plan consisted of advising people not to get sick , and if you do , to die quickly , the Just Say Naysayers were licking their chops .
The Great Right - Wing Noise Machine went instantly into high - screech mode , pounding Grayson day and night .
The all - important Conventional Wisdom was that all the Republicans had to do was pencil in a candidate , and the seat was won .
Grayson , however , surprised the Noisemakers , and maybe some of us as well , by .
And an amazing thing happened .
Of course to us lefties he became the man of the hour , the progressive hero who stood up to the bullies and lying obstructionists .
Meanwhile Republicans found their prospective candidates turning uncharacteristically media-shy .
Not only were you not hearing fancy talk about a larger - than - 10 - point margin of victory , you began to wonder if they were going to be able to come up with a candidate .
Already on October 2 , a Friday , theran a story , " GOP quiet on who might face Alan Grayson in 2010 , " in which reporter David Damron noted that " it was hard to find a politician Thursday willing to take [ Grayson ] on . "
According to Damron , " Orange County GOP Chairman Lew Oliver , the man who ' guaranteed ' Grayson 's defeat , acknowledged Thursday that it was time for Republicans to muster a serious candidate , " and the reporter quoted senior Grayson campaign adviser Julie Tagen : Crotty withdrew last week , even though he was confident he would have beaten Grayson " handily , " " saying his low - key style ' was just not a good fit ' with Washington 's rancorous tone .
In the end , he said , ' I would have won a prize I 'm not sure I wanted . ' "
( It seems Crotty also has some dirty laundry he may not be eager to have aired . )
Yesterdaypolitical reporter Mike Thomas posted this blog item :
Even while we waited , all tingly , for the big announcement , the spin was already in motion for Gramps to opt out of the raceand then have to leave the grandkids behind for the forced march to D.C.
Um , right .
Today the big announcement came -- with our Dan 's " Nuh-uh , I do n't think so " buried in a cloud of gibberish opaque even by the unexalted standards of a provincial right - wing hack .
Dara Kam reports on the 's Post on Politics blog :
And then the 's David Damron reported that 68 - year - old restaurant - supply company owner Jerry Pierce had just " suddenly " withdrawn from consideration , " just hours after pledging to put a large sum of his personal fortune into the race , " in exchange for which he would receive the party endorsement .
Why the change of heart ?
It seems our Jerry can't bring himself to put his family through it , a consideration that apparently had n't occurred to him before , including the time when he was bartering for the party nod .
FYI : Last week Pierce told Damron that " he would run with or without the party 's support by tapping the veterans and pro-growth groups he has worked closely with for years .
" It does seem that Grayson is showing that if you stake out your principles clearly and stand by them , it 's possible to get at least some of your voters to : ( a ) begin focusing on those issues rather than all the deafening political noise and / or ( b ) at least respect you for believing in -- a lesson that has served loudmouthed hard - right - wing pols with their cartoonlike , nuance - free visions of the world for decades .
And then there 's that crew in the White House , scared of pretty much everything and everyone , it seems , except us lefty whiners .
When it comes to us , they feel gloriously empowered .
While the president himself periodically makes a pretty speech -- and there 's no doubt , he can make as pretty a speech as you 're going to hear today -- making it sound as if he shares our concerns and indeed will pursue an agenda that realizes our fondest hopes , the trolls back in the White House , under the command of Trollmaster Rahm Emanuel , laugh at us and spit at us and keep watch for any passing bus they can throw us under .
Of course , like any bullies , they 're only brave with people they 're persuaded are weaker than them -- and we seem to be pretty much it .
Despite the pitiful estate to which the entire Republican Party has sunk , the Rahmites are fraidy scared of them , who in the administration 's view have to be respected , appeased , and wherever possible accommodated , even when they themselves show no sign of willingness to make the slightest accommodation in return .
They 're even scareder of right - wing and so - called " moderate " Democrats , to whose satisfaction the administration is apparently willing to water down any proposal on the table .
As an online colleague observed , the Obama administration seems built on fear , but not in the way that the Bush regime was , which was to make all players in the process fear the regime .
No , the present administration seems afraid of everyone else .
( Everyone but us , that is . )
It operates as if from a position of the most abject weakness .
Never mind the 365 -173 electoral - vote shellacking that put the president in office .
Never mind the commanding Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress .
Never mind the solid - to - overwhelming public approval indicated in polls -- which was , granted , a lot more overwhelming when more of those people being polled still believed that the president actually believed in something .
Never mind the cartoon status to which the opposition " party " has been reduced : a bottom - feeding assortment of unreconstructed Confederates , Crap Christian demagogues , Far Right zealots , and sweaty - palmed corporate predators .
Sunday night we got confirmation of a sort that the White House sees itself engaged in the most delicate of balancing acts .
As you 've surely heard -- Howie has already linked to Digby 's report -- on NBC'sCNBC ( and NYT ) correspondent John Harwood answered a question from Lester Holt about resistance to Obama administration policy from the left with this eye - popper :
This produced an online firestorm a firm - sounding White House denial from senior communications adviser Dan Pfeiffer : ( One delicious speculation that I 've heard speculated , is that the anonymous source being officially repudiated was Pfeiffer himself .
This makes such wonderful sense that I 'm sorry there appears to be no factual backup for the speculation . )
Now Digby makes the interesting point that , as she has pointed out repeatedly , such a dismissive view of the liberal netroots is one that Harwood himself has voiced -- in , that is -- on -air more occasions than can be readily enumerated .
Still , I do n't see any possibility that he simply made this up , and while " adviser " can be an ambiguous term , I do n't think Harwood 's use of it was meant at all ambiguously ; I think he meant .
It 's possible , of course , that it represents a dissident view within the WH , but Harwood sure does n't think so , and since the speaker had to expect his / her words were going to be made public , do you think there 's any chance that he / she would have said something that might have gotten him / her in trouble with his / her superiors ?
And besides , and above all , Lip service is available on selected occasions for those of us in what I would call the mainstream of Democratic Party issues , but how much consideration of those views is ever given in the inner sanctum ?
When it comes to LGBT issues , which many people mistakenly assumed was the exclusive subject of Harwood 's comment , again the president made one of his patented fancy speeches at the HRC dinner Saturday night , but with no commitment to anything of an actual follow - through nature except a plea to watch and see .
Whereas when the mangiest Blue Dog has an itch , Master Rahm and his team are on the job .
On a host of controversial pieces of legislation , most obviously health care reform but not limited to it , the White House has seemed to place a higher value on Republican votes it was never going to get than on the votes of Democrats who were thereby put in the position of voting for legislation the believed to be seriously compromised .
As a number of people skilled in the principles of negotiation have pointed out , this adminstration begins " compromising " before the other side even announces a position , apparently simply inof objections before they 've even been made -- and again by people who have no earthly intention of voting for the " compromise " package .
With regard to health care reform , we 've heard often enough that the administration 's brain trust has as its sole priority passage of " a bill , " and never mind whether the bill actually brings us closer to achieving the kind of reform that 's needed .
There is the ever - increasing suspicion that " a bill " may perfectly well include one that functions mainly as a bonanza for the insurance industry , one that large numbers of Americans are going to punish the Democrats for when they discover how much they are forced to pay either in premiums for super - crap covers - nothing insurance or for the penalty for not buying insurance .
This of course suggests that the brain trust is n't even very good at the politics of its machinations , since there 's a good chance that what it considers a politically successful outcome will make an already restive electorate outright angry and defiant .
But then the politics of Master Rahm always seem to take as their constituency , not the electorate but his corporate patrons .
If in the end very little of this is about enlightened policy as much as it is a game of " Show me the money " -- as a lot of Howie 's writing in recent months as tended to suggest -- then it may well be that the administration is succeeding admirably in the " complicated and difficult " task of " governing a closely divided country .
If it 's about achieving any of the policy goals announced so eloquently by candidate and then President Obama , it 's not only lousy policy but probably even lousy politics .
At the moment the administration has precious little to show the country by way of actual accomplishment .
The Democrats have gotten plenty of mileage out of the Republicans ' self - destruction .
Master Rahm clearly believed in the 2006 and 2008 elections that it was n't necessary for the Democrats to be seen as believing in anything to beat them , that in fact being caught believing in something would cost them more votes than it would gain .
That struck some of us as a dangerously , even tragically misguided notion .
This administration came into power with a mandate for change , and with the election results had an opportunity to remake the political landscape .
( Of course there is again the quite different consideration that what we consider the bind we 're in now is exactly the situation Master Rahm wanted to engineer .
As Howie documented in his coverage of the 2004 , 2006 , and 2008 congressional races , the DCCC -- directly controlled by Rahm in the first two , less directly last time -- devoted more urgent attention to fighting progressive Democrats than to fighting Republicans .
Hell , an alarming number of is anointed candidatesRepublicans until they heard " the call . "
We always wondered just what kind of House majority the Master was trying to create .
Or perhaps I should say we were always afraid that it would be the kind we 've wound up with . ) I do n't want to conclude that that opportunity has been squandered .
I would rather think that Alan Grayson has been showing us how some of candidate Obama 's agenda -- " the idea of Obama , " that is , as opposed to " actual Obama " -- might yet be salvaged .

If you thought banks were the summon of " prestige " , think again .
This was a step beyond that ...
Everything , even the cafeteria furniture was custom designed .
You can imagine what was at the center of the business .
Money .
Gradually , Louis - Paul Boon started to creep back into my mind .
My commercial instincts got into a battle with my ethic values , which had remained dormant during the first years in my career .
Then came
My conscience won the battle .
I gave up my management career ,
Gradually , once more , my commercial and competitive instincts got the upper hand .
While I continued to work in the humanitarian world , I gradually got sucked into the hard core " business " aspect of it : concentrating on my core work , I would do the stuff I did well , and do it head - on .
I would not always put it all in a humanitarian context .
As the years went on , my team grew .
I hired hundreds of people over the years .
Larisa started
She triggered my conscience back into a ferocious battle with my competitive instincts .
And this time , the conscience would get the upper hand .
It has ever since , I 'd love to believe .
My conscience is a big as a 30 story flat now .
It dominates everything I do .
Every time I raise my voice ( a lot ) , piss off people ( a lot ) , hurt someone ( luckily rarely I would think ) , I can not sleep at night .
I am trying to lead a life where my ethics determine what and how I do it .
It dominates .
That makes me a pain to work with .
That makes it impossible to manage me .
Many see me as a loose canon .
I simply can not keep quiet .
I feel guilty if I have something on my mind , and do not speak up , or question .
I fight battles , often loosing battles .
I bang my head against the wall continuously .
But I do not give up .
This blog , The Road , is part of that dynamic , by the way .
The " conscience " is one of the reasons I continue to work in the humanitarian world .
Not only because it is " humanitarian " , but maybe , maybe , I can work on " change from within " .
The UN is criticised a lot .
But it is easy doing that from the sidelines .
I want to do it while being in the midst of it .
Trying to make a change from within .
And maybe , maybe , I can instill a change in people .
Even if it was in a small part , I want to change the world .
And remind people of their conscience .
Every day is a battle to continue doing that .
It is so easy to get sucked into your daily job , without loosing sight of the wider , the humanitarian , the human context .
Every day , I have to remind myself .
Every day , I have to weigh the conscience part , with the work I have to deliver .
Not loosing sight of either .
Every day .
Every day , I want to kick people until they have a conscience .
" Lowie " in me has not died .
Is he still alive within you ?

Money .
Gradually , Louis - Paul Boon started to creep back into my mind .
My commercial instincts got into a battle with my ethic values , which had remained dormant during the first years in my career .
Then came the evening that changed the rest of my life .
I could no longer work for a commercial company .
The lust for life , for adventure , for the horizon , but mainly the drive to ' make a positive change in this world ' , got stronger .
My conscience won the battle .
I gave up my management career , went to the Antarctic wrote a book , and started my professional life from scratch as a technician for the Red Cross Gradually , once more , my commercial and competitive instincts got the upper hand .

I hired hundreds of people over the years .
Many left a trace in my mind and heart .
It was not until the midst of the 2003 Iraq crisis , we hired Larisa .
Larisa started the Pink Revolution in our team .
She would question all and everything .
She was a pain .
She would be the one saying " you can not kill to feed the hungry " .
Not meant literally ( thank God ! ) , but rather : " you can not run over your ethics while doing your humanitarian work " .
She triggered my conscience back into a ferocious battle with my competitive instincts .
And this time , the conscience would get the upper hand .

Trying to make a change from within .
And maybe , maybe , I can instill a change in people .
Even if it was in a small part , I want to change the world .
And remind people of their conscience .
Every day is a battle to continue doing that .
It is so easy to get sucked into your daily job , without loosing sight of the wider , the humanitarian , the human context .
Every day , I have to remind myself .
Every day , I have to weigh the conscience part , with the work I have to deliver .
Not loosing sight of either .
Every day .
Every day , I want to kick people until they have a conscience .
" Lowie " in me has not died .
Is he still alive within you ?

When I was seventeen , as part of the tests to graduate secondary school , we had to read three books from one author , and make short summary .
I choose Louis - Paul ( " Lowie " ) Boon , a Flemish writer , columnist , socialist and anarchist .
He was not really educated .
He was a house painter .
But he was a born artist and story teller .
He lived in poverty while he wrote his first book .
After 400 pages of it , he discarded the relevance , and hung it from a string on his bathroom wall , so he could save on toilet paper .
His wife took the manuscript , read it , took the last page and wrote on it : " Etcetera , Etcetera , Etcetera " .
She wrapped everything together in brown paper and sent it off to a publisher .
It won the Leo J. Krijn Prize for literature .
I did not read three books from Louis - Paul Boon .
I got fascinated by him and read all of his books , about 30 or 40 by then .
Some of the books had the size of an encyclopedia .
And I did not write a summary , I wrote a 100 page thesis .
My teachers collectively declared me a nut case and I graduated ( almost failing my maths exam , though , but that is a different story ) .
No surprise Louis - Paul Boon left a lasting impression on the teenager I was , and still am .
Not only in his writing style and approach to life , but also in some of his basic principles .
One of them was " You have to kick people until they have a conscience " :
You have to repeat ethical values to people , slam their face with it , until they understand .
Head - on .
That sentence remained within me , lingering .
Being young , you want to prove yourself , so I got into the commercial world , into the business .
And not just any business .
After some adventures at a hitech research company , I joined a company - at that time - at the heart of the world 's financial world .
I worked at their headquarters , in a building designed by Ricardo Bofill and set on an old castle estate near Brussels .

Lawsuit seeks injunction against Linden Research to prevent intellectual property rights infringement in Second Life
by Pixeleen Mistral , National Affairs desk
Shannon Grei and Kevin Aldermann 's Eros LLC have filed a complaint in US District Court in Northern California against Linden Reseach alleging " Linden Lab , with knowing and conscious intent to do so , profits in multiple ways and at multiple stages from the illegal conduct " and asks for an injunction to halt the activity .
Eros LLC markets a line of sex animations for the virtual world of Second Life , and has built a successful business – but the accumulated frustrations with the weak enforcement of intellectual property rights on the part of Linden Lab seem to have reached the breaking point .
When the Herald contacted Stroker Serpentine for comment , Mr. Serpentine ( Kevin Aldermann in real life ) said , " This is not about financialgain .
Seldom do class actions result in substantial class settlements .
This is about a pattern of ambivelence over six years .
We wantfundamental change in the regard to the very content and creators thatmade SL what it is today . "
The complaint begins :
" Plaintiffs Eros , LLC ( “ Eros ” ) and Shannon Grei , d/b/ a Nomine ( “ Grei ” ) ( collectively , “ Plaintiffs ” ) , bring this class action complaint against Defendants Linden Research , Inc. and Linden Research International , Inc. ( collectively , “ Linden Lab ” or “ Defendant ” ) , headquartered in San Francisco , California , for its practice of violating the real - world intellectual property rights of proprietors of virtual content within the Second Life virtual world ( “ Second Life ” ) , which Linden Lab owns and operates . "
The illegal conduct alleged includes
" directly and secondarily violated the intellectual property rights of Plaintiffs and other Second Life proprietors .
Linden Lab directly and secondarily infringes the trademark of Plaintiff Eros by using Eros ’s mark to sell infringing virtual goods within Second Life and by providing the tools to other infringing Second Life users .
Linden Lab directly and secondarily violates the copyrights of Plaintiff
Grei by reproducing and displaying her copyrighted works within Second Life , and by materially contributing to and supervising the infringing conduct of others within Second Life . "
We will have much more on this breaking story once we finished reading the complaint – if Stroker is as successful with this legal action as he has been with legal actions in the past , the Lindens may have their hands full .
I hope they get their money back from the Halloween store when they return those " Angry Protester " costumes .

October 10 , 2009 --
It has become commonplace to say that there are two lefts in Latin America : one would be “ carnivore ” , the other “ vegetarian ” ; one would be radical , the other moderate ; one would be revolutionary , the other reformist ; one would be socialist , the other capitalist .
Dichotomous definitions of this kind are made by spokespersons ( official or unofficial ) of the US State Department , with the explicit purpose of bringing about discord in the Latin American left , making it fight itself rather than its common enemies .
To be sure , there is neither the manner nor the motive to deny the existence of programmatic , strategic , tactical , organisational , historical and sociological differences in the Latin American left .
We shall talk about these differences further below .
Yet a dichotomous interpretation of the actually existing differences , in addition to serving the purposes of the right , expresses an incorrect theoretical interpretation .
The reductionism ( by saying that there are two lefts in Latin America ) helps the right politically because it bears the following implicit conclusion : one left ’s growth depends on the other ’s weakening , in an equation that conveniently removes our common enemies from the picture .
Reductionism , moreover , is an incorrect theoretical interpretation because it cannot account for the historical phenomenon of the past 11 years ( 1998 - 2009 ) , namely : the simultaneous growth of the various Latin American lefts .
Contrary to the followers of the reductionist view , in any of its forms , we advocate that the strengthening experienced , from 1998 until today , by the different currents of the Latin American left is due partly to its diversity , which has made it possible to express the sociological , cultural , historical and political diversity of the dominated classes of our continent .
Were it homogeneous and uniform , were it just one or two , it would not exhibit its current strength .
We also advocate that the continuity of the strengthening of the Latin American lefts will depend , to a good extent , on the cooperation between the different existing currents .
Such cooperation does not preclude the ideological and political struggle between the multiple lefts ; yet this struggle must occur within the framework of maximum strategic cooperation .
Such cooperation will be more difficult the more imperfect our understanding of the process we are living in is .
The material - political basis that makes cooperation between most of the different currents of the Latin American left possible is the existence of a common strategic situation .
Whether this situation will continue to exist or not , that will depend on the social and political struggle that is underway at this very moment .
The ultra-radical or hyper - moderate currents that refuse to realise the existence of a common strategic situation are the very same that , consciously or unconsciously , deliver services to the local dominant classes or to imperialism .
Debate on the nature of the Latin American revolution
What we know today as Latin America contributed during the so - called “ primitive accumulation ” and has , ever since , been fully integrated to world capitalism .
From the debate on the nature of this integration stem the different existing positions about the nature of the development actually existing in each country and in the region as a whole , and about the possibilities of the reformist and revolutionary struggle , of “ democratic capitalism ” and of socialism .
National resistance to invasion and exploitation by European powers , as well as resistance of direct producers to exploitation practiced by local and foreign dominant classes , has taken up various forms since 1492 .
In the 20th century — in an environment characterised by rising industrialisation , imperialism , world wars , the Russian Revolution , revolutions and anti-colonial wars — Latin America ’s popular struggles came to combine , in different ways , the demands for political democracy , national sovereignty and land reform with anti-capitalist and socialist purposes .
Until the 1950s , the prevailing combination emphasised national - democratic demands : defeating imperialism and latifundia , which , to some , constituted “ feudal remains ” , industrialising the economy , democratising the state and affirming national sovereignty .
This national - democratic orientation was shared by most socialists , including the communist parties that appeared as of the 1920s .
Termed in the Marxist variant as “ stageism ” ( first the bourgeois revolution , next the socialist revolution ) , the national - democratic orientation was criticised , even within the left , for three main reasons : a ) for underestimating the organic links between latifundia , imperialism and capitalism ; b ) for believing in the feasibility of a strategic alliance of the proletariat with the “ national bourgeoisie ” ; c ) for conceiving as relatively compartmentalised “ stages ” what should more adequately be conceived as “ flow ” , as “ transgrowth ” .
The most consistent formulation of stageism , as well as its defence in face of criticisms , was made by the communist parties .
There is no need here to recall the details surrounding the debate , but two points should be emphasised .
First , they were right those who said that it was necessary to put into perspective the “ obstacles ” to capitalist development in Latin America .
“ Imperialism ” and “ latifundia ” , dependence and limited domestic market , were metabolised and incorporated to the actually existing capitalist development .
Therefore , to deduce , based on these obstacles , the possibility of a revolutionary alliance ( anti-imperialistic , anti-latifundia ) between the “ national ” bourgeoisie and the proletariat was to transform the secondary ( the actually existing contradictions , which prompted fractions of the bourgeoisie to adopt more radical attitudes ) into a main contradiction .
This , in turn , leads us to the mistake of extracting from this contradiction , supposedly the main one , consequences ( conceiving the proletariat as the left of the democratic - bourgeois revolution ) without adequate material basis .
Second , also right were those who said that the struggle for socialism in Latin America could not minimise the so - called “ pending tasks ” of the democratic - bourgeois revolution .
Themes as national sovereignty , industrialisation , political democratisation , land reform and welfare policies constitute , still today , the raw material of all and any political fight implemented by socialists in Latin America .
The fact that the bourgeoisie is not prepared to lead the fight for these claims , does not remove them from the political horizon ; the fact that the proletariat is called on to take up the vanguard of such claims , does not eliminate its democratic - bourgeois character .
The theoretical debate outlined above can only find a complete solution in the terrain of practice , namely : the struggle for historically democratic - bourgeois claims may fulfil one or another strategic role , depending on the correlation of forces at the national , hemispheric and world levels .
If the proletariat has enough strength and radicalness , the struggle for democratic - national claims may undergo “ transgrowth ” toward transformations of a socialist kind .
Conversely , if the proletariat is weak and subaltern , the struggle for the “ democratic revolution ” will neither be democratic nor revolutionary , nor will it accumulate any strength toward socialism .
The discussion about the nature of the Latin American revolution ( socialist , democratic , etc. ) was always simultaneous with the debate on which revolutionary path : violent or peaceful , guerrilla or insurrection , etc .
Again , different combinations were established : from “ stageists ” favouring more radical forms of violence to socialists imbued with the strongest commitment to “ peaceful transition ” .
The multiple “ stageism ” and “ reformism ” variants were seriously brought to question by the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959 .
To some sectors of the left , the strategic discussion ( on the nature of the revolution and its path ) appeared to be settled in favour of a given “ model ” .
Despite the fact that the really existing Cuban Revolution was one thing , while the “ models ” formulated thereafter were something else .
A similar divergence happened in the 1917 Russian case and in the 1949 Chinese case : the models simplified and many times contradicted enormously the strategy actually implemented .
Observations on socialist transition and strategy
There is so much confusion regarding the terms “ capitalism ” , “ transition ” , “ socialism ” and “ communism ” , that it becomes mandatory to explain what one means , in this text , by these words .
By capitalism we understand a mode of production based on the private property of the means of production , a mode of production where direct producers are obliged to sell their labour power to capitalists , who appropriate themselves of the “ surplus value ” of the salaried ; we oppose to capitalism another mode of production , one founded on the social property of the means of production and in which it is indispensable to work with the categories communism ( that other mode of production ) and socialism ( the transition period between one and the other mode of production ) .
For known historical reasons , the term “ communism ” is rejected or simply left aside by large sectors of the left , including some who proclaim themselves revolutionaries .
Still , from the theoretical standpoint , the use of the term is essential , once it enables distinguishing between what “ transition ” is and what the “ final objective ” is ( that is , the mature form of society intended to be built ) .
When we speak of socialism , we speak of a transition between capitalism and communism .
Thus , the socialist transition ( or socialism ) is , by definition , a social formation that combines capitalism and anti-capitalism .
That which defines whether we are before a socialist formation is the existence of an organic , structural movement toward social property ( with all the complex political and social outcomes ) .
In other words , that which defines whether we are before a socialist transition is the existence of a movement toward the socialisation of production , of property and of political power .
This definition of socialism as movement toward contains at least two potential causes for misunderstanding .
The first of them considers transition as a linear process , of progressive accumulation , taking any withdrawal as a sign of a return to capitalism , as a reason to believe that the transition toward socialism has been interrupted .
The second is to mistake : a ) the struggle we wage within capitalism , in favour of socialism for ; b ) the socialist construction or transition .
In our opinion , a key variable in eliminating these misconceptions is to know who wields the political power .
That is , the difference between withdrawal and stampede ; between concession and capitulation ; between “ improvementism ” and struggle for reforms .
For instance , the difference between a struggle for socialism and a socialist transition might not lie in the measures themselves , yet must necessarily be present in politics , in the correlation of forces , in state power .
This is so because material - driven limitations can oblige a revolutionary government to adopt pro-capitalist measures .
Yet these measures acquire different strategic senses when adopted by a bourgeois government or by a socialist government .
To transform the struggle for socialism to true socialist transition , to start the construction of socialism , it is necessary to control state power , that is , have the means to affect a society ’s structure , to control the economy and the means of production .
Surely these means are determined , ultimately , by the pre-existing material basis : the entire world ’s political will , the most absolute state power , is not capable of transforming a pre-capitalist material basis into raw material enough for the construction of socialism .
In this case , what political power can ensure , within certain boundaries , is that capitalist development policies be at the service of the strategic project of building socialism .
For , unless the working class holds state power , it will have little influence on the economic macro- determinants that produce and reproduce capitalism every day .
Only with state power can the working class change the existing accumulation pattern in society , shifting the hegemonic axis from private property and accumulation of capital to collective property and social accumulation .
Conquering state power is a complex process , whose tipping point is the establishment of a monopoly on violence .
Not that there might not be some challenge to this monopoly , but this cannot be relevant to the point of bringing into question state power itself .
In addition to monopoly on violence , conquering state power involves other elements , such as the creation of a new political and legal institutional framework ; capacity to run the economy and social communications ; de facto and de jure recognition from other states , etc .
Moreover , as we know , power is a social relation that can be won or lost .
What occurs at the micro level with recently elected governments may also occur at a macro scale with states originating great social revolutions .
Revolutions are “ irreversible ” only in certain speeches , not in real history .
No social class or bloc of classes has reached state power by using only one way for the accumulation of forces or one way to seize power .
The victory of the Russian insurrection , of the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples ’ wars , the Cuban guerrilla war , would become incomprehensible if we dissociate the main forms of struggle in each case from the other forms of struggle that were present beside the main form of struggle : mass or vanguard struggles , legal or clandestine , electoral or direct action .
However , the historical conditions of a country or an era confer on a given form of struggle the role of catalyst and main battering ram in the showdown against the enemy classes and their state power .
Yet this condition of catalyst , of main form of struggle , is an organic product of a concrete situation that cannot be transplanted to another situation .
We have spoken several times about the conquest of state power , yet we must recall the obvious : if power is a social relation , conquering state power requires the construction of a distinct social correlation of forces , a political - social bloc that aims to put into practice a given program .
Political - social bloc
Which program ?
The answer to this question leads us back to the debate on the nature of the revolution .
In a capitalist society , the construction of a historical alternative to the contradictions existing within a particular society requires starting the socialist transition .
But this theoretical and historical conclusion , according to which “ the order of the day ” is to supersede capitalism , when translated to the terrain of political strategy may be understood in at least two different ways : a ) the leftist way defends building a political - social bloc hinging on a socialist program ; b ) the “ popular - democratic and socialist ” way defends building a political - social bloc hinging on a program interlinking democratic measures with socialist measures .
In the current stage of development of capitalism , democratic measures are not socialist , yet may take on an anti-capitalist direction .
For those who think socialism and anti-capitalism are synonyms , this is no more than a play on words .
Surely socialism is consequent anti-capitalism , that anti-capitalism that implies the overcoming of the capitalist mode of production .
Yet in everyday life , capitalism is confronted in several ways : the struggle for higher wages , land reform , the struggle against private monopolies , the defence of state - owned companies , universal public policies , the struggle against imperialism etc .
These struggles are waged against aspects of capitalism or , at best , against a hegemonic form of capitalism in a given historical situation , not aiming in itself at the defeat of capitalism in general , as a mode of production based on private property and the extraction of surplus value .
That is : they are capitalist struggles against capitalism .
Struggles that generally speaking aim at building more democratic capitalist societies , politically , economically and socially .
Nevertheless , under different conditions , these capitalist struggles against capitalism may come to integrate a movement that is conducive to the overcoming of the capitalist mode of production .
In these cases , it is as if next to anti-capitalism or proletarian socialism there existed a smallholder capitalism , a petit - bourgeois socialism .
The political - social bloc capable of challenging and conquering state power must be organised around a program combining socialist measures ( or tasks , or claims ) with anti-capitalist measures that are not socialist in themselves .
To use a more precise word , they are democratic , bourgeois - democratic measures , defenders of small property against large property , defenders of the public ( which is different from the social and the collective ) against the private , defenders of the national against imperialism .
The leftist way of viewing the construction of the political - social bloc is not capable of succeeding for two reasons .
The first of them is related to the debate on the nature of the revolution in Latin America , a revolution that , as we said before , will necessarily have to address democratic tasks .
The second reason is strictly political : the correlation of forces that precedes the conquest of state power and the level of consciousness prevailing in the working class and its allies make it impossible , by definition , to constitute a power bloc only or mainly hinging on the “ direct struggle for socialism ” .
That is : if there is capitalist domination , that is so because the people ’s prevailing level of consciousness is not socialist .
This level of consciousness can only become consequently socialist in the course of the process , which is why the programmatic starting point of the new political - social bloc cannot be explicitly or consequently socialist .
This is tantamount to saying that : a ) the class struggle process will not necessarily reach the “ temperature ” needed to produce a level of socialist consciousness in the vast majority of the people ; b ) it is expected that socialist sectors act both toward “ raising the temperature ” ( by stimulating the struggle process itself ) and to raising the level of consciousness .
For the reasons explained before , the political - social bloc capable of challenging and conquering state power needs to organise with regard to a ) “ future ” issues ( the construction of socialism ) ; b ) and , mainly , “ past & present ” issues ( facing the problems derived from actually existing capitalism ) .
What this means is that socialist forces conquer and maintain state power if and when they manage to build political majorities based on action programs addressing immediate issues .
The classic example of this is still the slogan “ Bread , peace and land ” .
The Cuban Revolution of 1959 , the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Chinese Revolution of 1949 resulted exactly from continuous democratic , popular and national radicalisation .
Those were “ socialist revolutions ” not a priori but , rather , due to the course they took , to the global process in which they were embedded .
Thus , it only makes sense to speak of “ direct struggle for socialism ” if we construe it in the following way : the conquest of state power aiming at executing popular - democratic programmatic measures may come to be an integral part of the socialist transition , without there necessarily being separate intermediate phases .
The word “ necessarily ” is fundamental in this analysis : stageism is wrong because it supposes the need for self - contained intermediate phases ; yet this does not mean that these intermediate phases will neither come to exist , nor that they might look “ self - contained ” , as occurred during the Russian Revolution with the New Economic Program and is occurring now with Chinese “ market socialism ” , which , in the eyes of many , seems like a prolonged period of abandonment of the construction of socialism .
The expression “ may come to be ” is also fundamental , for it indicates that we are standing before a political problem that depends on the correlation of forces , the level of consciousness of the masses , the general direction of the process .
A political problem that may produce solutions that will depend , eventually , on the level of material development and the productive potential previously reached by a society .
For these reasons , it is imperative to combat two types of leftism : a ) on the one hand , that type of leftism that manifests itself in defence of an abstract socialism , delinked from partial anti-capitalist struggles ; and b ) on the other , that leftism that mistakes strict sense anti-capitalist measures with broad sense “ socialist ” measures .
This second type of leftism , very much present in Latin America today , mistakes the rhetorical and political radicalism of the processes , brought about mostly by the intransigence of the ruling classes with their economic and social radicalism , yet forgets that the overcoming of capitalism requires that there be capitalist development to be overcome .
To what we have said thus far another variable should be added : the neo-stageist line of the moderate left of Latin America , which broke the ties between democratic tasks and the struggle for socialism .
In some cases , because it is a left that has abandoned socialism .
In other cases , for being a left that , instead of standing up to and overcoming , prefers to capitulate to the correlation of forces .
Or still for being a left that , even when it maintains a genuinely socialist commitment , does so by building on a “ process strategy ” ( whose musical translation is in a verse of a song that is very popular in Brazil that reads : “ Deixa a vida me levar – May life lead me ” ) .
Hence we might say that there are at least three broad programmatic designs : the leftist , the neo-stageist and the popular - democratic .
The leftists fail to perceive the differences adequately ; the neo-stageists see a Chinese wall ; and the popular - democratic seek to organically bring together the struggle against neoliberalism and the struggle for socialism .
These differences cross each other , in different ways , when we shift from the programmatic discussion to the discussion on which way should be adopted , whether accumulation of forces or seizure of power .
Guerrilla warfare and the electoral path
The 1960s witnessed a radical increase in class struggle across Latin America , reflecting the ripening of the contradictions typical of the capitalist model of development predominant in the region : dependent and conservative .
This , within a context of US meddling in the region and of the conflict between “ camps ” .
At that moment , part of the Latin American left , stimulated by the Cuban experience and gathered around a slogan calling for the creation of “ many Vietnams ” , adopted the strategy of “ guerrilla warfare ” .
In some countries , guerrilla warfare had organic roots in the national situation .
In most cases , however , it did not .
With the exception of Nicaragua and of Cuba itself , in no other place in Latin America did guerrilla warfare end up in revolutionary victory .
In some cases , like El Salvador and Guatemala , the guerrilla acquired enough strength to reach peace accords that set the frameworks for the end of armed conflict ; but in most cases , the guerrilla forces were destroyed .
Today , in Latin America , Colombia is the only country where there are relevant groups that defend the tactical adequacy of a guerrilla strategy .
With the end of the guerrilla cycle , in the late 1970s and early 1980s , another strategy started to gain shape , one based on the combination of social struggles , electoral contests and the exercise of government at the national , sub-national and local levels .
This strategy has been crowned ( since 1998 with Hugo Chávez and up to now , 2009 , with Funes ) , by a wave of victories of leftist and progressive parties in elections for national government of several countries of Latin America .
This wave of electoral victories is the product of various circumstances , especially : a ) a relative carelessness of the United States with its pateo trasero ; b ) the harmful effects of neoliberalism , including on the right - wing parties ; c ) the accumulation of forces by the left , especially in combining social struggles and electoral struggle .
Currently there exists a new correlation of forces in the region which , besides propelling changes within each country , contains imperialist meddling .
This regional situation co-exists with two other variables of a worldwide nature : the strategic defensive struggle for socialism and capitalism ’s long and deep crisis .
This is the material basis that enables cooperation between Latin America ’s diverse leftist currents : the existence of a historical situation in which are interwoven the presence of the left in multiple governments of the region , the strategic defensive struggle for socialism and a long and deep crisis of capitalism .
These are the fundamental variables of the strategic situation common to all of Latin America that make it possible to at the same time demand a high level of cooperation between the different sectors of the Latin American left – without which it will not be possible to overcome the strategic defensive and avert the risks derived from the crisis of capitalism .
From the viewpoint of a socialist left , the central questions to solve are how to engage the existence of leftist and progressive governments as a fulcrum of the struggle for socialism and how to coordinate the different ongoing processes , in each country , in such a way that they each will reinforce each other .
Integration and strategy
Throughout the 20th century , the Latin American and Caribbean left faced two great hurdles : the strength of the adversaries at the national level and foreign meddling .
The latter was always present , especially in those moments when the left was trying to or actually did reach the central government and power .
When the local ruling classes were not able to contain the left , they resorted to the US marines .
Nowadays , a progressive and leftist environment contributes towards elections and re-elections , helps avert coups ( against Chávez and Evo Morales , for example ) and was fundamental in the condemnation of the invasion of Ecuador by Colombian troops .
Besides neutralising or at least minimising economic blockade policies , which played a critical role in the right - wing ’s strategy against the Allende government in Chile and is still affecting Cuba .
The existence of a favourable correlation of forces in the region creates better conditions for each national process to follow its own course .
This creates immense possibilities , unprecedented to a certain extent , for all the programs and strategies of the left .
Thus , the first task of the Latin American left is to preserve the continent ’s correlation of forces .
What happens is that , when leftist forces manage to reach the central government of a given country , they do so with a program based on the tripod of social equality , political democratisation and national sovereignty .
And the defence of national sovereignty is not just against “ imperialist metropolises ” but , rather , also involves solving conflicts between and among countries of the region .
These conflicts were not " invented " by the incumbent governments , usually being the heritage of previous periods , including the unequal and dependent development that occurred in the region .
In most cases , they will not be overcome in the short term : as they have structural causes , a solution will only be found in the long term , within the framework of an adequate process of regional integration .
Exacerbation of these regional conflicts would have , as by - products , the dissimulation of some rather more relevant contradictions with the imperialist metropolises .
Thereby , from a strategic point of view , we must make sure these conflicts do not become main contradictions , for , if that happens , the Latin American correlation of forces will be tipped in favour of foreign meddling .
It is well known that the progressive and leftist governments of the region follow the development and integration road , regardless of their adopting different strategies and different paces .
And it has already been said that a greater or smaller chance of success , at the national level , is tied to the existence of a Latin American correlation of forces that is favourable to leftist and progressive positions .
Hence , our strategic imbroglio may be summed us thus : how to harmonise multiple national strategies with the construction of a common continental strategy that preserves unity in diversity ?
The structural solution to regional conflicts supposes a reduction in inequality , not only within each country , but also across the economies of our subcontinent .
The institutional nature of the integration , both in multilateral and bilateral relations , must be attuned with this purpose .
Reducing inequality inside each country entails facing a “ cursed heritage ” and implementing deep social reforms .
Yet this does not suffice to eliminate existing disparities across economies , a goal that requires combining , in the long term , solidarity measures , direct exchange and market measures too .
Today there are three “ models ” of coexistence : the first is the decadent model that is subordinated to the United States , the second is the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America model ( ALBA — a nine - nation trading bloc initiated by Cuba and Venezuela ) and the third is the model of the Union of South American Nations ( UNASUR ) .
The ALBA model is rather worthy of merit , regardless of what we might think about its internal sustainability , the nature of the agreements signed , its actual coming into effect and its effects on recipient countries .
But no correlation of forces , institutional mechanisms and economic situation will allow the set of countries of the region to adopt the ALBA ’s solidarity principles and / or operate in a similar way as the Venezuelan government .
In essence , because it is not sustainable that capitalist countries will maintain a socialist foreign policy .
Hence , though every left - wing alternative should involve a solidarity component , the main dimension of the agreements in the current phase of the Latin American integration still has to be that of trade , economic and institutional agreements , one involving governments and state - owned and / or private enterprises of the UNASUR ( comprising therein the Bank of the South and the Defence Council ) .
This path contains several risks : a ) initiatives as the UNASUR entail sharing the table with political and ideological adversaries , who are still governing important countries of the region ; b ) the dynamics of the integration includes moments of greater political protagonism by the presidents , interspersed with periods wherein prevails the generally more bureaucratic spirit of each country ’s foreign relations office ; c ) trade and economic agreements always benefit , to a higher or lower degree , the interests of capital , at least while this mode of production is hegemonic in the countries involved ; d ) the enterprises involved generally seek their immediate profit first and secondarily the operation ’s strategic purpose , that is , development and integration ; e ) the survival of the UNASUR depends on the commitment of the region ’s main economies .
Conclusion : within the framework of a common strategic equation ( that of “ being in government as part of the struggle to be in power ” ) , we must operate distinct national policies , yet combined in a common continental strategy , whose pace will be set by the course and speed of the transformations in the larger countries , starting with Brazil .
Even if this makes the march even slower , it is best to keep the “ vanguard ” close to the troops ’ main body .
Which prompts us to discuss how to take advantage of the existence of leftist and progressive governments as a fulcrum in the struggle for socialism .
Recently elected governments and the struggle for socialism
If we exclude the hyper - moderates and the ultra- leftists , we may say that there are two basic positions among the Latin American socialists with regard to the existing progressive and leftist governments in the region : a ) there are those who view such governments merely as part of the process of accumulation of forces ; b ) and there are those who consider that these governments constitute a fundamental part of the accumulation of forces and also of the way to seize power .
Both positions are based , primarily , on observing the existing links between reform and revolution .
In the history of humanity there are periods of “ reformist ” evolution and periods of “ revolutionary ” evolution .
The difference between the former and the latter lies in three combined aspects : the content of the changes , the way such changes are imposed and the speed at which they occur .
But the fundamental difference is the nature of the changes .
“ Enclosures ” , the spreading of machines and the imperialist offensive on China , to cite examples of the 18th , 19th and 20th centuries , respectively , were revolutionary inasmuch as they altered social relations of production .
It was that , and not the speed or the violent form , which defined the revolutionary character of the processes cited .
Revolutionary processes do not appear out of the blue , just like that , by spontaneous generation .
Revolutions constitute a moment in the evolution of a society ’s contradictions , the moment in which these contradictions reach a point of disruption , of transformation into something different .
Said in a different way , revolutions occur when a society cannot evolve any longer in a “ reformist ” way .
There is , therefore , continuity , yet also disruption , between “ reformist ” moments and “ revolutionary ” moments in the evolution of a society .
A revolution would not exist without reforms ; yet a revolution exists precisely because reforms are no longer sufficient .
To this all , one should add that a decisive component in the transformation of reforms into a revolution lies in the combination between the disposition for fight of the dominated classes and the resistance of the dominant classes .
When those below fight strongly for changes and those at the top offer brutal resistance , the conditions are created to transform the struggle for reforms into a revolution .
Shifting from the historical to the strategic angle , it is obvious that electoral processes are not sufficient to initiate the construction of socialism , once they allow us to reach government , not power .
For this reason , in societies where the left managed to reach government via the electoral path , it is necessary to build a road to power that considers the fact that we are in government as an absolutely relevant variable of a revolutionary policy , as part of the historical circumstances , not as an “ unanticipated problem ” or an “ undesirable deviation ” .
Curiously , most of the left sees no theoretical difficulty in interlinking the strategy ’s reformist moment and the revolutionary moment , when what is at stake is a trade union struggle or the election of parliamentarians .
Yet it faces enormous difficulty when the question is exercising national government .
One of the reasons for this difficulty is that , in most of the cases in which it took over national governments electorally , the left was unable to accumulate forces toward socialism : it either abandoned its program , was defeated electorally or was toppled by coups and / or foreign interventions .
If socialist revolutions are rare events , even rarer seem to be socialist transitions from recently elected governments .
Nevertheless , the defeat of experiences , such as Popular Unity in Chile , as well as the defeat of a number of classic revolutionary attempts , does not allow concluding the unfeasibility of a strategic path ; it allows only concluding that the left , acting and taking certain options , was defeated under given historical conditions .
For those who think that electoral victories of the left always constitute the antechamber of defeat , it becomes necessary to answer two questions : a ) how to accumulate forces in a historical juncture in which “ electoral democracy ” prevails ; b ) how to confer legitimacy to the classical ways of seizing power in a juncture when the left is obtaining electoral victories .
Now for those who think that , in certain historical conditions , by adopting certain policies , it is possible to transform electoral victories that accumulate forces toward socialism , it is necessary to answer : a ) do such governments constitute a type of “ stop over ” on a route that will lead to a revolutionary showdown ?
b)
Do such governments constitute an integral part of a way to seize power that is different from insurrection and popular war ?
Those who defend this second position are called on to study another of the paradigmatic experiences of the Latin American left : Chile ’s Popular Unity government ( 1970 - 73 ) .
The hyper - moderate left considers that it has little to learn from the experience of the Popular Unity , since Popular Unity explicitly proposed to be a way to socialism .
At best , they use the Popular Unity experience to instil a reverential fear of the right , imperialism and the armed forces , as well as to “ prove ” that one should not “ strain ” the correlation of forces .
Nor does the ultra-radical left give much importance to the Popular Unity experience , which does not fit its preferred paradigms : insurrection , guerrilla warfare or , more recently , “ movementism ” .
At best , they use the Popular Unity experience to confirm their fears of the right , imperialism and the armed forces , as well as to “ prove ” that it is fruitless to try an electoral way to socialism .
Rigorously , hyper- moderates and ultra-leftists doubt the possibility of using electoral processes ( and the mandates stemming thereof ) as a fulcrum for the struggle toward socialism .
When we discuss the role of elected national governments in the struggle for socialism , we do so in a historical situation distinct from that in 1970 - 73 .
However , the fundamental questions to be studied and debated are not altered : a ) the composition and program of a historical - popular bloc ; b ) the combination between presence in the state apparatus and the construction of a counter - power , especially in the case of the armed forces ; c ) how to deal with the attitude of the dominant classes which , in face of threats to their property and power , break legality and push the process to situations of disruption ; d ) the greater or lesser maturity of actually existing capitalism in each concrete social formation and the ensuing possibility of implementing socialist measures .
The big novelty , one which affects the terms of the equation summed up above , is the creation , between 1998 and 2008 , of a correlation of forces in Latin America that allows curbing foreign meddling .
As long as this situation persists , it will be possible to speculate , theoretically and practically , on a way to seize power that , though revolutionary , is different from the insurrection and the popular war .

Last week , we benchmarked Firefox 3.6 and proved it ’s 1/4 Times faster than 3.5.3 .
The upcoming Firefox has one unique feature that we have n’t seen in any of the browsers , yet .
It can rotate / tilt based on accelerometer put in your laptop , similar to the one seen in the iPhone .
But why would you want it ?
Firefox 3.6 can recognize your screen orientation and adapt accordingly is awesome and signifies that we ’ll see more and more accelerometer - equipped lappies in the future .
Not convinced ?
Read on
It will fuel the fire to Apple Tablet rumors .
Why ?
Because you can’t really think about using this feature and finding it too useful on a regular laptop .
It ’s much easier to imagine it on a keyboard - less , thin , compact device which you can easily turn into a vertical position .
Apple Tablet PCs will be available in Two Models – 6 ″ and 10 ″
It ’s good to see that Firefox is leading the innovation , one step ahead of other browsers .
Though 3.6 intends to be about bug fixes and stability , it does come out with some useful features : install plugins without restart , javascript , CSS performance improvements , etc .
Check out the video for demonstration of this new feature : Rotation

Elliott Madison arrested by FBI and charged with using social networking site to help demonstrators evade Pittsburgh police
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
A New York - based anarchist has been arrested by the FBI and charged with hindering prosecution after he allegedly used the social networking site Twitter to help protesters at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh evade the police .
Elliot Madison , 41 , from Queens , had his home raided and was put on $ 30,000 ( £ 19,000 ) bail after he and Michael Wallschlaeger , 46 , were tracked to the Carefree Inn motel in Pittsburgh during the summit on 24 and 25 September .
The pair were found sitting in front of a bank of laptops and emergency frequency radio scanners .
They were wearing headphones and microphones and had many maps and contact numbers in the room .
Official police documents allege the two men used Twitter messages to contact protesters at the summit " and to inform the protesters and groups of the movements and actions of law enforcement " .
In all , almost 200 protesters were arrested during the two - day summit , which brought world leaders to Pittsburgh to discuss the global economic meltdown and other matters of common financial interest .
About 5,000 protesters were estimated to have taken part in demonstrations in the city .
Twitter has rapidly established itself as an important tool in the armoury of protest groups and demonstrators .
During the summit , the police openly monitored Twitter to listen in to the protesters ' communications .
The FBI said that as well as the computers and radio scanning equipment discovered at the motel , they also confiscated from Madison 's home 11 gas masks , five pairs of goggles and test tubes and beakers .
They said they also took away anarchist books and pictures of Marx and Lenin .
Madison is a social worker with a Manhattan - based programme attached to a psychiatric hospital .
He is said to be a member of the People 's Law Collective , a voluntary group that advises protesters on legal issues arising from actions .
Wallschlaeger produces a talk show on radio called This Week in Radical History .
In a revealing interview , Johnny Marr and The Cribs discuss what went wrong with indie , why LA destroys creative thought , the curse of the lad , and how The Smiths never had an afrobeat influence
It 's not exactly hard to have your suspicions about Johnny Marr joining The Cribs .
On the surface , a midlife crisis to go with his dyed black hair , the equivalent of buying a motorbike and screaming off into the blueyonder with a dollybird riding pinion .
And for The Cribs , a chance to bring in some credibility and give their fourth album a peppy boost .
But you only have to look at Jeffrey Lewis ' comic on the history of The Cribs to know that such preconceptions are way wide of the mark .
Then again , preconceptions have blighted The Cribs ever since they emerged alongside the start of this decade .
I must admit I had them pegged as yet another skifflin ' band of indie urchins , the North 's answer to the Libertines .
But there 's a fierce intelligence to their lyrics , a subversiveness to their behaviour , that 's starting to increasingly come to the fore .
Sitting outside the offices of their label Wichita , Johnny Marr tucks into spaghetti , Gary and Ryan Jarman share a plate of nachos and brother Ross dines on a haloumi burger as they set the record straight .
So Gary and Johnny Marr , you met at a barbeque in Portland .
Are you sure you were n’t just a pair of expats bemoaning the lack of English mustard ?
Gary J :
We did go out for afternoon tea a few times , which seems quite quaint but we got on really well from the start .
J Marr :
We were n't talking about things we missed about England because we were happy to be there .
Our friends are there and we feel pretty much at home there , we would n't be there otherwise .
I do n't think we act like ex pats .
Gary J :
It 's nice to have an English friend though , someone who . . . as much as I fit in there , I do feel that some things get lost , and some parts of American culture I do n't necessarily assimilate to well .
Perhaps having a countryman there stops you becoming a little Englander ?
J Marr :
That 's true
Gary J : I 've never felt isolated .
You do n't want to become a cliche , though I found myself going to the English pub a lot .
J Marr : What Gary did n't realise was that all these musicians were really excited about him being there because they really like The Cribs .
Clued up American musicians are very impressed when there 's a British band .
The real cliche , that I saw in my earlier years , was when British musicians would go and live in LA and start looking , acting and behaving differently , even down to their choice of equipment or instruments or their clothes .
They started , intentionally or otherwise , being American .
What they missed is that clued up people in America do n't want them to do that .
Without being too nationalistic about it , it made me realise the cool things about being in a British band .
British musicians and actors do get that awful English - meets - LA accent
Gary K :
As far as being influenced by LA , that 's the death of your creativity .
That 's a by - product rather than the incentive
J Marr : I 've resisted being there so many times , it 's been on the cards and I 've fought it tooth and nail .
There were some ideas about The Smiths moving there in the mid-80s , I went over and I was n't having it .
I knew it would be as Gary described , I did n't think there 'd be any good ideas there .
I 've had a couple of friends there sometimes , but I never felt I could write anything half decent there .
I wrote one song there years ago , but that was it .
Morrissey lived there . . .
J Marr : [ sharp ]
I can't speak for him , I 'm just saying for myself .
Ryan , you 've been very critical of how indie has evolved , though of course it 's actually done the opposite if one considers Landfill Indie .
When you look at The Smiths you can hear influences from Afrobeat to rock …
Gary J : Doo-wop , girl groups . . .
J Marr : [ The Afrobeat influence on The Smiths ] was by accident .
Never deliberate .
I only found out about that because people said the guitar sounded that way .
It was around Rough Trade so I was able to investigate it .
But the influences that we share are , as Gary was saying , girl groups and post punk contemporaries of mine .
Without a doubt , what was in the air when we first signed to Rough Trade has a real connection to the Cribs when I first joined the band ; Subway Sect or Orange Juice .
That DIY ethic .
The Cribs could easily have been on Rough Trade , the old Rough Trade .
Ryan , do you think the problem with ‘ indie ’ recently is that groups have limited their influences ?
Ryan J : Scenes like this get created for the more commercial networks , and only last for 12 to 18 months before everyone 's sick of it .
Lately it seemed like Britpop in the 90s when it was definitely a very commercial movement , and unabashedly so .
The only reason I ever commented on it in the first place was because we got lumped in on it .
We just wanted to make sure that people knew we were n't part of it , we have different influences and different objectives .
Gary J :
We existed at the same time in the same country as a lot of bands we had no affinity with .
To be lumped in with that was really galling , bands on their first record , these kids who were just chancers . . . we were waiting for that ship to sink , we were never afraid .
And regardless of the fact that we 're now wallowing in this pop hell , we 're not scared of it .
It 's not a sour bake , but it 's nice there 's a distinction between mainstream pop and bands like ourselves .
Do you think that you 're more indie in the old fashioned definition ?
Ryan J : It 's just a case of being your own boss .
I ca n’t imagine a situation where for the sake of convenience , or being able to indulge yourself by giving the control to someone else .
I think anyone in a band or anyone who has any kind of creative output should try and keep it that way .
It 's fun for us too , you get to expose other bands by taking them on tour , or different artists with your sleeves , I would n't ever swap that for having a big team so I 've got more time to sit around and drink beer and watch TV .
I got in a band to get out and do something .
Was that something you found appealing when you joined , Johnny ?
J Marr :
The people that I 'd been close to , and joined seriously , have all controlled all the aspects of what they 're doing .
So say in The The , Matt Johnson oversaw every aspect of his videos , and the time was known for that .
He micromanaged his own career , and paid the price for it sometimes .
I 'm not interested in . . . let me put it this way , I could n't be involved on a day - to - day basis with people who left their artwork decisions to the A&R man , or did n't care about the support acts , and I think there are a lot of groups around are like that .
There 's no compromise with the way that The Cribs go about things , and I think the things that inspire them are very humble and down to earth , both in bands and labels .
I doubt however successful The Cribs may or may not get that it 'll have any bearing on the way that they go about their business , you know what I mean ?
An obvious example - when we came to write , it was down to me to choose a place to work , so I chose a pretty fucking cold rehearsal room in Stockport , rather than my studio in Manchester , because I thought my place might be too distracting .
I did n't necessarily want to write there .
Some people given that choice would be going ' what are we doing lugging our gear up these stairs into this rehearsal room ' .
We got on with it .
We do n't have to stay in stupidly luxurious hotels , because it does n't feel very cool .
For years and years coming to London on my own , or travelling around America I 'd just stay in some cool area .
I 've done that thing where you get close to death by luxury .
I do n't want to be churlish or be ungrateful , but it 's not very creative .
Gary J :
We still tour in the same way as we started out .
We 've got a nice van which has got a microwave , and it seems kind of fancy for a van .
I do n't need a bus ; what would I need a bus for ?
Ryan J : I heard about a band recently , I 'm not going to say any names , who spent 42 grand on a private jet just to do an interview .
It 's disgusting , it 's more than most people 's wage .
It ’d pay for a few albums too
Gary J :
You could even say ' I really like Shrag from Brighton , I 'm going to put them in a studio for a month to release a really great album and release it myself ' .
And you 'd have loads of money left .
J Marr :
That almost decadence has to have an effect on how you play , and what you produce .
For me , the pay - off for being in a band , and what I 'm after , is in the riffs .
There 's a thing that means more to me than fucking lobster on room service , and if you mess with that you deserve everything you get .
You want to stay sharp , and come up with good riffs , and marry it with people who come up with good lyrics .
And that 's something that comes more in more in focus as I go along .
That 's what I look forward to .
It might sound a little abstract but if anything gets in the way of that , then I will be miserable .
How about the Mark E Smith idea : keep musicians on a tiny wage and only release music of worth , as vetted by a central body ?
J Marr : Let 's have it right .
There 's . . .
Ryan J : It 's a little bit dogmatic . . .
J Marr : Yes , thank you Ryan .
Even criticising people can become your persona , being ' I 'm so purist ' , that can be a pose .
How does this affect the political side to your lyrics ?
Do you think that musicians can often be dogmatic in the way they approach politics ?
Ryan J : I just like to think that our values come , our personal politics , not soapbox politics .
I do n't think it 's a contrived thing , it 's not preconceived to write political lyrics , but we only ever sing about what we care about , and that 's our personal politics .
J Marr :
The band never talk about party politics or politicians , but as individuals they just have this idea of conscience in lifestyle .
Ryan J : I hope that our values come out in our music and interviews
Gary J : It 's not a self - righteous thing
It 's these people who shout the loudest who are the problem ?
Ryan J : Johnny will always say ' the knobheads shout the loudest ' , and it 's totally true .
I used to resent the fact that people saw the band as outspoken , and we never were .
We just wanted to be left out of stuff , and left away from the things that we were n't interested in .
When the last record came out we were sucked into a world that we were n't a part of .
J Marr : Also , one thing I noticed when I started doing interviews , and these aspects of the band cropped up that I had to learn about really quickly .
It became a reductive thing .
I 've hammered this metaphor into the ground , but I had this 3D idea born about The Cribs and their lyrics , and the music , and the way they sang , and then it became two - dimensional .
It was all about Ryan hurting himself , some political stuff , slagging off other bands , The Cribs as scamps sort of thing .
A third of my idea of the band that I was expecting to talk about was never brought up , and that was intelligence .
Like the cover of ‘ Martell ’ where Ryan 's looking into the camera and he's got blood on his face , it 's funny to me .
And the fact that the band collectively made that single cover , rather than something where they ’re looking really cool and tough , is funny .
And the fact that ‘ Men ’s Needs ’ , regardless of its chart position , was a hit .
And I was starting to get asked all these really lowbrow questions about them getting wrecked .
I think the humour was ignored .
But people missed the humour in The Smiths , surely ?
J Marr : I do n't think it was .
If you 're wearing a hearing aid on Top Of The Pops and singing about gender ; I 'm trying to avoid the word ' politics ' , because we were n't too dogmatic , but those elements were all laid out in The Smiths .
We had a picture of a naked man on the cover of the first single , and we had a picture of a half naked man on the cover of the first album .
I think it 's more subtle in The Cribs .
For all the subtleties in the lyrics , it 's more vaudevillian , music hall , and that music hall aspect is what I heard in songs like ‘ Martell ’ or ‘ Ignore the Ignorant ’ .
I see a song like ‘ Animal Like Me ’ to be a very deliberate Northernism , and that 's not an accidental title , and I was never asked about that .
Is it because you got tarnished with laddism ?
Gary J : Yes , especially being a Northern band .
Those people have my entire life been my nemesis , and it 's disgusted me we 've been lumped in with stuff like that .
It 's a differentiation between lad rock and punk rock .
Lad rock , which was Oasis bar - room straight uninspired music , becoming assimilated into some approximation of punk .
Being around that was so frustrating it made me not want to be in a band for a while , because the lines had become so blurred .
I always hated it , I was disgusted at it .
With Oasis gone , is laddism over ?
Gary J :
They ruined my life on a small level , and when I got in a band they ruined my life on a bigger level .
They somewhat debased what we were doing .
Surely they turn up to the gigs ?
Gary J :
On the last record we 'd play gigs and have them bellowing back ‘ Men 's Needs ’ .
The Smiths had it , and they were so anti laddism .
You had a hardcore lad fanbase .
J Marr : Yeah we did , because we got in the charts .
But it can be an opportunity .
Because that only happens because the band rock like fuck .
If a band play in a wet style , and very fey , those guys wo n't come back .
With The Smiths , for all our ideas of Oscar Wilde and afternoon tea , we could do that , we knew that we really took care of business .
No matter whether you 're an artist , a creative intellectual , if you want to see a rock band you 've got to rock like fuck , and that is n't being rockist .
The Cribs do that , and The Smiths did it , and that 's where it starts getting really interesting , when you marry those guts with brains .
To a certain kind of sensibility that 's a great opportunity .
I 'm super grateful that it 's touched my life .
Verizon Wireless today officially announced the Google Android 2.0 - powered Droid smartphone , the company 's first Android phone , with one unexpected feature : spoken turn - by - turn directions .
Verizon Wireless today officially announced the Google Android 2.0 - powered Droid smartphone , the company 's first Android phone .
The Droid will be available Nov. 6 for $ 199.99 with a two - year contract and $ 100 mail - in rebate .
As we reported previously , the Droid is a large , slim ( 0.5 - inch thick ) smartphone with a 3.7 - inch , 854 - by - 480 capacitive touch screen and a sliding keyboard .
It has a built - in 5 - megapixel camera , DVD - quality video recording , and Wi-Fi , and it makes calls on the Verizon Wireless network .
The Droid has a TI OMAP 3430 processor which can run at up to 600 - MHz , Motorola chief executive Sanjay Jha said in a press conference on Tuesday .
The processor changes speed based on the demands of running programs .
The OMAP 3430 is based on ARM's Cortex - A8 architecture , which is newer and faster than the ARM11 used in previous Android phones .
The Droid is also the first phone to come with Google Maps Navigation Beta , which offers free , spoken turn - by - turn driving directions based on the Google Maps engine .
As an Android 2.0 phone , the Droid automatically syncs with Microsoft Exchange and has an improved Web browser compared to other Android phones .
The browser supports HTML5 and double - tapping to zoom .
When asked if Verizon got early or exclusive access to Android 2.0 , John Stratton , Verizon 's chief marketing officer , was a bit coy .
" We gain a time - to - market advantage through close collaboration [ with Google ] , " he said .
Verizon intends to release more Droid - branded Android devices in the future , Stratton said .
" The partnership between Verizon and Google will be a multiyear partnership under the Droid franchise , " he said .
Motorola , for its part , will release at least 20 smartphones next year , Jha said .
While some of them , such as the Droid , wo n't have Motorola 's proprietary MOTOBLUR interface , most will , he said .
" We really like MOTOBLUR and we 'll support that in future devices as well , " Stratton said .
Verizon 's early publicity for the Droid set it against the iPhone , with TV ads proclaiming " iDon't " do various things in a familiar , Apple - like font .
" We have to demystify the notion that [ the iPhone is ] untouchable , " Stratton said .
" To give Apple some credit here , they 've revolutionized the industry . "
And it 's clear that the Droid , not the BlackBerry Storm 2 which is also launching today , is Verizon 's flagship phone for the holidays .
" The marketing campaign that will support the launch of the Droid will be the largest in our history .
We 're going to put significant energy behind this product , " Stratton said .

Gehard Demetz is a mystery artist , the only thing that we know about him is that he was born in 1972 , Italy , and that he currently lives in the mountains of Selva Gardena .
Maybe this is the only thing that matters when you set an eye on his absolutely marvelous wooden sculptures , since you forget everything you may have in your mind .
Why lie , this is not wood , this is the material of the dreams .
And dreams are the perfect place for dark surrealism to rise .
What are those lost children looking for ?
What ’s the story that they hide ?
They look at you and it seems that they are inviting you to torture them .
Or to pay for having tortured them in the past , as if they were the habitants of a forgotten orphanage where bad things were happening .

Their sad expressions come as a contrast to the almost porcelain aspect of the wood .
It seems that innocence was interrupted there and now it ’s time for justice , for the revenge of the good .
The missing wooden parts of the sculptures reveal the aching truth .
That life may be at moments superficial and seemingly happy - go - lucky , but nobody can hide from the past , nobody can escape his ghosts .
Gerald Demetz ’s sculptures leave you defenseless .
Addicted to darkness , you keep begging for more .

Gehard Demetz bares it all to Yatzer // 13 February 2010
click on the following image to read the exclusive interview @ Yatzer
The issue is an emotional one at Florida State because a final decision could erase as many as 14 victories from the record of the longtime football coach Bobby Bowden .
He is in a race with Penn State ’s Joe Paterno for the most victories by a major college football coach , and has come under fire this season for the team ’s 2 - 4 record .
Wetherell , who earlier this year announced plans to retire , played football for Florida State when Bowden was an assistant coach in the 1960s .
The transcript released Wednesday offered an unflattering portrait of Florida State ’s professors and administrators defending themselves before the Committee on Infractions .
Committee members asked many questions about what help the five dozen student - athletes received ; whether that assistance broke university and N.C.A.A. rules ; and how Florida State ’s administrators questioned athletes about the help they received .
Wetherell said the university was embarrassed by the cheating , but had learned from the incidents .
“ This is not something that we are proud of , and it is not necessarily our finest hour , ” he said , paraphrasing a famous quotation about Apollo 13 ’s failure to reach the moon .
The university ’s investigation was messy , Wetherell said .
Students who cooperated with the investigation were ultimately penalized more than those who were evasive or uncooperative .
Some students hired lawyers , while others answered questions alone .
“ We had the probability of the race card being played by some athletes , saying different students were getting different priorities , ” Wetherell said .
“ We had the gender card being played .
We had major sports versus minor sports , all involved in that process . ”
Yet Wetherell made clear that the student - athletes were not culpable , only the university .
He blamed a “ rogue tutor ” who made copies of a test in a “ contaminated course ” and gave some answers to students for the infractions , which Florida State reported to the N.C.A.A..
Brenda Monk , a learning specialist hired to work with athletes who had learning and physical disabilities , was accused of improperly helping students type , edit and write their papers .
Monk , who testified that some of those athletes had a second - grade reading level , was accused of committing academic fraud .
In one case , she was said to have let students use a study guide that had answers to exam questions for an online music course .
Monk has left the university and filed a defamation suit against Florida State .
Monk ’s lawyer , Brant Hargrove , said that the committee restricted his ability to adequately defend his client because he could not subpoena records .
During the investigation , “ we kind of had our hands tied behind our backs , because we have not been able to get at some of the issues that we ultimately would like to get at just because of the forum we are in , ” Hargrove said .
TORONTO ( Reuters ) -
The phone call on Christmas Eve 2007 was like all the others .
Gil Cornblum , a respected Toronto lawyer , told his law school buddy , an unemployed consultant named Stanko Grmovsek , that a corporate merger was about to take place -- and to start buying stock .
The old friends had turned a profit that way dozens of times already , using confidential information garnered on deals by Cornblum to invest in companies ahead of major market moving news like mergers and acquisitions .
The merger in question was hardly high - profile -- a U.S. manufacturer of construction equipment , Terex Corp , was buying ASV Inc , which designed and made track machines -- but it led the duo to their biggest take ever , a nearly US $ 1 million pay day .
It was also big enough to alert authorities to Grmovsek ’s and Cornblum ’s audacious 46 - deal , 14 - year insider trading scheme -- Canada ’s largest ever .
Over that span , they netted more than $ 9 million , according to Canada ’s securities regulator .
The scheme came to light less than two weeks after the biggest hedge fund insider trading case in history , involving the Galleon Group as well as executives at several blue chip U.S. firms .
The Canadian case may have brought in less lucre , but the details -- laid out in court documents and legal filings from the Ontario Securities Commission , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. District Court -- read like a paperback detective novel on white collar crime .
GUILTY
On Tuesday , Grmovsek , 40 , pleaded guilty to criminal charges ; one day earlier , Cornblum , his closest friend and best man at his wedding , jumped to his death from a Toronto highway bridge .
Both men had been cooperating with authorities in the U.S. and Canada .
The suicide came at the end of a long battle with depression , Cornblum ’s wife Marilyn told the Globe and Mail newspaper .
According to local media , he had unsuccessfully attempted suicide twice before during a months - long investigation involving law firm secrets and corporate mergers across the United States and Canada .
The pair hatched the scheme during Cornblum ’s ‘ articling year ’ at a Toronto law firm from 1994 to 1995 , U.S. prosecutors said .
During that year , Cornblum provided Grmovsek with information on at least two mergers involving Canadian companies .
By 1999 both men were able to bring in about C$ 600,000 each from a brokerage account in the Bahamas which they used to purchase homes in swank Toronto neighborhoods .
But after cashing in on more than 40 blockbuster deals involving companies with names like Staples , ING Groep , and Alcoa Inc , and lesser - known financings and resource restatements by small mining companies , authorities investigated .
The case is both stunning in its simplicity and comical in its complexity , with the men growing increasingly paranoid as the years went by .
Friends and associates describe the two , but especially Cornblum , as respected and highly intelligent .
“ I mean , who would have expected this ? ” said one person who knew Cornblum as a teenager in the late 1980s , describing him as a nice fellow who tended to keep to himself and was aloof to a degree .
“ He was a really bright guy , into the arts more than the sciences . ”
The first phase of the scheme took place from 1994 through 1998 .
Both men had graduated from Osgoode Hall School of Law at York University in Toronto .
Cornblum was working in New York as a young associate at Sullivan & Cromwell , a prestigious U.S. law firm involved in mergers and acquisitions .
Grmovsek , who quit law in 1997 and also did a short stint in film school , was an energetic partner .
He would make 4 a.m. wake - up calls to Cornblum to ensure the young lawyer was getting to his office in time to rifle through fax rooms and copy centers for details of impending mergers .
As one corporate lawyer among dozens , Cornblum gathered inside information not just from cases he was working on , but from other attorneys “ at lunch or in the hallways , ” by reading memos left outside offices and by accessing computer records “ often using passwords intended by use by the word processing department , ” U.S. prosecutors said .
He would then phone his friend Grmovsek with stock tips , and the two split profits down the middle .
“ Typically , it is very simple for someone ( to plot such a scheme ) , ” said Darryl Levitt , a lawyer with Macleod Dixon LLP in Toronto .
“ If you are involved in a transaction and you know that the target is going to be bought out for 30 percent more than what it is currently trading at , all you have to do is pick up the phone and call a friend and give them that information , so that they can buy shares , to the detriment of other shareholders . ”
HIGH ANXIETY
But half a decade into their partnership , the two were overcome by stress and took a five - year hiatus from their life of crime .
During that period , Cornblum changed law firms several times .
When the partnership resumed in 2004 , the two men became far more cautious in their approach , although their growing take -- and greed -- would eventually do them in .
Toward the end the scheme , when Cornblum was working in the Toronto office of Dorsey & Whitney , another U.S. law firm , investigators say he got nervous about using his office phone to call Grmovsek .
“ Beginning in 2006 , Cornblum began using pay phones to communicate with Grmovsek in an effort to conceal their contacts , ” the U.S. District Court documents said .
The two also used weekly lunch dates to exchange information and plan stock - trading strategies , since they were both again living in Toronto .
Grmovsek got increasingly creative in using trading accounts in the names of friends and family -- and even a neighbor -- to buy stock just before an acquisition was announced and sell it after the shares had jumped .
According to a statement of allegation by the Ontario Securities Commission , Grmovsek traded through brokerage accounts belonging to his parents , a sister and brother - in - law , his ex-wife , a friend and her spouse , and a former neighbor .
Authorities said the friends and family were not aware of the insider trading scheme , though some did pay Grmovsek a percentage of profits generated by the illegal trading .
One of the curiosities of the case is that Cornblum appears to have been caught at least in part because he was found to have been using his law firm ’s computers to look up information without billing clients for that time at work .
While it is not yet clear how authorities discovered the scheme , it appears that regulators became suspicious at the flow of trading just before some mergers were announced .
That led them to the common thread between the mergers : the law firm involved in negotiating the deal .
The law firm , Dorsey & Whitney , searched its computer records , among other things , to see who had accessed records about the suspicious cases .
In one instance , late on a Sunday night in February 2008 , Cornblum used his Dorsey computer to look at three different documents related to a merger transaction that he was not involved in as a lawyer .
“ According to Dorsey ’s internal records , Cornblum did not bill any time to clients on that date , ” one court filing notes .
Grmovsek faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison for the U.S. charges , according to the U.S. Attorney .
He is scheduled to be sentenced on November 23 .
Some predict his arrest will be followed by others in the not so distant future .
“ After the major Ponzi schemes , uncovering a lot more insider trading matters is certainly not surprising .
There is certainly going to be a lot more coming out of the woodwork , ” said Levitt .
Tom Tinkham , an attorney with Dorsey and Whitney , said the firm implemented one major change when it found out about Cornblum a year and a half ago : senior partners who maintain documents in the company ’s electronic document database are now required to make all files restricted and decide on which employees will be given access in each case .
He also said all lawyers at the firm were required to take -- and pass -- annual tests on ethics .
Asked if Cornblum passed those tests , Tinkham said : “ Yes , he did . ”

A few days ago I downloaded a video file ( . flv ) from a website .
I wanted to convert the video from .flv to .avi ( I know it ’s not a free format , but I needed to ) .
I searched over the Internet and found out about FFmpeg .
FFmpeg is a command line tool used to convert multimedia files between formats .
Not only it converts video files but it also converts audio files .
To make sure FFmpeg is already installed on your GNU / Linux distribution , open the package manager you use and search for ffmpeg .
Install it if it ’s not already installed .
I usually use the Konsole ( Kubuntu ’s Terminal ) , so I typed :
$ sudo apt - get install ffmpeg
Ok , now we have the program , but how does it work ?
To begin with , open up a terminal .
I understand that lots of people are afraid , bored or do n’t like using it , but once you get the hang of it , you can perform many useful tasks .
The generic syntax is :
$ ffmpeg [ [ infile options ] [ ` - i ’ infile ] ] … { [ outfile options ] outfile }…
You have to have in mind that options that precede the infile are applied to the the infile and options that are between the infile and outfile are applied to the outfile .
In my case , I had a .flv file and I wanted to convert it to .avi .
So the way to do it is :
$ ffmpeg - i infile.flv outfile.avi
Done !
Simple as that !
You will find the .avi file in the same folder !
Keep in mind that by default , FFmpeg tries to convert as losslessly as possible , attempting to keep the best quality for the output file .
It uses the same audio and video parameters for the outputs as the one specified for the inputs .
If you want to see what formats and codecs are available on your PC just type :
$ ffmpeg - formats
FFmpeg supports .3gp , .avi , .mp3 , .mp4 , .mvi , .rm , .mkv among many others .
Some video options that you might find useful are :
- b bitrate where bitrate is the video bitrate in bit /s .
The default is 200kb / s
-r fps where fps is the frame rate in Hz .
The default value is 25 Hz .
-s size where size is the frame size .
The default in FFmpeg is the same as the source .
The format is ‘ wxh ’. wxh is equal to 160 ×128 .
You can use both either wxh or 160X128 ( see video options link below for all sizes )
- aspect aspect where aspect is the aspect ratio with values 4:3 , 16:9 or 1.3333 or 1.7777 .
-vcodec codec where codec is the name of the video codec that you want the FFmpeg to use .
Some audio options that you might find useful :
- ar frequency where frequency is the audio sampling frequency .
The default value is 41000KH
z
- ab bitrate where bitrate is the audio bitrate in bit /s .
The default is 64k .
- acodec codec where codec is the name of the audio codec that you want the FFmpeg to use .
More details can be found here :
Following are some examples mentioned on ffmpeg documentation .
Example 1 :
ffmpeg - i input.avi -b 64 k output.avi
With the - b 64 k option we set the outfile bitrate to 64 kbit / s
Example 2 :
ffmpeg -r 1 - i input.m2v -r 24 output.avi
Using the -r 1 we force the frame rate of the input file ( valid for raw formats only ) to 1 fps and with the -r 24 we set the the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps .
Example 3 :
ffmpeg - i test.wav - acodec mp3 - ab 64 k test.mp3
In this exampe we can see the use of FFmpeg for audio files .
We convert a .wav file to .mp3 .
As said before using - acodec mp3 we force FFmpeg to use the mp3 audio codec to create the output file .
The - ab 64 k tells ffmpeg to use an audio bitrate of 64k .
Example 4 :
ffmpeg - i video.avi - ar 22050 - ab 32 -s 640×480 video.mp4
Using the - ar we set the audio sampling rate to 22050 Hz .
The - ab as i said sets the audio bitrate to 64 k and the -s sets the frame size to 640×480 .
Here instead of 640×480 we could have used vga like this :
ffmpeg - i video.avi - ar 22050 - ab 32 -s vga video.mp4
Remember to see the video options link for all available sizes .
Conclusion : With FFmpeg you can manipulate and convert video and audio files between a variety of formats , fast and easy , with just a simple command .
Remember not to hesitate to use the terminal !

real to me , damn it ! "
Dave Wills , the Crying Wrestling Fan " It 's still , damn it ! "
" Kayfabe " is a carny term thought to have originated from the Pig Latin for " be fake " , possibly originally by pronouncing it backward ( " kay - feeb " ) .
Professional Wrestling adopted the term as a reference to the standard Fourth Wall features of separating the audience from the action .
It is meant to convey the idea that , yes , pro wrestling is a genuine sport , and yes , this is how these people act in real life .
It is essentially Willing Suspension of Disbelief specifically for pro wrestling .

Back in the old days , though , kayfabe was much more ; it was pro wrestling 's real life Masquerade .
Wrestlers , promoters , and everybody else involved with the business alike resorted to any means necessary to guard the secret that wrestling was rigged , from wrestlers roughing up any reporters who dared ask , " It 's all fake , right ? " to ( alleged ) death threats towards anybody who threatened to expose the secret , through contacts with the Mafia and other organized crime .
Heels and faces were n't allowed to travel , eat , or be seen with their " enemies " in public , and changed in separate locker rooms .
Wrestlers lived their gimmicks 24/7 and those playing Wild Samoans or Foreign Wrestling Heels could not speak English in public if their characters did n't .
There are even rumors that some wrestlers would lie under oath in court to maintain the illusion , and some old - time heels tell stories about carrying guns for their own protection from those fans who took it just a bit too seriously .
To get an idea of just how important kayfabe was , it 's interesting to watch shoot interviews with old - time wrestlers filmed in the modern era .
Even decades later when everyone knows that wrestling is fake , they often start speaking as if various angles and feuds were real and tend to dance around actually saying that wrestling is staged if pressed ( Arn Anderson , now an onscreen personality for AEW , is notorious for this ) .

Naturally , there had always been skeptics that denied pro wrestling 's legitimacy from the beginning note A court case in the 1930s revealed the inner workings of pro wresting in the court transcripts and Shadow of the Thin Man cracked jokes about the pretense as early as 1941 , not to mention that The Flintstones had Fred Flinstone laugh at the idea that wrestling was real in their Pro Wrestling Episode ( first aired in 1963 ) , but fans widely started to figure out the truth in the ' 70s ( if indeed they ever really did n't know before — with any live TV audience there is a certain amount of kayfabe of a sort going on with them too ) , and once Vince McMahon 's World Wrestling Federation rose to prominence in the ' 80s , the secret was out for any but the most die - hard ( and thick - headed ) fans .
And even they finally got it in the '90s , when McMahon himself revealed it on Monday Night RAW .
McMahon was also forced to break kayfabe when he hosted a tribute broadcast to Chris Benoit after the wrestler was found dead with his family , which aired a few days after McMahon 's " character " was supposedly either Killed Off for Real or at least was to be out of commission for a while ; a day later , when the details of Benoit 's death became known ( that he had committed murder - suicide ) , McMahon further dissolved kayfabe in a follow - up broadcast in which he discussed the tragedy .
Other kayfabe - breaking incidents have occurred during live broadcasts , with the announcers outright referring to " wrestling angles " and " storylines " , perhaps most notably the off - camera accident that killed Owen Hart during a pay per view broadcast , forcing the announcers to explain what had happened .

Another aspect was legal : steroids .
McMahon had to explain that pro wrestling was entertainment and not a " sport " , and therefore avoid having real sports governing bodies from investigating .
( Not that he did n't have legal issues surrounding steroids . )
" Breaking kayfabe " , for a pro wrestler , is tantamount to " breaking character " for an actor .
Note that even in the 21st century , when pro wrestling is known to be staged , kayfabe is still a big deal ; most wrestling organizations expect wrestlers to maintain kayfabe at all times , and one ( Deep South Wrestling , one of WWE 's farm leagues ) levied substantial fines on its wrestlers for breaking kayfabe at public appearances , before it was shut down .
This has become more apparent now thanks to most wrestlers having an online presence , as they can now extend it beyond what is seen on camera , playing up their personas and engaging in icy and confrontational conversations with their opponents on the likes of Twitter .
Some people compare modern kayfabe to Penn & Teller 's tricks which seem to give away the magic 's " secret " , while actually setting you up for a different , more impressive effect .
Kayfabe can be heavily bent , if not outright broken , by a Worked Shoot .
As a side note , if you happen to know anybody who claims to have been a wrestling fan " back when it was real " , unless Willard Scott announces their birthday on The Today Show , they were taken in by kayfabe .
By all accounts , wrestling was completely show within 10 - 15 years after the turn of the 20th century .
This was necessary to compete with the emerging sport of boxing , which naturally lends itself to long , drama filled , multi-round fights , whereas a real wrestling match could last about ten exciting seconds , or two boring hours .
The late Gorilla Monsoon , one half of the best commentary duo of his era , had " KAYFABE " on his car 's license plate .
The night after the Exposed !
Secrets of Pro Wrestling special came out ( years after kayfabe was exposed in mainstream wrestling ) , Mick Foley was the only one to try to " restore " kayfabe by claiming " I did n't do so well , last week — but I was watching TV last night , and the Secrets of Pro Wrestling were revealed to me ! "
Although Foley was probably just taking the mickey ( pardon the pun ) out of the ridiculous show .
Conversely , some fans would prefer not to see " real " fighting , and prefer kayfabe .
The arguments include :
If it was real , it would be too disgusting to watch , like boxing or Joe Theisman 's Squick moment on Monday Night Football .
Real fights tend to be very short , as demonstrated by the UFC or MMA in general .
Conversely , real fights can bore viewers by going on for the full length of time , ending with a ( sometimes controversial ) judges ' decision .
Since pro wrestling is scripted , boring matches should logically be less common , as no wrestler wants to bore his audience .
Real fights tend to be visually boring .
Wrestling is more theatrical , and requires different skills ( including gymnastics and even a little ballet ) .
As demonstrated in the NFL , when the injuries are real , the quality of the games slowly degrades over the course of the season until it is not much higher than college games ' .
Kayfabe allows for ( relatively ) minimal injuries over a long period of time - or rather , allows professional wrestlers methods for working around the injuries they do sustain in order to keep the matches exciting .
Unlike genuine sports , wrestling involves an underlying morality of good vs. evil ( or face vs. heel ) which has been a part of literature for centuries .
These are powerful and primordial tropes , and most people find them deeply satisfying .
In fact , tropes in general seep in much more easily and clearly in a fictional sport , theoretically leading to more interesting storylines .
This is parodied in an episode of South Park where the kids think wrestling is only about the stories ( " W.T.F . " ) .
Wrestling provides lots of good ol ' fashioned , unabashed Narm Charm .
To put it another way , wrestling fans who treat the sport as if what we see on TV is real are not so different than people who talk about soap opera characters like they are real people .
All fictional works require some suspense of disbelief to get the audience really connected .
The only real difference between that and kayfabe is that professional wrestling extends that fiction beyond the edge of the camera frame .
The radio industry has taken this trope in a different direction , with the presenters occasionally being different versions of their real - life selves .
At the core , we all know that it 's scripted , but knowing that does n't stop you enjoying it .
We know that movies and TV shows are " fake " too , but a well told story , particularly one with lots of action , is well received regardless .

Borden admires the way the Chinese magician goes to such an extreme that he " lives " his performance at home , especially since that 's what he himself does with his twin brother .

In their early days , Fozzy did the same .
At the very beginning ( back when the band was called Fozzy Osbourne ) , Chris Jericho used the name Moongoose McQueen for his singer persona , and " McQueen " and Jericho would talk each other up but deny being the same person .
Radio
I 'm Sorry I Have n't a Clue : No-one involved will ever openly acknowledge that Samantha does n't exist ( Humph once explained to a fan that Samantha was real , but Colin Sell was n't , and this was happily accepted ) , there is no laser - display board and , above all , that Mornington Crescent is anything other than a well - known game with a storied history and clearly defined rules .
Two episodes of ISIHAC are recorded in a row .
However the chair and teams will act as if the second episode is a week after the first as this is how it sounds to the radio audience .
Similarly , panelists on The Unbelievable Truth have called back to jokes or topics from ' an earlier recording ' or ' some time ago ' instead of half an hour earlier that afternoon .
Long - time fans of Bubba The Love Sponge have figured out " Ned " does n't actually exist , but a voice done by one of the show 's crew ( and is played by his father at live appearances ) .
Officially , they insist he 's real , however .
Adam Carolla got his start in radio calling into The Kevin and Beane Show playing Mr. Birchum , a surly and jaded high school wood shop teacher .
Although many fans assumed he must be a character , his genuine knowledge of carpentry kept others thinking he was a real person .
At public events he would acknowledge it was just a character if people asked .
That Gosh Darn Hippie
Show makes frequent use of scripted phone conversations Played for Laughs between DJ Hippie and various " callers " , though DJ Hippie always behaves as if they were real and their scripted nature is never acknowledged on - air .
Downplayed , but Bauer Media 's Hits Radio network treats Greigsy 's mid-morning show 10 am - 2 pm which goes out on five radio stations across Scotland as if it were local to the stations .
On the show , he presents it as if it were local to the station , with pre-recorded local inserts to try and attempt to convince the listener it 's local - e.g .
" This is Greigsy , on 97.3 Forth One , playing All The Biggest Hits for your Monday morning .
Coming up next we 've got XYZ and news for Edinburgh . "
However , they can't say they 're broadcasting from the city , due to Ofcom rules .
The characters portrayed in The Jack Benny Program mostly used their real names ( Eddie Anderson as Rochester being an exception , and Sadie Marks would eventually adopt Mary Livingstone as her actual name ) , and their personas were extremely well known and usually who they " played " in everything , i.e .
Jack was always a cheapskate , Phil always a boozer , etc .
It was so convincing that the show got letters from a real lawyer who thought Rochester actually was Benny 's mistreated valet and offered to represent him , and Benny had to break the fourth wall and admit that the real Anderson was a wealthy man with his own mansion and servants .
On another occasion , the performers briefly dropped character to comically complain about how hard it was to play so stupid / drunk / fat / cheap all the time .
In effect , all pre-recorded radio presented " as live " ( recorded in Real Time earlier in the week , but aired on another day and presented to the listener via radio station sites and presented as if it were an actual , live show ) with occasional split links referencing local news and in - jokes / references is a form of this , but downplayed .
Chris Tarrant had a networked show on Real Radio network in England , Wales and Scotland from 2007 to 2010 which was pre-recorded , but to the average listener sounded live and local .
Sports
The Washington Generals were the ultimate jobbers to the Harlem Globetrotters as the constant losers in a fake league that focuses on showmanship rather than actual basketball .
In the early days of the exhibition matches , they would even play as several different teams to create the illusion of a whole league rather than just two teams , much like old - school jobbers , who would work as several characters to keep rosters and costs down .
In 2015 , the Generals folded when the Trotters ended their long - term contract to serve as their foils .
Two years later , the Trotters bought the trademarks of the Generals and relaunched them as a separate barnstorming team that no longer plays the Trotters .
This practice was used in Roller Derby predominantly during the TV era ( the 1950s - 70s ) .
Modern Roller Derby uses aspects of kayfabe only to the extent that skaters may adopt slightly different on - track personalities ; the action is entirely unstaged .
note
In many cases , roller derby is an actual competition without a predetermined ( read : rigged ) outcome , instead of just being " sports entertainment " ( examples of the latter include " Rollergames " , and " Rollerjam " ) .
It is not uncommon for athletes in " real " sports to put on a sort - of kayfabe of their own , creating feuds or rivalries that may well have no place in reality but which serve to help build a brand and keep fans engaged between games .
It also is n't uncommon for players to make a show of being best buddies on the field and even in media interviews , only to be distant - at - best when the cameras are n't rolling .
During the 1998 home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa , they gave off the image of being close friends united in a race for history when McGwire broke the home run record , Sosa came and gave him a big hug .
Years later they both admitted that they never really talked to each other at all outside of happenstance meetings and pre-arranged interviews .

Larry the Cable Guy got his start this way , as comedian Daniel Whitney would call into various radio shows across the country playing Larry .
The character took off , and most never knew he was playing a character , and even now most assume Daniel is really Larry .

Pokémon Sun and Moon : Incineroar , the final evolution of the Alolan Fire starter , Litten .
It 's a Dark - Type , based on a professional Heel wrestler and fights extremely dirty in battle , even attacking the opponents ' trainer .
However , true to its pro wrestler theme , it 's not deliberately malicious and is all an act .
Out of battle , it maintains its act , but actually enjoys the admiration it gets , especially from children .
Professor Burnet in the same game may well be in on the act whenever she says the Masked Royal and her husband Kukui are n't the same person .
Webcomics
In Ménage à 3 , DiDi has her first experience with professional wrestling and , being The Ditz , takes it completely seriously .
Her behaviour after the match confused the hell out of Roxie , the wrestler she had befriended earlier , until Roxie realized that DiDi was legitimately angry at her for the Face Heel Turn she pulled in the ring .
She tried to run with it and play up her character ... for all of 10 seconds until DiDi started crying , then she decided that she had to come clean or risk getting fired .
'' Mr. Boop : Part of the appeal of the comic is Alec Robbins constant public commitment to the idea that the comic is based on his " actual real life " being married to Betty Boop .

Western Animation
South Park :
In one episode the kids take a field trip to a pioneer - themed living museum set in 1864 , where the actors are under no circumstances allowed to break character until the second their work day ends at 5:00 , even if they are held at gunpoint by a group of robbers demanding the code to the mine shaft tunnel so they can use it to escape from the police ( a door locked by a keypad does n't exist in 1864 , you see ) .
It took Stan getting into a character of his own and rephrasing the question in a way the actors were allowed to answer it to defuse the situation .
Another episode featured actual professional wrestling and a real wrestler getting angry that they were getting more publicity .
He eventually outdoes them when people think he 's creating his own narrative .
Disney has a policy of not explicitly publicizing the actors behind Mickey and the Gang , so as to not shatter the illusion of the characters .
It 's not that they pretend they do n't exist , but when they are brought up by the company , it 's at events and in media meant for animation and Disney enthusiasts .
One segment in Animaniacs featured the titular Warner Brothers ( and Sister ) attending a wrestling match with Dr. Scratchansniff , who is an avid wrestling fan .
After Warners
Troll him by continually remaining skeptical and heckling him about the authenticity of wrestling ( or lack thereof ) , the fed - up doctor shouts , " It's ! Not ! FAKE ! " Unfortunately for the good doctor , the wrestlers in the ring only hear the last part of that exclamation , which results in Scratchansniff getting a firsthand look at how " fake " it is after all .
Which just goes to show you that yes , Kayfabe exists , but the wrestlers are still 300 lb masses of muscle and adrenaline who can , must , and will beat the tar out of anyone who breaks the illusion , intentionally or not .

Polish PM would n't take U.S. calls
Polish Prime Minister Donald
Tusk confirmed today that he declined last night to take a call from the U.S. informing him of the decision to scrap planned missile - defense bases in his country .
Two U.S. - based sources close to the Polish government said Thursday that Tusk also rejected a call from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton — on the grounds that , as the head of the government , he should speak to the president .
" Hillary called — and the reason he turned it down was because of protocol , " said a source .
Questions about the exchanges surfaced in the Polish press after Obama reached the Czech prime minister late last night to warn of the policy change , but did not speak to the Pole until this morning .
And the static offers a glimpse at the distress beneath the diplomatic facade being offered by Eastern European leaders .
Polish Radio reports today that Tusk confirmed an earlier press report that he had n't taken Obama 's call but denied it was due to " technical difficulties . "
Tusk said he declined to speak with President Obama during the night because he wanted to “ properly prepare for the discussion . "
A Polish Embassy spokesman noted that Tusk ultimately spoke to Obama , while Clinton spoke to the country 's foreign minister .
A State Department spokesman would n't comment on the details of the episode ( updated ) .
The Polish preparation may have paid off however :
They are reportedly angling for an American commitment of Patriot missile systems based in Poland , which Poles see , like the larger missile - defense bases , as a partial guarantee against Russian agression ( despite American denials that the defenses are aimed at Russia ) .
" I would not describe what is going on today as a defeat for Poland , " Tusk told reporters in Warsaw , according to the AP , saying Obama had signaled that " Poland has a chance to win an exclusive position " in the new system .

Tokyo's trains are notoriously crowded at rush hour
Tokyo police have begun a week - long crackdown against the twice - daily scourge of gropers on commuter trains .
Undercover teams have been deployed on some lines in a bid to catch molesters in the act on crowded trains .
Last year more than 6,000 people were arrested on suspicion of groping or taking unsolicited photographs .
According to one survey , nearly two - thirds of young women have been groped on public transport .
Some train lines have introduced women - only carriages .
Website ' recommendations '
Tokyo police have begun what is being described as a " groping prevention week " .
There are conspicuous extra police patrols in stations handing out leaflets , and undercover teams have been deployed on trains to try to catch men in the act .
Gropers can be imprisoned for up to seven years in Japan .
Local reports say the police are particularly concerned that gropers are using the internet to co-ordinate their activities and form gangs .
Several suspects arrested in recent months are said to have told officers they had targeted particular train lines because of recommendations they had read on websites .
A man set off on a shooting spree killing an anti-abortion protester outside a high school because he did n't like the activist holding a sign with graphic images of a foetus in front of students .
The gunman drove next to a gravel pit business and shot and killed the owner , who apparently also upset him , police said .
Authorities believe they stopped a third killing by catching up with the gunman before he could kill again .
" The defendant had ill will toward these three individuals - not for the same reason necessarily , but had a grudge , " said Shiawassee County , Michigan , Prosecutor Randy Colbry .
Police charged Harlan James Drake , 33 , with first - degree murder .
The shootings started around 7.20 am across the street at Owosso High School , as parents dropped off students before class .
James Pouillon , a well - known activist in the town , was standing across the street with a sign that pictured a chubby - cheeked baby with the word " Life " on one side and an image of an aborted fetus with the word " abortion " on the other .
Mr Pouillon , known as " the sign man " for his years of in - your - face protests against abortion , was a polarising figure in Owosso .
" His dedication to his cause was unprecedented , " said Tony Young , who tangled with Mr Pouillon during protests outside his car dealership .
The county 's chief assistant prosecutor , Sara Edwards , said there did n't appear to be a " triggering event " but Mr Pouillon 's presence outside the school seemed to aggravate Drake .
It was " the fact that he was outside the high school with his signs in front of children going to school , " she said .
Drake then drove seven miles and down a dead - end country road to Fuoss Gravel Co and killed Mike Fuoss , 61 , who owned the gravel business , said Shiawassee County Sheriff George Braidwood .
The shootings come a little more than three months after the killing of late - term abortion provider George Tiller at his Kansas church .
A man with a long history of anti-abortion views , Scott Roeder , has pleaded not guilty to the murder .

Another week , another $ 3 billion acquisition by Cisco Systems .
On Tuesday , Cisco announced that it would pay $ 35 a share , or $ 2.9 billion , for Starent Networks , which makes products that help wireless telecommunications companies ship large volumes of data to phones and computing devices .
The deal represents about a 20 percent premium over Starent ’s closing price on Monday of $ 29.03 a share .
After the announcement , Starent ’s shares rose $ 4.88 , or almost 17 percent , to close at $ 33.91 on Tuesday .
For Cisco , the acquisition extends its bet that consumers and workers will keeping pulling down ever larger amounts of data onto smartphones and laptops over wireless networks .
Starent ’s hardware and software products make it possible to create and manage high - speed data services , and the company counts carriers like Verizon Wireless , Sprint Nextel , Vodafone Group and China Telecom as customers .
“ We have had a huge explosion in data traffic , ” said Ned Hooper , Cisco ’s chief strategy officer .
“ We expect the market for mobile data to double every year through 2013 . ”

Writing comedy involves many subtleties that likely go unappreciated by casual audiences .
The writer is constantly making seemingly minor word choices that could , in fact , make or break the flow of a joke .
Do you call it " poo " , " poop " , " poopoo " , " doodoo " , " dookie " or even " doots " ?
Take the comedic shortcut of throwing in profanity ?
For this strip it amused me to imagine a " poop " as one of many distinct entities .

I have to admit , when my blogger buddy Greg from MobileCrunch told me he had an iPhone game that was based on a single button that lights up every now and again , I was skeptical .
But , I figured I owed it to him to check out the game – hell , it ’s free .
But , I ’m glad I did .
Button for iPhone is expectedly simple , but that ’s also what makes it a great little game .
I actually downloaded the game and gave it a shot .
Button is n’t like most other games that require your full attention .
It ’s actually intended to be a little mental distraction that you can play while doing other tasks – blogging , for instance .
“ Whether the player is building a spreadsheet or typing their next blog post , Button helps to keep them focused by giving their brain that little tickle it needs every once in a while .
Simply by playing a game , you might be able to keep your mind on your work and your eyes off the ceiling . ”
The button lights up and you tap it .
Everytime you hit the button , you collect BTUs ( Button Thermal Units ) .
BTUs are like points .
Simple .
You get to play against Button players around the world in real - time .
And , you can band together in groups with other Button players around the world .
Mostly , the game is cool because it ’s actually a helpful distraction .
Like I said , it ’s a fun little distraction .
It might make you more productive , or it might turn you into a degenerate Button addict .
Either way , it ’s free on the AppStore .

One of the chief rules of writing is " Show , do n't tell " — the belief that you can get a point across better by illustrating it than by talking about it .
Yet every time ESPN wants to celebrate one of its anniversaries , the cable sports giant spends a whole lot more time telling you of its awesomeness than showing it to you .
And that , in turn makes the ESPN empire seem not so much awesome as obnoxious .
That 's why " 30 for 30 , " the primary component of ESPN 's 30th anniversary festivities , is so remarkable — both surprising and great .
Though the project — a series of 30 documentaries covering sports stories big and small from the last three decades — celebrates ESPN 's legacy by limiting itself to the channel 's lifespan , it does n't spend any time telling you why ESPN is so wonderful .
Instead , it shows you , by virtue of the directors the project was able to attract , and the quality and sweep of the films they made with minimal executive interference .
This is ESPN using its power for good instead of evil , for a celebration of sports rather than a celebration of itself .
Conceived in part by popular ESPN.com columnist Bill Simmons ( you can read my interview with Simmons here ) , " 30 for 30 " will , over the course of the next year or so , unveil films from some of the biggest names in both documentary and fiction filmmaking , including Steve James ( " Hoop Dreams " ) , Albert Maysles ( " Grey Gardens " ) , and Barbara Kopple ( " Harlan County , USA " ) from the traditional docu world , and Barry Levinson ( " Rain Man " ) , Ron Shelton ( " Bull Durham " ) and John Singleton ( " Boyz N the Hood " ) crossing over from scripted features .
( There are also films from celebs - turned - directors like Ice Cube and Phoenix Suns point guard Steve Nash . )
HBO Sports has long been the standard - bearer for sports documentaries , and while they do excellent work , there 's a predictable house style for all the films , down to the use of actor Liev Schreiber as narrator .
The " 30 for 30 " films share an umbrella title and a general era , but beyond that , they reflect the individual personalities of their directors .
The series opens with " Kings Ransom , " Peter Berg 's look at the trade of hockey great Wayne Gretzky from the Edmonton Oilers ( playing in a small but passionate market reflecting the game 's Canadian roots ) to the Los Angeles Kings ( representing the NHL's expansion into semi- interested warm weather cities ) .
Like Berg 's fiction films ( " Friday Night Lights , " " The Rundown " ) , the edits are fast and the sound is mixed up high , particularly when he keeps cutting between a middle - aged Gretzky quietly reflecting on what became of his career after the trade with very loud snippets of Gretzy 's glory days with the Oilers .
The second film , " The Band That Would n't Die , " is set , like so many of Levinson 's films , in Baltimore , as he takes an equally warm and melancholy look at the Colts Marching Band , who kept playing for years after the Colts left town , hoping their ongoing passion for the team would inspire the NFL to give the city a new team .
( With the arrival of the Baltimore Ravens in 1996 , it 's the only one of the first four films to offer a happy ending . )
The fourth , " Muhammad and Larry , " is Maysles ' look at the tragic Muhammad Ali-Larry Holmes 1980 championship fight , where Holmes so savagely beat on a past - his - prime Ali that one onlooker recalls , " I wanted him to knock Ali out early .
Not to hurt him , but to end it . "
Maysles actually shot most of the footage in the run-up to the fight , but when the bout ended up traumatizing most of boxing fandom , he could n't find anyone willing to buy the film .
Decades later , ESPN came calling , and some new interviews were shot with Holmes and many of the participants and witnesses .
( Star - Ledger columnist emeritus Jerry Izenberg appears , as he does in pretty much every Ali film — and , as always , he comes up with a few choice anecdotes that he has n't told in any of the other movies . )
As with " Muhammad and Larry " ( which offers just enough glimpses of the fight to show you how horrific it must have been in full ) , all the films offer a mix of classic and contemporary footage , and images both familiar and never - seen .
Berg shows a long excerpt from the Edmonton press conference Gretzky gave after the trade , and the famous moment where he broke down in tears and had to sit in a corner ; it 's no less striking for how many times you may have seen it if you care about hockey .
But he also finds home movie footage of a dazed Gretzky and new bride Janet Jones ( who was accused of driving the trade so she could focus on her acting career ) in the limo immediately after the wedding he planned for them .
TV news coverage of moving trucks trying to smuggle all the Colts equipment out of Baltimore under cover of night never gets old — it 's amazing to think such a thing was ever attempted , even a quarter century ago — and Levinson also finds bountiful video evidence of the contempt that the city and Colts owner Robert Irsay held for each other .
( Irsay shows up drunk for a TV appearance and bellows at the Colts fans , " If you love the Colts , why do n't you treat me right ? " )
And because Maysles had open access to the Ali and Holmes camps , " Muhammad and Larry " is witness to many intimate moments , as well as ones that are tragic in retrospect .
The Ali of today does n't appear in the film , but there 's a sequence of 1980 Ali amusing visitors with close - up magic tricks , and it 's painful to see how dexterous and fast - talking he was , and then to think of how much Parkinson 's disease ( which was exacerbated by all the blows to the head in fights like this ) has slowed his fingers and his mouth in the years since .
The third film , " Small Potatoes " — a look at the rise and fall of the United States Football League from Mike Tollin , who has produced many movies ( " Varsity Blues " ) and TV shows ( " One Tree Hill " ) with sports themes — is both lighter and less focused ( and therefore less compelling ) than the other three , but the story it tells is infectious .
And Tollin has a great villain in Donald Trump , who bought the New Jersey Generals franchise and pushed the USFL to move its games from the spring to the fall , directly in competition with the NFL — an impatient move that everyone else in the film agrees killed the enterprise .
The media has been so in the tank for Trump ever since " The Apprentice " debuted that it 's almost startling to be reminded of what an arrogant , selfish blowhard he is — surprising most of all for Trump himself , who gets grouchier the longer his interview lasts , and the more obvious it becomes that this is n't another puff piece .
There 's a telling moment where Tollin shows Trump demanding to know which will be his primary camera , and a priceless sequence where Trump does a slow burn while Tollin reads a long and damning quote about him from former USFL announcer ( and one - time " SportsCenter " anchor ) Charley Steiner .
Because of ESPN 's reach , and its tendency to club you over the head with that reach , it 's easy to focus on all the annoying things the network does rather than the many things it does right .
Based on these initial four films , " 30 for 30 " is one of the best ESPN projects in years — a reminder of how great ESPN can be when it acts a little humble and gives you the story without the self - promotion .
" 30 for 30 " ( Tonight at 8 on ESPN ) A series of documentaries covering events from ESPN's 30 years on the air opens with Peter Berg 's film about Wayne Gretzky being traded to the LA Kings .

This is because in recent years struggling cities and counties have sold their delinquent tax bills to the highest bidder .
It seemed a painless way to turn old debts into cash to finance schools or public services .
But housing advocates say the private companies may be exacerbating the foreclosure crisis , pushing out homeowners faster than would governments , which are increasingly concerned about neighborhoods becoming wastelands of abandoned properties .
“ In the beginning , you ’re getting this immediate windfall of cash , ” said Anita Lopez , the auditor of Lucas County , Ohio , which sold off more than 3,000 tax liens for $ 14.7 million .
The county includes Toledo .
“ But when you think about abandoned properties , foreclosed properties — the cost to the community is far more expensive than the short - term benefits . ”
Investors say the arrangement actually benefits everyone .
School districts , fire departments and public parks get an infusion of cash .
The investors take on a risky but potentially high - yielding investment .
And taxpayers do not have to pick up the slack from scofflaw landlords or tax evaders .
Governments , of course , can charge interest and penalties too , and they foreclose on properties for back taxes .
But governments charge interest rates that are half what private investors charge — often offering no -interest payment plans — and are also more likely to be concerned about the long - term prospects of neighborhoods .
In Toledo , one of the areas hardest hit by the downturn and by private lenders holding tax liens , homeowners like Richard Fix are facing foreclosure for a few thousand dollars in overdue taxes .
Mr. Fix said he lost his job with Chrysler in January 2008 and took a lower - paying job .
As he and his family struggled to pay their mortgage , credit cards and other bills , he said they fell behind on $ 5,900 in taxes .
“ I ’m in a no - win situation at this point , ” he said .
With the economy faltering and property values plunging , homeowners and landlords are falling behind on their bills or abandoning their property , just as governments are facing huge budget shortfalls .
Private investors step in and buy tax liens , paying governments upfront all or part of the value of the taxes .
The investors then get the right to foreclose on the properties , taking priority over mortgage lenders , and to charge interest rates as high as 18 percent on the unpaid taxes .
“ It beats the heck out of any certificate of deposit , ” said Howard Liggett , executive director of the National Tax Lien Association .
Because the sales occur in a patchwork of cities and counties across more than two dozen states , there are no figures tracking the number of tax - lien sales nationwide .
The liens that are sold come from cases in which homeowners pay taxes to the local government , not through their lenders .
But Mr. Liggett , whose group represents tax - lien investors , said they generated about $ 10 billion every year .
In 2006 , Lucas County began selling off its overdue tax certificates to a New Jersey company named Plymouth Park Tax Services , a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase .
It also operates under the name Xspand .
The company , once run by the former governor of New Jersey , James J. Florio , was sold to Bear Stearns and then absorbed into JPMorgan after Bear ’s collapse last year .
Today , Plymouth Park is one of the largest players in the tax - lien business .
Plymouth Park has filed more than 1,000 foreclosure actions against delinquent taxpayers , more than any single mortgage lender in the county .
But it says that it has only foreclosed on 56 of those filings .
Plymouth Park has bought $ 2 billion in tax liens across the country since 2008 , and says the number of foreclosures around Toledo is an aberration .
All told , foreclosures in Lucas County rose to 4,093 in 2008 from 3,486 in 2007 , and they are on track to be 7 percent higher this year than 2008 , according to county figures .
Plymouth Park ’s president , John Garzone , said the company tried to set up payment plans with homeowners and foreclosed only as a last resort .
The company said that the government would most likely have initiated many of those foreclosures on its own .
WASHINGTON - After a months - long review by a U.S. House ethics panel , Rep. Keith Ellison , D - Minn. , has disclosed the amount of his privately - paid trip to Mecca in December .
The trip , paid for by the Muslim American Society of Minnesota , cost $ 13,350 , Ellison said Thursday .
The two - week trip to Saudi Arabia , which Ellison described as a personal religious pilgrimage , or Hajj , prompted little discussion until June when Ellison filed financial travel reports that failed to disclose the amount the Muslim group had paid for his travel .
In releasing the amount on Thursday , Ellison held to his previous assertion that he was following the instructions of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , commonly known as the ethics committee .
" I never had a moral objection to giving the number out , " said Ellison , the first Muslim elected to Congress .
" But the rules said I did n't have to , so I did n't .
Now I am . "
What changed is the committee 's view of the trip .
In a Sept. 21 letter to Ellison , ethics officials had said that a " statutorily - mandated review " of Ellison 's financial disclosure statements indicated that he originally had " disclosed the trip properly . "
But " upon further review , " the committee said , Ellison must now report the cost of the trip .
The letter , signed by committee Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren , D - Calif. , and ranking Republican Jo Bonner of Alabama , said , " We consider this change to be merely a minor , technical correction , and we concur that you followed proper procedures and committee guidance . "
In explaining the discrepancy with the panel 's October , 2008 , advice -- rendered two months before the trip -- Lofgren and Bonner noted that Ellison 's original itinerary indicated he might add " meetings of an official nature , such as with government or business leaders . "
In some cases where House members can show that they are accepting paid travel for business purposes unrelated to their official duties in Congress , they do n't have to fully disclose the costs .

TEL AVIV , Israel , Oct. 6 ( UPI ) -- Israel 's leaders are circling the wagons against international efforts to arrest them abroad on war crimes charges .
The deputy prime minister , Gen. Moshe " Boogie " Yaalon , a former military chief of staff , this week canceled a fundraising visit to London for fear he might be arrested for the assassination of Hamas military chief Salah Shehahdeh in July 2002 .

Shehahdeh was killed when the air force dropped a 2,200 - pound bomb on his apartment block in Gaza City , along with 14 other people , including his wife and nine children .
Yaalon , a former commander of the Israeli army 's elite Sayaret Matkal special forces unit , was forced to call off an earlier visit to London in September 2005 after Palestinian groups sought warrants for his arrest for the Shehahdeh killings .
A week ago a London court rejected a Palestinian bid to have Defense Minister Ehud Barak , another retired general who is the Jewish state 's most decorated war hero , arrested on similar charges , this time linked to the Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip in December and January .
On Sunday the current chief of staff , Lt. Gen. Gaby Ashkenazi , had to fly secretly to Normandy for a military conference with U.S. and French commanders amid warnings that senior Israeli officers could be arrested in Europe because of their involvement in Operation Cast Lead , the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip on Dec. 28 .
Israeli concerns that the country 's leaders have become targets of a widening campaign to hold them accountable for alleged war crimes against the Palestinians , and other Arabs , over the years are not new .
But they were dramatically heightened by a 574 - page U.N. report on the 22 - day Israeli invasion of Gaza that alleged Israel committed " actions amounting to war crimes , possibly crimes against humanity " during that offensive in which some 1,200 Palestinians , mainly civilians , perished .
Israel fatalities totaled 13 .
The closely documented report was issued Sept. 15 .
The four - member commission headed by widely respected former South African Supreme Court Justice Richard Goldstone , who is Jewish , also accused Hamas of war crimes .
But it came down particularly hard on Israel , denouncing the disproportionate use of force employed during the winter offensive .
Israel refused to cooperate with the commission , appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council based in Geneva .
The scathing report was given weight because Goldberg is one of the world 's most respected experts on war crimes and served as chief prosecutor of the U.N. International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia .
The Defense Ministry in Tel Aviv branded the report " a prize for terrorists . "
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu held emergency meetings to discuss the consequences of the report .
" The goal is to avoid a slippery slope which would lead Israel to The Hague , " said a senior official in the premier 's office .
According to J.J. Goldberg of The Forward , an influential Jewish weekly published in the United States , " Israel 's international isolation and vulnerability is several degrees deeper " following the report 's release .
" How serious the damage will be depends in considerable measure on how Israel chooses to respond .
Initial signs are not encouraging . "
The report urged the Israeli government to investigate its allegations and take the appropriate action .
If Israel failed to do so within three months , the United Nations was urged to refer the case to the 108 - state International Criminal Court , which could potentially indict Israeli generals and political leaders .
If that happens , they could find themselves in the same situation as African tyrants currently on trial for war crimes or quarantined like President Omar al - Bashir .
Now , Goldberg noted , " that sort of isolation is a real threat " for Israeli leaders .
The Israelis are currently faced with a new principle of international law -- " universal jurisdiction " -- that permits prosecutions by countries other than those in which the alleged crimes were committed .
No Israeli leader has ever been convicted of such crimes .
In 2001 Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was tried in absentia in Belgium , though not convicted , for the massacre by Israeli - allied Lebanese Phalangists of as many as 2,000 unarmed Palestinian civilians in Beirut 's Sabra and Chatilla refugee camps during Israel 's 1982 Lebanon invasion .
Seeing is believing ?
A new television show which debuted in Turkey recently may provide a partial answer to the recent spike in anti-Israeli sentiment evident in the country .
" Ayrilik " ( " Farewell " ) , a prime - time show which airs on Turkish State - sponsored television channel TRT1 depicts the Israel Defense Forces as a murderous , bloodthirsty army .
Tensions Barak : Turkey central actor in region , Israel should avoid hostility Roni Sofer Following Turkey 's cancellation of their joint military exercise with Israel , Jerusalem is trying to defuse flames .
Defense minister says relations with Turkey are strategic :
No place for getting pulled into fiery statements against them .
Turkey : Cancellation not political Barak : Turkey central actor in region , Israel should avoid hostility
Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman summoned the acting Turkish ambassador to Israel to a meeting with high - ranking Foreign Ministry officials in order to protest against the TV show .
" Broadcasting this series is a serious case of state - sponsored incitement .
Such a series , which does n’t even have a weak connection to reality , and which presents the IDF 's soldiers as murderers of innocent children , is unworthy of being broadcast in enemy states , let alone in a country which had full diplomatic relations with Israel . "
While the main plot is that of a love story which develops between the lead characters during Israel 's January offensive in Gaza Strip , much of the show centers on the IDF 's brutish activities .
In an episode of the show available on YouTube , Palestinians clash with IDF forces .
Some of the Palestinians have firearms while others use simpler measures like stones .
At the end of the scene , an " IDF soldier " is seen passing by a body of a Palestinian youth and jolting it with his foot , as the youth 's mother runs over in tears to cradle her son 's body .
The following scene shows another " soldier " run a Palestinian girl into a street corer .
She looks at him and smiles , but the " mission driven " soldier shoots her in the chest and watches her bloodied body drop to the floor before leaving the area .
The opening credits also show a particularly monstrous image of Israeli soldiers , as snapshots of explosions , tanks wreaking havoc , soldiers beating civilians and dead bodies everywhere light up the screen .
One of the shots also depicts a group of Palestinians facing an IDF firing squad .
Bloodthirsty .
The firing squad scene
According to the show 's website , it " brings to life the bleeding wound of Palestine .
The show depicts all sides of the generations - long tragedy …
This season focuses on the women and children and the Palestinian story , as well as the notion that the ultimate solution is love , compassion and world peace . "
' Israelis are always the bad ones '
Diplomatic relations between Jerusalem and Ankara have been tense since Israel launched Operation Cast Lead .
Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan proved one of the operation 's harshest critics .
Relations with turkey seem to have taken a turn for the worst earlier this week , as Ankara decided to cancel an annual joint air force drill with Israel .
Jackie Angel , a representative of the Jewish community in Ankara , told Ynet that the Turkish media 's attitude towards Israel has been bad for a long time .
" The Israelis are always the bad ones and the Palestinians are the good ones .
There 's nothing new here .
During the Gaza war the biased coverage was catastrophic .
There were n't two sides , only the Palestinian side . "
He stressed that " in day - to - day life these things have no effect .
Both as Jews and as Israelis we do n't feel any change towards us on the part of Turkey .
The things get seem stronger only on the Israeli media . "
Meanwhile , Turkish experts are also pessimistic in regards to the diplomatic crisis between the two countries .
" If bilateral relations between Turkey and Israel touched bottom after that incident , the current crisis shows that they are to remain there for some time to come , " Ilker Ayturk , a political science professor at Bilkent University in Ankara , told Time magazine .
" Until very recently , it was the upper echelons of the Turkish military who determined the scope and pace of the strategic relationship between Israel and Turkey , " Ayturk says .
" What we are witnessing is the chief of staff allowing , willy - nilly , Erdogan to take the initiative .
They are acquiescing in a ' political ' decision . "

Many in Jakarta moved onto the streets as a precaution after the quake A 6.1 - magnitude earthquake has struck the Indonesian island of Java , causing buildings to sway in the capital , Jakarta , officials have said .
The epicentre was located 180 km ( 115 miles ) west of the city , in the Sunda Strait , at a depth of 50.6 km ( 31.4 miles ) , the US Geological Survey said .
There have so far been no reports of any damage or casualties .
A more powerful 7.6 - magnitude quake devastated western Sumatra last month and left more than 1,100 people dead .
An official at the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology , Climatology and Geophysics , Suharjono , told the AFP news agency that Friday 's tremor was the result of movement in the same tectonic plate , but that it was impossible to say whether the two events were related .
" However , the epicentres are in the same bloc ... due to a clash between the Indo - Australian and Euro - Asian plates , " he said .
Suharjono said the quake was not strong enough to cause a tsunami .
In Cilegon , on the western coast of Java , residents said the earth had shaken powerfully and some people had run from their homes , but that there was no evidence of major damage .
" There was strong shaking for less than a minute .
There was a lot of panic , " Warca Dinata , a teacher , told AFP .
" We all ran out of our homes but now everything is OK . "
Indonesia sits on the so - called " Pacific Ring of Fire " , one of the most active areas for earthquakes and volcanic activity in the world .

More than 1 billion hungry , UN agencies report
By Tom Eley
15 October 2009
More than 1 billion people , one sixth of humanity , will have experienced undernourishment by the end of 2009 , two United Nations agencies reported on Wednesday .
The ranks of the hungry have increased by about 100 million people in one year , a result of the most severe economic crisis since the Great Depression .
“ The State of Food Insecurity , ” produced by the UN ’s Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) and the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , explains that the sharp increase in global hunger is not the result of poor harvest or natural disasters , but the man -made causes of high food costs , growing unemployment , and declining incomes .
Meanwhile , cutbacks in donations to the WFP have so far left it with 58 percent of last year ’s funding , forcing it to curtail ongoing food relief operations .
The report notes that the spike in malnourishment marked an intensification of a longer - term trend .
Hunger has been on the increase since the early 1990s .
“ Even before the food crisis and the economic crisis , the number of hungry people had been increasing slowly but steadily , ” the report notes .
Most of the increase in hunger has taken place in the world ’s poorest regions — Asia , sub -Saharan Africa , Latin America and the Caribbean , and the Middle East and North Africa .
“ No nation is immune and , as usual , it is the poorest countries — and the poorest people — that are suffering the most , ” states the report , which was released in advance of World Food Day on October 16 .
Poor nations have been hit by a combination of problems , among them a dearth of foreign aid and investment , declining wages and mounting layoffs , an unprecedented global reduction in remittances from emigrants to family members left behind , and persistently high food prices , the Rome - based agencies said .
The world ’s poor are still suffering the effects of the commodity speculation of 2006 - 2008 that sent the prices of such staple foods as rice , wheat and corn beyond the reach of hundreds of millions .
While prices have receded somewhat with the economic crisis of 2009 , they remain , on average , 17 percent higher than their 2005 levels .
High food prices cause more than hunger .
Difficulty in procuring food forces families to adopt a number of “ coping mechanisms , ” according to the report , such as “ replacing more nutritious food with less nutritious food , ” selling productive assets , and “ forgoing health care or education . ”
The report also notes that the tools with which governments in poor nations might typically respond to widespread hunger — currency devaluations , borrowing , and international relief — have been blunted by the global character of the economic crisis .
Past economic crises have been concentrated in single nations or regions , the report points out .
Although extreme hunger is most intense in less developed nations , social misery is on the rise among workers and the poor in the advanced economies , where the report estimates 15 million will have experienced undernourishment by the end of 2009 .
This figure , if anything , underestimates the nutritional crisis in the advanced countries .
In the US alone , 36.2 million people lived in households defined as facing “ food insecurity ” in 2007 — before the onset of the economic crisis — among them 12 million children , according to statistical analysis of US Department of Agriculture and Census Bureau data .
( see “ US : 12 million children face hunger and food insecurity ” ) .
The social crisis in the advanced economies was highlighted by an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) report , also released this week , on unemployment .
The report found that among its 30 member states the combined unemployment rate rose in August by .1 percentage points from July to 8.6 percent , and stood 2.3 points higher than August of 2008 .
It is anticipated that unemployment rates will rise for another year and remain high for years to come .
Mounting unemployment in the advanced economies has disproportionately affected layers of the population such as the youth , unskilled workers , and immigrants .
In response , immigrants have cut back on remittances , compounding hunger in poorer nations .
Remittances account for more than 6 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) in most developing countries , according to “ The State of Food Insecurity . ”
For some , the figure is much higher .
In Tajikistan , remittances account for 46 percent of GDP ; in Honduras and Lebanon , about 25 percent .
Roughly a fifth of all households in Albania , the Phillipines , El Salvador , and Haiti depend upon remittances as a source of income .
In the South Asian countries , remittances account for well over half of all foreign capital inflows .
Surprisingly , this is especially true of India — held up as a star in the new global economy — where remittances account for more than three quarters of all cash inflow , dwarfing foreign direct investment .
Yet declines in remittances were just one part of a marked contraction of the overall capital flows to poor countries .
Citing one example , the report explains that in the 13 largest Latin American economies , capital inflows have fallen by more than three quarters , from $ 184 billion in 2007 to an estimated $ 43 billion in 2009 .
Foreign aid has fallen precipitously as well , with the International Monetary Fund estimating that 71 poor nations will see an average drop of 25 percent in assistance this year .
This falloff , again a result of the economic crises in the advanced countries , will have its most severe impact in the very poorest countries , especially those in sub-Saharan Africa .
The global food crisis is prompting warnings from aid organizations for immediate action — as well as incomprehension , given the enormous resources and food production capacity theoretically available to meet it .
“ We have the economic and technical means to make hunger disappear , ” said FAO Director - General Jacques Diouf .
“ What is missing is a stronger political will to eradicate hunger forever . ”
This statement is only half true .
While it is certainly the case that science and technique have increased agricultural productivity to the point that all the world ’s population could be easily fed , what stands in the way is not a lack of “ political will , ” but a system of social organization — capitalism — that subordinates social need to the profit drive of the rich .
Last year the WFP secured record donations of $ 5 billion in order to feed the world ’s hungry .
This year , donor countries and wealthy individuals have held the purse strings tight , giving the WFP only $ 2.9 billion .
This is a paltry sum .
According to Forbes , there are 224 individual families in the world who have personal fortunes of $ 2.9 billion or more .
The total resources allocated through the WFP to feed the world ’s poor is also about 2 percent of what the biggest Wall Street banks will dole out in salaries and bonuses to America ’s top bankers , whose reckless speculation triggered the very economic crisis that has sent tens of millions more into hunger .
( See “ A record year for Wall Street pay ” )
And , of course , the $ 2.9 billion offered to feed the world ’s hungry is an infinitesimally small percentage of the trillions governments have mobilized to rescue the world ’s biggest banks .
“ World leaders have reacted forcefully to the financial and economic crisis and succeeded in mobilizing billions of dollars in a short time period , ” Diouf noted .
“ The same strong action is needed now to combat hunger and poverty . ”
Yet it is not only that these unfathomably large bank bailouts and the personal fortunes they protect represent a misallocation of resources that might serve useful social purposes , for example seeing to it that everyone has enough to eat .
The wealth of the financial elite arises directly from the impoverishment of the great majority of the world ’s population through predatory forms of speculation in debt , commodities , real estate , currency , and the shutdown of industry .
Now these practices have been joined by the open plundering of the world ’s treasuries .
These processes will encounter mass opposition .
Already , high food prices have triggered riots in over 60 countries since 2007 .
Ceasefire

Put in mind of his own father and moved to tears
Achilles took him by the hand and pushed the old king
Gently away , but Priam curled up at his feet and
Wept with him until their sadness filled the building .
Taking Hector 's corpse into his own hands Achilles
Made sure it was washed and , for the old king 's sake ,
Laid out in uniform , ready for Priam to carry
Wrapped like a present home to Troy at daybreak .
When they had eaten together , it pleased them both
To stare at each other 's beauty as lovers might ,
Achilles built like a god , Priam good - looking still
And full of conversation , who earlier had sighed :
' I get down on my knees and do what must be done
And kiss Achilles ' hand , the killer of my son . '
Longley 's poem is Patrick Corrigan 's pick for National Poetry Day .
( Read more about Longley 's poem here . )
It 's a wonderful poem which matures with every new reading .
Patrick , the Northern Ireland director of Amnesty International , chose the poem because it calls attention to the importance of human rights ( and much more too ) .
I am now receiving your suggestions for a poem exploring religion : it could be devotional , or sceptical , celebratory or philosophical .
You could even write an original poem .
I 'll post my own choice by the end of the day .

Psychologists in America have revealed a shock insight from a recently - announced study : people with extreme or " deviant " views are much more willing to share their opinions than those with moderate ideas .
This is thought to lead groups or communities actually composed mainly of moderates to acquire an extreme character .
The study in question was carried out by Kimberly Rios Morrison of Ohio State and Dale T Miller of the Stanford Graduate School of Business .
The example of " extremism " or " deviance " identified by the two profs in their experiments was a belief that students should be allowed to drink alcohol in the common areas of their dormitory accommodation .
This is forbidden at Stanford , and those who strongly disagree with the rule were also those most likely to say so .
According to the psychologists , this was because they believed that the rest of the student body was on their side .
“ Students who were stridently pro-alcohol tended to think that their opinion was much more popular than it actually was , ” says Morrison .
“ There ’s this stereotype that college students are very pro-alcohol , and even most college students believe it .
Most students think of themselves as less pro-alcohol than average . ”
By doing a certain amount of cunning lying , however , the researchers convinced the pro-booze loudmouths that in fact nobody agreed with them .
This , apparently , shut them up .
“ It is only when they have this sense that they are in the majority that extremely pro-alcohol students are more willing to express their views on the issue , ” according to Morrison .
However it seemed that the extreme anti-grog lobby never really became willing to speak up , even when they had been falsely told that everyone was on their side .
" Their view that they are in the minority may be so deeply entrenched that it is difficult to change ...
They do n’t have the experience expressing their opinions on the subject like the pro-alcohol extremists do , " theorises Morrison .
The prof then goes on to extrapolate this thinking into other areas of debate , suggesting that the syndrome of extremists falsely believing that everyone in a group backs them leads to a sort of positive - feedback loop .
Extreme opinions are aired , people hear them more , people falsely assume that the entire group holds those beliefs and so it becomes gradually more extreme in appearance - if not in the actuality of its members ' beliefs .
“ You have a cycle that feeds on itself : the more you hear these extremists expressing their opinions , the more you are going to believe that those extreme beliefs are normal for your community , " explains Morrison .
The prof believes that her group - positive - feedback theory could explain the ( apparently ) heavily polarised nature of US politics in recent times , or other debates in which each side appears increasingly extreme / evil to the other - whereas in fact most on both sides actually hold more moderate opinions .
Examples could include environmental matters , the perennial arguments regarding what kind of women are most attractive etc .
There may not be a " monolithic " silent majority in these arguments , according to the theory , but " the minority may be more vocal " .
We say : we 're sure we speak for all decent people everywhere in stating categorically that studies of this type are hogwash and those who write them thieving parasitical crooks leeching from the public purse .
Well , maybe not in all cases .
But we do struggle with the idea college students are n't pro-alcohol .
The announcement from Ohio State here , and the profs ' paper Expressing deviant opinions :
Believing you are in the majority helps is here . ®
This extraordinary French motorcycle from between the wars was spotted by Paul d’Orléans in Bavaria recently .
He sums it up perfectly : “ The Majestic is the physical embodiment of the Art Deco aesthetic , a streamlined torpedo which suggests Speed and Modernity . ”
The real innovation is at the front — this is one of the first motorcycles to feature hub - centered steering ( as beloved by Bimota of late ) .
And yes , the front also has sliding pillar suspension , similar to that on a Lancia Lambda or early Morgan .
D’Orléans was lucky enough to ride this machine , but the styling apparently promises more than the 500 cc Chaise engine can deliver .
Still , it ’s hard not to be seduced by those swooping lines in light - gauge steel , beautifully accentuated by classic French racing blue paintwork .
For that , we could forgive just about anything .

Throw your hips to and fro with glee .
Oct. 7 , 2009 --
When it comes to seeking treatment for chest pain , education does n't always mean people do the right thing .
In a new study , heart patients who received counseling about heart attack symptoms and when to get treatment were no more likely to get immediate care than those who had not received counseling .
This is disappointing because patients who receive care within 90 minutes after the onset of heart attack symptoms fare much better .
The study , published in Circulation : Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes , included 3,522 patients with documented heart disease .
Patients had a mean age of 67 years ; two - thirds were men .
About half of the patients received counseling .
During the next two years , 565 of the study participants were admitted to the hospital with chest pain symptoms .
Some were admitted more than once .
Even after learning the value of getting to the hospital quickly and using the emergency medical system ( EMS ) , the group that received counseling was not significantly more likely to do these things than the comparison group that did n't get counseling .
The delay time -- the time between symptom onset and the hospital visit -- was 2.2 hours for the group that got the counseling and 2.25 hours for the group that did n't get the counseling .
The counseled group used the emergency medical system 63.6 % of the time , compared to 66.9 % for the group without the counseling .
The only good news ?
The group that got counseling was more likely to take an aspirin and was more likely to call the emergency medical system if chest pain occurred within six months of the counseling .
In an accompanying news release , Alice Jacobs , MD , past president of the American Heart Association and professor of medicine at Boston University School of Medicine , listed common reasons that patients resist seeking care :
Fear the incident will be an embarrassing false alarm
Not wanting to " bother " care providers
Concern that insurance wo n't cover emergency care
" This study again underscores the importance of ongoing research in this area targeted at finding what will change the behavior of patients and the public at high risk for coronary events , " Jacobs said in a statement .
The New Moon soundtrack bolted to the # 2 position on the charts after it was released last week , and if it had n’t been for Michael Buble , it would certainly have been # 1 ( Well played , Buble ; well played , sir ) .
I do n’t need a marketing guru to tell me how popular the series by Stephenie Meyer is .
I just have to talk to my daughter ( age 13 ) to know that the Twilight series is something that is more than a passing fad and a cleverly marketed story that appeals to teenage girls .
Sure , all the product surrounding the series is designed to evoke eeks and gasps from its targeted demo , but it ’s the story and how well it translates to the screen that ’s really of importance to my daughter and her friends .
The fact that a group like Paramore recorded an extremely popular song for the first film ’s soundtrack is a wonderful addition to the Twilight universe , but soundtracks are one thing , and the story another .
All that said , however , I asked my daughter and her two friends ( all of whom are fans of the Twilight series ) to listen to the New Moon soundtrack and offer their thoughts on music that ’s been carefully chosen to appeal to their tastes …or has it ?
First off , let ’s meet our teen critics — all of whom are in eighth grade .
Maya Asregadoo started reading the Twilight series in sixth grade after one of her friends recommended the book .
She checked it out of the school library , and , well , she ’s been hooked ever since .
Jackie Kuyat is Maya ’s BFF since grade school .
Maya suggested that Jackie read Twilight and , like Maya , she ’s been hooked ever since .
Emmy Hurley is also a friend of Maya ’s from grade school , and they ’re in the same Girl Scout troop .
Emmy learned about Twilight from friends at school and like Maya and Jackie , has been hooked ever since ( are you sensing a viral “ word of mouth ”  kind of marketing here ?
Me too ) .
I asked our panel to give us their overall thoughts on the soundtrack , and Jackie said , “ It was okay [ but ] it had a lot of weak songs . ”
Emmy agreed , saying that “ I thought this CD was very boring and not very entertaining . ”
Maya was a a bit more forgiving : “ Overall , I did like this album , but the songs sounded very much the same .
They were all pretty much the same genre , and they were mostly slow - sounding .
I did enjoy that element [ to a point ] , but it got boring after too much of the same thing . ” 
The soundalike quality of the songs was certainly the most universally annoying thing about the soundtrack .
But was there more ?
Emmy stated that the songs were n’t well chosen : “ [ It was ] like they randomly picked a whole bunch of songs and put them on the CD .
I expected [ the soundtrack ] to be a whole lot better and fun to listen to , and that I would want to listen to it all the time .
But I do n’t really want to listen to it again . ” 
Ouch !
And if you think that hurts , Jackie piled on with this twist of the knife : “ This album did not support itself well and I would not buy this unless it was selling for about two dollars . ” 
Is that the sound of the cutout bin I hear in the distance ?
If two dollars is the price point for the entire album , Maya would n’t even pay that : “ Basically , I would n’t go out and buy this album based on the fact that there were only a few songs that stood out to me . ” 
That could mean that while the entire album is a downer , and many of the songs sound very much like the others , there have to be some songs that stand out ; songs worth , say , 99 cents for a download ?
The answer is a resounding yes from all three of our panel members .
Emmy clearly likes perhaps the only rocker on the album : “ The song I like was “ Monsters ” by Hurricane Bells .
It had a good beat and was pretty entertaining — [ overall it was ] better than the others by far . ” 
Jackie was taken by the one instrumental piece on the album , “ New Moon ( The Meadow ) ”  by Alexandre Desplat .
“ The atmospheric / background quality of the composition is “ a very classic Twilight - sounding songs — and it made me happy to hear a song like that [ on the soundtrack ] . ”
“ I Belong to You ”  by Muse also started to grow on her because , to Jackie , it ’s “ the best song with words . ” 
Like Jackie , Maya has more than one preferred song on the album : “ My favorite songs on the album would have to be “ Meet Me on the Equinox ”  ( Death Cab for Cutie ) , “ A White Demon Love Song ”  ( the Killers ) , and “ Roslyn ”  ( Bon Iver & St. Vincent ) . ” 
The Killers ’ slow burn on “ White Demon ”  and the rather haunting Bon Iver and St. Vincent “ Roslyn ”  stand in stark contrast with Death Cab for Cutie ’s “ Meet Me on the Equinox ”  in that the DCFC tune would n’t be half as interesting if it was n’t for the inventive drumming of Jason McGerr .
Sure , that ’s my two cents on that tune , but hey , take the drumming away , and what do you have ?
Not a lot , kids … not a lot .
So what have we learned ?
Well , if our esteemed panel is any indication , the soundtrack producers misread the tea leaves of popular culture when they put these songs together .
That is to say , as a standalone group , they were too downbeat and morose .
How these songs are used in the film may change opinions over time , but for now , the verdict on the New Moon soundtrack seems to be : download two or three of your favorites and skip the rest .

STS - 1 , the first space shuttle mission , launched on April 12 , 1981 .
At that point , the shuttle was already several years old , and the original designs stretch back to the early 1970’s .
The shuttle then was designed using the same basic technology that was used to go to the Moon , and while it ’s been updated several times since , it was n’t until 2007 that the shuttle ’s computer software was updated to the point that the computers would n’t require a reboot if the shuttle was in orbit over the New Year .
So the first test launch of NASA ’s first new rocket in three decades is a big deal .
And today , the Ares 1 - X rocket , carrying a dummy second stage and packed with 700 sensors to gather flight data , launched successfully from Kennedy .
Watching this brought me back to being a child and watching the shuttle launch for the first time .
I wo n’t say it was STS - 1 , because I do n’t remember .
But it was an early launch , before Challenger .
Earlier this week , I heard a story on NPR about the launch of the Ares 1 - X .
In it , the deputy mission manager for the launch , Jon Cowart , says “ This is really rocket science .
And it ’s not something you do on a lark .
If it was easy , everybody would be doing it . ”
And the story makes the following point :
[ N ] o matter what happens , the test flight data will be extremely useful for rocket science and designers of future space vehicles .
“ To borrow a quote from one of my favorite rocket designers , Wernher von Braun , ” Cowart says , ” ‘ One good test is worth a thousand expert opinions . ’ “
In other words , even if the rocket had blown up on the launch pad , as so many others did in the early days of manned spaceflight , it would still provide the designers valuable data .
Data that would ensure that the next rocket would succeed , or at least not fail for the same reason .
Or , to put it yet another way , NASA can make putting the space shuttle , and perhaps soon the Ares rockets , into space appear routine and perfectly safe because of all the rockets they blew up decades ago .
And all the explosions in the video below were successes because scientists and engineers learned from them .
Whether the Obama Administration will continue the development of the Ares 1 rocket is an open question .
But today , the Ares 1 - X was a success .
And it did n’t even blow up .
The debate over America 's counterterrorism policies is sounding a lot like the debate over the Bush administration 's aggressive " war on terror . "
Nine months into the Obama administration , the same human rights and civil liberties officials who were sharply critical of President Bush are leveling similar criticisms about the new administration .
Although the rhetoric from the White House is toned down , harsh interrogations have stopped , and secret CIA prisons are shuttered , critics complain that emerging Obama antiterror policies seem more Bush - like than Obama - like .
The administration has embraced Mr. Bush 's law of war philosophy justifying the potential indefinite detention of terror suspects deemed by President Obama to be too difficult to put on trial , but also too dangerous to release .
Administration officials are hinting that Obama may fail to fulfill his pledge to close the Guantánamo prison camp by January .
A new version of the controversial military commission process is expected to emerge soon from Congress .
And construction continues for a new , expanded terror prison camp at the Bagram air base in Afghanistan .
" Bagram is becoming Obama 's Guantánamo , " Hope Metcalf , director of the National Litigation Project of the Lowenstein International Human Rights Clinic at Yale Law School , warned during a panel discussion in Washington Thursday .
" The situation at Bagram is , if anything , far worse than Guantánamo , " she told a gathering of the American Constitution Society .
" At Bagram , there are no lawyers , no courts , and essentially no hope . "
Joanne Mariner , director of the counterterrorism program at Human Rights Watch , told the same assembly that the pace of detainee releases from Guantánamo has slowed from the rate during the Bush administration .
Currently , 221 detainees remain at Guantánamo .
Of 38 Guantánamo habeas corpus cases in which judges had examined the government 's evidence , 30 detainees had been ordered released , Ms. Mariner said .
Of those , she said , only 12 have won actual freedom .
According to Mariner , the slowdown is partly because of a reluctance in Europe to accept released detainees in light of a refusal in Congress to permit any resettlements in the United States .
But , she added , the pace of resettlements in Europe may soon pick up .
A number of detainees are now in the pipeline for resettlement there , she said .
Accepting countries include Portugal , Belgium , and Ireland .
Among contentious issues under debate in Congress is whether a revamped military commission should include authorization to try suspected terrorists for providing material support to a terror group .
Critics argue that material support is not a traditional war crime .
They say officials are seeking to include it as a triable offense before a military commission to provide an easy path to a conviction .
Analysis of the material - support issue is " ongoing , " said David Kris , assistant attorney general for national security .
" This is ultimately a historic and legal inquiry , " he told the gathering of the American Constitution Society .
Mr. Kris was asked how national - security lawyers in the Obama administration would avoid becoming legal " enablers " for officials who might seek authorization to engage in controversial interrogation tactics .
Kris said it was up to the attorney general and other top Justice Department officials – including himself – to " set the right tone . "
The Justice Department , he added , was seeking to hire " good , strong people with character and principles . "

WASHINGTON , Oct. 16 ( UPI ) -- The U.S. Defense Department told a congressional committee paying $ 400 for a gallon of gas is one reason the cost of the war in Afghanistan is so high .
That is the cost once the gas is shipped to Karachi in Pakistan , sent to Afghanistan by truck , distributed to storage depots and then to forward operating bases , The Hill reported .
Helicopters carrying bladders of fuel are used for some remote bases , the most expensive means of transport .

Mark Iden , deputy director of operations at the Defense Energy Support Center , which supplies fuel for all military operations , said the fuel starts out priced at $ 2.78 per gallon but " a lot of other factors come into play " before it reaches its destination .
The Pentagon gave the House Appropriations Defense subcommittee the statistic on fuel to explain why the United States spends $ 1 billion for every thousand soldiers in Afghanistan , staffers told The Hill .
" It is a number that we were not aware of and it is worrisome , " Rep. John Murtha D - Pa. , said .
" When I heard that figure from the Defense Department , we started looking into it . "
The EU pays farmers money to maintain their land
The EU farm subsidies system is a " masterclass of misadministration " in most of the UK , the head of the Commons Public Accounts Committee has said .
Edward Leigh MP was responding to a National Audit Office report condemning the high cost to the taxpayer .
Farming minister Jim Fitzpatrick has disputed figures showing average claim processing costs were £ 285 in Scotland , but £ 1,743 in England .
He said " real progress " had been made but conceded serious problems existed .
The EU's Single Payment Scheme provides grants to farmers for maintaining their land .
When asked if he could find anyone who thought the system worked well , Mr Fitzpatrick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " I think that would be a difficult thing to produce ... the answer , I suspect , is a straightforward no . "
The NAO 's report accused the Rural Payments Agency ( RPA ) , which administers the scheme , and the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) of showing scant regard for protecting public money in the process of handing out the grants to farmers .
The agency has been heavily criticised in the past for shortcomings in its operations .
Delays to farmers ' payments in 2006 , blamed on computer failures at the agency , cost millions of pounds and were described by MPs in a 2007 report as a " fiasco " .
There was widespread anger at the time that no ministers or civil servants resigned as a result .
' Unforeseen costs '
The National Audit Office said the current average cost of processing a claim in England was now £ 1,743 .
This is often much more than the value of the claim itself and is far more than the average of £ 285 under the simpler Scottish system .
The report said that since the scheme 's creation in 2005 it had racked up more than £ 680 m in " unforeseen additional costs " , including £ 304 m in extra staff costs and £ 280 m in penalties for late payments and administrative errors .
It has also overpaid farmers an amount totalling somewhere between £ 55 m and £ 90 m .

The report did find some improvements - in particular , fewer payments being made late to farmers - but NAO chief Amyas Morse said there were still " significant issues to be resolved " .
" There has been a serious lack of attention to the protection of taxpayers ' interests over the administration of the scheme , " he said .
" Previous assurances on overall progress in recovering over - payments from farmers proved optimistic and reflect a lack of reliable information on actual progress .
" Defra should urgently address the risks to ongoing IT system support and the inaccuracy of the scheme 's data , explore alternative payment systems and resolve ongoing management issues . "
Mr Fitzpatrick said they " did not accept " the NAO figures on claims costs .
He said they believed the average cost of processing farmers ' claims outside Scotland had reduced recently from £ 750 to £ 700 .
He said they had cut the number of administrative staff from 4,500 to 3,500 , had introduced an online system for farmers to use , and were re-mapping the country to improve the accuracy of claims submitted .
" There has been some real progress made because we recognise how vitally important these payments are to farmers , and we have got to get it right . "
' Get a grip ' Conservative backbencher Mr Leigh accused the RPA of " lamentable " communication with farmers , who he said often had little idea what they would be paid or when .
It is taxpayers who are picking up the tab for the whole sorry mess
Peter Kendall
National Farmers ' Union Shadow environment secretary Nick Herbert said : " Vast sums of taxpayers ' money has been wasted on excessive administration costs and fines to the EU , yet typically ministers who should be held accountable for this dismal state of affairs still refuse to accept their responsibility .
" It is time for a fundamental overhaul of the agency to get a grip of the farm payments scheme once and for all . "
The Lib Dems echoed that call for a new system .
" This needs to include a minimum payment figure of around £ 300 so that the smallest claims are filtered out and farmers get their payments efficiently , effectively and on time , " rural affairs spokesman Tim Farron said .
The National Farmers ' Union president Peter Kendall accused Defra of rushing to implement a " hugely complex model " .
" Initially , it was farmers who paid the price , but now it is taxpayers who are picking up the tab for the whole sorry mess , " he said .
The government previously announced that a review of the Single Payment Scheme would be carried out by 2013 .

Beautifully illustrated , epic in scale and an engrossing , frustrating reading experience , Absolute Promethea may very well represent late - period Alan Moore 's finest hour .
So why does it feel like there 's going to be a test at the end ?

Promethea was always the strongest of Alan Moore 's turn - of - the - century America 's Best Comics line ; less throwaway nostalgia than Tom Strong , less full of indulgent parody than Tomorrow Stories and more regular than Top Ten , it was the series that seemed to have a " point " beyond simple entertainment .
Reading the new oversized collection of the series ' first twelve issues , the greater intent behind the entertainment becomes obvious - but also , when taken in one sitting , threatens to overpower the story more than once .
On the more straight - forward level , the story follows teenager Sophie Bangs as she investigates ( and then becomes ) the mythical heroine Promethea , who has existed for centuries , possessing those who were able to conjure her through literary means .
And on that level , it 's a very engaging , if slightly derivative , read ; much of the fun from that story comes from the asides and injokes than the superhero antics Sophie finds herself in the middle of , especially given the Joker rip - off bad guy .
But if Moore 's source material seems a little too obvious there , it 's because his real interest is in the other part of the series , which is essentially a magical handbook ; as Sophie learns the history of Promethea and the earlier Prometheas before her , Moore repeatedly steps outside of the superhero narrative to teach her - and , by extention , the reader - his rules of magic .

How much this will be of interest to the reader depends on how interested the reader is in magic , and specifically Moore 's magic ; as the series took more and more of a diversionary direction into the more magical realms - the final issue reprinted in the Absolute edition is literally an entire issue of Moore explaining magic via talking snake heads - Promethea becomes a much more narrowly - focused book , with parts that ( in retrospect ) foretell Moore 's own retreat from the mainstream with books like Lost Girls .
For my part , I found it interesting enough to keep reading , but also much harder to genuinely care about ; it was as if the series changed from a straight - forward narrative to a series of lectures from someone who did n't have the perspective on his subject to necessarily remember to tell newcomers why they should care .

Throughout the whole thing , however , artists JH Williams III and Mick Gray shine ; even as Moore loses the narrative thread or falls into ( self - ) parody at times , the book continues to look amazing , with a sense of design and character that has only since been outdone by Williams ' own subsequent work on Seven Soldiers and especially Detective Comics .
While I 'm unconvinced about the pricetag ( $ 100 ) of the Absolute edition of the series - especially as it features no new material from the two much - cheaper paperback editions it collects other than an afterword by Brad Meltzer - the chance to see this artwork on a larger scale is very welcome indeed .

Absolute Promethea , then , is a difficult book to recommend .
The series itself , much less so - although it 's not for everyone , especially as it shifts from superhero comic to magical history textbook - but the high price of the Absolute edition genuinely makes me think that everyone who is n't buying the book solely for the artwork should seek out the paperbacks , instead .
Absolute Promethea is available in comic stores now .
… And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead is an indie rockband best known for their heavy yet anthemic music and their tendency to destroy their equipment at the end of their performances ( a rock and roll tradition usually associated with The Who ) .
According to the band 's website , the name “ … And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead ” is taken from both an ancient Mayan ritual chant and an Egyptian burial text .
Band members have also claimed that they made it up because it sounded cool and discovered the association after the fact .
The chief creative element of the band consists of Jason Reece and Conrad Keely .
They each formed their first band in 1993 , soon after moving to Olympia , Washington .
Dissatisfied with the northwest , the two ventured south to Austin , Texas and started playing as a duo under the moniker , “ You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead ” .
The band expanded to include guitarist Kevin Allen and bassist Neil Busch .
They then officially changed their name to “ … And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead ” ( adding the conjunction and then the ellipsis for effect ) .
The band is also known by the shorter name “ Trail of Dead . ”
Reshaping the Solar System
Yesterday ’s story on IBEX is now complemented by images from the Ion and Neutral Camera , part of the Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument on the Cassini orbiter .
The Cassini data confirm the fact that the heliosphere is n’t shaped the way we ’ve always thought .
The assumption up to now has been that the collision of the solar wind with the interstellar medium would create a foreshortened nose in the direction of the Solar System ’s motion , and an elongated tail in the opposite direction .
Both IBEX and Cassini argue otherwise .
Stamatios Krimigis ( Applied Physics Lab , Laurel , MD ) notes the import of these findings :
“ These images have revolutionized what we thought we knew for the past 50 years ; the sun travels through the galaxy not like a comet but more like a big , round bubble .
It ’s amazing how a single new observation can change an entire concept that most scientists had taken as true for nearly fifty years . ”
Amazing and invigorating , for we ’re opening up serious new ground here .
Put together , what Cassini and IBEX are telling us is that particle pressure and magnetic field density are what dominate the interaction between the interstellar medium and the heliosphere .
We ’re getting a look at how a solar system moves through the space around it through twin imaging programs that map an otherwise invisible boundary .
Image :
The shape of our solar system moving through the interstellar medium was previously thought to be comet - shaped , with a head pointed into the stream , and a tail flowing downstream .
New observations show the shape actually resembles something more like a slippery ball ( the hot particles that exert pressure ) moving through smoke ( the interstellar magnetic field ) .
As the “ ball ” moves through the “ smoke , ” the smoke bends and parts to let the ball through , then resumes its previous shape after the ball has passed on .
At present , this is only hypothetical : New models will be motivated by these measurements , and will provide a more physically accurate basis for the interaction of the heliosphere with the interstellar medium .

Cassini has been mapping energetic neutral atoms not only near Saturn but across the entire sky .
These ENAs , discussed yesterday , are produced by energetic protons that interact with the magnetic field of the interstellar medium .
For more on ENAs , I turn to Mike Gruntman ’s AstronauticsNow site ( thanks to Centauri Dreams reader Carl for the tip ) .
Gruntman is a professor of astronautics at USC , an author , and a mission co-investigator on IBEX .
Of ENAs he writes :
The interaction between charged and neutral particles is a common phenomenon in space plasmas .
Whenever an energetic ion undergoes a charge exchange process in a collision with a neutral background atom , an energetic neutral atom – ENA – is born .
Ion-electron recombination and neutral atom acceleration by the solar gravitation may also contribute to an ENA population under certain conditions .
ENAs are ubiquitous in space environment and their study opens a new window on various phenomena in space plasmas with a promise ( already partially realized ) to qualitatively improve our understanding of global magnetospheric and heliospheric processes .
Gruntman goes on to note that recording ENA fluxes as a function of observational direction allows us to create a global image , which is what we are doing with the interactions at our system ’s edge .
It ’s a method that is paying off handsomely , as Edmond Roelof , a co-investigator on the Magnetosopheric Imaging Instrument , points out :
“ Energetic neutral atom imaging has demonstrated its power to reveal the distribution of energetic ions , first in Earth ’s own magnetosphere , next in the giant magnetosphere of Saturn and now throughout vast structures in space - out to the very edge of our sun ’s interaction with the interstellar medium . ”
You can see an animation showing the interstellar medium flowing past the heliosheath here ( the heliosheath is a secondary bubble around the heliosphere formed by the interstellar medium ’s interactions with the latter ) .
Also note five papers published in Science Express this week on IBEX and Cassini , including Krimigis et al. , “ Imaging the Interaction of the Heliosphere with the Interstellar Medium from Saturn with Cassini , ” ( October 15 , 2009 ) .
Abstract available .
DETROIT  General Motors said Wednesday that it would shut down its Saturn division by next year after Roger Penske abruptly cut off talks to acquire the brand .
The Penske Automotive Group said it could not proceed with the deal because another auto manufacturer , which it did not identify , said it would not build vehicles to be distributed under the Saturn brand name .
The decision by Penske Automotive stunned G.M. and Saturn dealers , who had hailed Mr. Penske , who has built a track record of successful turnarounds , as the savior of the brand that G.M. was forced to sell as part of its government - financed bankruptcy reorganization .
“ Today ’s disappointing news comes at a time when we ’d hoped for a successful launch of the Saturn brand into a new chapter , ” G.M. ’s chief executive , Fritz Henderson , said in a statement .
“ We will be working closely with our dealers to ensure Saturn customers are cared for as we transition them to other G.M. dealers in the months ahead . ”
Bereits vor der Landtagswahl in Hessen hatte ich erklärt , warum deine Stimme für die Piratenpartei nicht verschenkt ist .
Jetzt steht die Bundestagswahl vor der
Tür und es ist höchste Zeit , den Artikel auf den neuesten Stand zu bringen .
Denn es ist viel passiert , in den letzten Wochen und Monaten .
Deine Stimme ist bei weitem nicht verschenkt .
Sie zählt – und zwar auf vielerlei Weisen .
5 % sind keine Utopie mehr Mit deiner Stimme unterstreichst du die Bedeutung der Ziele Deine Stimme zahlt sich aus Nach der Wahl ist vor der Wahl Nicht - Wähler stärken die etablierten Parteien Wer unehrlich wählt , verschenkt seine Stimme
1 ) 5 % sind keine Utopie mehr
Noch vor wenigen
Wochen habe ich es selbst belächelt : 5 % – natürlich nicht .
Doch die nicht abflachende Welle an Zustimmung , die die Piratenpartei seit einigen Monaten trägt ist überwältigend .
Da ist zum einen der nicht enden wollende Zustrom an engagierten Neumitgliedern und die damit einhergehende Ausbreitung bis in die letzten Winkel des Landes .
Da sind die Wähler , die an Infoständen auf uns zukommen und verkünden , dass sie uns wählen werden , oder per Briefwahl schon gewählt haben – die Presse , die uns immer stärker wahr und ernst nimmt und etablierte Politiker deren Angst spürbar wird .
Angefangen bei 0,3 % bei der ersten
Wahl in Hessen , über 0,5 % bei der dortigen Neuwahl und 0,9 % bei der Europawahl , hat sich die Piratenpartei mittlerweile auf fast 2 % ( Landtagswahl Sachsen ) hochgearbeitet und sitzt mittlerweile in den ersten Stadtparlamenten .
Der Aufwärtstrend ist klar erkennbar – nicht zuletzt trägt deine Stimme dazu bei .
5 % mögen unwahrscheinlich klingen , doch sie sind keine Utopie mehr .
2 ) Mit deiner Stimme unterstreichst du die Bedeutung der Ziele
Nach wie vor trägt deine Stimme für die Piratenpartei dazu bei , Themen wir Transparenz , Datenschutz , Netzpolitik und Bürgerrechte verstärkt in den politischen Diskurs einzubringen .
Mit jeder Stimme mehr für die Piratenpartei , wird es für die etablierten Parteien schwieriger , diese Themen zu ignorieren und an den Wählern vorbei zu diskutieren .
Zwar hat sich auch die Opposition mittlerweile einige Piraten - Themen auf die Fahnen geschrieben .
Aber wie glaubwürdig ist das ?
Die Grünen haben unter Rot -Grün mit den Otto - Katalogen selbst Überwachungsbefugnisse eingeführt und unter anderem die Vorratsdatenspeicherung mit vorbereitet !
Die FDP hat in Nordrhein - Westfalen erstmals heimliche Online - Durchsuchungen eingeführt , was aber zum Glück vom Bundesverfassungsgericht gekippt wurde .
Die Linken sitzen in der Berliner Landesregierung und haben die Videoüberwachung ausgeweitet .
In der Opposition redet es sich leicht , aber es kommt darauf an , was in der Regierung gemacht wird .
Dort haben alle etablierten Parteien versagt !
Um die Ziele der Piraten wirklich durchzusetzen , benötigen wir eine starke Piratenpartei .
3 ) Deine Stimme zahlt sich aus
Durch das hervorragende Ergebnis bei der Europawahl wird die Piratenpartei bereits bei der staatlichen Parteienfinanzierung berücksichtigt .
Jede einzelne Stimme bringt der Piratenpartei somit Geld für die politische Arbeit ein .
Deine Stimme zahlt sich im wahrsten Sinne des Wortes aus .
Aufgrund der Parteienfinanzierung sollte man über Proteststimmen gut nachdenken und immer im Hinterkopf behalten wen und was man damit finanziert .
Wer aus Protest z.B. NPD wählt , finanziert damit auch rechte Propaganda und Ausländerhetze !
Jede Stimme für die Piratenpartei hilft uns , mehr und vielfältigeres Werbe - und Informationsmaterial zu finanzieren , Räume für Info - Abende und Podiumsdiskussionen anzumieten und vieles mehr .
Das ist wichtig um noch bekannter zu werden , denn ein Großteil der Wähler kennt uns immer noch nicht .
4 ) Nach der Wahl ist vor der Wahl
Ja ja , der alte Spruch , ich weiß .
Aber es ist nunmal so .
In Rheinland - Pfalz z.B. stehen Anfang 2011 schon wieder Landtagswahlen an .
Ein gutes Ergebnis für die Piratenpartei setzt ein Zeichen !
Es ist ein Signal für die etablierten Parteien und für die Wähler , auch wenn die Piratenpartei unter 5 % bleibt .
Ab 3 % bekommt man bei vielen Umfrageinstituten einen eigenen Balken .
Viele derjenigen , die vorher zögerten werden dann erkennen : „ Meine Stimme hätte ja doch etwas gebracht .
Die Piratenpartei ist gar keine chancenlose Kleinpartei , sie hat wirklich die Chance auf 5 % ! “
Wenn es diesmal nicht klappt , dann wird es bei den nächsten Landtagswahlen klappen .
Setze mit deiner Stimme ein Zeichen , dass die Piratenpartei wirklich das Potential hat , in den Bundestag einzuziehen .
Rüttle die Zweifler wach !
5 ) Nicht - Wähler stärken die etablierten Parteien
Viele Nicht - Wähler sind immer noch der Meinung , sie signalisieren den etablierten Parteien durch ihren Boykott ihre Unzufriedenheit .
Diese Nachricht kommt bei den Etablierten nicht an .
Es ist ihnen schlicht egal , ob sie jetzt 30 % durch Millionen oder Tausende Wahlberechtigte bekommen haben .
Wer nicht wählt , signalisiert :
Es soll alles so bleiben wie es ist .
Prozentual gesehen kommt die Nicht - Wahl gerade den etablierten Parteien sogar zugute , da die Stimmen der eigenen Anhänger quasi mehr zählen .
Je besser das Ergebnis einer Partei ohnehin schon ist , desto stärker profitiert sie davon .
6 ) Wer unehrlich wählt , verschenkt seine Stimme
In einem Beitrag kürzlich hatte ich ja schonmal dazu aufgerufen : Wählt ehrlich !
Denn wer seine Stimme aus vermeintlich taktischen Gründen abgibt , verschenkt sie letztendlich .
Hand aufs Herz : Wem hat taktisches Wählen schonmal was gebracht ?
Was ist gut daran , eine Partei zu wählen , mit der man sich eigentlich gar nicht identifizieren kann , nur um eine andere zu verhindern ?
Die „ kleineren Übel “ regieren seit Jahrzehnten im Wechsel , unsere Grundrechte schwinden immer mehr dahin und die Politik entfernt sich weiter vom Bürger .
Schluss damit !
Es ist Zeit die Partei zu wählen , hinter der man wirklich steht .

Understanding a systemic banking crisis
Harald Uhlig
The recent crisis was like a bank run , but it did n’t quite fit .
This column describes six features that a model of the recent crisis ought to capture and describes a new theory with which we might analyse the crisis and policy responses .
Bryant ( 1980 ) and Diamond and Dybvig ( 1983 ) have provided us with the classic benchmark model for a bank run .
The financial crisis of 2007 and 2008 is reminiscent of a bank run , but not quite ( Brunnermeier 2008 ; Gorton 2009 ) .
The following six features summarise the prevalent view of many observers :
The withdrawal of funds was done by financial institutions ( in particular , money market funds and other banks ) at some core financial institutions ( I shall call them “ core banks ” for the purpose of this column ) rather than by depositors at their local banks .
The troubled financial institutions held their portfolios in asset - backed securities ( most notably tranches of mortgage - backed securities and credit default swaps ) rather than being invested directly in long - term projects .
These securities are traded on markets .
There is a large pool of investors willing to purchase securities .
For example , in the 2008 financial crisis , newly issued US government bonds were purchased at moderate discounts and the volume on stock markets was not low .
Nonetheless , investors were willing to buy the asset - backed securities during the crisis only at prices that are low compared to standard discounting of the entire pool of these securities .
The larger the market share of troubled financial institutions , the steeper the required discounts .
This perspective has possibly been crucial for a number of policy interventions , despite the inapplicability of the original Diamond - Dybvig framework .
This creates a gap in our understanding .
A new or at least a modified theory is needed .
My paper ( Uhlig , forthcoming ) seeks to contribute to filling that gap .
A systemic bank run is a situation in which early liquidity withdrawals by long - term depositors at some banks are larger and a bank run is more likely if other banks are affected by liquidity withdrawals too , i.e. the market interaction of the distressed banks is crucial .
This is different from a system - wide run , which may occur if all depositors view their banks as not viable , regardless of whether the depositors at other banks do too .
The goal is for the model to produce the stylised view , i.e. the six items listed above .
That stylised view may be entirely incorrect as a description of the 2008 financial crisis .
It is possible that the appropriate perspective is one of insolvency rather than illiquidity , and future research will hopefully sort this out .
Absent that clarification , it is worthwhile to analyse the situation from a variety of perspectives , including the one described above .
It turns out that items one to three are straightforward to incorporate , merely requiring some additional notation .
Item four ( large pool of investors ) is easy to incorporate in principle , but hard once one demands items five ( investors require discounts during crisis ) and six ( discount - market - share link ) as well .
Item six turns out to be particularly thorny to achieve and will be decisive in selecting one of two variants for modelling outside investors .
Here is the key argument .
Common to both variants , suppose that there are some unforeseen early withdrawals .
Therefore , core financial institutions need to sell part of their long - term securities , thereby incurring opportunity costs in terms of giving up returns at some later date .
Suppose that the remaining depositors ( or depositing institutions ) are the more inclined to withdraw early as well , the larger these opportunity costs are .
If a larger market share of distressed banks and therefore larger additional liquidity needs drive these opportunity costs up , then a wide spread run on the core banks is more likely ; this creates a systemic bank run .
Whether this happens depends on the market for the long - term securities , the outside investors , and the reasons for steep discounts of these securities , and it is here where the two variants differ .
In the first variant , I hypothesise that expert investors have finite resources , while the remaining vast majority of investors are highly uncertainty averse : they fear getting “ stuck ” with the worst asset among a diverse portfolio and are therefore not willing to bid more than the lowest price .
For the second variant , I assume that risk - neutral investors together with adverse selection create an Akerlof - style lemons problem ; liquid core banks have an incentive to sell their worst assets at a given market price , leading to a low equilibrium price .
Both models generate a downward sloping demand curve or , more accurately , an upward sloping period - 2 opportunity cost for providing period - 1 resources per selling long - term securities from the perspective of the individual core bank , holding aggregate liquidity demands unchanged .
However , the two variants have sharply different implications regarding the last item in the list above .
With uncertainty aversion , a larger market share of troubled institutions dilutes the set of expert investors faster , leading more quickly to steep period - 2 opportunity costs for providing period - 1 liquidity , and thereby setting the stage for a systemic bank run .
By contrast , with adverse selection , a larger pool of distressed institutions leads to less free - riding by unaffected core banks , thereby lowering the opportunity costs for providing liquidity .
I therefore argue that the 2008 financial crisis should be analysed and policy conclusions drawn using the tools of uncertainty aversion .
For example , with uncertainty aversion , a government purchase of assets above market price may be a good deal for the taxpayers under uncertainty aversion but not under adverse selection .
Generally , a number of current policy and regulatory proposals may be good to evaluate from that perspective .
One caveat , though .
The whole analysis has presupposed that the markets indeed underpriced the stock of securities .
My analysis has nothing to say whether that perspective is right or not .
This is for other researchers to decide .
An interesting investigation can be found in Huizinga and Laeven ( 2009 ) .

DURHAM , N.C. --
By taking advantage of the vagaries of the natural world , Duke University engineers have developed a novel approach that they believecan more efficiently harvest electricity from the motions of everyday life .
Energy harvesting is the process of converting one form of energy , such asmotion , into another form of energy , in this case electricity .
Strategiesrange from the development of massive wind farms to produce large amountsof electricity to using the vibrations of walking to power small electronicdevices .
Although motion is an abundant source of energy , only limited success hasbeen achieved because the devices used only perform well over a narrow bandof frequencies .
These so - called " linear " devices can work well , forexample , if the character of the motion is fairly constant , such as thecadence of a person walking .
However , as researchers point out , the paceof someone walking , as with all environmental sources , changes over timeand can vary widely .
" The ideal device would be one that could convert a range of vibrationsinstead of just a narrow band , " said Samuel Stanton , graduate student inDuke 's Pratt School of Engineering , working in the laboratory of BrianMann , assistant professor of mechanical engineering and materials sciences .
The team , which included undergraduate Clark McGehee , published the resultsof their latest experiments early online in Applied Physics Letters .
" Nature does n't work in a single frequency , so we wanted to come up with adevice that would work over a broad range of frequencies , " Stanton said .
" By using magnets to ' tune ' the bandwidth of the experimental device , wewere able verify in the lab that this new non-linear approach canoutperform conventional linear devices . "
Although the device they constructed looks deceptively simple , it was ableto prove the team 's theories on a small scale .
It is basically a smallcantilever , several inches long and a quarter inch wide , with an end magnetthat interacts with nearby magnets .
The cantilever base itself is made of apiezoelectric material , which has the unique property of releasingelectrical voltage when it is strained .
The key to the new approach involved placing moveable magnets of opposingpoles on either side of the magnet at the end of the cantilever arm .
Bychanging the distance of the moveable magnets , the researchers were able to " tune " the interactions of the system with its environment , and thusproduce electricity over a broader spectrum of frequencies .
" These results suggest to us that this non-linear approach could harvestmore of the frequencies from the same ambient vibrations , " Mann said .
" Moreimportantly , being able to capture more of the bandwidth makes it morelikely that these types of devices could someday rival batteries as aportable power source . "
The range of applications for non-linear energy harvesters varies widely .
For example , Mann is working on a project that would use the motion ofocean waves to power an array of sensors that would be carried inside oceanbuoys .
" These non -linear systems are self - sustaining , so they are ideal for anyelectrical device that needs batteries and is in a location that isdifficult to access , " Mann said .
For example , the motion of walking could provide enough electricity topower an implanted device , such as a pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator .
Ona larger scale , sensors in the environment or spacecraft could be poweredby the everyday natural vibrations around them , Mann said .

Yucca Mountain , a ridge of volcanic rock , has been the main focus of a federal program that has spent $ 10.4 billion seeking a repository for nuclear waste .
Opposition to such a repository has been fierce in Nevada , and President Obama spoke out against the project during his campaign .
In February , he released a proposed budget cutting off most of the money for Yucca Mountain and promised to appoint a commission to look into alternatives .
But even that has been delayed .
B. John Garrick , the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board , established by Congress in 1987 , said the White House had announced plans for a panel to review NASA about the same time it pledged to form the blue - ribbon commission on nuclear waste .
The space flight board has already been appointed , done its work and announced its findings , he said .
“ Anything nuclear is just very difficult , it seems , ” Mr. Garrick said .
Some experts on the nuclear industry have speculated that elected officials might prefer a report that comes after the midterm elections in 2010 , because the commission could recommend proceeding with Yucca Mountain .
Meanwhile , the government is continuing to pursue an operating license for Yucca , although the proposed financing for that work was slashed at the behest of the Senate majority leader , Harry Reid of Nevada , a strong opponent of the project .
Mr. Reid wants limited financing for the federal fiscal year beginning on Oct. 1 and none at all for the year after that .
How did Mary Shelley come up with the idea for “ Frankenstein ” ?
Did that spooky storytelling contest at the Villa Diodati in 1816 -- you know , the one with Byron , John Polidori and Mary ’s husband Percy -- send her imagination into high gear ?
Was it all the result of a nightmare ?
Sort of , but not exactly .
Richard Holmes ’ thrilling study of scientific discovery in the Romantic era , “ The Age of Wonder ” ( Pantheon : 552 pp. , $ 40 ) , spotlights many intriguing figures and their discoveries , but it ’s the chapter “ Dr. Frankenstein and the Soul ” that answers these questions by placing her famous story in the context of its times .
The years leading up to “ Frankenstein , ” Holmes explains , were a time -- well before Darwin ’s theories electrified the public -- when debates were raging over the existence of the soul and the animating force behind all life , called Vitalism .
“ Vitalism was the first great scientific issue that widely seized the public imagination in Britain , a premonition of the debate over Darwin ’s theory of evolution by natural selection , exactly forty years later . ”
Holmes hardly diminishes Shelley ’s achievement -- he just helps us to understand how “ Frankenstein ” was “ the most singular literary response to the Vitalism debate . ”
Mary , he says , gave “ playful form ” to the scientific speculations of the day -- had she lived in our time , I bet she would ’ve written thrillers about genomes or nanotechnology and given the late Michael Crichton a run for his money .
Advertisement
What Holmes does n’t mention is the role of Percy Shelley in the early manuscript -- and this omission makes Charles E. Robinson ’s edition “ The Original Frankenstein ” ( Vintage : 448 pp. , $ 14 paper ) the ideal complementary text to read beside Holmes ’ .
Check out the attribution on the book ’s cover : “ Mary Shelley with Percy Shelley ” -- how ’s that for a byline ?
Though Mary Shelley drafted the novel in two volumes , it was published in three different versions : 1818 ( in three volumes ) , 1823 ( in two volumes ) , 1831 ( in one volume , probably the one most of us know ) .
Robinson has edited the book to return us to the original draft ’s two - volume structure :
It ’s a version you ’ll probably wish you had had in high school -- I know I do -- because , even though the story is broken into two volumes , the chapters are shorter and the pacing is brisker .
This structure , Robinson points out , also enables the second volume to open dramatically as Mary Shelley first wanted -- with the voice of the creature , telling the story of his “ birth ” and tragic education in the cruelty of humankind .
Percy Shelley ’s contributions -- as editor and co-author of sorts -- are easy to locate : Robinson has italicized all of these , whether single words inserted to increase effect ( “ villain , ” “ thickened , ” “ devil ” ) or longer , more evocative phrases ( Victor Frankenstein ’s delirium leads him to imagine beings “ who visit him from the regions of a remoter world ” ) .

When Victor wanders the ice fields of the Alps after a double tragedy ( the death of his brother William by a mysterious killer ; the death of his servant Justine , who is blamed for the crime ) , he beholds “ Mont Blanc in awful majesty . ”
Those are Mary Shelley ’s words .
Then , her husband ’s pen takes over , adding physical details and the sense of awe you find in his poems :
“ The sea , or rather the vast river of ice , wound among its dependent mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses .
Their icy and glittering peaks shone in sunlight over the clouds . ”
Why did Percy Shelley add material ?
Did he think his wife was incapable of writing a novel on her own ?
Not at all for , as Robinson explains , “ collaboration seems to have been the hallmark ” of the couple ’s literary relationship .
They transcribed each other ’s work all the time and served as sounding - boards for ideas -- there was an easy interplay between them that was an enhancement , not a distraction , to their efforts .
Along with local color , her husband added layers to characters ’ personalities , as in the case of Elizabeth , Victor ’s beloved .
In a letter to Victor , for example , she includes a very Shelleyan political viewpoint that , even without italics , we would suspect belonged to him :
“ The republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it , ” Elizabeth declares .
Then , she adds : “ A servant at Geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in France or England . . . . ”

Other additions tell us unexpected things about the poet -- like his interest in the occult .
Did n’t know that ?
In her 2008 biography “ Being Shelley , ” Ann Wroe writes how the poet dabbled in black magic as a schoolboy , attempting to contact spirits .
Victor too confesses that his boyish preoccupation with raising ghosts and devils -- what a surprise ! -- was stirred by reading Gothic novels , which made such efforts seem easy .
It was “ a promise liberally accorded by my favorite authors , the fulfillment of which I most eagerly sought , ” following this with the sad admission that “ my incantations were always unsuccessful . ”
This edition of “ Frankenstein ” also includes a second version of the novel that strips away Percy ’s contributions to show what Mary Shelley “ brought to the writer ’s table . ”
It ’s a slog to get through and feels unnecessary -- Mary Shelley ’s imagination is n’t lessened by our seeing what her husband added in the book ’s early stages .
She was deeply engaged with theories of galvanism , reanimating human tissue and the life - force ( given magisterial treatment in Holmes ’ book ) and synthesized them in a fable that certainly is one of the earliest examples of science fiction -- a proposition that drives some literary snoots absolutely nuts .
Why should it ?
It ’s impossible to deny that such elements of that genre are there .
What they worry about , I think , is reductionism :
That calling “ Frankenstein ” a work of science fiction prevents it from being other things as well -- a meditation on mortality , religion and identity ; a vibrant retelling of the myth of Prometheus ; a melodramatic thriller ; and , as Robinson ’s fine edition suggests , the product of an extraordinary partnership between two evenly matched minds .
Dan Brown ’s pop wisdom :
At Killing the Buddha , you ’ll find a thoughtful , sympathetic essay by Samuel Biagetti about Dan Brown ’s “ The Lost Symbol ” which honors him as a premier “ pop philosopher and historian . ”
Titled “ Modernity ’s Fraternity :
Why the new Dan Brown book is a love letter to the Freemasons , ” the essay is extremely ( maybe too ) generous :
Advertisement
“ Brown ’s books do n’t rise very far above the grocery - store checkout aisle .
Nevertheless , his ambition outstretches any run-of - the - mill author of cheap thrillers .
. . .
However naive the novel may be , it testifies to the myths that helped to make the modern world , myths in which Brown places zealous faith .
In so doing , it reads like a love letter to Masonry . ”
I agree that this novel feeds the public ’s hunger for mystery , but it ’s that naivete that is worrisome , especially when it influences the opinions of such a large readership .
Biagetti also provides a thoughtful , expansive view of Freemasonry and the ancient quest for hidden knowledge .
Worth a read .
And still more conspiracies :
The Bilderberg Group , which Arthur Goldwag spends a handful of pages on in his book “ Cults , Conspiracies and Secret Societies ” ( reviewed in a previous Siren ’s column ) , is the subject of H. Paul Jeffers ’
“ The Bilderberg Conspiracy : Inside the World ’s Most Powerful Secret Society ” ( Citadel Press : 234 pp. , $ 14.95 paper ) .
Forget the Illuminati or Opus Dei ; those covens of troublemakers are nothing next to what the Bilderberg Group may be up to .
As Jeffers writes , the organization refers to international financiers , world leaders and others ( also referred to as the “ high priests of capitalism ” ) who first met in the Netherlands at the Hotel de Bilderberg in 1954 .
The group ’s founders include a member of the Rockefellers and Henry Kissinger , and information is sketchy about what goes on at its regular annual meetings .
These meetings are kept confidential , and the high level of secrecy has stirred angst that dark machinations on a global scale are underway .
Its 2009 meeting , earlier this year in Greece , in fact , was reported by one blogger as being about plans to remake the global political economy .
( Too bad they could n’t have worked on it before the implosion of the world financial markets . )
Advertisement
When groups employ secrecy -- whether we ’re talking Freemasons or members of the local school board -- suspicion is inevitable .
Bilderberg defenders say that secrecy enables members to speak candidly , more at ease , and foster better trans -Atlantic relationships -- that , in fact , is what Jeffers shows was behind the group ’s very first meeting .
Even if that is true , critics counter , that motive long since evolved into a sinister plot to create a “ New World Order . ”
They point to recent events -- the expansion of NATO , the progress of the European Union -- as sure signs that this dark plan is underway .
Jeffers does a thorough job of gathering information about the group ’s operations ( considering how difficult it is ) while reserving judgment .
His book ends simply , on two words : “ You decide . ”

Well , we can relax , because the bad old days of the Bush administration , when government agencies routinely spied on the antiwar movement and other dissidents , are over — right ?
Wrong – very wrong .
The indispensable Amy Goodman has the scoop : The Seattle Port Militarization Resistance ( SPMR ) group in Washington state thought their listserv coordinator , who went by the name " John Jacob , " was one of them : a dedicated antiwar activist and self - described anarchist .
They trusted him , they put him in a key position , they befriended him – and then they found out that he was a government informant .
His real name : John Towery ( here ‘s his myspace page , and here is a photo ) .
He claimed to be a civilian employee at Washington state ’s Ft. Lewis : in reality , he was and is a functionary of the force protection unit , i.e. military personnel .
His job : spying on the antiwar movement .
Towery was " outed " when one of SPMR ’s members filed a public records request in the city of Olympia for any documents , including emails , in the city ’s possession that referenced communications between the city police and the military regarding " anything on anarchists , anarchy , anarchism , Students for a Democratic Society or the Industrial Workers of the World , " as local antiwar activist Brendan Maslauskas Dunn described it to Amy Goodman on her " Democracy Now " program .
The results were startling : " I got back hundreds of documents from the city . "
It was in going through this material that he and his fellow activists discovered the truth about " John Jacob " : that he was a spy sent in to keep track of antiwar activity in the area , and a member of the Force Protection Service at Ft. Lewis .
His fellow activists confronted him , and , as Dunn stated :
" He admitted to several things .
He admitted that , yes , he did in fact spy on us .
He did in fact infiltrate us .
He admitted that he did pass on information to an intelligence network , which … was composed of dozens of law enforcement agencies , ranging from municipal to county to state to regional , and several federal agencies , including Immigration Customs Enforcement , Joint Terrorism Task Force , FBI , Homeland Security , the Army in Fort Lewis . …
He admitted to other things , too .
He admitted that the police had placed a camera , surveillance camera , across the street from a community center in Tacoma that anarchists ran called the Pitch Pipe Infoshop .
He admitted that there were police that did put a camera up there to spy on anarchists , on activists going there . "
Oh , but he had a story : it was n’t as bad as it seemed , he had n’t completely betrayed his friends and associates , who had known him since 2007 , when he first insinuated himself into local activist circles : because , you see , the Olympia and Tacoma cops had been planning to raid the Pitch Pipe Infoshop , as well as a house in Olympia where many activists lived , and they wanted their informant to tell them about all the guns , and drugs , and bombs that they imagined – hoped – were stockpiled there .
Because , as everyone knows , no self - respecting anarchist is ever without a bomb to throw .
" And , of course , " says Dunn , " John told them , no , we did n’t have any of that stuff .
He told them the truth . "
" Of course " is maybe giving Towery too much of the benefit of a doubt : after all , if his friends were arrested , and the anarchist " conspiracy " broken up , his intelligence - gathering activities would be rendered more difficult .
Perhaps
Dunn is allowing his residual feelings for someone he describes as a former " close friend " get in the way of a more realistic assessment .
Towery did his job all too well .
Be that as it may , this incident throws the spotlight on a shadowy national network of domestic spies – in effect , Obama ’s political police , who infiltrate dissident groups of whatever sort and send the information back to what are called " fusion centers , " part of the new " integrated " approach to fighting our eternal " war on terrorism " — a war that is n’t only being fought on the battlefields of Afghanistan .
The enemy is not just the Taliban – it ’s Americans , too .
And we are n’t just talking about the various weirdos and would - be mini-Osama bin Ladens , like John Allen Muhammad and John Lee Malvo .
The national hysteria over the alleged threat of " homegrown " terrorism is being stoked to a fever pitch by the latest FBI " catch , " a rural North Carolina " terrorist cell " supposedly headed by the proprietor of the local drywall contractor — a former " soldier of fortune " who allegedly fought in Afghanistan against the Soviets by the name of Daniel Patrick Boyd ( " also known as Mohammed " ) , and a good old boy if there ever was one .
The next logical stage in our carefully - stoked national hysteria is to cast the " anti-terrorist " net wider – to include antiwar organizations like SPMR , and Students for a Democratic Society ( SDS ) , which Towery took a particular interest in .
The antiwar movement is not a collection of " terrorist cells , " and yet that is precisely how the US government is dealing with them : infiltrating and spying on our organizations , planning " raids " on activist gathering places and homes , and no doubt engaging in further disruptive activities yet to be revealed .
How is this possible in the land of the free ?
It ’s possible – and , indeed , inevitable – due to the post - 9/11 national security industry that grew up in the wake of 9/11 .
A vast bureaucracy sprang up around the stream – nay , river – of tax dollars that flowed out of Washington in the wake of the worst terrorist attack on American soil in our history .
No expense was spared , no contractor was left behind – and the money spigot has only been opened wider now that Obama and his Keynesian advisors have decreed we must spend our way out of the economic recession .
All these people , busily compiling " intelligence " on anything deemed " suspicious , " are a police state waiting to be born .
The " fusion centers " are the product of a supposedly " wholistic " theory of intelligence - gathering adopted by the burgeoning Homeland Security bureaucracy in the post - 9/11 era , an approach that integrates the personnel and facilities of various government agencies and pools them in designated " fusion centers . "
Fusing the civilian and the military , the local cop on the beat and the national security bureaucracy , the new apparatus of surveillance and repression is the virtual embodiment of government " work . "
Unable to get anywhere near Al Qaeda , they have to produce something to justify their funding , and naturally began to broaden the definitional limits of the " terrorist " label to include an ever - widening array of " suspicious " activities .
The antiwar movement soon came into their purview , and the rest , as they say , is history .
Towery apparently worked for one such " fusion center , " located at Ft. Lewis , where he routinely transmitted information about local antiwar organizations to federal , state , and local law enforcement agencies , including military intelligence , the FBI , Homeland Security , and the immigration authorities .
With his intimate knowledge of the politics and personal activities of every key member of the local " radical " scene – quite aside from having the names , addresses , phone numbers , and other personal information of every person on the local antiwar listserv – he was a valuable asset to anyone who wanted to throw a monkey wrench into the works .
What every local activist , and anyone who ’s ever signed their name to an antiwar petition or attended a meeting , needs to ask themselves is : how many other " John Jacob "s are hanging around – and to what purpose ?
It ca n’t happen here ?
It has happened here .
You wo n’t hear or read about this in the " mainstream " media : Amy Goodman ’s " Democracy Now " broke the story , and it has n’t gone much further than that .
The reason : the media is in the tank for Obama , and they do n’t want to further tarnish his " progressive " credentials .
After all , it ’s bad enough he ’s following the Bushian path on government secrecy , detainee policy , and the unprecedented expansion of presidential power .
Now that the Democrats are in power , they ’re for all these things – because , after all , the Good Guys hold the reins .
I can hear the Obama cultists now :
They would never spy on the antiwar movement – why , for goodness sakes , most of those antiwar types voted for Obama !
And now he ’s sent his spies to disrupt their organizations ?
I do n’t believe it !
Yet that , in effect , is what happened : not that the President personally ordered " Agent Orange " – as Towery was known on the listserv – to infiltrate and spy on the Washington antiwar movement .
It was n’t necessary : the " fusion centers " that dot the American landscape are merely doing what spy agencies are supposed to do , and they ’re doing the same thing under President Obama that they did under George W. Bush .
Obama has n’t put a stop to it because he ’s fighting an expanded version of the same war , and is loath to let a bunch of left - wing hippies stand in his way .
We have been through this before : go back and read Seymour Hersh ’s exposés of government " cointelpro " operations conducted on antiwar activists and other dissidents during the 1970s .
The Socialist Workers Party , at one point , had something close to a majority of police agents in its ranks , and the SWP case is a particularly egregious example of what was a widespread phenomenon during that tumultuous era .
It looks to me like we are going back in time , rather than progressing – an odd phenomenon when you consider that there ’s an alleged " progressive " in the White House .
To get a handle on what ’s happening , consider the thoroughly reactionary Friedrich Nietzsche ’s theory of " eternal recurrence " – with the added fillip that each time some infamous chapter in our history repeats itself , the brazen hypocrisy of the miscreants grows worse .
At least with people like Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover , we had some kind of ideological consistency and honesty : those guys thought they had the right – and the duty — to carry out their crimes against the Constitution , and did n’t make any bones about it .
It ’s the " progressives , " who claim fealty to civil libertarian values , and yet countenance the Obama administration ’s continuation and expansion of the surveillance state , that are the real danger .
Because they manage to fool an awful lot of people – the very same people who wrote to me in anger and puzzlement when I first began to take on the Obama -ites .
Give him a chance , they whined .
He ’s only just gotten into office .
Okay , well , he ’s had his chance , and he has n’t taken it .
President Obama is presiding over an even wider war than George W. Bush ever dreamed of , and because of that the antiwar movement is a natural target for his spy agencies , whose reach continues to grow .
Why any of this is surprising to anyone is beyond me , but then again I ’ve not been inducted into the Obama cult .
One wonders what it will take for what passes for the " left " these days to wake up .
If I were them , I would heed the words of Murray Rothbard , the great libertarian theorist and onetime ally of the New Left , and apply it to their own movement :
" For the libertarian , the main task of the present epoch is to … discover who his friends and natural allies are , and above all , perhaps , who his enemies are . "
Thilo Sarrazin , a Bundesbank director who criticized Turkish and Arab immigrants in a recent interview , has been punished by his employer and may lose his job .
Apart from receiving threats by Islamist extremists , he may also be taken to court by the German authorities on charges of “ incitement to racial hatred . ”
For many Germans , however , the 64 - year old Mr. Sarrazin , who until last May was Finance Minister in the regional government of the state of Berlin for the Social - Democrat SPD , is a hero .
Last week Axel Weber , the president of the Bundesbank , Germany ’s equivalent of the FED , needed body guards on an official visit to Istanbul .
Normally , the head of the German central bank never travels with body guards , but life at the Bundesbank has changed since two weeks ago .
Lettre International , a German cultural magazine based in Berlin , published an interview with Thilo Sarrazin , in which the Bundesbank director criticized the unwillingness of Turkish and Arab immigrants to assimilate into German society .
The interview provoked the anger of these very immigrants .
Immigrant groups accuse Mr. Sarrazin of espousing the “ racist views of the far right . ”
In contemporary Europe , leading a life surrounded by body guards has become normal for people such as Geert Wilders , a Dutch politician who criticizes the Islamization of his native land , and Kurt Westergaard , a Danish cartoonist who made a drawing depicting the Muslim Prophet Muhammad with a bomb in his turban .
Thilo Sarrazin has now joined their ranks .
His boss Mr. Weber , however , does not want to become the target of angry Muslims .
He has apologized to everyone who might feel offended by the “ discriminatory comments ” of the Bundesbank official .
Indeed , the Bundesbank issued a statement distancing itself in the strongest terms from the interview .
It also demoted Sarrazin ; he may even be fired altogether .
In the Lettre International interview , Sarrazin talked about the economic and cultural situation in his hometown of Berlin .
He argued that Berlin has been unable to recover the cultural and economic status and prestige it had before the Second World War .
Even its contemporary population figure of 3.2 million is lower than the pre-war 4 million .
Sarrazin says that Berlin ’s dynamics was broken when the city lost its Jews .
The Jewish elite was driven out and instead the city acquired a Turkish and Arab underclass .
“ The large scale disappearance of the Jews could never be compensated , ” Sarrazin said .
“ Thirty percent of physicians and lawyers , eighty percent of all theatre directors in Berlin in 1933 were of Jewish origin .
Commerce and banking were also largely Jewish .
All this has vanished ; it was also a considerable intellectual loss .
Sixty to seventy percent of the extermination and expulsion of the Jews in the German speaking countries affected Berlin and Vienna . ”
Sarrazin argued that during the Cold War , ambitious and dynamic people moved away from the highly - subsidized West Berlin while left - wing activists and drop - outs took their place .
Meanwhile a Turkish and Arab underclass was imported , which also lives mostly off government subsidies without making economic contributions to the city .
“ Berlin has a bigger problem than elsewhere of an underclass that does not take part in the normal economic cycle .
Many Arabs and Turks in this city , whose numbers have grown as a result of wrong policies , have no productive function except selling fruit and vegetables , ” Sarrazin said .
The plight of his home town makes him very bitter .
He lashed out at what he called policies that were “ too plebeian ” instead of elitist .
“ Anyone who can do something and strives for something with us is welcome .
The rest should go elsewhere , ” Sarrazin told Lettre International .
The Turks , however , “ are conquering Germany in the same way that the Kosovars conquered Kosovo : through their high birthrate . [… ]
I do not need to acknowledge anyone who lives off the state , rejects this country , does not take proper care of the education of his children and keeps producing little girls in headscarves . ”
Since the publication of the interview , Sarrazin has received threats from Islamists .
The Social - Democratic SPD Party has started a procedure to oust him from its ranks .
He has also been criticized by the Zentralrat der Juden ( Central Council of Jews ) , whose General - Secretary Stephan Kramer compared his comments about Turkish and Arab immigrants to the “ opinions of Göring , Goebbels and Hitler . ”
The Berlin prosecutor is currently examining whether Mr. Sarrazin can be prosecuted for the crime of “ racial incitement . ”
An opinion poll indicated , however , that 51 percent of the Germans agree with what Mr. Sarrazin said .
Conservative newspapers , such as Die Welt , the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , and the mass circulation Bild have come to his defense , arguing that he has merely stated uncomfortable facts .
Prominent Germans , such as former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and the writers Henryk Broder and Ralph Giordano , have also spoken out in support of the Bundesbank official .
Helmut Schmidt , the nonagenarian former leader of the Social - Democrat SPD , said that the presence of seven million immigrants in Germany are proof “ of a wrong development for which the political class [ of the past 15 years ] is responsible . ”
It would have been better , Mr. Schmidt told the weekly magazine Focus , that those who refuse to integrate into German society “ had been left outside . ”
He added that “ The further inflow of people from Eastern Anatolia or Black Africa will not solve the problem [ of Germany ’s ageing population ] , but will only create an enormous new problem . ”
Ralph Giordano said that Sarrazin ’s analysis was “ right on the mark . ”
Henryk Broder stated that he “ does not even go far enough . ”
Since both Messrs . Giordano and Broder are Jewish , their support for Mr. Sarrazin has earned them severe criticism from the Central Council of Jews , whose Mr. Kramer derisively called both men “ Jewish intellectuals . ”
On October 14th , Jasper von Altenbockum , an editorialist of the influential Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , wrote in his paper that Mr. Sarrazin ’s frank remarks were proof of his great “ civil courage . ”
“ Civil courage is more than just courage .
It is also a service to the state , whose legal constitutions and social achievements are worth defending . ”
Mr. Altenbockum criticized those who accuse Sarrazin of acting irresponsibly and foolishly .
“ In a civil society it is not considered foolish to risk one ’s own existence when one defends the civil society and its freedoms and security .
What is foolish , is for the civil society to punish those who act thus . ”
GAMBLERS who adopt a well - known probability strategy to beat the house at blackjack beware – UK researchers have developed an automated system that will detect card counters before they can cash in .
Card counting , a strategy made famous by the film Rain Man , involves remembering which cards have been played , and which might be likely to turn up .
An abundance of low - value cards in the discard pile can tip the odds slightly in favour of the gambler , and a card counter bets big only then .
The strategy is n’t illegal , but casinos will move suspected card counters to a new table , where …

A NEW interpretation of the Bible suggests that God did not create the Earth , but stumbled upon it while looking for a magazine .
Dr Nathan Muir , a leading Hebrewologist , said the misunderstanding arose from the traditional translation of the word ' bara ' which , he claims , does not mean ' to create ' but to ' move the chest of drawers out a bit because it could easily have fallen down the back ' .
He said : " Genesis clearly tells the story of God searching for an old copy of Omnipotent Digest that contained a picture of an otter giving a ' thumbs up ' gesture .
" He had told one of His friends that it was very amusing and had promised to see if He could n't dig it out .
" The passage goes on to describe how , while searching for the magazine , God found His spare set of van keys that He thought
He 'd lost ages ago , and then a blue - green ball thing that He considered taking outside for a kickabout before realising it was covered in tiny creatures . "
Dr Muir admitted that it was still unclear how the Earth ended up in God 's vast living room .
" It seems God lived in an infinitely massive shared house with three other supreme beings , and one of them may have left it lying around .
The text reads , ' And God said lo , is this anyone 's , because if it's not then I might have it , if that 's alright . "
But creationists have dismissed Dr Muir 's interpretation , insisting any theory other than God constructing absolutely everything in six days , five and a half thousand years ago was ' dangerously unhinged ' .
Rev Martin Bishop , of the First Church of the Immaculate Contraption , said : " The passage actually reads , ' And God did ask the beasts of the field , 'has anyone seen the magazine with the picture of that universe I created ? ' "

The House of Representatives officially rebuked Republican Joe Wilson on Tuesday for shouting " You lie ! " in the middle of President Obama 's health care address to a joint session of Congress .
The South Carolina lawmaker 's outburst last week was a " breach of decorum , " according to the resolution , which states that the House " disapproves " of his behavior .
The resolution passed 240 - 179 , largely along party lines .
Seven Republicans broke with their leadership to support it ; 12 Democrats were opposed .

Joe Wilson Voted to Provide Taxpayer Money for Illegal Immigrants ' Healthcare By Donny Shaw 11 Sep 2009 On Wednesday night , Rep. Joe Wilson [ R , SC - 2 ] , shouted " You lie ! " at President Obama when he said that the healthcare bill would not cover illegal immigrants .
" The supporters of the government takeover of healthcare and liberals who want to give healthcare to illegals are using my opposition as an excuse to distract from the critical questions being raised about this poorly conceived plan , " Wilson said the next day in a campaign fundraising video .
However , in 2003 [ under Bush ] , Wilson voted to provide federal funds for illegal immigrants ' healthcare .
The vote came on the Medicare Prescription Drug , Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 , which contained Sec. 1011 authorizing $ 250,000 annually between 2003 and 2008 for government reimbursements to hospitals who provide treatment for uninsured illegal immigrants .
The program has been extended through 2009 and there is currently a bipartisan bill in Congress to make it permanent .
[ Wilson obviously has no problem funding undocumented workers ' health care , as long as the ' president ' is white .

The House of Representatives appears headed for a vote to formally rebuke Rep. Joe Wilson this week for heckling President Obama after the South Carolina Republican refused Sunday to apologize on the House floor .
" The House likely will take up a resolution , " Brendan Daly , a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , told USA TODAY .
" He violated the decorum of the House ; it has to be resolved in the House . "

Joe Wilson , who faces possible censure in the U.S. House of Representatives for shouting " You lie ! " during President Barack Obama 's speech to Congress on healthcare reform , said on Sunday he would not apologize again .

Boy , Oh , Boy By Maureen Dowd 13 Sep 2009
Surrounded by middle - aged white guys -- a sepia snapshot of the days when such pols ran Washington like their own men ’s club -- Joe Wilson yelled “ You lie ! ” at a president who did n’t .
But , fair or not , what I heard was an unspoken word in the air :
You lie , boy ! ... The congressman , we learned , belonged to the Sons of Confederate Veterans , led a 2000 campaign to keep the Confederate flag waving above South Carolina ’s state Capitol and denounced as a " smear " the true claim of a black woman that she was the daughter of Strom Thurmond , the ' 48 segregationist candidate for president .
Wilson clearly did not like being lectured and even rebuked by the brainy black president presiding over the majestic chamber .
... Wilson ’s shocking disrespect for the office of the president -- no Democrat ever shouted " liar " at W. when he was hawking a fake case for war in Iraq -- convinced me :
Some people just can’t believe a black man is president and will never accept it .
" Joe the Heckler " Wilson Newest GOP Star By R J Shulman 12 Sep 2009
While not as snappy as " I have not yet begun to fight " or " give me liberty or give me death , " the words " you lie , " hurled at President Barack Obama by South Carolina Representative Joe Wilson , has catapulted the little - known congressman into the new Republican sensation .
" With just two words , Joe was able to wrestle the spotlight away from Obama and his fascist communistic plans for a government takeover of health care , complete with death panels and doctor rationing , " said Senator Chuck Grassley , Republican of Iowa .
( Satire )
House plans to admonish Rep. Wilson over outburst -- While not a formal censure or reprimand , the resolution , if passed as expected , would put Congress on record as condemning Wilson 's conduct .
11 Sep 2009 Democratic leaders are planning a House vote early next week to admonish Republican Rep. Joe Wilson if he does not apologize on the House floor for yelling " You lie ! " during President Barack Obama 's health care address to Congress .
National attention from the heckling episode has money pouring into Wilson 's campaign treasury and that of his 2010 Democratic challenger .
Democratic leaders decided at a meeting late Thursday that they probably will propose a resolution of disapproval early next week if Wilson does n't apologize to Congress , said Brendan Daly , a spokesman for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Dem leaders renew push for Wilson censure 10 Sep 2009 Joe Wilson 's flat refusal to apologize to the entire House for heckling President Obama has rekindled a push by top Democrats to introduce a censure resolution -- despite Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's earlier refusal to consider the idea , sources tell me .
Majority Whip James Clyburn ( D - SC ) and Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) are once again considering the move after Wilson adamantly refused to offer a mea culpa in the well of the House -- after Clyburn buttonholed him on the floor .
Joe Wilson : ' I will not be muzzled '
11 Sep 2009 Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - Racist - SC ) released a fiery fundraising appeal late Thursday , calling himself a target of the left and vowing to push forward in his battle against President Obama ’s health care reform effort .
" … I will not be muzzled .
I will speak up loudly against this risky plan , " Wilson says in the video appeal on his campaign Web site .
Wilson ’s factual failure worse than his incivility -- Even Bush , an actual liar , was granted enough respect not to be yelled at during a speech By Keith Olbermann 10 Sep 2009 But Congressman — you 're not supposed to be a Town Hall panicker , you 're not supposed to be a Rube defending the efficacy of the Snake Oil , you are a Congressman — and still you were wrong at the top of your voice !
Town Halls , Death Panels , Oligarhys , a multi-racial president who is accused of hating half his own ancestry , neuroses about communist artwork , the idea that fascism and socialism are n't mutually exclusive , grass - roots protests bought and paid for by lobbyists and corporations , scared seniors terrified enough to turn to insurance companies for protection against reformers who want to increase their coverage and cut their rates , birchers , birthers , deathers , the voices in Michele Bachmann 's head , the Republican rebuttal to the President of the United States given by a guy who thought he could become " Lord Boustany " by paying a couple of English con men .
Wilson's ' Spontaneous ' Outburst 10 Sep 2009 8:11 PM Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) addressed reports about the implications of his " you lie " outburst during President Obama 's health care address .

Strange Bedfellows
In its attempt to stomp out the pro-Uighur movement in its restive western autonomous region , Xinjiang , China might be looking for help from a surprising partner : its major rival in the region , India , according to a recent report in the South China Morning Post .
The two countries do n’t have a history of ground - level cooperation on counterterrorism — far from it — but they could end up moving in that direction as the anarchy in the North Waziristan area of Pakistan begins to spill over into China as well as India .
But major questions remain :
How far will China go to win India ’s help ?
And is Beijing sincerely looking for advice , or just fishing for intelligence from the other rising powerhouse in Asia ?
Before attempting to answer these questions , it ’s important to note that the pro-Uighur movement in Xinjiang is actually two distinct movements .
First , there ’s Western media darling Rebiya Kadeer ‘s Munich - based group , the World Uyghur Congress ( WUC ) , which has been a major irritant to the Chinese , launching demonstrations that led to July ’s riots in Urumqi .
But the Chinese government is also contending with a lesser - known , but more threatening Uighur group — the East Turkestan Islamic Movement ( ETIM ) , which draws its funding and membership not from the West , as with the WUC , but from the Uighur diaspora in Pakistan , the Persian Gulf , and Turkey .
The ETIM labels itself an agitator for the religious rights of Xinjiang Muslims .
It looks upon Xinjiang , which the Uighurs call East Turkestan , as a traditionally Muslim land that has been occupied by non-Muslims .
Unlike the WUC , which focuses on Uighur ethnicity — not religion — the ETIM ’s ideology is pan-Islamic , and it claims to fight for the restoration of Eastern Turkestan to the ummah , or the worldwide Muslim community .
The Chinese claim that more than 1,000 ETIM members had been trained by al Qaeda in Afghanistan before the September 11 terrorist attacks , but their claim is treated with some skepticism by the United States and refuted firmly by the ETIM leadership .
Still , the U.S. State Department said in 2005 that the two groups were linked , and the United States has listed ETIM , which is based in North Waziristan , as a terrorist organization since 2002 .
Because of the ETIM ’s suspected links with al Qaeda and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , another terrorist group operating from North Waziristan , China has reached out to its ally Pakistan for help .
But repeated requests to Pakistan for action against the terrorist infrastructure of the ETIM have not produced satisfactory results .
Pakistan arrested and deported to China some identified anti-Beijing Uighurs , but it has not been able to dismantle the ETIM ’s terrorist infrastructure , as China had hoped .
Nor has Pakistan been able to offer much help on the intelligence front , due to the government ’s weakness in Waziristan .
After China ’s striking out with Pakistan , then , it seems only logical that Beijing should move on to India — asking not for operations against the ETIM infrastructure , but for intelligence .
There has so far been no reliable information that India has received such a request .
But a request to New Delhi would probably not bring the results Beijing wants .
For one thing , the focus of Indian intelligence is Pakistani Punjab and Pakistan - occupied Kashmir , the source of most terrorist threats to India .
Thus Indian intelligence is not particularly well - informed on the Waziristan area .
Second , China has never criticized Pakistan - sponsored terrorism against India .
There is , therefore , no built - up reservoir of goodwill that would induce India to help China with its ETIM problem .
Still , the request itself , if correct , is part of a larger movement toward greater cooperation between the two countries on counterterrorism efforts .
Since 2002 , China has welcomed meetings between Chinese and Indian counterterrorism experts to exchange views and assessments on the state of jihadi terrorism in the region , hoping to benefit from India ’s experience and expertise on this subject .
India has responded positively to the general Chinese interest , and the cooperation has been expanding through mechanisms such as a joint working group on terrorism that periodically exchanges views and assessments and the joint counterterrorism exercises by the countries ’ armies that allow each country to learn from the other ’s tactics .
This new partnership only goes so far , however : Although cooperation against acts of terrorism will continue to expand , the chances of China and India working together against terrorist organizations are remote .
The two countries agree on what constitutes an act of terrorism , but not on which are the terrorist organizations of the region .
China , for example , agrees with Pakistan ’s view that the violence in Kashmir is a freedom struggle and not terrorism .
It has also blocked a consensus in the U.N. Security Council on declaring certain Pakistani organizations terrorists , against India ’s wishes .
And China — hoping to maintain good relations with Pakistan in order to keep the threat of a two - front war hanging over India ’s head — is unlikely to change its mind on these positions , no matter how unhappy it gets over Pakistan ’s failure to stamp out the ETIM in North Waziristan .
Working with China on ground - level counterterrorism is also difficult for India because India has the second - largest Muslim population in the world after Indonesia , and members of this community might not want India to help China in what they see as repression of their coreligionists .
What ’s more , the pro-West Uighurs led by Kadeer are close with the Dalai Lama , who is based in India and commands considerable respect there not only as a Buddhist leader , but also as a thorn in the Chinese side .
He and the large Tibetan refugee population in India would oppose helping the Chinese out in Xinjiang .
More broadly , relations between China and India in most other areas , though improving , still have their problems , which act as speed bumps : the ongoing border dispute , Indian allegations of the dumping of cheap Chinese goods , competition for oil and gas , and naval competition in the Indian Ocean .
However , cooperation over counterterrorism , if it comes about , could bring the two Asian giants closer together .

The unemployment rate checked in last Friday at 9.7 percent , but let ’s toss that aside and talk about the real rate – 16.8 percent .
That ’s the so - called U - 6 rate that includes people on unemployment , those whose benefits have run out , people who ’ve given up , and people who are working part time for economic reasons .
That ’s the national rate .
But there are pockets where things are far worse , such as California .
There , according to the San Francisco Chronicle , 40 percent of “ working age ” Californians are unable to find a job .
The figure comes from a Sacramento - based research group called the California Budget Project .
The organization published a 19 - page Labor Day Special Report that notes : “ The current recession stands apart from prior downturns for both the depth and breadth of destruction in the job market .
California has lost more jobs at a faster rate in the past two years than during any prior recession for which data are available , and employment has fallen in nearly every major sector of the economy . ”
The report predicted that the state ’s unemployment rate would remain in double digits through 2011 , and said even a return to modest GDP growth would likely result in a jobless recovery .
Now , for the health implications .
Another Labor Day report published by Rutgers University based on a survey of long - term unemployed , as well as newly unemployed , warns that a tidal wave of related mental - health problems are washing over the nation , from coast to coast .
“ Three - quarters of the still jobless report stress in their daily lives , two - thirds report being depressed , three - fifths feel helpless , and more than half say they ’re angry , ” the report said .
“ Significant numbers report having trouble sleeping , avoiding social situations , strained family relations , and increased substance dependency . ”
The report ( full release can be downloaded here ) was based on a “ scientific sampling ” of 1,200 Americans unemployed and looking for work over the last 12 months .
The 894 who were still out of work at the time of the survey were described as “ shaken , traumatized people coping with serious financial and psychological effects from an economic downturn of epic proportions . ”
Carl Van Horn , director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development , which conducted the research , said : “ Millions of unemployed Americans are suffering economic and personal catastrophes .
This is not your ordinary dip in the business cycle .
Americans believe that this is the Katrina of recessions .
Folks are on their rooftops without a boat .
The water is rising , and many see no way out . ”
More than half have borrowed money from relatives or friends .
A quarter have missed mortgage , rent or credit card payments .
Half are optimistic – but half are pessimistic – that they will be able to find a new job .
More than a quarter of those laid off were earning more than $ 75,000 ; an equal percentage had at least a four - year degree .
It ’s fair to say that many employed people are nervous about what may happen next .
Unemployment issues have been mostly discussed in the media , and by elected officials , in economic contexts .
I think it ’s pretty obvious that they should become part of the health care debate as well .

Swiftboating Same - Sex Marriage in Maine
This first appeared in these pages in October 2009 , just before the election in which Maine ’s same - sex marriage law was overturned .
I post it again so that the lessons from three years ago can be built on .

Special to Dirigo Blue , Karen Ocamb is a journalist in southern California , and covered last summers fight over Proposition 8 , the ballot measure that nullified a ruling by that State ’s Supreme Court allowed same - sex couples to marry .
I thank her for this informative and thorough history of the Prop 8 campaign , and what it may portend for Maine .

The Religious Right is Swiftboating Same Sex Marriage in Maine
By Karen Ocamb
News editor , Frontiers in LA
“ God has no grandchildren , ” the evangelical ex-Marine father of my late friend Chip Howe said , explaining how he surrendered judgment and came to accept Chip ’s homosexuality .
Chip , a Lieutenant in the Navy during the Vietnam War , was supposed to get married and provide his parents with grandchildren .
Chip ’s father thought being gay meant that would never happen .
That was in 1990 , before there was any real hope for marriage rights for same sex couples .
Though Chip had known love before he died , he never got to experience the fruition of his constitutional right to pursue happiness – marriage and a family of his own .
The story is instructive because Religious Right professionals have succeeded in making it appear as if all people of faith are antigay and anti-marriage equality .
Worse yet , they are using religion as an excuse to perpetrate lies and deception – to swiftboat same sex couples in the name of God , when in fact they are just advancing another end - justifies - the - means political scheme .
That ’s what happened in California and that ’s what is now underway in Maine as opponents of same sex marriage fight to prevent Maine ’s marriage equality law from taking effect though a referendum on the Nov. 3 ballot .
State Sen. Larry Bliss ( D - South Portland ) got to the heart of the issue in his Sept. 28 op - ed response to Rev. Bob Emrich ’s Aug. 26 Maine Voices column advocating passage of the anti-gay Question 1 .
Bliss wrote :
“ Do we want a Maine where Rev. Emrich and his supporters tell the rest of us who can be a family and who can love whom ?
Marriage equality upholds traditional Maine values of personal freedom and equality by respecting the right of every Mainer to marry the person he or she loves .
That ’s the Maine I live in .
Those are the values I hold dear . ”
Watch Out Maine
But that ’s not the Maine residents will recognize in the next two months as the Proposition 1 political campaign heats up .
This Sunday , Sept. 13 , for instance , Maine Jeremiah Project ’s Emrich and the National Organization for Marriage with their Stand for Marriage Maine coalition ( S4MM ) are holding a rally featuring some of the big guns in the Religious Right professional world – Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council ( FRC ) , Pastor Chris Clark from San Diego , and via video , Focus on the Family ’s Dr. James Dobson .
The purpose of the rally is to galvanize their conservative Christian base and help organize an army of volunteers and a network of churches to “ Impact Maine Culture , ” as described on the Maine Jeremiah Project website .
Apparently the media is not being allowed into the event .
California also experienced a pre-election onslaught of out - of - state Religious Right professionals – including Perkins and Dobson – for a massive rally in San Diego dubbed TheCall .
( Religious Right watcher Bruce Wilson , who is straight , later described on the Huffington Post how TheCall ’s organizer Lou Engle is tied to violent Religious Right extremists . )
Perhaps the most widely publicized religious involvement in California ’s Prop 8 battle was by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints ( LDS ) , more commonly referred to as the Mormon Church .
Protect Marriage / Yes on 8 campaign manger Frank Schubert said members of the Mormon Church eventually contributed “ somewhere in the $ 20 million range , so about half of what we raised – which we were very grateful for . ”
Progressive California Courage Campaign founder Rick Jacobs and the Rev. Eric Lee , director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , held a news conference outside the Mormon Church in LA after church elders asked members to sacrifice to fund Yes on 8 – which they did , getting second mortgages and dipping into their scarce savings .
In fact , on Nov. 3 , 2008 , blogger hekebolos published a leaked internal memo on Daily Kos that seem to indicate that Mormon leaders had been working to prevent marriage equality in California and Hawaii since 1997 , recruiting local California Catholic bishops to serve as the front for the operation .
The story was later picked up by blogger Jim Burroway at Box Turtle Bulletin , which expanded the reach to Arizona .
With a prominent member of the Mormon Church on the National Organization for Marriage ’s ( NOM ) board of directors , longtime politico Fred Karger publically challenged NOM founder Maggie Gallagher over whether NOM is really a “ front ” for the Mormon Church .
Last month , Karger , founder of Californians Against Hate , pressed the question , asking whether Maine ’s Stand for Marriage PAC might be receiving funds “ laundered ” through groups such as NOM .
The Maine Commission of Government Ethics and Election Practices will consider Karger ’s official request for an investigation on Oct. 1 in Augusta .
Not all Mormons backed Prop 8 or appreciated what the church did in their name .
Famous former San Francisco 49er quarterback Steve Young , for instance , who is a descendant of Mormon founder Brigham Young , opposed Prop 8 , posting “ No on 8 ” signs in front of his Palo Alto home and his wife Barbara contributed $ 50,000 .
And many non-Mormon residents of Utah worried about whether a growing backlash ” over Mormon involvement might impact the state .
Spiritual Warfare
But to hear the Religious Right professionals talk about it , the campaign over Prop 8 in California was “ spiritual warfare , ” a cataclysmic battle between good and evil .
Chuck Colson , Watergate felon and founder of the Prison Fellowship Ministries , said this on a Yes on 8 video produced by the American Family Association for widespread distribution to pastors and Christian activists :
“ This vote on whether we stop the gay marriage juggernaut in California is the Armageddon .
We lose this , we ’re going to lose in a lot of other ways , including freedom of religion . ”
Catholics for Protect Marriage leader Bill May told the Associated Press :
This [ California ]
Supreme court decision was a huge wake - up call for Catholics .
It was shocking .
The sense is that this is the last chance to restore the definition of marriage , and if unsuccessful , it is going to have serious ramifications for California and across the nation .
FRC ’s National Prayer Director Rev. Pierre Bynum said in an email :
“ Thirty - five years of an American abortion holocaust , the civil imposition of homosexual ‘ marriage ’ upon America and the indoctrination of America ’s public school children in pro-homosexual ideology are practices that a Holy God will not tolerate . ”
FRC President Tony Perkins wrote in an e-mail :
“ The future of our nation hangs in the balance ! ”
And Jim Garlow , pastor of the evangelical Skyline Church in San Diego County , told AP :
“ This is not political to us .
We see it as very spiritual . ”
Garlow was one of the organizers of TheCall in San Diego ’s Qualcomm Stadium , which was designed to mobilize “ God ’s Army ” for a war between “ Darkness versus Light . ”
“ We would not have won without people of faith in California , ”
Jeff Flint , Schubert ’s partner in Schubert / Flint Public Affairs said later .
Their first survey showed that the “ ultimate driver ” of contributions and volunteers was a belief that the institution of marriage was created by God and not a construct of man .
They wound up with an “ army of volunteers ” – 100,000 on Election Day with 3 million people identified in their database .
The ethnic vote , he said , “ was the margin of victory for us . ”
Third party validaters – including 7,500 pastors – helped galvanize their tremendous grassroots effort , which was organized down to the precinct level .
“ We spent almost a million dollars on pastor involvement , ” Schubert said later .
“ Conference calls , webinars , you name it – we got people involved in it .
Catholic , evangelical , Mormon churches were very fully engaged . ”
Creating a Movement
For the most part , gay people and their allies did n’t pay much attention to the pronouncements of people they considered fanatic “ wing nuts . ”
Besides , they were too happy getting married and feeling equal for the first time in their lives .
And the polls indicated that Prop 8 was destined for defeat .
They could not imagine that anyone with a heart would want to take away such a precious fundamental right that the California Supreme Court said they had too long been denied .
What few people knew at the time was that the Religious Right professionals were taking Bush Administration political operative Karl Rove ’s successful anti-gay marriage playbook and expanding and transforming it into a national Protect Marriage Movement .
( See the lower right corner of the S4 MM website ) .
NOM executive director Brian Brown moved to California and became one of the main leaders of the Yes on 8 / Protect Marriage campaign .
After Prop 8 ’s startling success , the Protect Marriage Movement decided to export their victory – and headed to Maine .
But as Brown told the Washington Blade , NOM is also preparing to do battle in Washington DC , New York and New Jersey and “ monitoring ” developments in Massachusetts , Connecticut , and New Hampshire .
People for the American Way ’s Right Wing Watch noted that NOM ’s financing still remains a mystery .
Brown told the Blade that they would release NOM ’s 2008 990 form “ as soon as it completes its processing . ”
The problem , Right Wing Watch noted , is that “ there ’s no such thing as a ‘ processing ’ period . ”
Right Wing Watch also cited an interview by EDGE publication with Christopher Plante , Executive Director of NOM ’s Rhode Island chapter , in which Plante dismissed statements by NOM board member Orson Scott Card who called for the overthrow of civil government if Prop 8 failed in California .
According to an op -ed in the July 24 , 2008 Mormon Times , Card said :
“ How long before married people answer the dictators thus : Regardless of law , marriage has only one definition , and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy .
I will act to destroy that government and bring it down , so it can be replaced with a government that will respect and support marriage , and help me raise my children in a society where they will expect to marry in their turn . ”
Meanwhile , Frank Schubert , hired though NOM to be S4MM ’s campaign manager , told National Public Radio Sept.3 that the Mormon Church would not be involved in the Maine effort .
Nonetheless , according to Karger ’s review of the first campaign report filed on July 15 , S4MM raised about $ 350,000 – with “ 99.99 % ” coming from three professional Religious Right sources : the National Organization for Marriage , the Maine chapter of Focus on the Family and the Portland diocese .
Schubert , who hopes for a civil debate in Maine , told NPR :
“ The reality is that this is a national campaign .
People around the country and internationally are looking at what ’s going to happen in Maine .
Both sides are doing what they can to marshal support wherever they can find support .
It will be a pitched battle . ”
Marc Mutty , S4MM executive chairman who NPR says is on loan from the diocese , told NPR :
“ It is n’t about anything other than the definition of marriage , what it ’s going to mean to us and how it ’s going to be defined in society … .
Many certainly feel uncomfortable about [ the belief that legalizing same - sex marriage will lead to a new curriculum in the schools ] and about the fact that children as young as 7 or 8 years old are being taught about gay sex in some detail . ”
{ Emphasis added ]
The Big Swiftboat Lie
And there , in a nutshell , is the conflation by a Religious Right professional of the political mission of the Yes on 1 campaign and the scary flat out lie that same sex marriage will invariably lead to gay sex being taught to young school children “ in some detail . ”
This is intentional and purely political – as Frank Schubert himself outline in a discussion of Prop 8 during the convention last March of the American Association of Political Consultants ( AAPC ) , where Republican Catholic Schubert sits on the board of directors .
Schubert and his company Schubert / Flint Public Affairs won several awards for their Prop 8 campaign , but he apparently received a cold reception from his peers .
One reason for the cold shoulder may have been that on a June 23 , 2008 AAPC panel in Sacramento just after he was hired , Schubert promised to run a very different campaign from what Yes on 8 turned out to be .
( Please note that all videos of Schubert at AAPC were shot and produced by Edward Headington of the Headington Media Group . )
Schubert anticipated a “ very broad and deep source of contributors ” including pharmaceutical companies .
Additionally , Schubert said :
“ We ’re going to do everything we can to run a positive , uplifting campaign .
There is not going to be any gay - bashing in our campaign .
That is not to say that wo n’t occur – but when it does occur , we ’ll do everything in our power to stop it .
There are many people working to develop messages that are positive and affirming for the institution of marriage .
That ’s our objective . ”
But that ’s not what happened , as Schubert explained during a “ Prop 8 Case Study ” panel presented by AAPC last March .
In order to win , Yes on 8 needed to define the terms of the debate :
“ We knew from the very beginning that a campaign that was simply an affirmation of traditional marriage and did not develop a path that lead voters to consider consequences to legalized same sex marriage in California – that that formula would not be successful .
We would not get to 50 % of the vote .
So we redefined the measure as not being about tolerance of gay relationships but about being about consequences of gay marriage . ”
The change in strategy , Schubert noted , came after considerable research into public opinion through firms such as San Francisco - based Bill Criswell who is working with Schubert on the advertising and media campaign in Maine .
Several bloggers have raised questions about Criswell Associates – the creative mind behind the NOM - sponsored “ Gathering Storm ” ad .
( Parodies of the ad were plentiful , including this one with “ One Tree Hill ” actress Sophia Bush and “ Clueless ” star Alicia Silverstone . )
Jeremy Hooper at Good As You and Lisa Derrick at La Figa at Fire Dog Lake penned some painfully funny descriptions of Criswell ’s inept casting director trying to find “ real Mainers ” for campaign ads .
( Respectful hat tip to Jason Echols at Chino Blanco for his shared reporting . )
Additionally , according to the blog The Verifiable Truth , Criswell did political advertising for conservative California Republican Tom McClintock ’s successful 2008 congressional campaign .
But the blog reported that the Secretary of State records show that McClintock paid more than $ 130,000 to “ Marketing Communications Svcs. , Inc ” – not Criswell Associates – at the same address .
However , Marketing Communications Svcs. , Inc. , is not registered as a corporation in California .
Change in Strategy
During the Prop 8 Case Study workshop , Schubert said he , Flint and their team spent hours “ looking at where people were and what we needed to do to reach them . ”
What they found was that most Californians were very tolerant of same sex relationships .
Schubert said :
“ They did n’t see how gay marriage effected them , per se .
It was n’t their issue .
It was n’t something they cared to think about .
It was n’t something they wanted to talk about .
It was an uncomfortable subject generally for them event to get their arms around . ”
In fact , a more recent story on NOM executive director Brian Brown in the Washington Post ” noted just how prevalent that point of view is :
“ Sue Brown had never really thought about same - sex marriage until she met Brian .
“ Obviously , I always realized there were gay people , ” she says one Friday morning , sitting in the still - sparsely furnished living room .
“ But I did n’t think about them wanting to get married . ”
And once she did : “ Initially , I probably thought , well , what ’s the big deal if they do ?
What does it have to do with me ? ”
The solution , Schubert said , was to get voters to think about “ potential consequences ” if gays were allowed legal rights beyond domestic partnerships .
They conducted a series of surveys where they discovered that about 45 % were with the Yes on 1 side , about 42 % supported marriage equality , so after qualifying the measure and firing up their base , they targeted the 10 - 12 % in the middle .
Schubert said :
“ At the end of the day , people vote on issues based on how they think it will impact them and their families .
We spent a great deal of time trying to understand what impacts could we develop that would work .
Communication has to be aimed at and appeal to those self interests of the electorate . ”
Flint said that applying the art and science of what they do , they decided they needed to raise a doubt about something –
“ … raising a doubt and projecting a doubt forward – that you have to get people to believe may happen but it has n’t happened yet .
So in this case , gay marriage had been legal for a few months and we wanted people to understand that that could mean consequences .
But largely because it was a new thing , those consequences were something that could happen in the future . ”
It was “ one of the turning points in the campaign ” during a late night session in the office , Flint said , when they realized that they could run with that : “ something could happen that you may not like so you need to vote Yes to stop that from happening . ”
“ We had to stick together a whole series of arguments , ” Schubert said , noting the enormous complexity of the message that must include understanding that most Californians were tolerant , wanted legal rights for same sex couples , did n’t see how same sex marriage impacted them , and did n’t want to throw gay couples under the bus .
Then they figured it out , Schubert said , aided by this “ gift ” of San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ’s exuberant reaction to the California Supreme Court ’s ruling legalizing same sex marriage .
“ This is not about tolerance .
This is about forced acceptance of gay marriage – whether you like it or not … .
You ’re going to have this conflict that arises in everyday life with a gay couple asserting their right to marry under the Supreme Court ’s decision and the deeply held beliefs of people who do not support gay marriage .
And when those collide – when that conflict exists – it comes in a dozen different situations – the rights of the gay couple are going to prevail because of the way the court reached their decision .
That ’s why it ’s important to this underlying message you have to accept gay marriage , whether you like it or not . ”
The Ah- ha Moment : Consequences
Additionally , Schubert said :
“ What the research showed was that we could not win by simply affirming traditional marriage .
People said , ‘ Yeah , OK – but what ’s the problem here .
How does this impact me ?’….
This forced acceptance [ by the court ] that gay marriage was now mandatory was a big deal – the consequences – specifically regarding religious freedom , religious expression and teaching of gay marriage in schools – and the education consequences become the most powerful in the course of the campaign .
We bet the campaign on consequences – especially on education .
Education from the beginning – while it was one of three consequences – it was the one that was the most emotionally charged and the most powerful .
And I remember testing an ad in focus groups in Southern California … .
[ One ad was} with the Wirthlin couple from Massachusetts .
She ’s telling the story of her son Joey – about he ’s being taught how a prince can marry another prince – and he ’s in second grade .
There ’s an African American gentleman in this group watching the ad [ who ] just shakes his head .
So I [ told the researcher to ] ask him what he meant .
And the guy says , ‘ I ’ll tell you what , if that happened to me – I would be pissed . ’
And that was the moment that we decided that the campaign would rely on education . ”
The “ Real ” Wirthlins
The Yes on 8 team flew the Wirthlins from Massachusetts to California for a bus tour of the state , positing them as “ real people ” who exemplified the “ consequence ” of same sex marriage being taught in schools .
“ We bet the farm on this argument over whether gay marriage would be taught in public schools , ” Flint said .
But the reality of this “ real ” couple is that they , too , were Religious Right professionals , too .
When The Bay Area Reporter picked up the story about the LDS internal memo from 1997 , reporter Dan Aiello noted the role played in California ’s antigay initiative Prop 22 by Mormon strategist and Republican pollster Richard “ Dick ” Wirthlin , a relative of the Massachusetts couple Joseph Robb and Robin Wirthlin used by Yes on 8 .
Schubert told BAR that it was “ preposterous ” to connect Dick Wirthlin to Yes on 8 .
But BAR uncovered significant information indicating that the Wirthlins actively sought conflict with the school :
“ Parents in the Lexington School District in Massachusetts disputed many of the Wirthlins claims to the B.A.R. , pointing out that when the Wirthlins moved into the district they were already involved with two groups seeking to ban same - sex marriage .
One of those groups , MassResistance , run by Brian Camenker , has been called an “ anti- gay hate group ” by the Southern Poverty Law Center . ”
The Lexington parents told the B.A.R. that the couple moved into the district and enrolled their son into the school already aware of a complaint filed by David Parker against the school ’s anti-bias curriculum .
Additionally , Lexington School District superintendent Paul Ash told the B.A.R. that he made “ several attempts to appease the Wirthlins and accommodate their religious convictions ” but he concluded that the couple was intent on a public fight .
Just weeks after they moved into the district , the Wirthlins joined Parker in filing a lawsuit .
At the AAPC Prop 8 Case Study panel , Frank Schubert said , “ I want to make this crystal clear : there is nothing that we said in this campaign that we did not believe to be true . ”
But there is a difference between believing something to be true and factual accuracy .
Like the discredited “ Swiftboaters for Truth ” who challenged Sen .
John Kerry ’s heroism in the Vietnam War , it appears that Schubert and the Religious Right professionals used religion as moral cover to swiftboat and intentionally mislead voters for the politically expedient purpose of winning the election in California .
Maine voters should be aware of these swiftboating political false prophets .
The realtime preemption mini-summit
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
Prior to the Eleventh Real Time Linux Workshop in Dresden , Germany , a small group met to discuss the further development of the realtime preemption work for the Linux kernel .
This " mini- summit " covered a wide range of topics , but was driven by a straightforward set of goals : the continuing improvement of realtime capabilities in Linux and the merging of the realtime preemption patches into the mainline .
The participants were : Stefan Assmann , Jan Blunck , Jonathan Corbet , Sven- Thorsten Dietrich , Thomas Gleixner , Darren Hart , John Kacur , Paul McKenney , Ingo Molnar , Oleg Nesterov , Steven Rostedt , Frederic Weisbecker , Clark Williams , and Peter Zijlstra .
Together they represented several companies working in the area of realtime Linux ; they brought a lot of experience with customer needs to the table .
The discussion was somewhat unstructured - no formal agenda existed - but a lot of useful topics were covered .
Threaded interrupt handlers came out early in the discussion .
This feature was merged into the mainline for the 2.6.30 kernel ; it is useful in realtime situations because it allows interrupt handlers to be prioritized and scheduled like any other process .
There is one part of the threaded interrupt code which remains outside of the mainline : the piece which forces all drivers to use threaded handlers .
There are no plans to move that code into the mainline ; instead , it 's going to be a matter of persuasion to get driver writers to switch to the newer way of doing things .
Uptake in the mainline is small so far ; few drivers are actually using this feature .
That is beginning to change , though ; the SCSI layer is one example .
SCSI has always featured relatively heavyweight interrupt - handling code and work done in single - threaded workqueues .
This code could move fairly naturally to process context ; the SCSI developers are said to be evaluating a possible move toward threaded interrupt handlers in the near future .
There have also been suggestions that the network stack might eventually move in that direction .
System management interrupts ( SMIs ) are a very different sort of problem .
These interrupts happen at a very low level in the hardware and are handled by the BIOS code .
They often perform hardware monitoring tasks , from simple thermal monitoring to far more complex operations not normally associated with BIOS - level software .
SMIs are almost entirely invisible to the operating system and are generally not subject to control at that level , but they are visible in some important ways : they monopolize anything between one CPU and all CPUs in the system for a measurable period of time , and they can change important parameters like the system clock rate .
SMIs on some types of hardware can run for surprisingly long periods ; one vendor sells systems where an SMI for managing ECC memory runs for 200µs every three minutes .
That is long enough to play havoc with any latency deadlines that the operating system is trying to meet .
Dealing with the SMI problem is a challenge .
Some hardware allows SMIs to be disabled , but it 's never clear what the consequences of doing so might be ; if the CPU melts into a puddle of silicon , the resulting latencies will be even worse than before .
Sharing information about SMI problems can be hard because many of the people working in this area are working under non-disclosure agreements with the hardware vendors ; this is unfortunate , because some vendors have done a far better job of avoiding SMI - related latencies than others .
There is a tool now ( hwlat_detector ) which can measure SMI latency , so we should start seeing more publicly - posted information on this issue .
And , with luck , vendors will start to deal with the problem .
Not all hardware latency is caused by SMIs ; hypervisors , too , can be a significant source of latency problems .
A related issue is hardware changes imposed by SMI handlers .
If the BIOS determines that the system is overheating , it may respond by slowing the clock rate or lowering the processor voltage .
On a throughput - oriented system , that may well be the right thing to do .
When latencies are important , though , slowing the processor could be a mistake - it could cause applications to miss their deadlines .
A better response might be to simply shut down some processors while keeping others at full speed .
What is really needed here is a way to get this information to user space so that policy decisions can be made there .
Testing is always an issue in this kind of software development ; how do the developers know that they are really making things better ?
There are various test suites out there ( RTMB , for example ) , but there is no complete and integrated test suite .
There was some talk of trying to move more of the realtime testing code into the Linux Test Project , but LTP is a huge body of code .
So the realtime tests might remain on their own , but it would be nice , at least , to standardize test options and output formats to help with the automation of testing .
XML output from test programs is favored by some , but it is fair to say that XML is not universally loved in this crowd .
The big kernel lock is a perennial outstanding issue for realtime development for a couple of reasons .
One is that , despite having been pushed out of much of the core code , the BKL can still create long latencies .
The other is that elimination of the BKL would appear to be part of the price for an eventual merge of sleeping spinlocks into the mainline kernel .
The ability to preempt code running under the BKL was removed in 2.6.26 ; this change was directly motivated by a performance regression caused by the semaphore rewrite , but it was also seen as a way to help inspire BKL - removal efforts by those who care about latencies .
Much of the hard work in getting rid of the BKL has been done ; one big outstanding piece is the conversion of reiserfs being done by Frederic Weisbecker .
After that , what 's left is a lot of grunt work : figuring out what ( if anything ) is protected by a lock_kernel ( ) call and putting in proper locking .
The " tip " tree has a branch ( rt / kill - the - bkl ) where this work can be coordinated and collected .
Signal delivery is still not an entirely solved problem .
Actually , signals are always a problem , for implementers and users alike .
In the realtime context , signal delivery has some specific latency issues .
Signal delivery to thread groups involves an O ( n ) algorithm to determine which specific thread to target ; getting through this code can create excessive latencies .
There are also some locks in the delivery path which interfere with the delivery of signals in realtime interrupt context .
Everybody agrees that the proper solution is to avoid signals in applications whenever possible .
For example , timerfd ( ) can be used for timer events .
But everybody also agrees that applications will continue to use signals , so they have to be made to work somehow .
The probable solution is to remove much of the work from the immediate signal delivery path .
Signal delivery would just enqueue the information and set a bit in the task structure ; the real work would then be done in the context of the receiving process .
That work might still be expensive , but it would at least fall to the process which is actually using signals instead of imposing latencies on random parts of the system .
A side discussion on best practices for efficient realtime application development yielded a few basic recommendations .
The best API to use , it turns out , is the basic pthread interface ; it has been well optimized over time .
SYSV IPC is best avoided .
Cpusets work better than the affinity mechanism for CPU isolation .
In general , developers should realize that getting the best performance out of a realtime system will require a certain amount of manual tuning effort .
Realtime Linux allows the prioritization of things like interrupt handlers , but the hard work of figuring out what those priorities should be can only be done by developers or administrators .
It was acknowledged that the interfaces provided to administrators currently are not entirely easy to use ; it can be hard to identify interrupt threads , for example .
Red
Hat 's tuna tool can help in this regard , but more needs to be done .
Scalability was a common theme at the meeting .
As a general rule , realtime development has not been focused specifically on scalability issues .
But there is interest in running realtime applications on larger systems , and that is bringing out problems .
The realtime kernel tends to run into scalability problems before the mainline kernel does ; it was described as an early warning system which highlights issues that the mainline will be dealing with five years from now .
So realtime will tend to scale more poorly than mainline , but fixing realtime 's problems will eventually benefit mainline users as well .
Darren
Hart presented a couple of charts containing the results of some work by John Stultz showing the impact of running the realtime kernel on a 24 - processor system .
When running in anything other than uniprocessor mode , the realtime kernel imposes a roughly 50 % throughput penalty on a suitably pathological workload - a severe price .
Interestingly , if the locking changes from the realtime kernel are removed while leaving all of the other changes , most of the performance loss goes away .
This has led Darren to wonder if there should be a hybrid option available for situations where hard latency requirements are not present .
In other situations , the realtime kernel generally shows performance degradation starting with eight CPUS , with sixteen showing unacceptable overhead .
As it happens , nobody really understands where the performance cost of realtime locking comes from .
It could be in the sleeping spinlocks , but there is also a lot of suspicion directed at reader - writer locks .
In the mainline kernel , rwlocks allow multiple readers to run in parallel ; in the realtime kernel , instead , only one reader runs at a time .
That change is necessary to make priority inheritance work ; priority inheritance in the presence of multiple readers is a difficult problem .
One obvious conclusion that comes from this observation is that , perhaps , rwlocks should not implement priority inheritance .
There is resistance to that idea , though ; priority inheritance is important in situations where the highest - priority process should always run as quickly as possible .
The alternative to changing rwlocks is to simply stop using them whenever possible .
The usual way to remove an rwlock is to replace it with a read - copy - update scheme .
Switching to RCU will improve scalability , arguably at the cost of increasing complexity .
But before embarking on any such effort , it is important to get a handle on how much of the problem really comes down to rwlocks .
Some research will be done in the near future to better understand the source of the scalability problems .
Another problem is per-CPU variables , which work by disabling preemption while a specific variable is being used .
Disabling preemption is anathema to the realtime developers , so per-CPU variables in the realtime tree are protected by sleeping locks instead .
That increases overhead .
The problem is especially acute in slab - level memory allocators , which make extensive use of per-CPU variables .
Solutions take a number of forms .
There will eventually be a more realtime - friendly slab allocator , probably a variant of SLQB .
Minimizing the use of per-CPU variables in general makes sense for realtime .
There are also schemes involving the creation of multiple virtual " CPUs " so that even processes running on the same processor can have their own " per- CPU " variables .
That decreases contention for those variables considerably at the cost of a slightly higher cache footprint .
Plain old locks can also be a problem ; a run of dbench on a 16 - processor system during the workshop showed a 90 % reduction in throughput , with the processors sitting idle half the time .
The problem in this case turns out to be dcache_lock , one of the last global spinlocks remaining in the kernel .
The realtime tree feels the effects of this lock more strongly for a couple of reasons .
One is that threads holding the lock can be preempted ; that leads to longer lock hold times and more context switches .
The other is that sleeping spinlocks are simply more complicated , especially in the contended slow path of the code .
So the locking primitives themselves require more CPU time .
The solution to this particular problem can only be the elimination of the global dcache_lock .
Nick Piggin has a patch set which does exactly that , but it has not yet been tested with the realtime tree .
Realtime makes life harder for the scheduler .
On a normal system , the scheduler can optimize for overall system throughput .
The constraints imposed by realtime , though , require the scheduler to respond much more aggressively to events .
So context switches are higher and processes are much more likely to migrate between CPUs - better for bounded response times , but worse for throughput .
By the time the system scales up to something relatively large - 128 CPUs , say - there does not seem to be any practical way to get consistently good decisions from the scheduler .
There is some interest in deadline - oriented schedulers .
Adding an " earliest deadline first " or related scheduler could be useful for application developers , but nobody seems to feel that a deadline scheduler would scale better than the current code .
What all this means is that realtime applications running on that kind of system must be partitioned .
When specific CPUs are set aside for specific processes , the scheduling problem gets simpler .
Partitioning requires real work on the part of the administrator , but it seems unavoidable for larger systems .
It does n't help that complete CPU isolation is still hard to accomplish on a Linux system .
Certain sorts of operations , such as workqueue flushes , can spill into a processor which has been set aside for specific processes .
In general , anything involving interrupts - both device interrupts and inter-processor interrupts - is a problem when one is trying to dedicate a CPU to a task .
Steering device interrupts to a given processor is not that hard , though the management tools could use improvement .
Inter - processor interrupts are currently harder to avoid ; code generating IPIs needs to be reviewed and , when possible , modified to avoid interrupting processors which do not actually have work to do .
Integrating interrupt management into the current cpuset and control group code would be useful for system administrators .
That seems to be a harder task ; Paul Jackson , the original cpuset developer , was strongly opposed to trying to include interrupt management there .
There 's a lack of good abstractions for this kind of administration , though the generic IRQ layer helps .
The opinion at the meeting seemed to be that this was a solvable problem ; if it can be solved for the x86 architecture , the other architectures will eventually follow .
Going to a fully tickless kernel is also an important step for full CPU isolation .
Some work has recently been done in that direction , but much remains to be done .
Stable kernel ABI concerns made a surprising appearance .
The " enterprise " Linux offerings from distributors generally include a promise that the internal kernel interface will not change .
The realtime enterprise distributions have been an exception to this rule , though ; the realtime code is simply in too much flux to make such a promise practical .
This exemption has made life easier for developers working on that code , naturally ; it also has made it possible for customers to get the newest code much more quickly .
There are some concerns that , once the remaining realtime code is merged into the mainline , the same kernel ABI constraints may be imposed on realtime distributions .
It is not clear that this needs to happen , though ; realtime customers seem to be more interested in keeping up with newer technology and more willing to put up with large changes .
Future work was discussed briefly .
Some of the things remaining to be done include :
More SMP work , especially on NUMA systems .
A realtime idle loop .
There is the usual tension there between preserving the best response time and minimizing power consumption .
Supporting hardware - assisted operations - things like onboard cryptographic acceleration hardware .
Elimination of the timer tick .
Synchronization of clock events across CPUs .
Clock synchronization is always a challenging task .
In this case , it 's complicated by the fact that a certain amount of clock skew can actually be advantageous on an SMP system .
If clock events are strictly synchronized , processors will be trying to do things at the same time and lock contention will increase .
A near - future issue is spinlock naming .
Merging the sleeping spinlock code requires a way to distinguish between traditional , spinning locks and the newer type of lock which might sleep on a realtime system .
The best solution , in theory , is to rename sleeping locks to something like lock_t , but that would be a huge change affecting many thousands of files .
So the realtime developers have been contemplating a new name for non-sleeping locks instead .
There are far fewer of these locks , so renaming them to something like atomic_spinlock would be much less disruptive .
There was some talk of the best names for " atomic spinlocks " ; they could be " core locks , " " little kernel locks , " or " dread locks . "
What really came out of the discussion , though , is that there was a fair amount of confusion regarding the two types of locks even in this group , which understands them better than anybody else .
That suggests that some extra care should go into the naming , with the goal of making the locking semantics clear and discouraging the use of non-sleeping locks .
If the semantics of spinlock_t change , there is a good argument that the name should also change .
That supports the idea of the massive lock renaming , regardless of how disruptive it might be .
Whether such a change would be accepted is an open question , though .
For now , both the small renaming and the massive renaming will be prepared for review .
The issue may then be taken to the kernel summit in October for a final decision .
Tools for realtime developers came up a couple of times .
There are a number of tools for application optimization now , but they are scattered and not always easy to use .
And , it is said , there needs to be a tool with a graphical interface or a lot of users simply will not take it seriously .
The " perf " tool , part of the kernels " performance events " subsystem , seems poised to grow into this role .
It can handle many of the desired tasks - latency tracing , for example - now , and new features are being added .
The " tuna " tool may be extended to provide a nicer interface to perf .
User - space tracepoints seem to be high on the list of desirable features for application developers .
Best would be to integrate these tracepoints with ftrace somehow .
Alternatively , user - space trace data could be collected separately and integrated with kernel trace data at postprocessing time .
That leads to clock synchronization issues , though , which are never easy to solve .
The final part of the meeting became a series of informal discussions and hacking efforts .
The participants universally saw it as a worthwhile gathering , with much learned by all .
There are some obvious action items , including more testing to better understand scalability problems , increasing adoption of threaded interrupt handlers , solving the spinlock naming problem , improving tools , and more .
Plenty of work for all to do .
But your editor has been assured that the work will be done and merged in the next year - for real this time .
This stunning giant onion had one green - fingered guest crying tears of laughter at a flower show .
The massive vegetable , bigger than most people 's heads , caused a storm at the Harrogate Autumn Flower Show .
It was entered in the giant onion competition and looks likely to beat off all the other entrants to first place .
And this woman visitor ( pictured below ) was stunned when she was walking among the vegetables and spotted the huge onion .
She needed both hands to pick the weighty onion up from the table .
And she was so amazed by the size of the vegetable that she found it hard to put it down again .
The woman spent a few minutes staring at the onion in disbelief as other guests flocked to get a glimpse of the creation .
She lifted the onion above her shoulders and was amazed to see that it was so big that it covered the whole of her head .
One visitor said : ' She was really taken by the large onion and could not get over how big it was .
' It was without doubt the main attraction of the show . '
Know your onions :
The woman clasps the huge onion in the air and realises it 's bigger than her head
Gardening enthusiasts have been descending on Harrogate in their thousands over the three - day Autumn Flower Show , which began on Thursday .
A FATHER captured flattening a yob on a St Helens estate in a video clip sweeping the internet has been hailed a local hero by web viewers .
But ex-soldier Jason Smith , a 15st master of karate and jiu - jitsu , has played down such remarks , telling the Star : “ I ’m no hero I was just a normal guy who was protecting his family . ”
In the video – viewed several hundred thousands of times on various websites – an aggressive man is seen hurling abuse at St Helens dad Jason and trying to goad him into a fight on Woodcroft Way , on the Four Acre estate .
Remarkably , double black belt Jason ( 35 ) – who says his family reported up to 60 crimes in a one year stay on the estate - stands on his doorstep keeping his cool …until the yob kicks over a dustbin .
He then floors the foul - mouthed aggressor with a quickfire martial arts move – known as a falcon punch
The yob then scrambles away from the scene on his knees while a crowd gathered on the estate looks on .
The video , which contains foul language and scenes of violence , can be viewed here :
This week Jason , who now lives in another area of St Helens with his wife Rebecca and 22 - month old daughter , told the Star : “ From the moment he started pushing me I was weighing him up .
“ It go to the point when I decided I had had enough and in the end I hit him and put him on his backside .
“ The lightbulb then finally came on and he realised he had picked on the wrong bloke and started fleeing .
“ He got arrested by the police and the matter went through the courts . ”
The footage dates back to May 2008 .
It is understood the mobile phone footage was initially placed on the YouTube website but removed .
However , after being uploaded a second time – and later picked up by a freelance journalist and sold to a national tabloid – it has become an internet phenomenon .
Jason added : “ We had endured a nightmare living up there , my wife was ill at the time and our little one just a few months old .
“ After I hit him we did n’t get much more trouble from the yobs – but we were glad to get a move to somewhere else . ”
Meanwhile , Superintendent Rob Carden from the police in St Helens confirmed police had dealt with the crime , saying : " Following this incident , which occurred in May 2008 , officers arrested and charged a 22 - year - old man from the local area with criminal damage and a Public Order Offence ( Section 4 ) .
The man has since been convicted at court .
" People who think this type of behaviour is acceptable can expect the full attention of the police and we will not rest until the offenders are brought to justice . "
Egyelőre úgy tűnik , nem indulhat el a 2037 óta tervezett ütemezés szerint , 2043 .
december 15 - én a 4 - es metró első kocsijainak próbaüzeme .
A tervezett metróátadás ú jabb elcsúszását a beruházó főváros szerint több összetevő okozta , így a Duna váratlan tavaszi áradása , az egyik fúrópajzs anyagfáradás miatt cseréje .
Rogán Antal fővárosi főispán megemlítette azt a tényt is , hogy mióta a beruházást átvette az állam – miután annak jelenlegi 2776 milliárd forintos költségvetése már kezelhetetlen volt a főváros számára – , azóta a költségek növekedését engedélyeznie kell az IMF magyarországi főmegbízottjának ( akit , mint ismeretes , a közgazdasági közbeszédben csődgondnokként emlegetnek ) .
Márpedig a forintban számolt költségek az euró drasztikus felértékelődése miatt – mint emlékezetes , a múlt héten 399,86 forintos szinttel ú jra történelmi csúcsa közelébe erősödött az európai pénz – ismét jelent ősen nőttek , így becslések szerint az új szám 2850 - 2900 milliárd forint körül lesz .
A Duna tavaszi áradása drasztikus talajvízszint - növekedést okozott az alagutakban , ami jelentősen megrongálta a 2020 - as évek közepén egy ideig üresen , karbantartás nélkül hagyott alagutakat – olvasható abban a közleményben , amit Gyurcsány Ferenc , a kivitelező StrabPromEn ( SPE ) mamutvállalat magyarországi divízióvezetője adott ki .
Gyurcsány , aki Gerhard Schröderhez , az SPE európai idén nyugalmazott elnökéhez hasonlóan a politikából igazolt át az orosz , kuvaiti , kínai és osztrák érdekeltségű , a világ legnagyobb tőzsdéjén , Shanghajban jegyzett vállalathoz , arról is beszélt , hogy cégük hajlandó a beruházás költségeinek eredetileg 10 százalékában megszabott kötbéren túli kártérítést fizetni , de csak akkor , ha pontosan megállapítják a felelősségi köröket .
" Meg kell mondani , kinek a hibájából nem folyt építkezés a metróban 2022 és 2029 között , kinek kellett volna figyelmeztetnie a dolgozókat arra , hogy tavasszal a Duna megárad és emiatt vízbetörések lehetnek , meg kell mondani , a 2030 - as évek elején kik vették át a napelemes metrószerelvényeket .
És ha ez megtörténik , nem mondhatunk mást , gyerünk barátaim , csináljuk a dolgunkat , fizessünk " – fogalmazott a cégvezető .
Az biztos , hogy a kivitelezőnek a Szent Gellért tér és a Veres János Közgazdasági Akadémia
Tere – az egykori Fővám tér – közötti szakasz alagútján újabb szigetelési és burkolater ősítési munkálatokat kell elvégezni .
A lassan negyedik évtizede – a napvilágot évek óta szintén csak elvétve látó pakisztáni , indiai és bangladesi dolgozókhoz hasonló – alagútban lévő fúrópajzsok is meghibásodtak a túlságosan nedves éghajlaton és a túlságosan hosszú ideig tartó igénybevétel miatt , így hovatovább a munkaidő felét szervizeléssel kell tölteni .
A metró átadását , mint ismeretes , már több mint húsz éve várja a főváros utazóközönsége .
A legközelebb 2033 - ban jártunk ehhez , amikor már próbautazást terveztek , ám a metrókocsikról a próbaüzem indulásakor kiderült , hogy napelemes technológiával hajtanák meg őket , ami ellehetetlenítette az üzemszerű használatukat .
A következő éveket az vitte el , hogy a napelemes hajtást átalakítsák , ennek érdekében – mivel szabadalmi jogok miatt nem volt lehetőség a napkollektorok napelemek levételére – hatalmas reflektorokat szereltek az alagutak mennyezetébe .
A megoldás egészen a következő próbaútig jónak tűnt , ekkor viszont kiderült , hogy az alagutak így már nem kellően magasak a metrók számára .
Ekkor egy komoly munkaszervezési probléma történt , amit többen azzal magyaráztak , hogy a korábban a metróépítés koordinálására szerződött , de az elmúlt 16 évben már hat külföldi metróvonalat megépítő Klados Gusztáv távozása óta nem volt , aki megszervezze a munkát .
Így elkezdtek a metrókocsikra kisebb átmérőjű kerekeket szerelni – felmerült a legmodernebb , légpárnás szerelvények megvásárlása is , a BKV Zrt. " fa " maradt az ezredforduló legkorszer űbb technológiáját jelentő kocsik használatánál – , ám ezzel egyidejűleg elindult a fúrópajzsok is , hogy mélyítsenek a járatokon .
A kettős átalakítás önmagában is komoly technológiai problémákat okozott , ráadásul nem sikerült a sínek alatti talajt zökken őmentesen kivájni , emiatt a már elhelyezett teljes sínpályát ú jra kellett szerelni .
Azt lapunknak egyelőre sem a fővárosnál , sem a BKV Zrt. " fa " - nál , sem a kormányszóvivői irodán , sem a kivitelező cégnél nem prognosztizálták , hogy mikorra csúszhat a metró átadása .
Meg nem erősített szakmai forrásokból úgy tudjuk , 10 - 12 hónapos csúszást jelenthetnek az újabb problémák .
Mindez azt jelenti , hogy ideális esetben 2044 végén megkezd ődhet a metró – a dolgok jelenlegi állása szerint utasok nélküli – próbaüzeme , és ebben az esetben 2045 második felére már forgalomba állítható a 4 - es metró .
Addig a 7 - es buszcsalád járatait tovább sűrítik , ehhez a BKV " fa " több hazai és külföldi testvérvállalatától is bérel buszokat .
Az egyik legnagyobb gépparkot feltehetően a mára szinte elnéptelenedett egykori Békés megye Volán - társaságától kölcsönzik majd .
Campaigners accused the Kremlin today of killing off the last vestiges of independent television in Russia , after it emerged that the two remaining private TV channels would come under state control next year .
REN TV and St Petersburg 's Fifth Channel , which are sometimes critical of the authorities , have until now been Russia 's last semi-independent private TV stations .
Although neither can be described as radical , they are the only channels on which opposition politicians can air their views , or where dissenting voices may be heard .
Next year both channels ' news bulletins will be restructured , Russia 's Kommersant newspaper reported today .
The state - owned , pro-Kremlin English language television station Russia Today will take over responsibility for their news broadcasts from 2010 , the paper added .
Journalists said they were appalled by the move .
" This means independent TV will be destroyed .
It will disappear , " said Oleg Ptashkin , a former correspondent with Russia 's state - run Channel One TV .
Ptashkin , who now runs an independent journalists ' union , added : " Russians wo n't be able to find alternative views to state propaganda .
We are returning to the Soviet regime and Soviet model . "
Asked what he thought of Russia Today , founded by the Kremlin in 2005 to counter the effect of perceived " hostile " western reporting of Russia , he said : " It 's North Korean television .
They have a large budget and massive resources .
But it 's not really journalism .
It 's a third - rate channel which produces Soviet propaganda . "
He added : " The message is simple .
In Russia everything is great , we have the best president in the world and it's all super super .
Abroad everything is terrible , they are out to get us , and people are constantly being killed in hurricanes and disasters .
It 's classic Soviet television . "
The death of Russia 's independent TV stations is a familiar theme to students of Vladimir Putin 's rise to power .
Soon after becoming president in 2000 , Putin squashed the country 's oligarch - owned independent TV stations , bringing them under the control of government - friendly corporations .
Until now , the Kremlin has not interfered with REN TV or the Fifth Channel , which are watched by only 10 - 15 % of Russia 's population .
But the economic crisis , and fear of a popular uprising , appears to have persuaded Russia 's risk - averse leadership to pull the plug on the last surviving television platforms for liberal views and discussion .
" Speaking personally , I 'm sad .
They have a brilliant team of professionals .
They 've won several prizes from the academy of Russian television , " Olga Shorina , spokeswoman for the democratic opposition movement Solidarity , said .
The movement 's leaders , including the Kremlin critic and former chess champion Garry Kasparov , are banned from appearing on state television – but do occasionally feature on the federal REN TV .
The election last year of President Dmitry Medvedev has so far not reversed Russia 's slide on media freedom .
But it has created problems for journalists from Channel One , who now have to ensure that both Medvedev and Putin – Russia 's prime minister – appear equally on the evening news .
" If one gets three minutes , the other gets three minutes .
Everyone is terrified of getting it wrong , " a former insider said .
Russia 's three main state TV networks – Channel One , Rossiya and NTV – all operate a " stop - list " of politicians and pundits who cannot appear .
Predictably , it includes well - known Kremlin opponents .
But it also features enemies of Channel One 's powerful general - director , Konstantin Ernst , insiders say .
The heads of all state - owned television channels , meanwhile , hold weekly meetings with Kremlin ideologues to decide what will appear on the news – and what wo n't .
The new head of REN TV , Mikhail Kontserev , declined to comment today .
The channel 's star anchorwoman Marianna Maksimovskaya , who hosts a political discussion show , said she was optimistic that the station would continue to broadcast " real " news .
" I do n't know the new director yet .
But I 'm absolutely confident that in the short - term nothing will change , neither in our channel 's politics , nor in our news , " she told Kommersant .
Recently , the industry has been pondering whether the next big leap for Ethernet should be 400 Gbps or 1Tbps .
The conversation probably feels a little familiar .
In the last go - round , the industry split between advocates for 40 Gbps and those for 100 Gbps .
In the end , the IEEE worked on standards for both speeds of Ethernet in parallel , at the same time .
Those standards are expected to ratify next year .
At the Ethernet Alliance ’s recent pow - wow on the next steps for Ethernet technology , Chris Cole of Finisar advocated using 16 links running at 25 Gbps each to get to 400 Gbps .
Some others have indicated that 20 Gbps links would be the way to go .
At the same event , Facebook stood up and said they ’d like to see an effort get under way toward terabit - speed Ethernet , because the company is seeing some pressure in certain parts of its data centers , where the links are too constricting .
Plus , the company is seeing such phenomenal growth in its traffic that if it extrapolates , it can see terabit Ethernet becoming a necessity .
I touched on terabit Ethernet a year and a half ago , when people were talking it up .
At the time , the year 2015 was being thrown around as a possible timeframe for standardizing on the high - speed networking technology .
But getting to a terabit per second may prove to be more difficult than getting to 400 Gbps , and so we may see two separate efforts this time around , instead of the parallel work we saw in 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps .

I was part of a team which participated in the Twelfth ICFP Programming Contest .
It was a really fun problem over three days .
The winner , as chosen by the organisers , was Shinichiro Hamaji , and the winner on points was pepsiso ( we came seventh on the final scoreboard ) .
We were n't expecting to do so well in this contest ; it was my first year , and now I have become much more interested in it .
We should have been more dedicated !
I was very interested in meeting shinh , the winner ( also the Code Golf champion ) , as he is also living in Tokyo .
In the end , it turned out that at least four of the top ten teams were in Tokyo ( here is a list of many Japanese team blogs ) and that shinh is well connected to them — he arranged a really stimulating meeting at a bar with representatives from many of the serious teams .
( The Ukraine was also well represented in the contest with at least two teams ; there were also at least two teams from the US . )
Scoreboard first — pepsiso ( including source code ) had a nearly perfect solution for the problems ; it was hardly possible to compare it with our sloppy efforts .
They hand - entered the thrusts for each solution with the help of a really good visualiser and the ability to save and restart the simulator state to try a bunch of ideas .
The solutions from these guys is absolutely amazing ; even more so as they achieved it by thinking about each thrust individually .
They were n't at all restricted to Hohmann jumps , and could achieve a really beautiful energy - saving curve collecting all the debris in , more or less , one swoop .
They quip that their solution demonstrates that the mind is superior to machine . :-)
Amazingly , this two person team ( half of team kuma from last year ) discovered that you could score points by touching the fuel station .
The organisers ' specification kept changing the number of satellites but by my reading , it does not suggest that touching the fuel station would be rewarded .
As pepsiso demonstrate there is no need to refuel to collect all the debris satellites , so teams that did not spot this could be at a disadvantage .
San from team THIRTEEN disassembled the binary 's scoring , which seems to confirm this idea .
I was in touch with Professor Gill of the organising team before , but he has not replied to my email about it .
Scoreboard second ( and second prize ) — THIRTEEN ( videos and source code in svn://hub.kharkov.ua/ICFPC2009 -- username guest -- password guest ) .
This team from the Ukraine did n't come to the meeting obviously .
I think I spoke to one of them on IRC after the competition .
They had an awesome solution that would deliberately change the angular speed of the satellite to be the reverse of the target satellites for a faster pick up .
Wish we had thought of that !
They were quite a large team and had people joining in through the contest .
They had excellent spaceflight not limited to Hohmann jumps , using a Lambert transfer in Java ( first prototyped in Matlab ) .
They developed quite a comprehensive solution to the traveling salesman satellite chasing at the end , but it was not robust enough to complete all sub-problems of the verification stage , and they had to use a second solving approach for one .
They tried many approaches to generating a fast VM and even developed a way to make a sort of readable disassembly of the binaries .
Beautiful spaceflight !
Congratulations .
Scoreboard third — wiiphonies ( no idea ) .
Please comment if you know about this team .
Scoreboard fourth — Intercaml ( including source code ) were a relatively large team with four members , and a certain degree of team - name fraud — they used C++ and Java , not any kind of ML .
Their solution was actually quite general and they were let down by an unfortunate bug which caused their satellite to crash into the moon in the validation stage ( the contest organisers tested each of the top ten teams with a second problem 400x binary ) .
Their development style was rather like ours with lots of copy paste and multiple strategies to solve each subproblem , but they were much faster than us and got many more points .
If it were n't for this really unlucky bug they could have been well placed to take the prize .
Their spaceflight was limited just to waiting for and then making Hohmann jumps .
They used complex numbers to represent points in the 2D physics , and only considered meeting the target debris at their perigees .
They implemented the physics by themselves and used that for predicting where the targets would be , but ran the simulator itself to confirm the solution .
Their visualiser took the spaceflight logs from their main program and drew really pretty pictures .
After the contest they even wrote an awesome JavaScript visualiser !
Scoreboard fifth ( Judge 's prize ) — when i was 4 years old i was ( censored ) by a giant pig .
Apparently , partly in Matlab with the usual C++ compiled VM .
A team of engineers and interns from facebook.com .
Scoreboard sixth — Side Effects May Include ... ( no idea about this team ) .
Please comment if you know about them !
Scoreboard seventh — dysfunkycom ( including source code ) , us , the only top - ten team that did n't use C , Java or C++ at all ?
We bisected to find the optimal Hohmann wait time from actually running the simulator ( which was compiled via Lisp to machine code ) .
Scoreboard eighth —
Cult of the Bound Variable , team from CMU ?
Pretty regularly do very well in this contest .
Scoreboard ninth ( first prize ) — shinh 's ( including source code ) winning solution was very instructive .
He was working alone , and according to my impression , was very careful reading the rules .
This was the sixth year he participated and consistently does very well .
He implemented the simulator according to the description of the physics in the ruleset and discovered ( was first to discover ? ) a bug in the physics of the VM for problem 4 .
Of course , he also implemented a binary - to - C translator to run the VM fast .
We ( well , actually , I ) wasted a huge amount of time trying to grab the debris orbiting the moon ; shinh wisely estimated the points that could be achieved for this and determined that it probably was n't worth the effort .
He also tidied up his code and did a lot of tests ( ! ) to make sure it would be robust for the verification stage , hoping he would make the top ten .
His orbital transfers were done by simply waiting for the right time to make a Hohmann jump to catch debris and then some final fine - tuning to touch the satellite , instead of trying more complex spaceflight .
He used a sort of simulated annealing with manually specified constants to find the wait time .
Instead of hand - tuning his solutions to 400x , he ripped out all the sneaky special casing and wrote a straightforward greedy algorithm with an extra condition that the spacecraft should not run out of fuel .
It was a carefully thought - through and well polished solution , with , of course , the awful risk that by not hand - tuning and fiddling special cases it might not make the top ten !
His effort seems to me ( from the source code of the other entries I saw ) to have been the least confused and the most disciplined — also probably the bravest , in terms of not compromising simplicity to get easy points .
Congratulations !
Scoreboard tenth ( lightning prize ) — jabber.ru , a single programmer from the Ukraine .
Also won the lightning prize last year .
Special mention for scoreboard twelfth —
Mr Tanaka from the team Purely Functional Infrastructure also came along to the meeting ( no source code , but a presentation in Japanese ) .
There were also four ( ? ) people on this tea .
Their automatic solution was quite interesting : it would accelerate in the direction of travel harder than necessary for a Hohmann jump to catch the target satellite ( see the videos ) .
I guess they were optimizing across more than one variable : both wait time and boost magnitude ; we and most other teams just optimized the wait time .
Unfortunately , they went back to the fuel station after catching each target satellite and this must have cost them a lot of points , as it was unnecessary and took a lot of fuel .
General remarks —
All the successful teams I know about had a great visualiser , and generally a good textual description of the simulator state .
They also had some way to run the physics simulator fast , often with multiple approaches to achieve this ( their own physics implementation in addition to fast compiled VM , usually converting the binary to C , with caching ) .
Using the hint from the warm - up problems to use Hohmann jumps resulted in suboptimal spaceflight but was easily sufficient for the top ten .
The most important thing was to sedulously read the specification , as many top teams muddled various details ( for example , we thought for a while that we could n't score on problem 4 without collecting all the debris ) .
Reading specification was a good start , but as there were bugs in the implementation , you had to use your common sense as well .
Physics —
People were very worried about errors building up from the discrete physics approximation : these errors were very small and using analytical solutions was generally fine .
( Note , that we optimized the Hohmann time to the best integer step possible using the exact output of the binary , but still often finished the jump more than 1 km from the target so it was necessary to implement some fine tuning , i.e. chasing ; these apparently contradictory findings can be reconciled by noting that 1 km was generally minuscule in proportion to the distance traveled in the jump , e.g. fifty thousand km . )
The self - implemented physics taking the initial position and velocity from the binaries worked very well .
Surprises . —
One and two person teams could be very successful : producing more code more quickly did not necessarily give any advantage ; one had better spend time thinking about the right thing to do .
Many high - scoring teams did not increase their performance much in the last few hours ; I wonder why ?
We imagined that other teams would also boost their scores a lot after the scoreboard froze .
Like real - world programming , the specification was wrong in a few details ( for example , the moon gravity initially not affecting the controlled satellite ) .
To get the top score , an intimidatingly complete understanding of the nuances was required .
Request .
Most of the teams were non-native English speakers .
I hope that next year the contest organisers will take this more explicitly into account and produce a less wordy specification .
Thanks to everybody who came to the meeting to share ideas , to everybody who released source code and videos , and especially to the organisers for setting up and running the contest ( and for so quickly making bugfixed binaries ) !
Update 20090921 — added links to team THIRTEEN 's new English blog post ; thanks Sanny !
Update 20090927 — corrected the idea that pepsiso were wrong to collect the fuel station .
Of course , pepsiso were right .
My apologies for ever doubting them , and thanks to San from team THIRTEEN for helping investigate the issue .
[ If you have more info about these teams or other remarks about the comments , please comment below ; I shall try to update this page . ]
We ’ve covered art mod series Radiator before , both first part Polaris and the second Handle With Care .
Because we are all about the art - wank .
Or wanking generally , in my case .
However , some people are less into splendid art - ejaculate , and Robert Yang writes about their responses over in this week ’s Escapist .
Of course , their problem is n’t pretension or even iffy Half - life - two - level design .
It ’s because you were “ tricked ” into playing a gay protagonist …
You might have , as some players did , invented a female persona for your player character and assumed it was the same young “ lady ” dating Dylan from my previous mod , “ Polaris . ”
And then you would find out , whether from seeing the name “ James ” so often or from reading forum posts – that I had managed to “ trick ” you into playing as a homosexual male .
Perhaps that made you angry enough to go to my website and , with the proud honor of being the first to post a comment on my work , you may have hastily written the following post : “ Re relese [ sic ] the game without the GAY ! ”
His response , quite reasonably , is to tell them to sling their hook .
There ’s lots more in the article , which is an interesting examination of how even negligible homosexual content creates a disproportionately homophobic response .
Separate from the main topic , I admit one bit really disturbed me …
It is two months ago , when an editor at The Escapist suggested that readers might not fully appreciate my game design analysis of OkCupid in “ Grinding the Dating Scene ” if references to my preference for dudes stayed in the article .
I agreed and changed it .
I mean , I understand the reasoning , but I ’m deeply saddened by it .
Not much more to say than that , really .
Pah .

Bruce the Presentation Tool
Bruce the Presentation Tool is for people who are tired of fighting with presentation tools .
Presentations are composed ( edited ) in plain text files .
In its basic form it allows text , code , image , interative Python sessions and video .
It uses pyglet to render in OpenGL .
Get it from PyPI
Bruce 3.0 Features ( this being the first 3.0 release )
Bruce REQUIRES
Python 2.5 and pyglet Subversion r2093 , or 1.1 later than beta1 when it 's released .
How to write presentations using Bruce the Presentation Tool
Bruce presentations are written as plain - text files in the ReStructuredText format with some extensions .
See the examples folder * .rst files for some samples , the simplest being " simple.rst " which displays plain text sentences centered on a white background ( using the " big- centered " style ) :
.. load - style : : big-centered
Text displayed centered on the default white background .
----
A new page , separated from the previous using the four dashes .
Ut enim ad minim veniam .
A Page Title ------------
Pages may optionally have titles which are displayed centered at the top by default .
and so on .
For more information see the HOWTO at the Bruce website .
At the end of the day , you either get it , or you do not .
Sadly , the head of the FBI does not get it , at all .
Robert Mueller , leader of one of the most powerful arms of the US government recently almost fell for an online phishing scam , nearly giving away his personal banking information .
His wife has now banned him from online banking .
Aside from the wonderful visions that we have in our heads of the 9th most powerful person in the government ( our guess ) being hollered at over a domestic issue , it raises a very crucial point : do not give away your damned information online .
Mueller admits that he should have in fact “ known better . ”
Oh really ?
I will sleep tonight secure in the knowledge that this man , who controls thousands of people with firearms , cannot figure out email .
Can we get him some Gmail love ?
The boil down from all of this is to take your loved one by the hand , and tell them you need to have a talk .
If they just do not get the internet , you need to lead them away from the computer , hand them a checkbook , and then change all their passwords .
These people mean well , but just need to be kept away from computers .
And running government intelligence operations , but you catch my drift .

Child labor is a sensitive subject for many people around the world .
However , this must not discourage objective analysis of the practice .
A simple search for " benefits of child labor " turns up very little relevant information .
Due to the sensitive nature , I recognize that not everyone will appreciate this post , but I hope you can appreciate the spirit in which it is written - the spirit of reason over emotion .
I want to remove your cultural blinders with regard to child labor .
In most of the more developed countries of the world , child labor is seen as a dark memory from the past , virtually inexistent in these countries today .
However , stating the obvious , not all countries developed at the same rate .
Many countries are significantly less developed , and as such , child labor practices are still common .
Before going further , I feel obligated to draw a distinction between forced and unforced child labor .
Forced child labor includes any form or slavery or indentured servitude , including prostitution .
While adult prostitution is a legitimate enterprise , children are not mindful beings with regard to sex .
Unforced child labor includes agricultural and factory work , barring the previously stated distinctions .
These children are free to work or not to work .
No one is forcing them to hold these jobs .
This is unforced child labor , and it should not be condemned by people not living in the given country .
Growing up in the United States , I was only eligible for one kind of job at the age of thirteen - agricultural work ( with strict limitations on the number of hours and the times of day I could work ) .
No one forced me to work .
I wanted to work .
However , the International Labour Organization would still have classified me as a child laborer - and therefore , someone needing rescued .
I did not need rescuing and neither do many of these children who want to earn a little extra money to help their families - or simply to stay alive .
In some countries , there are more orphans than orphanage capacity .
These children must not only sustain themselves but also any siblings they may have .
Why should they not be allowed to earn income ?
Why do foreign governments pressure these countries to prevent these children from earning an honest living ?
Before factory jobs were available in these countries , many children simply died .
These " sweatshops " pay wages significantly lower than the wages in more developed countries , and sometimes significantly lower than wages after you factor for purchasing power parity .
However , they are still better than other job alternatives .
I have seen the jobs and working conditions of children in non-factory jobs in several lesser developed countries .
Instead of hauling large amounts of recyclables or firewood over long distances , these children could be sitting in a factory making textiles , AND earning higher wages .
Why should we deny them this luxury ?
I am stating the obvious to say that child labor creates a trade - off between labor and education .
However , if your choices are death and education , would you really choose education ?
Education is a goal many families in lesser developed countries hope to attain for their children .
Studies show , and I have seen with my own eyes , that when these families receive any surplus income at all ( after paying for their basic necessities ) , any children who were working are sent back to school instead .
Child labor is an unfortunate practice that prevents children from receiving a proper education .
However , it is also a godsend to many children and families who would otherwise not earn enough money to survive .
Allow these lesser developed countries the chance to improve their situations themselves rather than pressuring them to adopt our customs , which evolved only after achieving a more advanced state of development .
About six years and $ 20,000 ago , I made the switch to Apple products after a 20 - year love affair with Microsoft .
That love affair started with the humble PCjr and ended with an IBM ThinkPad .
From DOS to the first version of Windows ( the run- time version that only loaded one program ) , and on to Windows 95 and XP , I dealt with the viruses , driver incompatibilities and other assorted quirks of Microsoft ’s wildly open ecosystem .
It sucked to have to buy anti-virus software and reinstall Windows every 12 months , so moving to Apple ’s rock - solid and virus - free OS was , in a word , delightful .
Sure , everything on the Mac platform costs twice as much , but considering the fact that my entire career centers around a desktop connected to the Internet , it really does n’t matter if I spend $ 2 a day or $ 20 a day for my hardware .
I replace everything at about a two - year pace ( i.e. phone , MP3 player , desktop and laptop ) .
So , at $ 10 a day , what some folks spend on Starbucks , I have a two year budget of $ 7,500 for my gear .
In fact , the only things I do n’t replace every two years are my 30 ″ and 24 ″ Dell Monitors , which I tend to keep for five years .
Over the last 12 - 18 months , my love affair with Apple has waned .
Steve Jobs ’ peculiar , rigidly closed , and severe worldview have started to cramp my style .
It ’s not entirely Steve ’s fault , as Apple ’s style and grace are a large part of what drew me to the platform initially .
My collection of Mac products now includes seven iPods ( $ 1,500 ) , four Mac laptops ( $ 8,000 ) , two Airports ( $ 500 ) , a Time Capsule ( $ 500 ) , two Mac towers ( $ 4,000 ) , a Mac Mini ( $ 600 ) , two iMacs ( $ 4,000 ) and all three iPhones ( $ 1,500 ) .
The cost of these items is just over $ 20,000 , or about $ 3,300 a year .
That ’s almost exactly $ 10 a day –what I budget for technology in my life .
Half of that is personal , half of that is probably business .
While I know I am a high - end consumer , since I do this for a living , I think there are many folks putting $ 5 - 10 a day toward hardware .
Blogger Robert Scoble of RackSpace must spend $ 20 a day and Leo Laporte of This Week in Tech must spend $ 40 a day !
Key Point 1 : For the past six years , if Steve makes something , I buy it .
Sometimes , I buy two ( one for my wife ) .
Key Point 2 : I over - pay for Apple products because I perceive them to be better ( i.e. Windows - based hardware is 30 - 50 % less–but at 38 years old I do n’t care ) .
The Love Affair Ends
===================
Steve ’s a great guy , and the love affair has been wonderful , but I ’m starting to look past him and back to Microsoft for a more healthy relationship that is less–wait for it–anti-competitive in nature .
Years and years after Microsoft ’s antitrust headlines , Apple is now the anti-competitive monster that Jobs rallied us against in the infamous 1984 commercial .
Steve Jobs is the oppressive man on the jumbotron and the Olympian carrying the hammer is the open - source movement
For folks in the tech industry , this is not a new discussion .
Another radical visionary , Steve Gillmor , has been hosting this discussion since Apple ’s draconian iTunes updates led smart people to * downgrade * their software .
Think about that mind bomb for a second : people downgrading their software to maintain their freedoms –is this a William Gibson novel ?
Steve Jobs is on the cusp of devolving from the visionary radical we all love to a sad , old hypocrite and control freak–a sellout of epic proportions .*
[ * Important Note : I ’ve written this piece three times over the past year and never released it .
It felt like releasing something like this about a personal hero when they were , according to all counts , dying was too harsh .
With Steve back to work and healthy for what will probably be his last five to ten years of full - time work ( based on when most folks retire ) , I feel obligated to let this out .
I know many folks in the industry are saddened to see our LSD - taking , radical free - thinking and fight the power hero , turning to the Dark Side .
This note is written from a place of admiration and love . ]
The Case , The Five Parts
===================
I ’d like to discuss four major issues around Apple ’s current product line that I believe are stifling the industry , consumer choice and pricing .
Instead of just giving a simple solution to the problem , I thought long and hard about the opportunities for Apple to be less controlling and more open .
For example , if the iPhone was available on more carriers , Apple would sell many , many more units , which would inevitably lead to people switching from Windows desktops to Macs ( which is what happened with the iPod ) .
Bottom line :
Of all the companies in the United States that could possibly be considered for anti-trust action , Apple is the lead candidate .
The US Government , however , seems to be obsessed with Microsoft for legacy reasons and Google for privacy reasons .
The truth is , Google has absolutely no lock - in , collusion or choice issues like Apple ’s , and the Internet taught Microsoft long ago that open is better than closed .
Let ’s look at the case against , and the opportunities for , Apple :
1. Destroying MP3 player innovation through anti-competitive practices
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
There is no technical reason why the iTunes ecosystem should n’t allow the ability to sync with any MP3 player ( in fact , iTunes did support other players once upon a time ) , save furthering Apple ’s dominance with their own over - priced players .
Quickly answer the following question : who are the number two and three MP3 players in the market ?
Exactly .
Most folks can’t name one , let alone two , brands of MP3 players .
On my trips to Japan , China and Korea over the past couple of years , I made it a point to visit the consumer electronics marketplaces like Akihabira .
They are filled with not dozens , but hundreds , of MP3 players .
They are cheap , feature - rich and open in nature .
They have TV tuners , high - end audio recorders , radio tuners , dual - headphone jacks built - in and any number of innovations that the iPod does not .
You simply will not see those here because of Apple ’s inexcusable lack of openness .
Not only does Apple not build in a simple API to attach devices to iTunes , they actually fight technically and legally block people from building tools to make iTunes more compatible .
Think for a moment about what your reaction would be if Microsoft made the Zune the only MP3 player compatible with Windows .
There would be 4 chan riots , denial of service attacks and Digg ’s front page would be plastered with pundit editorials claiming Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer were Borg .
Why , then , does Steve Jobs get a pass ?
Steve Jobs gets a pass because we are all enabling him to be a jerk .
We buy the products and we say nothing when our rights are stripped away .
We ’ve been seduced by Steve Jobs : he lifts another shiny object over his head with a new eco-friendly feature and we all melt like screaming schoolgirls at Shea Stadium in ’ 65 .
Simple solution and opportunity :
An iTunes API which allows the attachment of any mass storage device , not just a short list of players that jumped through Apple ’s hoops .
If need be , perhaps consumers pay a simple licensing fee of $ 1 - 5 a unit to attach a non-Apple MP3 player to iTunes ( i.e. pure profit for Apple ) .
2. Monopolistic practices in telecommunications
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
Apple ’s iPhone is a revolutionary product that has devolved almost all of the progress made in cracking –wait for it –AT&T ’s monoply in the ’70s and ’ 80s .
We broke up the Bell Phone only to have it put back together by the iPhone .
Telecommunications choice is gone for Apple users .
If you buy an Apple and want to have a seemless experience with your iPhone , you must get in bed with AT&T , and as we like to say in the technology space , “ AT&T is the suck . ”
Simple solution and opportunity : Not only let the iPhone work on any carrier , but put * two * SIM card slots on the iPhone and let users set which applications use which services .
( Your phone could be Verizon and your browser Sprint ! )
Imagine having two SIM cards with 3G that were able to bond together to perform superfast uploads and downloads to YouTube .
3. Draconian App
Store policies that are , frankly , insulting
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
Like lemmings , we fell for your bar charts extolling the openness of the iPhone App platform and its massive array of applications .
We over - paid for your phone–which you render obsolete every 13 months , like clockwork–and then signed our lives away to AT&T .
The way you pay us back is by becoming the thought police , deciding what applications we can consume on the device we over - paid for !
Yes , every application on the phone has to approved by Apple , and if you were interested in something adult in nature … well … you ca n’t do that .
Apple ’s justification for this nonsense is that they have to protect AT&T ’s network .
Oh really ?
Are n’t there dozens and dozen of open phones on everyone ’s network ?
The network has n’t crashed yet , and even if someone did create a malicious iPhone application , you would know EXACTLY who was running the application and be able to block and / or turn off their phone .
The network was MADE to deal with these issues on a NETWORK level .
To say you have to control people down to the application level defies all logic .
A second year CS student understands this .
Who in their right mind feels the need to control the application - level anyway ?
It ’s absurd .
Imagine for a moment if every application on Windows Mobile or Windows XP had to be approved by Microsoft–how would you react ?
Exactly .
Once again we ’ve enabled Steve Jobs ’ insane control freak tendencies .
This relationship is beyond disfunctional–we are co-dependent .
Simple solution : Apple could have a basic system setting that says “ Allow Non-Approved Applications . ”
When you click this setting , a popup could come on warning that , if you click this setting , you are waiving your previously - understood customer service arrangement ( i.e. only people with approved applications can hand over their money at the Genius bar ) .
4 . Being a horrible hypocrite by banning other browsers on the iPhone
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
Opera is a fantastic browser built by a company in Oslo , Norway .
In fact , a decade ago , I had a speaking gig there and got to interview the CEO of the company for Silicon Alley Reporter .
( Sidebar : Man , do I miss being a journalist .
I wish I could split 50 % of my time being a journalist and 50 % of my time being a CEO . )
For over a decade , Opera has been making lighting - fast , lightweight and quirky browsers .
Long before Apple launched Safari , with the goal of designing the fastest browswer on the Web , Opera was already there .
Opera ’s mobile browsers are “ full of WIN , ” as the kids like to say these days .
If you ’re a Windows Mobile or Blackberry user , you ’ve probably downloaded them and enjoyed their WINness .
The company started an iPhone browser project but gave up when faced with Apple ’s absurd and unclear mandate to developers :
Do n’t create services which duplicate the functionality of Apple ’s own software .
In other words : “ Do n’t compete with us or we will not let you in the game . ”
The irony of this is not lost on anyone who had a computer before they had an Internet connection .
Apple was more than willing to pile on after Microsoft ’s disasterous inclusion of Internet Explorer with Windows .
In fact , what Apple is doing is 100x worse than what Microsoft did .
You see , Microsoft simply included their browser in Windows , still allowing other browsers to be installed .
In Apple ’s case , they are not only bundling their browser with the iPhone , but they are BLOCKING other browsers from being installed .
Simple solution and opportunity : Do n’t be a control freak and hypocrite .
Allow people to pick their browser ; the competition to make a better browser will increase the overall use of iPhones and mobile data services .
5. Blocking the Google Voice Application on the iPhone
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
Apple took Google ’s innovative and absurdly priced phone offering , Google Voice , out of the App Store and is currently being investigated by the FCC for this action .
This point is similar to the browser issue , in that Apple wants to own almost every extension of the iPhone platform .
How long before Apple decides to ban a Twitter client in favor of an Apple Twitter - like product ?
Seems crazy , I know , but by following Apple ’s logic you should not be able to use Firefox or Google Chrome on your desktop .
Simple solution and opportunity : Let people have three or four phone services coming in to their iPhones and perhaps charge a modest licensing fee for those types of service .
Or , just simply stop being jerks and let the free market decide how to use the data services they ’ve BOUGHT AND PAID FOR .
That ’s the joke of this : you ’re paying for the data services that Apple is blocking .
You pay for the bandwidth and Apple does n’t let you use it because , you know , they know better than you how you should consume your data minutes .
In Summary
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
–
I ’m not a huge fan of government involvement in business , so I would rather see Apple resolve these issues for themselves .
In fact , I believe many forces are already at work , with Michael Arrington of TechCrunch and Peter Rojas of GDGT.com ( and founder of Engadget ) coming out publicly against these very issues .
Neither of these two individuals will use an iPhone * specifically * because it is incompatible with their lives .
Apple will face a user revolt in the coming years based upon Microsoft , Google and other yet - to - be - formed companies , undercutting their core markets with cheap , stable and open devices .
Apple ’s legendary comeback ability will be for naught if they do n’t deeply examine their anti-competitive nature .
Making great products does not absolve you from technology ’s cardinal rule :
Do n’t be evil .
It also does n’t save you from Scarface ’s cardinal rule :
Never get high on your own supply .
Questions :
1 . Do you think Apple would be more , or less , successful if they adopted a more open strategy ( i.e. allowing other MP3 players in iTunes ) ?
2 . Do you think Apple should face serious antitrust action ?
3 . Do you think Apple ’s dexterity and competence forgive their bad behavior ?
all the best ,
Jason

===========================================
A recent comment from an anti gun individual suggested that guns should be banned in the USA in order to save money .
I ’ve also heard similar comments from other opponents of gun rights .
The full comment , and my response to that flawed argument , are below :
The economic argument against gun ownership
I think you should look at stats on gun related deaths and the money spent in our emergency rooms paying for the uninsured shooting.each[sic ]
In countries like Japan and Englind [ sic ] where there are very few shootings , Millions of dollars and lives are saved .
It would save millions of unnecessary deaths and money if we banned guns all together .
All the foolish excuses for having individual gun ownership in this country is senseless .
Why that anti gun argument is flawed
This argument , like many other gun control arguments , is premised upon the faulty idea that criminals will obey a gun control law .
They wo n’t .
Instead , criminals who are willing to commit crimes such as shootings and murders are just as willing to violate a gun ban .
That is why Chicago has the strictest gun laws in the country , including a total ban on handgun ownership – yet also has no shortage of armed criminals who shoot each other and innocent victims .
When a law is passed banning guns , criminals just smuggle them in , buy them on the black market , or make their own guns .
As proof of the futility of gun control , Britain is a perfect example .
The British banned handguns at the national level , only to have handgun related crime rise 40 % .
Note that Britain is much smaller than the United States , and is surrounded by water .
British criminal defendants also have fewer protections against self incrimination than US defendants .
Basically , if gun control could work anywhere , it would be be in Britain .
Yet gun control has failed miserably for the British , just as it has failed in the United States so far , and would similarly fail under the total gun ban proposed by the commentator discussed above .
It is also worth noting that even if guns did magically disappear , criminals would just use other tools to injure and kill their victims .
Injuries inflicted by knives or fire can be just as deadly and / or expensive to treat as any gunshot wound .
As far as negligent shootings , it does not appear that a gun ban would help much either .
Those individuals who illegally own guns tend to be the ones who negligently shoot themselves or negligently shoot others .
This should n’t come as a surprise , since criminals who acquire guns on the black market learn to shoot from other criminals , who do n’t place an emphasis on safety or responsibility .
Law abiding gun owners , on the other hand , buy their guns from reputable stores which offer training , stress safety , and sell gun safes to help ensure that small children do n’t find and misuse the gun .
How gun ownership actually saves society money
Rather than costing society money , gun ownership saves society money .
When a crime victim shoots a criminal in self defense , that crime victim is saved from suffering death or expensive injuries .
The crime victim can continue to support their family financially and pay taxes on their income , rather than having the family lose a source of income and end up on welfare .
The family of the victim does n’t lose their loved one , and as a result wo n’t have to take time off of work to either grieve their death and make funeral arrangements , or to care for the physically and / or emotionally injured crime victim .
When a crime victim defends themselves , they are also taking a violent criminal off the streets .
If the criminal is fatally shot in self defense , that criminal will never again harm another victim .
Society also saves the expense of bringing that criminal to trial , then paying the high costs of jailing that criminal .
Even if the criminal survives being shot in self defense , or is merely held at gunpoint until the police arrive , that criminal will be efficiently apprehended with enough evidence to make convicting the criminal much easier .
While that criminal is serving the ( likely longer ) jail term , no other crime victims will suffer at their hands .
Armed self defense also helps prevent innocent people from being prosecuted and jailed for crimes they did n’t commit , which saves the public money .
When a criminal is shot in self defense , fatally or otherwise , there is little doubt as to who was the perpetrator .
An innocent citizen who has no gunshot wounds is not likely to be confused with the dead or injured criminal .
Instead of being jailed at taxpayer expense for a crime they did n’t commit , the innocent person can continue to earn money and pay taxes , supporting themselves and their family .
Furthermore , the American firearms industry is an multi-billion dollar enterprise which employs tens of thousands of people and generates hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes .
Eliminating this industry would hurt the economy , the budgets of many states , and leave even more Americans unemployed in the midst of a recession .
* Why the economic analysis really does n’t matter in the first place *
Gun ownership for self defense and other lawful purposes is a constitutional right , guaranteed by the 2nd Amendment .
As such , even if gun ownership were to hypothetically cost society money , the monetary costs would not justify a gun ban .
That is because constitutional rights are not subject to elimination because some members of society ( erroneously ) find them to be too expensive .
A comparison with another constitutional right should help make this point clearer :
The 6th Amendment gives criminal defendants the right to representation by counsel , and to have an attorney appointed to defend them at the public ’s expense should they be unable to afford their own attorney .
Providing every indigent defendant with a free lawyer is incredibly expensive – yet this right is guaranteed by the constitution , and as such cannot be eliminated in the interest of cost savings .
Twenty - five years on from 1984 famine food aid remains knee - jerk reaction
International aid agency Oxfam today ( 22 October 2009 ) called for a radical shake - up in the way the world deals with food crises in Ethiopia and beyond .
The agency rounded on what it called a " knee - jerk reaction " to food crises which is dominated by sending food aid .
While the agency recognised that sending food aid does save lives , the dominance of this approach fails to offer long - term solutions which would break these cyclical and chronic crises .
In a report , " Band Aids and Beyond " , published today to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Ethiopia famine , Oxfam says international donors need to adopt a new approach to humanitarian disasters which focuses on preparing communities to prevent and deal with disasters such as drought before they strike , rather than relying mainly on short - term emergency relief , such as imported food aid .
Twenty - five years ago Ethiopia was struck by one of the worst famines in its history .
An estimated one million people died and millions more suffered from extreme hunger and malnutrition .
Today , millions in Ethiopia and across East Africa are facing severe food and water shortages after years of poor rains .
It is estimated that drought costs Ethiopia $ 1.1 bn a year - almost eclipsing the total annual overseas assistance to the country .
Currently , 70 per cent of humanitarian aid to Ethiopia comes from the United States .
Out of the $ 3.2 bn of US humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia since 1991 , 94 % has been in the form of food aid - almost all of it sourced from within the USA rather than purchased locally or regionally .
Most US food aid has conditions applied to transport and packaging , which can cost up to $ 2 of US taxpayers ' money to deliver $ 1 of food aid .
Penny Lawrence , International Director for Oxfam , who has just returned from visiting Oxfam projects in Ethiopia , said :
" We can not make the rains come , but there is much more that we can do to break the cycle of drought driven disaster in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa .
Food aid offers temporary relief and has kept people alive in countless situations , but does not tackle the underlying causes that continue to make people vulnerable to disaster year - after - year .
" Donors need to shift their approach , and help to give communities the tools to tackle disasters before they strike .
Drought does not need to mean hunger and destitution .
If communities have irrigation for crops , grain stores , and wells to harvest rains then they can survive despite what the elements throw at them . "
It is essential that donors rise to the challenge and provide adequate funding for emergency assistance for this year 's crisis - current response by international donors is far below requirements estimated by Governments and UN agencies .
But in this report , Oxfam argues that it is equally essential that donors do more to back programmes that manage the risk of the disaster before it strikes , such as early warning systems , creating stragetically positioned stockpiles of food , medicine and other items , and irrigation programmes .
For instance , in Somali region Oxfam is building birkhads , or protected wells , to enable communities to ' harvest ' rain during the rainy season to make sure there is more water available nearby when the rains stop .
These types of programmes receive just 0.14 per cent of overseas aid .
Yet , the agency says , that it is a more sustainable approach , as the emergency response is designed to contribute to development and keep communities safer in the years to come .
This approach is cost effective : for every $ 1 invested in this approach , $ 2 - 4 are returned in terms of avoided or reduced disaster impacts .
The call for donors to shift their approach comes as Ethiopia faces ever - greater threats from natural disasters .
Climate scientists predict that by 2034 , the 50th anniversary of the 1984 Ethiopia famine , what are now droughts will become the norm , hitting the region three years out of every four .
A shift of approach is needed to prevent climate shocks developing into disasters which will push more peoople into poverty .
Lawrence said : " Climate change makes the urgency of this approach greater than ever before .
Ethiopians on the frontline of climate change cannot wait another 25 years for common sense to become common practice . "
Notes to editors :
1. Further examples disaster risk management programmes include :
Building birkhads , or protected wells , to enable communities can ' harvest ' rain during the rainy season to make sure there is more water available nearby when the rains stop .
Oxfam is doing work like this in the Somali region of Ethiopia .
Food or cash for work programmes , for example in the midst of food shortages in the Tigray region , people received food for work on an irrigation project , as a result of this the community can rely on a more regular supply of water for their crops .

Republicans have been whining recently about being shut out of the drafting of health care reform legislation .
President Obama has cut off communication with Republican leaders , going more than four months without hosting the bipartisan congressional leadership at the White House to discuss his health care proposal , the No. 2 Republican in the House said Wednesday .
Maybe that has something to with the fact that Republicans have made clear that as many concessions as Obama was willing to make , Republicans did n't have a single one of their own .
Not one .
There was nothing Democrats could do to get GOP support .
They simply would n't vote for anything remotely infringing on the insurance companies ' ability to screw patients over .
Satisfying every Republican demand short of scrapping the entire project , said Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , would still not capture GOP support .
" Senator Kyl and some of the others have talked about some of the things that are happening in committee , " McConnell told reporters , referring to Senate Finance Committee Republican Jon Kyl of Arizona .
" But the core point is this :
At the end of the day , if the government plan is either in the bill or out of the bill , whether they will be able to argue successfully or not whether tax funds are gonna be provided for abortion , whether or not they will be able to argue at the end that dollars for health care for illegals is in or out , what we do know is what the core of the bill is going to look like .
We know that for sure , " he said .
So they 're not willing to make concessions , they 're not willing to vote for anything , make up outrageous lies about killing grandmothers , and then they whine about being cut out of the process ?
The only frustration has been Democrats ' insistence on making something work .
Cantor may not be getting any phone calls from the White House , but Olympia Snowe is now co-president , and do n't get me started on Max Baucus .
But it looks as Republicans are pretty much finished .
Democratic patience has run out .
Iowa Sen .
Tom Harkin said today Republicans will not be at the table when the Senate merges the health - care bills from two committees before sending one to the floor .
Harkin , a Democrat and chairman of one of the committees , also said any bill that passes Congress will include a government - run insurance option for Americans to buy .
" We will have a bill on the president ’s desk before Christmas , a health - reform bill .
It will have a lot of good stuff in it .
It will have a lot of prevention and wellness programs in there that I ’ve been fighting for , " Harkin told reporters in a morning conference call .
" And it will have a public option . "
" The question of if it does n’t is n’t even an option , " he added [...]
Asked whether Republicans would be at the table when Harkin ’s committee ’s bill is merged with legislation pending in the Senate Finance Committee , Harkin said no .
" No , this will be a proposal by the Democrats to bring a bill on the floor .
And that ’s what I have said before , that the people of this country — I keep saying — the people of this country pretty overwhelmingly elected Barack Obama last fall and to make changes , " he said .
" The people of this country overwhelmingly elected Democrats to the House and Senate . "
Definitely progress .
Will it be a robust public option , or some piece of crap ?
Time will tell , but at least we have a fighting chance with Democrats monopolizing the process .
The time for GOP shenanigans is over ( including Olympia Snowe 's games ) .
This will be a Democratic bill , so scrap all idiotic compromises trying to bring GOP support along , and draft the best possible bill .
Then twist some arms to get the 60 Democrats to vote for cloture , even if a bunch defect on the final vote .
This is the reason Obama and Reid told us we had to tolerate Lieberman .
Time to deliver .
( More on the conference committee news in this recommended diary . )
In the current version of the algorithm , having an < initial > element with a transition to a < history > pseudo - state leads to unexpected results .
The default history state is entered , even if the state has already been visited and there is a non -default history value .
In the case of transitions selected from parallel regions , the current algorithm completely specifies a ) which transition is to be selected in case of conflicts ( see isPreempted in B Algorithm for SCXML Interpretation ) and b ) the order in which those transitions should be taken ( see microstep in B Algorithm for SCXML Interpretation ) .
However , we could avoid completely specifying one or both of these choices .
This would give implementations greater flexibility , but would impair the portability of applications , which would not necessarily behave the same way on different platforms .
We solicit feedback on these alternatives .
Would such a change of naming conventions be an improvement ?
Could it serve to attract more new users to SCXML ?
Or would it break to much with " tradition " and thus repell some current users ?
We solicit feedback on this matter .
" go to s on e if x is bigger than one , assign two to /a/ b and send e2 with a payload of five to t after 2 seconds "
It seems there might be a way to name elements and attributes that 1 ) avoids abbreviations , 2 ) yet uses less space , 3 ) is easier to write , 4 ) is easier to read ( since it is closer to English ) and 5 ) suggests an natural order of attributes within elements , based on how the element reads when it is translated into English .
Note that the latter notation ( but not so much the former ) suggests a very natural translation into English , e.g. as follows :
We are considering redesigning this aspect of SCXML .
For example , what is now written as follows :
It could be argued that the current choice of names of SCXML elements and attributes is not optimal .
Often rather long words are used ( e.g. " transition " , " target " and " location " ) , making lines longer than necessary , and contributing to the size of SCXML documents .
Also , abbreviations are used in some cases ( e.g. " expr " and " cond " ) but not in others , which may give the impression of a language not well thought out .
Moreover , conventions for how to order the attributes within elements are lacking , which may make SCXML documents harder than necessary to read and understand .
We are considering adding an iterative construct , such as ' foreach ' or ' while ' , to the executable content in the Core module .
Such a construct is not strictly necessary , since iterators can be modeled by conditionalized targetless transitions .
For example , to model a ' while ' loop with condition C and body B , create an eventless transition with condition C and executable content B .
It will keep firing and executing B without leaving its containing state as long as C is true .
However , an explicit iterator might permit more succinct state machines .
We sollicit comments on the usefulness of such a construct .
B Algorithm for SCXML Interpretation
This section presents a normative algorithm for the interpretation of an SCXML document .
Implementations are free to implement SCXML interpreters in any way they choose , but they must behave as if they were using the algorithm defined here .
The fact that SCXML implements a variant of the Statechart formalism does not as such determine a semantics for SCXML .
Many different Statechart variants have been proposed , each with its own semantics .
This section presents an informal semantics of SCXML documents , as well as a normative algorithm for the interpretation of SCXML documents .
Informal Semantics
The following definitions and highlevel principles and constraint are intended to provide a background to the normative algorithm , and to serve as a guide for the proper understanding of it .
Preliminary definitions
state
An element of type < state > , < parallel > , < final > or < scxml >.
pseudo state
An element of type < initial > or < history >.
transition target A state , or an element of type < history >.
atomic state A state of type < state > with no child states , or a state of type < final >.
compound state A state of type < state > with at least one child state , or a state of type < scxml >.
start state A dummy state equipped with a transition which when triggered by the Run event leads to the initial state (s ) .
Added by the interpreter with an id guaranteed to be unique within the statemachine .
The only role of the start state is to simplify the algorithm .
configuration
The maximal consistent set of states ( including parallel and final states ) that the machine is currently in .
We note that if a state s is in the configuration c , it is always the case that the parent of s ( if any ) is also in c .
Note , however , that < scxml > is not a( n explicit ) member of the configuration .
source state
The source state of a transition is the atomic state from which the transition is leaving .
target state A target state of a transition is a state that the transition is entering .
Note that a transition can have zero or more target states .
targetless transition A transition having zero target states .
eventless transition A transition lacking the ' event ' attribute .
external event An SCXML event appearing in the external event queue .
See section ? for details .
internal event
An event appearing in the internal event queue .
It 's exact representation is implementation dependent , but a simple string would work .
macrostep
An external event causes an SCXML state machine to take exactly one macrostep .
A macrostep consists of a sequence ( a chain ) of microsteps .
However , if the external event does not enable any transitions , no microstep will be taken , and the corresponding macrostep will be empty .
microstep
If an external event enables one or ( in the case of parallel states ) more transitions , a microstep is taken , involving the processing of each of the enabled transitions .
This microstep may change the the current configuration , update the datamodel and / or generate new ( internal and / or external ) events .
This , by causality , may in turn enable additional transitions which will be handled in the next microstep in the sequence , and so on .
Principles and Constraints
We state here some principles and constraints , on the level of semantics , that SCXML adheres to :
Encapsulation An SCXML processor is a pure event processor .
The only way to get data into an SCXML statemachine is to send external events to it .
The only way to get data out is to receive events from it .
Causality
There shall be a causal justification of why events are ( or are not ) returned back to the environment , which can be traced back to the events provided by the system environment .
Determinism
An SCXML statemachine which does not invoke any external event processor must always react with the same behavior ( i.e. the same sequence of output events ) to a given sequence of input events ( unless , of course , the statemachine is explicitly programmed to exhibit an non-deterministic behavior ) .
In particular , the availability of the < parallel > element must not introduce any non-determinism of the kind often associated with concurrency .
Note that observable determinism does not necessarily hold for state machines that invoke other event processors .
Completeness
An SCXML interpreter must always treat an SCXML document as completely specifying the behavior of a statemachine .
In particular , SCXML is designed to use priorities ( based on document order ) to resolve situations which other statemachine frameworks would allow to remain under - specified ( and thus non-deterministic , although in a different sense from the above ) .
Run to completion SCXML adheres to a run to completion semantics in the sense that an external event can only be processed when the processing of the previous external event has completed , i.e. when all microsteps ( involving all triggered transitions ) have been completely taken .
Termination A microstep always terminates .
A macrostep may not .
A macrostep that does not terminate may be said to consist of an infinitely long sequence of microsteps .
This is currently allowed .
Algorithm
This section presents a normative algorithm for the interpretation of SCXML documents .
Implementations are free to implement SCXML interpreters in any way they choose , but they must behave as if they were using the algorithm defined here .
Note that the algorithm assumes a Lisp - like semantics in which the empty Set null is equivalent to boolean ' false ' and all other entities are equivalent to ' true ' .
Datatypes
These are the abstract datatypes that are used in the algorithm .
datatype List function head ( ) // Returns the head of the list function tail ( ) //
Returns the tail of the list function append(l ) //
Returns the list appended with l function filter (f ) //
Returns the list of elements that satify the predicate f function some(f ) //
Returns true if some element in the list satifies the predicate f function every ( f ) //
Returns true if every element in the list satifies the predicate f datatype Set procedure add(e ) //
Adds e to the set procedure delete(e ) // Deletes e from the set function member(e ) //
Is e a member of set ? function isEmpty ( ) //
Is the set empty ?
function toList ( ) // Converts the set to a list function diff ( set2 ) // Returns all members of Set that are not in set2 datatype Queue procedure enqueue(e ) //
Puts e last in the queue function dequeue ( ) // Removes and returns first element in queue function isEmpty ( ) //
Is the queue empty ?
datatype BlockingQueue procedure enqueue(e ) //
Puts e last in the queue function dequeue ( ) //
Removes and returns first element in queue , blocks if queue is empty
Global variables
The following variables are global from the point of view of the algorithm .
Their values will be set in the procedure interpret ( ) .
global datamodel ; global configuration ; global internalQueue ; global externalQueue ; global history Value ; global continue
Procedures and Functions
This section defines the procedures and functions that make up the core of the SCXML interpreter .
procedure interpret ( scxml , id )
The purpose of this procedure is to initialize the interpreter .
It is called with a parsed representation of an SCXML document .
In order to interpret an SCXML document , first perform inplace expansions of states by including SCXML source referenced by urls ( see 3.13 Referencing External Files ) and change initial attributes to initial container children with empty transitions to the state from the attribute .
Then ( optionally ) validate the resulting SCXML , and throw an exception if validation fails .
Create an empty configuration complete with a new populated instance of the data model and a execute the global scripts .
Create the two queues to handle events and set the global continue variable to true .
Call executeTransitionContent on the initial transition that is a child of scxml .
Then call enterState on the initial transition .
Finally , start the interpreter 's event loop .
procedure interpret( doc ) : expandScxmlSource ( doc ) if ( ! valid( doc ) ) { fail with error} configuration = new Set ( ) previousConfiguration = new Set ( ) datamodel = new Datamodel ( doc ) executeGlobalScriptElements ( doc ) internalQueue = new Queue ( ) externalQueue = new BlockingQueue ( ) continue = true executeTransitionContent([doc.initial.transition ] ) enterState([doc.initial.transition ] ) startEventLoop ()
procedure startEventLoop ()
Upon entering the state machine , we take all internally enabled transitions , namely those that do n't require an event and those that are triggered by internal events .
( Internal events can only be generated by the state machine itself . )
When all such transitions have been taken , we move to the main event loop , which is driven by external events .
procedure procedure startEventLoop ( ) : previousConfiguration = null ; initialStepComplete = false ; until( initialStepComplete ) : enabledTransitions = selectTransitions ( null ) if ( enabledTransitions.isEmpty ( ) ) : internalEvent = internalQueue.dequeue ( ) // this call returns immediately if no event is available if ( internalEvent ) : datamodel.assignValue( " event " , internalEvent ) enabledTransitions = selectTransitions ( internalEvent ) if ( enabledTransitions ) : microstep(enabledTransitions.toList ( ) else : initialStepComplete = true mainEventLoop ()
procedure mainEventLoop ()
This loop runs until we enter a top - level final state or an external entity cancels processing .
In either case ' continue ' will be set to false ( see EnterStates , below , for termination by entering a top - level final state . )
Each iteration through the loop consists of three main steps : 1 ) execute any < invoke > tags for atomic states that we entered on the last iteration through the loop 2 ) Wait for an external event and then execute any transitions that it triggers
3 ) Take any subsequent internally enabled transitions , namely those that do n't require an event or that are triggered by an internal event .
This event loop thus enforces run-to - completion semantics , in which the system process an external event and then takes all the ' follow - up ' transitions that the processing has enabled before looking for another external event .
For example , suppose that the external event queue contains events e1 and e2 and the machine is in state s1 .
If processing e1 takes the machine to s2 and generates internal event e3 , and s2 contains a transition t triggered by e3 , the system is guaranteed to take t , no matter what transitions s2 or other states have that would be triggered by e2 .
Note that this is true even though e2 was already in the external event queue when e3 was generated .
In effect , the algorithm treats the processing of e3 as finishing up the processing of e1 .
procedure procedure mainEventLoop ( ) : while ( continue ) : for state in configuration.diff ( previousConfiguration ) : if ( isAtomic ( state ) ) : if state .
invoke : state.invokeid = executeInvoke( state.invoke ) datamodel.assignValue(state.invoke.attribute (' idlocation ' ) , state.invokeid ) previousConfiguration = configuration externalEvent = externalQueue.dequeue( ) // this call blocks until an event is available datamodel.assignValue ( " event " , externalEvent ) enabledTransitions = selectTransitions ( externalEvent ) if ( enabledTransitions ) : microstep(enabledTransitions.toList ( ) ) // now take any newly enabled null transitions and any transitions triggered by internal events macroStepComplete = false ; until( macroStepComplete ) : enabledTransitions = selectEventlessTransitions ( ) if ( enabledTransitions.isEmpty ( ) ) : internalEvent = internalQueue.dequeue ( ) // this call returns immediately if no event is available if ( internalEvent ) : datamodel.assignValue( " event " , internalEvent ) enabledTransitions = selectTransitions ( internalEvent ) if ( enabledTransitions ) : microstep(enabledTransitions.toList ( ) else : macroStepComplete = true // if we get here , we have reached a top - level final state or some external entity has set continue to false exitInterpreter ( )
procedure exitInterpreter ( )
The purpose of this procedure is to exit the current SCXML process by exiting all active states .
If the machine is in a top - level final state , a Done event is generated .
procedure exitInterpreter ( ) : inFinalState = false statesToExit = new Set( configuration ) for s in statesToExit.toList ( ) .sort ( exitOrder ) for content in s.onexit : executeContent ( content ) for inv in s.invoke : cancelInvoke ( inv ) if ( isFinalState (s ) && isScxmlState(s.parent ( ) ) ) : inFinalState = true configuration . delete(s ) if ( inFinalState ) : sendDoneEvent ( ??? )
function selectEventlessTransitions ()
This function selects all transitions that are enabled in the current configuration that do not require an event trigger .
First test if the state has been preempted by a transition that has already been selected and that will cause the state to be exited when the transition is taken .
If the state has not been preempted , find a transition with no ' event ' attribute whose condition evaluates to true .
If multiple matching transitions are present , take the first in document order .
If none are present , search in the state 's ancestors in ancestory order until one is found .
As soon as such a transition is found , add it to enabled Transitions , and proceed to the next atomic state in the configuration .
If no such transition is found in the state or its ancestors , proceed to the next state in the configuration .
When all atomic states have been visited and transitions selected , return the set of enabled transitions .
function selectEventlessTransitions ( event ) : enabledTransitions = new Set ( ) atomicStates = configuration.toList ( ).filter ( isAtomicState ) for state in atomicStates : if !( isPreempted (s , enabledTransitions ) ) : loop : for s in [ state ] .append( getProperAncestors ( state , null ) ) : for t in s.transition : if ( t.attribute ( ' event ' ) == null && conditionMatch (t ) ) enabledTransitions.add(t ) break loop return enabled Transitions
function selectTransitions ( event )
The purpose of the selectTransitions ( ) procedure is to collect the transitions that are enabled by this event in the current configuration .
Create an empty set of enabled Transitions .
For each atomic state in the configuration , first check if the event is the result of an < invoke > in this state .
If so , apply any < finalize > code in the state .
Next test if the state has been preempted by a transition that has already been selected and that will cause the state to be exited when the transition is taken .
If the state has not been preempted , find a transition whose ' event ' attribute matches event and whose condition evaluates to true .
If multiple matching transitions are present , take the first in document order .
If none are present , search in the state 's ancestors in ancestory order until one is found .
As soon as such a transition is found , add it to enabled Transitions , and proceed to the next atomic state in the configuration .
If no such transition is found in the state or its ancestors , proceed to the next state in the configuration .
When all atomic states have been visited and transitions selected , return the set of enabled transitions .
function selectTransitions ( event ) : enabledTransitions = new Set ( ) atomicStates = configuration.toList ( ).filter ( isAtomicState ) for state in atomicStates : if ( event.attribute ( ' invokeid ' ) != null && state.invokeid = event.invokeid ) : //event is the result of an < invoke > in this state applyFinalize ( state , event ) if !( isPreempted (s , enabledTransitions ) ) : loop : for s in [ state ] .append( getProperAncestors ( state , null ) ) : for t in s.transition : if ( t.attribute ( ' event ' ) != null && is Prefix ( t.attribute ( ' event ' ) , event.name ) && conditionMatch(t ) ) : enabledTransitions.add(t ) break loop return enabled Transitions
function is Preempted (s transitionList )
Return true if a transition T in transitionList exits an ancestor of state s.
In this case , taking T will pull the state machine out of s and we say that it preempts the selection of a transition from s.
Such preemption will occur only if s is a descendant of a parallel region and T exits that region .
If we did not do this preemption check , we could end up in an illegal configuration , namely one in which there were multiple active states that were not all descendants of a common parallel ancestor .
function is Preempted (s transitionList ) : preempted = false for t in transitionList : if ( t.attribute ( ' target ' ) != null ) : LCA = findLCA ( [t.parent ( ) ].append( getTargetStates (t ) ) ) if ( isDescendant (s , LCA ) ) : preempted = true break return preempted
procedure microstep ( enabledTransitions )
The purpose of the microstep procedure is to process the set of transitions enabled by an external event , an internal event , or by the presence or absence of certain values in the datamodel at the current point in time .
The processing of the enabled transitions must be done in parallel ( ' lock step ' ) in the sense that their source states must first be exited , then their actions must be executed , and finally their target states entered .
procedure microstep( enabledTransitions ) : exitStates( enabledTransitions ) executeTransitionContent(enabledTransitions ) enterStates( enabledTransitions )
procedure exitStates( enabledTransitions )
Create an empty statesToExit set .
For each transition t in enabled Transitions , if t is targetless then do nothing , else let LCA be the least common ancestor state of the source state and target states of t .
Add to the statesToExit set all states in the configuration that are descendants of LCA .
Convert the statesToExit set to a list and sort it in exitOrder .
For each state s in the list , if s has a deep history state h , set the history value of h to be the list of all atomic descendants of s that are members in the current configuration , else set its value to be the list of all immediate children of s that are members of the current configuration .
Again for each state s in the list , first execute any onexit handlers , then cancel any ongoing invocations , and finally remove s from the current configuration .
procedure exitStates ( enabledTransitions ) : statesToExit = new Set ( ) for t in enabled Transitions : if ( t.attribute ( ' target ' ) != null ) : LCA = findLCA ( [t.parent ( ) ].append(getTargetStates(t ) ) ) for s in configuration .
toList ( ) : if ( isDescendant (s , LCA ) ) : statesToExit.add(s ) statesToExit = statesToExit.toList ( ).sort ( exitOrder ) for s in statesToExit : for h in s.history : f = ( h.attribute ( ' type ' ) == " deep " ) ? lambda( s0 ) : isAtomicState ( s0 ) && isDescendant ( s0 , s ) : lambda( s0 ) : s0.parent ( ) == s history Value [ h.attribute ( 'id ' ) ] = configuration.toList ( ) . filter(f ) for s in statesToExit : for content in s.onexit : executeContent ( content ) for inv in s.invoke : cancelInvoke( inv ) configuration.delete(s )
procedure executeTransitionContent(enabledTransitions )
For each transition in the list of enabled Transitions , execute its executable content .
procedure executeTransitions ( enabledTransitions ) : for t in enabled Transitions : executeContent(t )
procedure enterStates( enabledTransitions )
Create an empty statesToEnter set , and an empty statesForDefaultEntry set .
For each transition t in enabled Transitions , if t is targetless then do nothing , else let LCA be the least common ancestor state of the source state and target states of t .
For each target state s , if s is a history state then add either the history values associated with s or s 's default target to statesToEnter .
Else ( if s is not a history state ) , add s to statesToEnter .
Convert statesToEnter to a list and sort it in enterorder .
For each state s in the list , first add s to the current configuration , then invoke any external processes specified in < invoke > elements and assign their sessionid s to the datamodel , keyed on the < invoke > element 's id , then execute any onentry handlers , and finally , if s is a final state , generate relevant Done events .
If we have reached a top - level final state , exit the interpreter .
procedure enterStates ( enabledTransitions ) : statesToEnter = new Set( ) statesForDefaultEntry = new Set ( ) for t in enabled Transitions : if ( t.attribute ( ' target ' ) != null ) : LCA = findLCA ( [t.parent ( ) ].append( getTargetStates(t ) ) ) for s in getTargetStates ( t ) : if ( isHistoryState (s ) ) : if ( historyValue[s.attribute ( 'id ' ) ] != null ) : for s0 in history Value[ s.attribute ( 'id ' ) ] : addStatesToEnter(s0 , LCA , statesToEnter,statesForDefaultEntry ) else : for s0 in getTargetStates ( s.transition ) : addStatesToEnter(s0 , LCA , statesToEnter,statesForDefaultEntry ) else : addStatesToEnter(s , LCA , statesToEnter,statesForDefaultEntry ) statesToEnter = statesToEnter.toList().sort ( enterOrder ) for s in statesToEnter : configuration.add(s ) for content in s.onentry : executeContent ( content ) if ( statesForDefaultEntry.member(s ) ) : executeContent(s.initial.transition.children ( ) ) if ( isFinalState (s ) ) : parent = s.parent ( ) grandparent = parent.parent ( ) internalQueue.enqueue(parent.attribute ( 'id ') + " . Done " ) if ( isParallelState ( grandparent ) ) : if ( getChildStates ( grandparent ) .every( isInFinalState ) ) : internalQueue.enqueue(grandparent.attribute ( 'id ') + " . Done " ) for s in configuration .
toList ( ) : if ( isFinalState (s ) && isScxmlState (s.parent ( ) ) ) : continue = false ;
procedure addStatesToEnter(s, root , statesToEnter , statesForDefaultEntry )
The purpose of this procedure is to add to statesToEnter all states that must be entered as a result of entering state s .
These include ancestors of s , parallel siblings of s or its ancestors , and s 's default children , if s is a parallel or compound state .
Note that this procedure permanently modifies both statesToEnter and statesForDefaultEntry .
First , add s to statesToEnter .
Then , if s is a parallel state , add each of s 's children to statesToEnter .
Else , if s is a compound state , add s to statesForDefaultEntry and add its default initial state to statesToEnter .
Finally , for each ancestor anc of s , add anc to statesToEnter and if anc is a parallel state , add the children of anc that does not have a descendant on statesToEnter to statesToEnter .
procedure addStatesToEnter(s, root , statesToEnter , statesForDefaultEntry ) : statesToEnter.add(s ) if ( isParallelState(s ) ) : for child in getChildStates (s ) : addStatesToEnter( child , s,statesToEnter,statesForDefaultEntry ) elif ( isCompoundState(s ) ) : statesForDefaultEntry.add(s ) addStatesToEnter(getDefaultInitialState(s ) , s,statesToEnter,statesForDefaultEntry ) for anc in getProperAncestors (s , root ) : statesToEnter.add( anc ) if ( isParallelState ( anc ) ) : for pChild in getChildStates ( anc ) : if ( !statesToEnter.toList ().some( lambda(s ) : isDescendant(s, anc ) ) ) : addStatesToEnter( pChild , anc, statesToEnter, statesForDefaultEntry )
procedure isInFinalState(s )
Return true if state s is a compound < state > and one of its children is a < final > state and is a member of the configuration , or if s is a < parallel > state and isInFinalState is true of all its children .
function isInFinalState(s ) : if ( isCompoundState (s ) ) : return getChildStates(s) .some( lambda(s ) : is FinalState(s ) && configuration . member(s ) ) elif ( isParallelState(s ) ) : return getChildStates(s).every ( isInFinalState ) else : return false
function findLCA ( stateList )
Return the state s such that s is a proper ancestor of all states on stateList and no descendant of s has this property .
Note that there is guaranteed to be such a state since the < scxml > element ( which we treat as a state here ) is a common ancestor of all states .
Note also that since we are speaking of proper ancestor ( parent or parent of a parent , etc. ) the LCA is never a member of stateList .
function findLCA ( stateList ) : for anc in getProperAncestors( stateList.head ( ) , null ) : if ( stateList.tail ( ).every ( lambda(s ) : isDescendant (s , anc ) ) ) : return anc
The unromantic truth about why we kiss - to spread germs
It is an international symbol of love and romance .
But the kiss may have evolved for reasons that are far more practical - and less alluring .
British scientists believe it developed to spread germs .
They say that the uniquely human habit allows a bug that is dangerous in pregnancy to be passed from man to woman to give her time to build up immunity .
Pucker up : Kissing the same person for about six months provides optimum protection from potentially deadly germs , says Dr Colin Hendrie
Cytomegalovirus , which lurks in saliva , normally causes no problems .
But it can be extremely dangerous if caught while pregnant and can kill unborn babies or cause birth defects .
These can include problems ranging from deafness to cerebral palsy .
Writing in the journal Medical Hypotheses , researcher Dr Colin Hendrie from the University of Leeds said : ' Female inoculation with a specific male 's cytomegalovirus is most efficiently achieved through mouth - to - mouth contact and saliva exchange , particularly where the flow of saliva is from the male to the typically shorter female . '
Kissing the same person for about six months provides optimum protection , he added .
During a relatively chaste first kiss , just a small amount of virus is passed to the woman , cutting her odds of becoming ill .
Do n't fancy yours much :
The cytomegalovirus up close
As the relationships progresses and the kisses become more passionate , her immunity builds up .
By the time she becomes pregnant , the odds of her unborn baby becoming infected are much lower .
Previously scientists have claimed that kissing acts as a form of evolutionary quality control , with saliva holding clues to fertility , health and genes .
But the psychologists from Leeds and the University of Central Lancashire said these things can be judged without getting quite so intimate .
Dr Hendrie said : ' Information concerning body tone , smell , reproductive condition , disease state and , of course , personal physical and oral hygiene can all be gained solely from close physical proximity . '

IPv6 , the next generation Internet protocol , has been around for more than ten years , but has never seen any widespread adoption - until about a year ago , that is .
In early August of 2008 , uTorrent started to support IP v6 for its P2P traffic , and things changed drastically , according to a new blog post from Arbor Networks : uTorrent 's version 1.8 caused IP v6 traffic to increase 15 - fold within ten months .
But everyone 's favored Bittorrent client could n't completely turn IPv6 's fate around , at least not on its own .
Infrastructure improvements needed to be made to actually get more torrents to be swapped via the new protocol .
That happened when Hurricane Electric booted up new IP v6 relays around the world this April , which gave IP v6 another huge push .
Of course , the Pirate Bay has been supporting IPv6 torrent clients since January , and currently around 200,000 users are connected to its trackers via IPv6 .
IPv6 was originally invented to deal with the fact that more and more devices had a need for a finite amount of IP addresses .
One interesting result of IPv6 will be that you wo n't need to deal with NAT anymore , which should make P2P much more efficient and accessible to the average user .

STOCKTON --
A traffic stop involving a young officer and the son of a small - town mayor has the whole town talking .
The mayor of Stockton tried to fire the officer for issuing his son a ticket .
Cpl. Joshua Rowell told KSL
News he was just doing his job .
He said he acted professionally when he wrote the driver a ticket and was shocked when he was suddenly asked to hand over his badge .
Rowell is a new member of the five - man Stockton police force .
So , last Tuesday he did n't think twice about pulling over a driver in a small white car for avoiding a DUI stop .

Some already calling for revote in small town
When Mayor Dan Rydalch suspended an officer who gave his son a ticket , it set of lot of Stockton residents off .
Some town council members say he needs to retire .
" He did n't have a driver 's license , so I issued him a citation for that , " Rowell explained .
He did n't think twice , that is , until he handed the ticket to the court clerk .
" She looked at it and said , ‘ Hey , you know you just gave the mayor 's son a ticket ? '
And I said , ‘ Oh , crap , ' " Rowell said .
He said he had never met the driver , 29 - year - old Jared Rydalch , before .
He said Rydalch told him he was out looking for his dog , and asked him to tell the other officers to not pull him over again .
" I told him , ‘ No .
If I see you driving around again , I 'm going to pull you over again , ' " Rowell said .
Rowell said he knew there was trouble when , about 20 minutes later , he found the chief of police in the mayor 's truck in a heated discussion .
Then he said the mayor , Dan Rydalch , rolled down the window and demanded he get in his truck .
When he refused , Rydalch abruptly fired him on the spot .
" He told me , ‘ All right , I want your badge in the morning , ' " Rowell said .
" I tried to defend myself and say , ‘ First of all , look , he was breaking the law .
Second of all , I did n't know he was your son . ' "
Shortly after the incident , Rowell was told he was suspended without pay , indefinitely .
" The mayor , I think , was wrong , " said Stockton City Council member David Durtschi .
According to Durtschi , not only was Mayor Rydalch out of line , the council stands behind Cpl. Rowell .
In fact , the town is so upset about the mayor 's actions , many of the citizens are trying to change their write - in ballots for the upcoming election .
" I think the mayor did make a mistake , " one Stockton resident told KSL News .
Another said , " I was very shocked , very shocked , because I thought it was a little extreme . "
As for Rowell , he just wants the job he loves back .
" There 's no more respectable position than a police officer , in my mind , " Rowell said .
We tried repeatedly to get in touch with the mayor .
Another Stockton city council member , Kendall Thomas , told KSL News the mayor is conducting the investigation into any wrongdoing in the incident and has not consulted any of the council members .
A special council meeting is scheduled for Thursday night to discuss the incident .

Unwilling to fly without her pooch by her side , an Israeli woman purchased the entire business section of an El Al flight from Paris to Israel .
The woman identified as Rivka , told the Channel 10 television network Wednesday afternoon , she could not bear the thought of her eight - year - old boxer dog being placed in a cage in the cargo hold of the plane for the duration of the flight .

" He is my baby , and I asked El Al to rent out the business section and paid $ 32,000 to ensure my dog , Or ( light in Hebrew ) , would be able to sit next to me for the entire flight , " she told the television .
Rivka said it is the first time the two have flown since 2006 .
In the past her pet suffered from severe anxiety after flying alone in the cargo section , she said .
This time she decided to purchase the entire business section of the jetliner and enjoy the dog 's company for the four - hour flight from Paris to Israel .

What do you think about the $ 250 relief payment proposed for seniors ?
It 's a good idea
It 's not enough
It 's too much or View results
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
In the past , Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Ken Lewis has received an annual salary of $ 1.5 million .
But this year he will get nothing .
That means no salary , no bonuses .
In fact , he will have to repay Bank of America Corp . ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) the more than $ 1 million he has already earned in his final year on the job .
Lewis agreed to the deal on Thursday after the Treasury department 's pay czar , Kenneth Feinberg , " suggested " it to him , said Bob Stickler , a spokesman for the bank .
Stickler added that Lewis " felt it was not in the best interest of Bank of America or him to get into a dispute with the pay master . "
Lewis , who announced last month that he will retire at the year 's end , will still have $ 53 million in pension benefits waiting for him .
The outgoing chief will also have other stock awards and deferred compensation for a total $ 69 million payout , said Stickler .
Feinberg does not have authority to modify compensation awarded before 2009 , which includes Lewis ' retirement package and stock holdings from a four - decade career at the bank .
But Stickler asked , " Since when does law apply to this administration ? "
As a result , he said Bank of America is unsure whether or not Lewis ' retirement package is under review by the government .
Wall Street has been waiting for Feinberg to announce rules on compensation at the seven firms that have received large government loans last year as the financial system neared collapse .
And while firms are expecting Feinberg to crack down on payouts , a complete cut is bold .
The deal comes before the Charlotte , N.C. - based bank announces its third - quarter earnings on Friday morning .
Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share to decrease by 21 cents from a year ago when they were flat .
Bret Hedican , who played in more than 1,000 NHL games and was on the Stanley Cup - winning Carolina Hurricanes in 2006 , announced his retirement on Wednesday .
The 39 - year - old defenceman also suited up for St. Louis , Vancouver , Florida and Anaheim during his 17 NHL seasons .
Last season with the Ducks , he played 51 games , recording six points .
In 1,039 career regular - season contests , Hedican had 294 points , including 55 goals .
He added another 26 points ( four goals ) in 108 playoff games .
" I 'm proud to have played this game for as long as I have and I 'm leaving with no regrets , " Hedican said in a statement .
" I want to thank all of the general managers who believed in me , the coaches who got the best out of me and all of my teammates who made me a better hockey player . "
The native of St. Paul , Minn. , will likely be best remembered for his time with the Hurricanes .
He was a key blue - liner on Carolina 's 2006 Stanley Cup championship team , as well as the squad that reached the final in 2002 .
Hedican also helped Vancouver get to the Cup final in 1994 in his first of six seasons with the Canucks .
But the smooth skater said his most enjoyable years came while playing in Raleigh , N.C. , where he lived with his wife , figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi .
" The one thing I really am sad about is that I did n't retire a Hurricane , " Hedican , who also played for the U.S. Olympic team in 1992 and ' 96 , told Raleigh 's News and Observer .
" I really wanted to .
I wish it was possible to sign a one - day contract .
" I 'd pay [ general manager ] Jimmy [ Rutherford ] to let me sign for a dollar and put the jersey on again . "

ANYONE WHO TRAVELS frequently has probably built a lengthy list of tips and tricks to help minimize the bulk of items they need to take with them .
Nowadays , many people carry a laptop along , but even the most robust desktop replacement versions have hard drives that pale in comparison to a desktop - class external hard drive for storing data .
Many technologies such as external hard drives that were developed for corporate America have seen their fruits trickle down into the home market .
While one might assume I ’m suggesting you carry an external drive with you , I ’m introducing a more efficient way of accessing all your files while on the road .
In a business environment , it would n’t make sense to attach an external hard drive to every workstation especially when sharing data is essential , so Network Attached Storage ( NAS ) devices were created .
NAS devices are external hard drives that plug into a router via Ethernet cables , allowing authorized users on the network access to the same data .
Hard drive manufacturer Western Digital rolled out two feature - packed NAS devices called the My Book World Edition ( 2 terrabytes in size ) and the My Book World Edition II that does everything a NAS device should do .
One of the most interesting features for travelers is the My Book ’s built - in remote access technology called MioNet .
Simply load the MioNet software onto your laptop or NetBook and have instant access to everything you keep stored at home or in the office , whenever you want it , wherever you happen to be .
Installation is a breeze and using the software is extremely intuitive .
Additionally , with as much as 2 terabytes ( TB ) of storage capacity , you can keep thousands of photos , tons of home movies , enough music to fill your ears for weeks and all the other important documents you need with instant access anywhere .
If you travel often and need to access your digital data on a regular basis , stop hauling it around with you on an external hard drive , and opt for instant remote access to your digital data , all kept securely at home .

When I was sixteen and stupid ( and were n’t we all ? ) , I had this silly idea that when you form a band , the ultimate goal was to get signed .
Once you ’re signed , you ’ve made it .
Cascades of money gush from the pockets of your fans , you score the covers of Time , Atlantic Monthly , Rolling Stone and Home & Garden , you ’re given the master key to the Playboy mansion , and , of course , you get to quit your day job .
Now , not to say this is n’t all 100 % true , but since then I ’ve been able to witness this mythical beast known as a “ record contract , ” and she ’s quite a bit hairier than I once thought .
She looks like this , minus the unfortunate puritan censorship of her naughty bits [ Editor ’s note : you can click on any of the below images to enlarge them . ] :
That ’s a lot of bullshit compacted into three pages .
Now while those of you with law degrees may be masturbating furiously at this very moment , when I first saw this monstrosity , I was repelled .
To lift an expression from Gilbert Gottfried : what most bands dream of their whole careers in actuality has the sex appeal of a school bus fire .
And that ’s fine .
What matters with a record deal is n’t so much the style , but the substance .
So let ’s set our Babelfish translators to “ Legalese ” and attempt to shave away the bearded layers of this noble yet perplexing creature .
Here the contract is establishing its “ Me Tarzan .
You Jane . ”
Notice that “ The Artist ” in the eyes of the label is not the band as a whole , but a lone representative signing for the group .
Also note that with all the necessary personal information , it looks a hell of a lot like a job application , and that ’s because that ’s what it is .
The band is agreeing to become employees of the label .
So if you want your boss at your day job to fuck off , now you ’re agreeing to have a second boss .
Of importance is the word “ performing , ” because the more we little circus monkeys play live and tour , the more the label can take advantage of free advertising .
Unless you happen to introduce yourself as Garm , Fenris , Varg or John Lennon , refusing to play live while bound to a contract is bound to get you dropped .
Also , just so it ’s clear , the contract makes sure the artist understands that the label is the one sitting at the grown up table doing BUSINESS while the artist is eating crayons with the other children .
Blah blah blah Websters definition circa 1953 yadda yadda antiquated music terms .
But wait !
What ’s this I see ?
“ ’ Territory ’ shall mean and include all countries throughout the world ? ”
Well that ’s interesting .
Imagine you ’ve just signed to a Japanese label , without any offices in North America , and they throw in this gem of a clause .
Well too bad for you if you ’d like to limit the Japanese label to exclusive rights of the sale of your album in Asian and Oceanic markets only , and then sign to a separate US label to handle your stateside business , because you ’re on lockdown .
Of course , the hypothetical Japanese label , without any significant business connections in the USA , and a less developed understanding of that market , will have a harder time selling you there ( Vince comments on that very subject here ) .
What they ’ll usually opt to do instead , is to license the rights to your music to a North American label , who can then concentrate its efforts on its own geographic area .
That sounds great and all , but what it really means is there ’s one more middleman between the artist and the money being earned from the artist ’s music .
So basically the Japanese label is sub-contracting the work in foreign markets to another company and of course the band will be losing out on more royalties .
“ Exercises its option ? ” Sounds great !
Unfortunately , sometimes when you put two good things together , it becomes a bad thing , like chocolate and steak .
In this case , when a label exercises its option in a contract , it means they ’re extending your signing period , whether you want in or not .
And you must deliver however many more albums they ’ve stipulated , under the exact same terms as your initial deal , or you get sued for breach of contract .
Since labels only exercise options when it ’s clear to them the band is a cash cow , in sports terms , this is like LeBron James winning MVP but being forced to accept rookie pay for another year .
I do n’t know why people spend $ 250 an hour for lawyers to read these contracts when the contract itself already beats you over the head with the theme .
EXPLOITATION , EXPLOIT , EXPLOIT , EXPLOITING , EXPLOITING … sounds like an ESL class on the Amistad .
You ’d think a document designed to make the musician sign their souls away as quickly as possible would employ more delicate , diplomatic language , but this one very directly orders you to bend over and smile about it .
I ca n’t fault honesty .
So if it ’s not clear , this section is enumerating all the rights to your music you will be losing , that is to say , all of them .
The contract does n’t sugarcoat it , and in fact repeats the same “ we own you ” statement four times in the first sentence .
Of particular importance to the label are the exclusive rights to the album ’s master copy , from which all reproductions of the music are made .
This way , when the label inevitably drops the group , or the band signs elsewhere , the first label still is the only one legally able to reproduce copies of the band ’s older material .
The “ or refrain from using in good commercial practice as it elects ” line is especially troubling if you ’re in Ulver or Celtic Frost and plan to mutate your sound drastically with every release .
If the label decides it ca n’t properly market your weird new album , it could just eat the recording costs ( or bill you ) and opt not to release it .
This happened infamously with stoner - doom legends Sleep , who , after the massive underground success of their demo- cum - album Holy Mountain , had inexplicably signed to London Records , then home to the likes of Salt N Peppa .
To celebrate their arrival in mainstream legitimacy , Sleep decided it was a grand idea to compose a one - song , 60 - minute ode to reefer lovingly entitled Dopesmoker .
When Sleep had finished their opus , they sent the recording to the label suits , who promptly laughed their asses off and asked where the real album was .
Sleep told them they were n’t joking , and that WAS the album .
London Records refused to put it out , and sent the band back into the studio again .
They returned with a svelte 52 - minute jam called Jerusalem .
The label balked and dropped the band rather than “ waste ” any more money on anti-commercial junk .
Both Dopesmoker and Jerusalem were released after Sleep broke up , and today are considered metal classics .
The albums are also a historical document of watermelon - sized testicles on the band ’s part .
Oh joy , recording costs .
Thankfully the mystic Pro-Tools Genie has wished away the massive budgets of yesteryears ( at the cost of “ that analog sound ” depending on who you ask ) , but still , if you ’re hoping to spend a couple weeks in a quality studio , you ’re looking at a $ 5000 bill , and that ’s not including the producer .
The price is not that bad honestly , but what makes it laughable is what lately constitutes the “ Advance due to The Artist . ”
For most labels , real advances are a thing of the past .
Unless you ’re on Century Media , Roadrunner , or equivalent , you can expect recording budgets of less than $ 3000 , and that ’s if you ’re lucky .
This particular contract offers an awe - inspiring ZERO DOLLARS for the advance : not uncommon .
One guess who then makes up the difference between the recording costs and the actual advance out of their own pockets .
You could opt to record in your own house , but that ’s a whole separate set of costs for computers , boards , mics and software , and frustrating amounts of “ learning the hard way . ”
At the very least the label asserts all costs for promotion .
That ’s their job after all .
But this does n’t preclude the band hiring its own publicist , which I recommend .
What the label will expect to be paid back for includes :
Studio time
Producer
Mixing
Mastering
Album artwork
Graphic design
Photography sessions
Music videos
So now your hypothetical $ 3000 budget begins to look a hell of a lot smaller .
Before we were just talking about the recording costs ( where you ’d already have to cut corners ) , but now you have to squeeze in the graphic designer and artist bill as well ?
No wonder most metal album artwork sucks so hard .
Of course you ’ll need promo shots for all that press the label is going to score for you , so now you have the choice of handing your brother an iPhone and looking grim in front of a brick wall , or you can hire a professional and pay a few hundred bucks .
As to that music video you ’ve always dreamed of , does Call of the Wintermoon ring any bells ?
As fucking awesome as that video is , you are not Immortal , and you are not frostbitten enough to pull it off without looking like a false .
So unless you just happen to be a recording engineer with a tricked out studio , and your girlfriend just happens to be a world - class photographer , and your aunt ’s mother - in - law ’s dog happens to be a genius film maker who can create something brilliant on an anemic budget ( it can be done ! ) , the costs are going to be coming from YOU .
And if you have all that along with a publicist and a tour manager , you do n’t really need a label anyway .
Oh yeah , and then any money the label does offer you upfront comes right out of your royalties , so do n’t expect to see any money for at least a year , if ever .
Single album deals are the best .
It means you put out one record , reap the benefits of the label ’s promotional machine , and then you ’re free to get the hell out or seek better terms if you ’ve sold well .
Unless you ’ve just inked a miraculous multi-million dollar deal , the shorter your terms , the better off you are .
Now just be careful you ’re not going to get pegged with one of those forced contract extensions ….
“ One independent consecutive irrevocable options to extend the Term each for a period of two year … ”
Oh .
Here the label is covering its ass in case some Armageddon happens and you / the label ca n’t deliver a finished product in a timely manner because you ’re busy being sodomized by the Antichrist .
You know they ’re serious about it because they ’re whipping out the French legal terms .
Be careful though , because even if you ’re on the run from zombies and / or labor unions , you better find a bomb shelter with a recording studio quickly because you only have a three - month grace period .
What the fuck did I just read ?
Indemnification means you ’re forfeiting your right to claim damages or expenses against the label .
Now I might just be in shock here , but I do believe I read that in case of a dispute The Artist is responsible for the label ’s legal fees .
This clause is a protection against you ever suing them .
And if you do sue them , it ’s in writing that they can freeze your royalty checks ( not that it ’s likely you ’ll be earning any regardless ) .
Remember when I said you did n’t need a lawyer ?
You need a lawyer .
This is all reasonable .
If I ran a label I ’d make sure my artists appeared for promotional sessions too .
Do n’t be an idiot and refuse to promote your material properly .
With that said , do n’t be an even BIGGER idiot and lose your receipts for your costs associated with said promo .
It says in black and white that you ’ll be reimbursed for your costs .
Now from a practical standpoint , there ’s no way of knowing just how quickly that is .
Are they going to hang on to your money until their next accounting period ?
Are they going to absorb the cash you spend into your debt to them ?
The contract does n’t make this clear .
Regardless of how and how soon they pay you , do n’t just send the receipts to the label : make copies of them .
Your invoices can very easily get “ lost in the mail . ”
I do n’t know about you , but at my day job , I get paid every two weeks .
The label however , will pay you twice a YEAR , if they pay you at all .
This is a big “ if . ”
I ’m acquainted with band that signed to a big name metal label , and over the course of their career there sold over 10000 albums .
They have yet to see a cent .
Now this is n’t the label ’s entire fault .
They ’re a business , and they need to make a profit .
Since the label is essentially a bank with the added services of distribution , management and promotion , it ’s only fair they recoup their investment .
In the money chain , they ’re in the middle of the line after the stores and distros , so it ’s understandable it takes them a bit longer to figure out their accounts , and it ’s possible they ’re getting screwed as well .
But that does n’t change the fact that you as the artist are last in line for handouts .
And you must remember that any money spent on you by the label can and will come out of your royalties .
Bankruptcy : one of the few ways a band will ever regain control of its master recordings .
Bands , just pray for another financial crisis , and you ’ll have the rights to your own music back in no time .
TELEGRAMS ?
Do these even still exist ?
I consider this detail indicative of the state of the music industry as a whole .
No wonder Internet file sharing scared all these record label geezers so badly .
They ’re still trying to figure out how to program their Betamax players .
The label can license out your material to anyone it wants , and you have zero say in the matter .
Do n’t like it ?
That ’s too bad because by signing this contract you ’re allowing the label to extend its terms to any person or organization .
So while you do n’t have access to your master copies , the label can give out your music to anyone BUT YOU , and you do n’t even get to authorize it .
I do n’t think I noticed a single comma in this whole contract .
So despite the tenuous grasp of punctuation and grammar , it still puts the onus on the band to understand the gobbledygook they ’re reading .
Hire a good lawyer who ’s fluent in run-on sentences .
As to legal issues , while we ’ve already established that suing the label is a near - impossibility because of the legal costs incurred , if you do dare to enter litigation , you must be careful when the company is from another state , or – God forbid – another country .
As a foreigner , you will lose .
Beyond the court aspect , just the travel costs are prohibitive to most people .
I.e. : you ’re screwed .
If you ’re not going to sell like crazy ( in metal terms ) , these numbers are almost unimportant , because you wo n’t be making any money anyway .
After glossing over the unsurprising $ 0 dollar advance for the first album , and yawning at the industry - standard 15 % of wholesale price per unit sold , notice the extremely surprising addendum of “ after copy sold numbering 500 . ”
What .
So the band is paying for the recording , mixing , mastering , artist , and graphic design 100 % out of pocket , NOTHING came from the label up until that point .
And then the label , who has n’t yet spent a dime , once the master copy is in their grubby little mitts , tacks on this clause stating that the band has to sell a completely arbitrary 500 copies before they earn back any of the money they ’ve spent .
This should be a crime .
I hate to say it , but most metal albums on small labels barely even sell 500 copies their first year .
And if by some marketing genius the record does move more than 500 units , the band is earning a paltry 15 % of wholesale , which usually comes out to about 85 cents per unit sold .
Calculator time .
Assuming the band as a whole spent a realistic $ 8000 on the complete production of the album , two weeks recording , name producer , mixing time , mastering , artwork and all , here is what they will earn from album sales with this contract :
100 copies sold : $0
500 copies sold : $0
501 copies sold : $ 0.85
1000 copies sold : $ 425
2000 copies sold : $ 1275
5000 copies sold : $ 3825
10000 copies sold : $ 8075
So .
Under this contract in our likely scenario , for a band to simply break even with album sales , they will have to sell TEN THOUSAND COPIES .
This is no easy task for a new group on a small label , much less a metal band catering to a niche and piracy - friendly audience .
Here are some sales numbers for huge groups and they are n’t a hell of lot more impressive .
Factor in that most of these bands are splitting profits between 4 - 5 members , and you ’re probably better off at your job at McDonald’s .
If the band sells quite a few copies , the label will want to extend their contract .
For the second album , the advance in this contract has jumped from nothing to a very generous …
$ 450 .
That barely pays for mastering costs .
What makes it worse is the band is this time FORCED to pay for the next recording themselves , and if they ca n’t afford to deliver a completed master within that two - year extension period , they ’re in breach of contract .
So the band must scrounge and save , and pray none of them lose their jobs , because they ’re certainly not going to be able to afford to pay for the second album from sales of the first .
And if they are able to put together the money , the band must of course pay back the pathetic advance with album sales at 15 % wholesale , meaning once again they need to sell a little over 500 copies before they see any of their own money coming back to them .
The 30 % of licensing and digital downloads is a great cut .
Unfortunately , 30 % of nothing is nothing .
Most metal bands do n’t get to license their music out at all .
After 20 years of making awesome music , Slough Feg finally made their first video game soundtrack with Brutal Legend .
Those opportunities are rare .
As to digital downloads , metal fans are very adept at piracy .
With a physical album release , at least there ’s tangible media and artwork to attract the buyer and collector , but when the exact same product ( MP3s ) is offered for $ 10 , and just as easily available for free , I ca n’t fault anyone for running a Google blog search .
DO NOT GIVE UP THE RIGHTS TO YOUR MERCHANDISE .
Ever .
Merch ( and touring for larger bands ) is the only real cash cow in the music business anymore .
Shirts can cost as little as $ 3 - $ 4 a unit to print , and they get sold at around $ 15 .
That ’s a 500 % profit .
It ’s sad state of affairs , but financially speaking albums are promotional tools to sell t- shirts .
As I understand this particular clause , the band would still be permitted to print up their own shirts , simply that they wo n’t be able to license printings to any 3rd party .
And then the label offers 15 % of profits from their own printings .
To me that is fair .
But if I ’m reading this incorrectly and the band is not allowed to print its merchandise independently , that is a deal - breaker .
If you ever see a contract with terms that limit the artist printing his own shirts , or somehow the label takes a cut from self - printings , or merch sales while on tour , run away immediately .
DO NOT GIVE UP THE RIGHTS TO YOUR MERCHANDISE .
DO NOT GIVE UP THE RIGHTS TO YOUR MERCHANDISE .
DO NOT GIVE UP THE RIGHTS TO YOUR MERCHANDISE .
That incredible $ 450 advance for the second album now comes in 2 installments of 50 % .
Lovely .
For the record , we recorded our newest album Metazoa at Sharkbite Studios in Oakland , and that cost us $ 375 a day .
So the first installment of this contract ’s entire advance would n’t even cover a single recording day .
As mentioned in the first section , the label will designate a “ leader ” for the group , who signs for everyone else .
In this final section , the rest of the band members sign to accept that all payments will first go through the group ’s leader , and that the label is blameless in matters relating to any friction this may cause .
This contractual separation of band members strikes me as unnecessarily politicizing .
~~~
In the end , this contract symbolizes a demeaning and outdated system .
I do n’t understand why bands agree to this business model when the Internet makes it so easy for groups to promote and distribute themselves .
Labels still have a role to play , particularly in terms of touring and promotion , but this is n’t it .
With hard work , a band can earn a lot more money , and maintain their sense of freedom and self - respect simply by self - releasing their albums .
The numbers wo n’t be nearly as big , but the feeling of accomplishment , and , to be frank , the profits you can earn make it all worth it .
There ’s still a stigma attached to being unsigned , but with huge groups like Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails foregoing labels and earning a fortune doing it , attitudes are changing .
Comparatively smaller metal bands like Giant Squid , Neurosis , and Wormed have put out their own material to great success .
I truly feel this is the wave of the future : an artist - run industry .
I see metal labels functioning more as collectives and business partners , a collaborative relationship rather than one based on oppressive and one - sided communication .
A man can dream .

You do n’t need a record deal to visit Cormorant on MySpace or to stream their new album , Metazoa .
Digitization of books has become synonymous over the past year with the Google Book Search project and the class action lawsuit launched in response to the search giant 's efforts to create an Internet - based library consisting of millions of books .
While the digitizing continues , the legal drama reaches an important stage tomorrow morning when a court in New York will close third - party submissions supporting or criticizing the settlement .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
The attention on Google Book Search is understandable , yet it has distracted from the broader question of government supported digitization efforts .
Many countries have not been content to leave the digitization of their culture and heritage to Google , instead embarking on plans to create their own digital libraries .
Canada was once thought to be part of this group -- national digitization working groups were established and a strategy seemed imminent -- yet plans have languished to the point that it feels as if someone has hit the delete key on the prospect of a comprehensive Canadian digital library .
Canada 's failure to keep pace was made readily apparent by the release late last month of a European consultation document on its digitization efforts .
In September 2005 , the European Union launched i2010 , a digitization action plan .
Several years later , Europeana debuted , a website that provides direct access to more than 4.6 million digitized books , newspapers , film clips , maps , photographs , and documents from across Europe .
The site plans to host ten million objects by the end of next year .
Conserving public domain books
The majority of the materials included to date are in the public domain -- i.e. they are no longer covered by copyright and can be used and accessed by all .
In fact , the European Commission has emphasized " works in the public domain should stay there once digitized and be made accessible through the Internet . "
It acknowledges , however , that this is not always the case since some groups claim rights to digitized copies of public domain works or charge for downloads .
The European consultation document grapples with difficult issues such as guaranteeing access to public domain works and identifying ways to improve access to works that are still subject to copyright protection but are out - of - print , or for which the copyright owner cannot be located .
By comparison , Canada seems stuck at the digitization starting gate .
Library and Archives Canada was given responsibility for the issue but was unable to muster the necessary support for a comprehensive plan .
The Department of Canadian Heritage , which would seem like a natural fit for a strategy designed to foster access to Canadian works , has funded a handful of small digitization efforts but has shown little interest in crafting a vision similar to Europeana .
Barriers to creating a digital national library
Digitization law and policies have also gone missing - in - action .
The national copyright consultation wraps up next week , but the digitization issue has scarcely been raised .
The European Commissioner for Information Society and Media Vivian Reding has called for the creation of " a modern set of European rules that encourage the digitization of books . "
Yet in Canada , few have placed the spotlight on the legal barriers to creating a national digital library .
These include the danger associated with extending the term of copyright or providing overbroad legal protection for digital locks that could render Canadian culture inaccessible .
Supporters once talked about the dream of a national digital library comprised of every Canadian book ever published .
Years later , they are still dreaming .
Remember yesterday when all the wingnuts were screaming that the White House was shutting out Fox news :
Allahpundit ( who has now gone full metal wingnut ) was apoplectic :
Decide for yourself what the most disgraceful aspect of this is .
Was it the fact that Gibbs told Jake Tapper explicitly on Monday that the White House would n’t try to dictate to the press pool who should and should n’t be included — before doing precisely that ?
Was it Anita Dunn going out of her way to say she respects Major Garrett as a fair reporter — before the administration decided he did n’t deserve a crack here at Feinberg ?
Or was it the repeated insistence by Dunn and Axelrod that of course the administration will make its officials available to Fox — before pulling the plug today ?
The Weekly Standard was aghast :
The White House sent out an alert today to the press pool that “ Pay Czar ” Kenneth Feinberg would be doing a press availability — a round robin with the major news networks , in which Fox is customarily included .
The administration specified that everyone was invited except Fox News , according to Bret Baier on “ Special Report ” tonight .
You know where this is going , do n’t you ?
IT NEVER HAPPENED .
Fox made the entire thing up .
Take it away , TPM :
TPMDC dug into it , and here ’s what happened .
Feinberg did a pen and pad with reporters to brief them on cutting executive compensation .
TV correspondents , as they do with everything , asked to get the comments on camera .
Treasury officials agreed and made a list of the networks who asked ( Fox was not among them ) .
But logistically , all of the cameras could not get set up in time or with ease for the Feinberg interview , so they opted for a round robin where the networks use one pool camera .
Treasury called the White House pool crew and gave them the list of the networks who ’d asked for the interview .
The network pool crew noticed Fox was n’t on the list , was told that they had n’t asked and the crew said they needed to be included .
Treasury called the White House and asked top Obama adviser Anita Dunn .
Dunn said yes and Fox ’s Major Garrett was among the correspondents to interview Feinberg last night .
Simple as that , we ’re told , and the networks do n’t want to be seen as heroes for Fox .
TPMDC spoke with a network bureau chief this afternoon familiar with the situation who was surprised that Fox was portraying the news as networks coming to its rescue .
The question - when will these guys get tired of being made fools of by their media sources and their leaders ?
Oh , look .
Ed Morrisey .
Wrong about everything .
Remember when he even tried ?
And more here .
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency has agreed to issue new air - pollution rules for coal - and oil - fired power plants by November 2011 , according to court documents .
While the new regulations will likely reduce emissions of cancer - causing pollutants by millions of tons annually , they could mean costly technology upgrades for the industry .
A consent decree released late Thursday follows a lawsuit filed by medical associations and environmental organizations against the EPA in December , alleging the agency was n't drafting new power - plant emission rules fast enough as required by the Clean Air Act .
At issue were final " maximum achievable control technology " emission standards for hazardous air pollutants such as mercury , arsenic , cadmium , other heavy metals , acid gases and dioxins .
The agreement marks a major victory for the medical and environmental groups after years of legal battles against the industry and the Bush administration EPA .
" This is big , " said Ann Weeks , legal director at the Clean Air Task Force , who has been fighting for new standards for nearly a decade .
" We are very pleased with the outcome of this case , and look forward to working with the EPA to develop emissions standards for this industry that mandate the deep cuts in this pollution that the law requires . "

Not the beer , but a completely different kind of High Life : Saturday I ventured north with my lovely ladyfriend Tammi Jo to watch a few of Harry Miller 's magnificent ancient race cars speed around the Milwaukee Mile oval at the Wisconsin state fairgrounds .
Some artists work with brush , oils and canvas ; some work with chisel and marble ; Wisconsin native Harry Miller worked with metal , drill presses and lathes , and his masterpieces haul ass .
I absolutely loved this car , sort of a 3 - generation home built garage project that started in the late 1920's by the current owner 's grandfather .
Very Miller influenced , with clever use of low budget parts .
Front wheel drive uses a narrowed Model T differential .
Engine is nicely turned - out Tillotsen carbed Crosley .
Miller 's rolling jewels dominated Indianapolis but were very expensive , and the Great Depression put them beyond the reach of all but a few very well - financed race teams ( Miller in fact went bankrupt in 1933 ) .
For a time Indy struggled to find 33 cars to fill the grid .
As a response the " Junk Formula " was introduced , allowing larger engine displacement , up to 366 cubic inches , and outlawing superchargers .
The new rules meant you could make a fairly - competitive race car starting with a stock production engine block and narrowed chassis .
As a hot rodder I love the old Junk Formula cars , which were hot rods by different means .
Here 's a straight 8 Studebaker Junk formula .
A Chrysler from the same era .
During the Junk Formula era , Preston Tucker ( of Tucker car fame ) convinced Henry and Edsel Ford to make an Indy race program for Ford 's new Flathead V - 8 , and enlisted Harry Miller to prep a 10 - car team .
Results were disappointing and it would be 20 + years before Ford would get involved in factory sponsorship .
But the cars from the program were stunning -- like this V8 flatty - powered Ford racer .
Grille shell is just a cut - down 1935 Ford stocker .
A little Bugatti racer ( Type 35 ? ) that calls Cedar Rapids home .
Some people consider Harry Miller the American Ettore Bugatti ; I like to think of Ettore Bugatti as the Italian Harry Miller .
After Miller 's backruptcy , his shop foreman Fred Offenhauser bought the patterns and molds and created his own engine based on the basic Miller design .
Offy was the dominant Indy engine for years after , winning 24 time in 27 years .
Not only were they fast , but those Offy front - engine roadsters were beautiful .
The big cube , big horsepower , badass Novi V8 was a worthy competitor to the Offy -- but was also built by Offy .
It was designed by Bud Winfield and another former Miller employee , Leo Goosen .
Strolling through the artwork I ran into my Northwoods pal Bob Klessig who has appeared in my previous adventures at Bonneville and the sub -zero chill of the Merrill Ice Drags .
He 's hanging out with Mark Morton , editor - publisher for the coolest car mag there is , HOP UP .
Go forth linkward and buy thee a few , for lo , en hopup veritas .
Of all the old iron I saw , this one probably held my attention the longest : an old racer dubbed the Indian Gas Special .
Sponsor address was painted on as 1832 Milwaukee Ave. , which could be either be in Milwaukee or downtown Chicago .
Car appeared to be based off a Model T ( narrowed T or A frame ) , with a cast iron T block , but with some insanely cool modifications -- overhead cam conversion ( Rajo maybe ? ) , chain driven pancake supercharger , with a cool little pop - off pressure relief valve .
Schweeeeet .
Afterwards Tammi Jo and I stopped along the Tri State on the way back to Chicago and picked up enough contraband Wisconsin provisions to last us till our next trip north of the Cheddar Curtain -- Jager , Point , absinthe , 1960 Formula Schlitz , Mickeys Big Mouth Malt Liquor , cheese curds and kringle .
Strangely enough , no Miller .
See you next time , Wisconsin !
More Pix Here
UPDATE !
More iron for your ogling pleasure .
After getting south of 87° 30 ' and back to civilization , Tammi and Jo and I headed over to Highwood IL for the once - in - a - while Buffos cruise nite .
Some neat stuff there too , including this crayon box of hot rods ...
The dark blue roofline peeking up behind is the Coupe of Justice .
Here 's neat ride you do n't see parallel parked every day : the 1964 Pontiac Banshee GM prototype concept car .
Neat little item , but if you want to own one best get the extended payment plan .
Here 's one I flipped for .
Did n't talk to the owner , but I 'm guessing it was some sort of jaunty fraternity jalopy from the early 60s or late 50s .
The " ISNU " redbirds would be Illinois State Normal University , now simply Illinois State U .
The interior is done in contrasting red / black pleats , ISU 's school colors .
My personal favorite was this channeled candy brandy Deuce roadster .
Made even cooler by the fact that the current owner has had it over 50 years , going back to high school .
The remainder of the evening was spent at the home of our pal Cratedigger and his lovely bride - to - be , where we joined them for fireside cocktails and idle gossip .
Arising at the crack of 11 , I fired up the Coupe again and headed to Highland Park IL for " Auto Historica IX " charity car show which had another helping of killer vehicles , like this Chrysler Ghia concept .
The mind - blowing deco lines of Stout Scarab .
I think Lileks would dig this .
Another Scarab , the 1960s racing car .
No relation .
Man , a lot of cool car stuff has been named after dung beetles .
Hood vents on a 1930 's Graham .
Pardon me , have you any Grey Poupon ?
1924 Rolls Royce Silver Cloud .
That 's it for now , I 'm late for my gasoline detox treatment .
Happy motoring !
Globalive does not meet Canadian ownership and control requirements and cannot therefore set up shop as Canada 's fourth national cellphone company , the CRTC says .
The regulator on Thursday found that the Toronto - based company , which is backed by Egypt 's Orascom and had plans to launch service in Toronto and Calgary this year under the Wind brand , does not meet ownership and control rules .
" The commission found it particularly important that Orascom owns 65.1 per cent of the equity , has entered into a strategic technical arrangement with Globalive , controls and holds the ' Wind ' brand under which Globalive will operate , and holds the overwhelming majority of the outstanding debt , " the regulator said .
" The commission therefore determines that Globalive has not met the requirements of the ownership and control regime and is therefore not currently eligible to operate as a Canadian telecommunications common carrier . "
The CRTC prescribed a list of changes the company could theoretically make in order to bring itself into compliance , which would include amendments to the composition of its board of directors , liquidity rights and the threshold for veto rights .
However , the fact that Orascom controls almost all of the company 's debt is a factor that can not be easily resolved .
" When these levers are considered in concert with Orascom 's provision of the vast majority of Globalive 's debt financing , the commission finds that it cannot conclude that Globalive is not controlled in fact by a non-Canadian , to wit Orascom , " the CRTC said .
" In other words , the commission finds that Orascom has the ongoing ability to determine Globalive 's strategic decision - making activities . "
Globalive chief executive Anthony Lacavera said the CRTC has made a " bad decision " and that Canadians need to speak up on what they want to see in the wireless marketplace .
" What this means for Canadians is less choice in wireless , higher prices , less features and services , " Lacavera told CBC News .
" We were ready to launch with a new competitive offering that 's going to cause all the incumbent players to bring better offerings themselves to Canadians . "
' We are a Canadian company '
Lacavera rejected the findings of the CRTC , saying Globalive complies with Canadian ownership rules .
" The CRTC has , in our estimation , made errors in their assessment of our control and ownership .
We are a Canadian company , we have always been a Canadian company .
We 're ready to begin a new wireless offering to Canadians and Canadians have spoken loud and clear that they want this choice in wireless . "
He said they are still assessing their options .
The CRTC decision stymies the company 's plans to launch service across the country , except in Quebec , by next year after spending $ 442 million in an auction of government airwaves last year .
Globalive passed an ownership test by Industry Canada at the conclusion of the auction .
The government had reserved airwaves for potential new wireless carriers during the auction in an effort to boost competition in the Canadian marketplace .
Telecommunications analyst Carmi Levy said he was shocked by the decision , given the federal government ’s apparent openness to foreign investment .
Several other companies are also hoping to enter the sector and Levy said they should be double - checking their ownership structures .
" It means that the CRTC is looking very closely into precisely who ’s pulling the strings , " he said , " who ’s making the decisions , and if they do n’t meet those very stringent Canadian ownership criteria , they , too , will be denied entry . "
Levy predicted Globalive wo n’t give up because it has invested too much already .
" They will look at re-jigging their organizational structure , possibly seeking additional Canadian - based investment and re-approaching the CRTC at some future point in time , " he said .
GENEVA , Switzerland ( CNN ) -- U.S. President Barack Obama called on Iran to provide the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency with " unfettered " access to the newly disclosed Qom uranium enrichment site , and Tehran 's nuclear negotiator said the country would cooperate with inspectors .
President Obama said Iran must provide inspectors with " unfettered " access to the new site within two weeks .
Iran says it plans to cooperate " fully " and " immediately " with the U.N. nuclear agency and will invite representatives of the body to visit its newly revealed uranium enrichment facility " soon , " said Javier Solana , the European Union foreign policy chief .
The IAEA has confirmed a trip to Iran by Director General Mohamed ElBaradei would take place soon , but no specific date has been announced .
A senior U.S. official speaking on background told reporters that ElBaradei 's trip to Tehran could come as early as this weekend .
In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Thursday , Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , Saeed Jalili , said " transparency is not something new " for the Islamic republic 's nuclear program .
" Iran has committed itself to follow all the obligations and the like , " Jalili said , speaking through a translator provided by the Iranian delegation in Geneva .
" What I want to emphasize is that our cooperation with the agency and the way we look specifically regarding to nuclear energy is that we believe that nuclear warheads are illegitimate and no country should have these kind of weapons . "
He said nuclear energy for peaceful purposes " is the right of every sovereign state and country . "
Watch more from the Jalili interview »
There were a number of developments at a meeting Thursday in Geneva between Iran and world powers over Iran 's nuclear program ; Solana said the meeting " represented the start of what we hope will be an intensive process . "
" I and all the representatives of the six countries were united in underlining the importance of fully transparency and of rebuilding confidence through practical steps .
In the course of the day , we had both plenary meetings and bilateral discussions allowing for detailed exchanges on all issues , " Solana said .
The meeting occurred on the heels of the recent revelation that Iran was building a second uranium enrichment facility near the city of Qom , a dramatic development that jacked up tension between Iran and international powers .
International powers have threatened more sanctions if the Islamic republic does n't change its ways .
At a news conference Thursday after the talks , Solana said International Atomic Energy Agency experts are expected to visit the facility near Qom " within the next couple of weeks . "
IAEA spokesman Gill Tudor said Director General Mohamed ElBaradei " has been invited to Tehran by Iranian authorities .
He will travel there soon to discuss a number of matters . "
Solana confirmed that world powers and Iran will hold another round of talks before the end of the month , but it is not known where or exactly when .
" An agenda for that meeting will be worked out through diplomatic channels .
It will focus on nuclear issues , including proposals previously put forward by both sides .
It will also deal with global issues that any of the parties wish to address , " Solana said .
Solana also said the world powers and Iran agreed in principle " that low - enriched uranium produced in Iran would be transported to third countries for further enrichment and fabrication into fuel assemblies for the Tehran research reactor , which produces isotopes for medical applications . "
Details will be worked out at the next meeting , Solana said .
The senior U.S. official told reporters that the enrichment would happen in Russia .
" The potential advantage of this , if it 's implemented , is that it would significantly reduce Iran 's [ low - enriched uranium ] stockpile which itself is a source of anxiety in the Middle East and elsewhere , " the senior U.S. official told reporters in a briefing Thursday .
Jalili , Iran 's chief nuclear negotiator , noted at a news conference Thursday that the parties hope to reach a framework for future talks .
The Geneva talks also featured a proposal for Iran to send its enriched uranium to a third country for final processing to ensure that it would be used for medical purposes , rather than a nuclear weapons program .
Of the third - party enrichment proposal , Obama said it might be " a step towards building confidence that Iran 's [ nuclear ] program is , in fact , peaceful . "
The president said Thursday in Washington that he expected to see " swift action " by Iran on the steps outlined in the Geneva talks .
Watch Obama demand transparency »
" This is a constructive beginning , but hard work lies ahead , " Obama said , noting that an " intensive period " of negotiations with Iran will be occurring .
" Talk is no substitute for action , " Obama said in urging Iran to take the necessary steps to meet its obligations under international non-proliferation agreements .
" This is about the global non-proliferation regime and Iran 's right to peaceful nuclear energy , " Obama said .
Iran participated in the talks along with the EU , Germany and the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council : the United States , Britain , France , Russia and China .
Top officials from the United States and Iran huddled on the margins of the Geneva talks on Iran 's nuclear program .
Jalili met with William J. Burns , the U.S. undersecretary of state for political affairs who was leading the U.S. delegation , a senior U.S. official and a diplomatic source confirmed .
The men discussed the nuclear program , a sit - down described as the first face - to - face meeting over the Iran 's nuclear program .
The diplomatic source , who characterized the meeting as " serious and frank , " said world powers are pushing for a date for International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors to examine the nuclear facility in Qom .

They also discussed human rights issues , including detained Americans in Iran .
Among those held in Iranian custody are three hikers who strayed from Iraqi territory into Iran .
The sources would talk only on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing discussions with Iran .
" They certainly are historical talks , " said David Albright , president of the Institute for Science and International Security and a former weapons inspector .
" For the United States and Iran to sit down finally and start to talk about the significant differences between the two countries is extremely important , and I think it 's long overdue . "

The existence of the second uranium enrichment facility prompted Obama and the leaders of Britain and France to publicly chide the Islamic republic last week at the G - 20 summit in Pittsburgh and threaten further sanctions .
Iran claims that its nuclear program is intended for peaceful purposes , but many in the international community have accused the country of trying to develop a nuclear weapons capability .

St. Vito Priest Again Charged With Sexual Abuse
A Mamaroneck Village priest arrested in December of 2008 was indicted on Thursday , April 30 and charged with three counts of sex abuse in the first degree and one count of attempted sex abuse in the first degree .
Father Richard Ordoñez , 37 , a visiting priest with St. Vito ’s Church in Mamaroneck is charged with sexual assault of a parishioner .
The priest is from Ecuador and had been living in the rectory at 816 Underhill Road , which is where the assaults are alleged to have occurred ( See : Mamaroneck Priest Charged With Sexually Abusing A Woman )
The woman had gone to marriage counseling with Father Ordoñez in January , 2004 .
According to a release from the Westchester District Attorney ’s office , on January 23 , Father Ordoñez grabbed the victim and attempted to sexually assault her .
She broke free , but he again grabbed and forcibly groped her .
Ultimately she broke away , fled and avoided further contact with the priest .
In September 2008 , after a conversation with a friend , the woman reported the assaults to the Mamaroneck Village Police .
At that point , Father Ordonez was out of the country , but when the victim learned he was returning , she went to the police .
On December 6 , 2008 , Mamaroneck Village police questioned Father Ordoñez , who was back serving as a priest and living in the rectory .
Two days later , on December 8 , police arrested the priest at JFK airport as he was about to board a plane with a one - way ticket to Ecuador .
He was later charged with one count of sexual abuse in the first degree .
Father Ordoñez spent a number of weeks in the Westchester County jail before he was able to raise the $ 50,000 bail set by Mamaroneck Village Judge Dan Gallagher .
It ’s unclear why Father Ordoñez is being indicted again on charges similar to those from December .
The Gazette received the release too late to ask follow - up questions .
Following the original arrest , the New York Archdiocese revoked the priest ’s authority to serve in the parish .
A case manager with a Westchester social service agency told the Gazette in December that she knew of four other women referred for marriage counseling with the priest from 2003 to 2004 who later said they had been abused by the priest .
One woman said he had forced her to have sex with him .
However , the case manager did not contact police .
The current indictment involves only one woman , the original victim identified in December .
It appears that no other victims have come forward .
Father Ordoñez ’ arrest in December was a shock to the St. Vito community , particularly to the Hispanic parishioners who attended the services he conducted in Spanish .

Joseph Stalin did n't trust Russia 's ethnic German population
A Russian academic investigating the fate of ethnic Germans deported by Stalin during World War II has had his research seized by security services .
History professor Mikhail Suprun was briefly arrested in the far north of Russia last month , but the incident has only now come to light .
Prof Suprun told the BBC he has been ordered not to comment on the case .
Thousands of ethnic Germans were sent to remote areas far from the war front after Hitler attacked the USSR in 1941 .
Although they had lived in southern Russia for generations - mostly along the River Volga - Soviet leader Joseph Stalin did not trust them .
Prof Suprun had managed to track down the files of 5,000 deportees and had interviewed hundreds of their descendents .
But now the documents he had collected over 10 years , his computer and all his hard drives have been seized by the FSB - the powerful successor to the KGB .
Although he has been ordered not to comment on the case , a few days ago he described the seizure as absurd .
He said it was part of a Russian government attempt to control how the history of World War II is told .

The ancient statues have giant red hats
Archaeologists believe they have solved one ancient mystery surrounding the famous Easter Island statues .
At 2,500 miles off the coast of Chile , the island is one of the world 's most remote places inhabited by people .
Up to 1,000 years ago , the islanders started putting giant red hats on the statues .
The research team , from the University of Manchester and University College London , think the hats were rolled down from an ancient volcano .
Dr Colin Richards and Dr Sue Hamilton are the first British archaeologists to work on the island since 1914 .
They pieced together a series of clues to discover how the statues got their red hats .
An adze , a road , and an ancient volcano led to their findings .
Dr Richards said : " We know the hats were rolled along the road made from a cement of compressed red scoria dust . "
Each hat , weighing several tonnes , was carved from volcanic rock .
They were placed on the heads of the famous statues all around the coast of the island .
However , precisely how and why the hats were attached is unknown .
Like an altar
An adze was found in pristine condition next to the hats .
The scientists think it might be an ancient offering .
A ceremonial adze was found next to the hats Dr Richards told BBC News : " These hats run all the way down the side of the volcano into the valley .
" We can see they were carefully placed .
The closer you get to the volcano , the greater the number .
" It 's like a church ; you can't just walk straight to the altar .
" The Polynesians saw the landscape as a living thing , and after they carved the rock the spirits entered the statues . "
Dr Richards and Dr Hamilton are joint directors of the " Rapa Nui ( Easter Island ) Landscapes of Construction Project " .
They will be working on the island over the next five years .
Dr Richards added : " We will look to date the earliest statues .
Potentially this could rewrite Polynesian history . "

A " carbon " tax on transport , homes and factories , intended to make France a " green " model for other large economies , was unveiled yesterday by President Nicolas Sarkozy .
But the convoluted proposals , including mechanisms to refund most of the new energy levies through tax breaks and " green cheques " , were condemned by critics as half - hearted and a bureaucratic nightmare .
President Sarkozy insisted , however , that the carbon tax or " climate contribution " would put France on track to fulfill its promise to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a quarter of their present levels in the next 40 years .
In theory , the taxes will grow steeper in the years ahead but the proposals are already contested by two - thirds of French voters and by many politicians on the left and within the President 's own centre - right party .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Sarkozy wants , in the first stage , to impose a tax of € 17 ( £ 15 ) per tonne of carbon dioxide on all forms of energy , except electricity .
This will increase heating fuel and petrol pump prices by around four centimes a litre and also place a modest charge on gas bills .
Electricity has been exempted because 80 per cent of French supplies are nuclear - generated and carbon - free .
After a tumultuous row within his own party , and public differences with his Prime Minister , François Fillon , Mr Sarkozy promised that tax - payers and businesses would be fully compensated for the new levies through cuts in their income and pay - roll taxes .
Poor people who paid no income tax would receive a " green " cheque .
People living in rural areas , who need to use their cars , would qualify for higher tax breaks than city - dwellers .
In a speech at a heat - pump factory near Lyons , televised to the nation , the President said : " Every centime taken from families will be returned to families ...
The aim of this ecological fiscal policy is not to fill the state 's coffers but to encourage the French people and companies to change their behaviour .
" The gravest challenge that we face is climate change , " he went on .
" Every one of our compatriots must feel concerned . "
In other words , while families and businesses that change their energy consumption patterns for the better would pay less tax , those which fail to do so would face no fiscal penalty .
Green politicians and climate campaigners said yesterday that the tax was a step in the right direction but half - hearted and set too low to make a real impact on the use of energy .
They had been campaigning for a tax of at least € 30 for every tonne of carbon dioxide .
In theory , almost the whole of the French political establishment is committed to the principle of a " carbon tax " .
France 's favourite TV ecologist , Nicolas Hulot , extracted a promise from all leading candidates during the 2007 presidential election that they would introduce the idea , if elected .
Carbon taxes were also approved by an environmental conference , uniting politicians of all parties , pressure groups , unions and industry , in October 2007 , a few months after President Sarkozy was elected .

Although Sweden already has a similar tax , France would be the first large industrial economy to introduce a systematic , environmental levy of this kind .
In recent weeks , however , the consensus supporting a carbon tax has evaporated .
The former Socialist presidential candidate Ségolène Royal abandoned her campaign promise and said the tax would be unfair to poorer people .
Politicians within Mr Sarkozy 's party , the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire ( UMP ) , complained that the tax would place a disastrous brake on France 's recovery from recession .
President Sarkozy , who had himself seemed to waver from introducing the policy just a few days ago , attempted to respond to all these criticisms yesterday .
It remains uncertain , however , whether he can force the proposals through the two houses of the French parliament in time to be included , on schedule , in next year 's state budget .
Green schemes or white elephants ?
How governments are tackling climate change
UK Ed Miliband 's Low Carbon Transition Plan calls for 40 per cent of energy needs to be met by " clean " renewable technology by 2020 .
A 2050 goal had been set at 80 per cent , but the Government admitted this week that the aviation industry 's continued growth could mean other sectors could need to meet a 90 per cent target .
AUSTRALIA Kevin Rudd 's government was forced last month to divide a climate change bill in two .
The original bill had included proposals for 20 per cent of electricity to come from renewable sources , which was supported by opposition parties , alongside the carbon emissions scheme – which conservatives bitterly opposed .
JAPAN
The incoming Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama this week repeated a promise he made during the recent election campaign to cut emissions by 25 per cent from 1990 levels .
But there was a crucial caveat : the deal is contingent on December 's Copenhagen meeting ending in an international deal .
USA Environmentalists were elated at the election of Barack Obama , and his appointment of the Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Chu as Energy Secretary ; since then , though , it has become clear that the economy and healthcare come first , and his climate - change plan still awaits the approval of a reluctant Senate .
GERMANY Angela Merkel has made Germany a leading nation in the fight against climate change , and a rare success story .
She brokered an important G8 deal in 2007 and aims to reduce emissions 36 per cent by 2020 .
She has also introduced ambitious goals on renewable power .
All major parties in Germany support that consensus .
Citibank ( NYSE : C ) and Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) ’s student loan businesses are under threat as Congress works on the most significant overhaul of the financial aid system since it was introduced in the 1960 ’s , leading many to believe that Citibank ’s and Wells Fargo ’s lucrative student loans businesses soon may out of business as the government works to federalize student loan offerings .
At the heart of the legislation , Congress is aiming to get subsidized private companies out of the student lending business and turn it over to the government .
Some predict that the proposal will eliminate up to $ 80 billion in costs by the end of the next decade by eliminating subsidies that are paid to lenders to keep their interest rates down .
The savings from the payment would be used to make colleges more affordable for low - income individuals by increasing the maximum Pell Grant by $ 1,400 up to a maximum of $ 6,900 .
In order to make up for the lack of affordable private student loans that are expected , the government is planning to offer additional low interest loans to students .
Although the legislation will result in an immediate increase in jobs , many are worried that the thousands of workers employed by banks offering subsidized student loans will be laid off .
One of the cities that would be hit by the legislation the hardest is Sioux Falls , SD , which has over 1,200 people that work in student lending services for Wells Faro and Citibank .
Because of South Dakota ’s lax lending regulations , many companies such as Premier Bankcard , Citibank and Wells Fargo have their headquarters for their credit card and student loan businesses in South Dakota .
“ This is a significant book of business that they are involved with and if it goes , the jobs go with it , ” said Sen .
John Thune , R - S.D.
If the legislation passes , it ’s estimated that up to 3,000 jobs could be lost across the state .
Both Wells Fargo and Citibank , two of the five largest student loan lenders nationwide , originate and service loans through the Federal Family Education Loan Program ( FFELP ) , the system that accounts for three - fourths of all student loans .
The student loan reform legislation passed the U.S. House in September with a vote of 253- 171 and will be going before the Senate early next year .
A California couple was so dependent on the housing market that , facing economic ruin after they lost virtually all of their property wealth when the economy tanked , they allegedly burned down their own home for insurance money .
Police in Tracy , California arrested 31 - year - old William “ Billy ” Tipton Jr. and issued an arrest warrant for his wife , 37 - year - old Frayba Tipton .
They are suspected of arson , forgery and insurance fraud .
Billy Tipton faces additional charges of grand theft and two more counts of defrauding an insurance company , according to a local news report .
The couple were real estate agents and mortgage brokers .
Billy Tipton used to own a branch of West Coast Realty and Mortgage in Tracy , although he apparently lacked a real estate or broker ’s license .
His wife owned A+ Realty and Mortgage .
" They let several properties lapse into foreclosure as their income as real estate agents and brokers suffered from a dearth of buyers .
Lawsuits demanding payment from Frayba and Billy Tipton show that the couple has had trouble keeping up with the bills for the past year or so , " the Tracy Press reports .
From the Tracy Press :
The Tiptons , who lost their upscale home to a suspected arson fire in July 2008 , told the Press the day after that they had taken their five children to Lake Tahoe for a Fourth of July vacation and that the loss of their home devastated them .
Not only did the fire destroy many of the family ’s possessions , it also nearly killed several firefighters when it weakened the beams supporting a heavy slate roof that collapsed just 30 seconds after a fire chief ordered his crew out of the burning house .
Investigators immediately suspected arson , said Germane Friends , the Tracy Fire Department Division Chief who pulled his crew out of the Fagin Drive fire with seconds to spare .
“ It was obvious at the time that it was an incendiary fire because it was started in so many different places , ” he said today .
“ I know they started investigating that immediately . ”
It 's a stark reminder of how desperate the declining real estate market has made some people .

More than 40 years after the cinematic success of The Yellow Submarine , the animated film that epitomised the height of psychedelic pop culture and featured a Beatles soundtrack – it is to be re-made in 3D by Disney .
The Hollywood director , Robert Zemeckis , who is best known for the spectacular special effects of his previous films which include Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit ? , has been brought on board .
The original story was written by Lee Minoff and based on the song by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , with some of the dialogue scripted by poet Roger McGough .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The film captures an underwater paradise that finds itself menaced by the music - hating “ Blue Meanies ” .
The Beatles ’ own contribution was limited .
The band only agreed to the film as a means of fulfilling their movie contract and their animated characters were voiced by other actors .
But on seeing the finished version , the group agreed to appear as themselves in the final scene .
The upgraded version is to use the state - of - the - art techniques that Zemeckis employed on his visually striking films , The Polar Express and Beowulf .
The studio has already pencilled in a tentative release date of summer 2012 .
But Variety magazine cautioned that lawyers were still in the middle of attempting to secure rights to the 16 original Beatles songs , including All You Need is Love and Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds .
There has been no confirmation yet on the involvement of Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr , the two surviving Beatles .
While some fans may see a re-make as sacrilege , Connor McNicholas , the former editor of NME , welcomed a 3D version that re-introduced the classic film to a new generation .
“ When I was a child , I was absolutely transfixed when I caught it on television .
It was tremendously surreal animation and it did n’t have a traditional narrative or characters , and it had a very big effect on me .
It ’s very easy to have a knee jerk reaction to a re-make as some may see the film as preserved in time , but nothing is wrong with completely re-imagining it in 3D .
It is a part of popular culture so it should be allowed to live on , ” he said .

If you ’ve been following the Tokyo Game Show this week and waiting for news , it ’s likely you ’ll have been disappointed .
The big announcements have been and gone .
As October looms the focus now is on delivering .
For their part though , Microsoft were likely waiting on one piece of news from TGS , the release date of the long awaited Gran Turismo 5 .
The reason ?
They ’ve been sitting on a Forza 3 demo for just the occasion .
A departing Shane Kim might have had an inkling it was n’t going to make 2009 .
Then again , he might equally have considered Forza 3 ’s release next month as a big announcement .
Read on for a arcade racer fan ’s impressions .
Arcade what you say ?
Let ’s get this out of the way up front .
Sim - racers are not a genre I can claim any expertise in .
As far as racing games are concerned , I graduated to the PGR series from Sega GT on the original Xbox and loved every minute of them .
To this man , other cars on the track are “ braking opportunities ” and corners should be taken sidewards to look good on replays .
You are n’t going to find a rigorous analysis of Forza 3 ’s impressive physics model or a detailed critique of the representation of the 2009 Ferrari California vs it ’s competitor ’s games here .
Does this make me a bad person to write about Forza 3 then ?
Not really .
Dedicated sim- racer communities are numerous and extremely vocal on the internet .
The debates across the forums are some of the most savage and detailed you will ever come across .
If Turn 10 have modeled an interior correctly or if the Ferrari does n’t feel right , opinions on it will be ten - a - penny .
I ’m here because of a different reason , notably Activision ’s purchase of PGR developer , Bizarre Creations .
In the eyes of many , Microsoft opting to not buy Bizarre was the death of PGR even if they still retain the IP with lip service to use it .
Delivering the first party racing experience for Xbox 360 for the time being solely lies on the shoulders of Turn 10 studios .
Their mandate for Forza 3 was pretty clear .
Broaden the appeal of the franchise without alienating the existing fans who appreciate its realism and attention to detail .
A tricky tightrope to walk if ever there was one .
Whether they will achieve this is hard to say from the demo but the encouraging signs are certainly there .
Comprising of only one track , five cars and two laps it initially seems like a frugal offering , especially when things like the community features and livery editor are so key to making Forza what it is but the first two laps were great fun and I did n’t hesitate to have another go , and then another .
Eventually I was fiddling around with the driving assists , the interface to which is deceptively simple but clearly hiding a lot of depth .
It should be easy enough for gamers of all abilities to tweak the game to their liking , which should mitigate any concerns that it ’s been dumbed down .
Tempting as it might be to use the “ rewind ” feature ( accessed via the back button ) , I did n’t bother .
The game is fun and rewarding enough to simply have another go , rather than cheat that perfect lap - time .
The other main takeaway from it was the visuals .
The jump from it ’s predecessor is dramatic and initial reports of a lack of anti-aliasing are wide of the mark .
It ’s there for sure but barely noticeable when you ’re zipping along at 60 FPS .
The track in the demo ( Comina Viejo ) was especially impressive .
The oft - demanded cockpit view is a little less so but at least it ’s present .
For many Forza 2 was a little bit of a disappointment despite being a solid game .
It did n’t look great , several features were cut and it offered nothing to the likes of me .
My experience with that demo was short lived .
Turn 10 ’s third offering has had the opposite effect and transformed a game I had less than a passing interest in to one which I ’m keen to play a little more of .
So far so good then but we ’ll have a few months yet before we can assess lofty claims of it being “ the definitive racing game of the generation ” .
At the very least though , it has a good chance of going some way to filling the hole left by that other Xbox racing franchise .
Forza 3 releases 27th October .
About a month ago , Forbes released their list of most disliked people in sports .
And you know what ?
They got it wrong .
Manny Ramirez ?
Really ?
I did n’t think anyone cared enough about Manny to hate him that much .
Allen Iverson ?
Where did that come from ?
And having John McEnroe on the list is a joke .
However relevant McEnroe even is today , he seems actually well liked .
This is n’t 1981 .
So here ’s a better look at Who ’s Who of the Sports Most Hated personalities today ( Sorry Barry Bonds .
You used to be hated .
Now you ’re just forgotten ) :
10 Jerry Jones Dallas Cowboys
Why you should hate him :
Like anyone needs a reason to hate the Cowboys , the so - called America ’s Team .
I did n’t vote for them .
But the Cowboys and Jones do help fill a void .
That of the hated owner .
With George Steinbrenner fading from the limelight ( and Al Davis simply too crazy ) , there needs to be representation on this Top Ten .
So in steps Jones and his massive ego .
At least when he ’s not getting all the plastic surgery money can buy .
And if hating on the Cowboys was n’t enough , you can also blame Jones as the central figure behind why no one could actually watch the NFL Network for several seasons .
Way to go Jerry !
But let ’s not forget that Jones has still got game .
That billion dollar stadium he just built managed to place an enormous scoreboard square in the middle of punted balls .
And the NFL wo n’t do anything about it , because they ’re bending over trying to appease Jones in anticipation of the upcoming labor talks .
Ca n’t upset Jerry and have him cry in a corner .
Though maybe the Cowboys need a lesson in stadium building .
Their pratice facility recently collapsed and the new stadium ca n’t contain punts .
At least haters can take heart in the fact that Jones is fast at work tearing down all the rebuilding Bill Parcells did a few years back .
9 Nick Saban Alabama Crimson Tide
Why you should hate him :
As TMQ ’s immutable law of weasel coaches holds :
When you hire a coach who ’s only in it for himself , you get a coach who ’s only in it for himself .
Ask the Miami Dolphins .
Saban left the Dolphins high and dry so that he could take more money at Alabama .
That and probably his massive ego could n’t take not beating up on NFL opponents like he can with an easy college schedule .
Let ’s not also forget he did all this once before after departing LSU prior to Miami .
Tigers fans hate him too , and he won a National Title there .
Basically , all of this just means people generally do n’t like Little Nicky .
I ’m sure he cries himself to sleep on his piles and piles of money .
Saban ’s so hated , even Hall of Fame coach Don Shula called him a “ liar ” and a “ quitter . ”
And you do n’t generate YouTube clips like this without doing something wrong :
8 Cristiano Ronaldo Real Madrid
Why you should hate him :
This is a rundown of the most hated sport personalities .
So despite what the United States might think , soccer is actually a sport .
Seriously .
And no matter what the sport , nobody likes a whiner .
Or a diver .
And Ronaldo has made an art of complaining as much as possible while grimacing whenever things do n’t quite goes his way .
You know , when he is n’t flopping on the ground in his sweet haircut .
He ’s got so many haters , you can join this Facebook page on it .
Plus , just like people whine about LeBron James and Sydney Crosby , nobody likes a guy who ’s good and highly paid .
But if you need more reasons why the defending FIFA World Player of the Year sucks ( besides the picture to the right ) , know that the beautiful Nereida Gallardo says Cristiano Ronaldo is bad in bed .
Take that Cristiano .
Oh , and this video provides more evidence :
7 Michael Vick Philadelphia Eagles
Why you should hate him : Yes , Michael Vick could be higher .
Particularly if you ’re a card - carrying member of PETA .
But there ’s the argument he ’s not even the most hated NFL quarterback .
For that , I could present Brett Favre .
It ’s a close call .
But Vick does have the flavor of the month hatred going for him , as people rage at him again for his treatment of animals .
So he ’s on the Top Ten and Favre ’s bumped .
Although I must admit that Vick seems to get far more hatred ( and jail time ) than Donté Stallworth does .
And Stallworth killed a dude this offseason .
Does that make sense ?
St. Louis Ram Leonard
Little once did the same thing , and it gets little attention these days .
These things are n’t always logical .
But it ’s weird to think Vick ’s best days were when he was the herpes spreading menace know as Ron Mexico .
Although he was n’t a very good quarterback back then either .
6 Isiah Thomas Florida International
Why you should hate him : Straight Bangin ’ has it right .
Isiah Thomas sucks at life .
Once a great basketball player , Thomas has proceed to burn through the Toronto Raptors , Indiana Pacers , and New York Knicks in a pathway of demolition and destruction .
At least when he was n’t ruining the fifty plus year tradition of the Continental Basketball Association ( CBA ) or becoming a terrible broadcaster .
Oh , and there was that sexual harassment case that he lost sometime in between .
He ’s like Matt Millen , just with more wreckage and a more disagreeable personality .
For instance , he wants to beat up Bill Simmons .
For some fun with Zeke , you can play the Six Degrees of Isiah Thomas or wonder when Florida International will go down in flames .
Thomas is excellent at burning bridges , and that kind of action will bring about a few angry mobs waiting to beat you down .
5 Scott Boras Agent
Why you should hate him :
No one likes this guy .
I ’m not even sure his own mother does .
He ’s baseball ’s version of Drew Rosenhaus , but worse than good ole Drew .
And he hails straight from the Gordon Gecko School of Greed .
He ’s the reason Barry Zito makes all that cash for doing nothing ( That and Brian Sabean is on crack ) .
Once thing ’s for sure , he ’s great at getting his clients top dollar .
But that also means he ’s great at being hated by just about everyone .
At least with most people on this list , one can find individuals who like them .
But have you ever come across a Scott Boras fan club ?
I found this blog that goes the opposite way .
4 Bill Belichick New England Patriots
Why you should hate him :
Here ’s a guy who managed to combine the hatred of Super Bowl success with two other great moments .
First , the man in the Hoodie drew a $ 500,000 fine for openly cheating .
And second , he showed poor sportsmanship by walking off the field with 2 seconds left in the Super Bowl .
So everyone thinks he a sore loser , lacks class , and is a cheater .
What a trifecta .
If only he was a star wide receiver , maybe we ’d get a great Joe Buck rant about him .
Plus , I believe he gets some residual hatred for much much his coaching disciples sucked in Cleveland and Notre Dame .
His fingers are in too many pies .
3 Kobe Bryant Los Angeles Lakers
Why you should hate him :
If only he did n’t rape so much .
Bryant is blamed for breaking up the early 2000s Lakers ( an amazing feat since he was n’t even on the team when it happen – he was a free agent ) , for being a ball hog , and for being an all - around asshole .
Let ’s not forget that he nearly cried his way off the Lakers a few years back when he decided they did n’t have enough talent for him .
This was despite the fact he voluntarily chose to resign with the team .
He ’s been described as friendless , someone who constantly turns on people in his life , and overall generally disliked .
Well except in China , where he was adored at the 2008 Beijing Olympics .
But then again , China ’s food and toys seem littered with poison , so I would n’t put too much stock in what they think .
They could be as mad as a hatter .
Here ’s a video dedicated to the Anti-Kobe movement .
2 Alex Rodriguez New York Yankees
Why you should hate him : Reasons A - Rod sucks .
Yankee ?
Check .
Steroids ?
Check .
Fake Personality ?
Check .
Madonna ?
Check .
People hate him for all the money he makes , because “ to whom much is given , much is expected . ”
And while Rodriguez has made a name for himself during the regular season , he has yet to really make a name for himself in the postseason .
His Yankee playoff trips have been mostly forgettable , and as a result New Yorkers dislike him .
Not that New Yorkers are to be trusted mind you , but it says something when the hometown fans boo you .
Everyone else hates him because of the Yankee thing and because they think he acts completely false when the cameras are on .
1 Terrell Owens Buffalo Bills
Why you should hate him :
With apologies to those that have not yet been mentioned ( I ’m mainly look at the broadcasters like Stephen A. Smith , Tim McCarver , Joe Morgan , Hawk Harrelson , and Chris Berman ) , T.O. is our number one .
Why ?
He managed to alienate drama queen lover Jerry Jones .
That says something .
He also managed to push his way off of a Super Bowl runner - up Eagles team .
Sounds like he ’s doing something wrong .
Besides dropping the ball too many times .
Owens is a good player , but he ’s not so awesomely good that he can get away with things like a Kobe Bryant can .
He ’s never been the MVP , never been a World Champ , and yet somehow is always the center of attention .
Just check out his reality show .
Update at bottom : Senior intel official concedes Congress was misled
From The Hill :
The CIA misled Congress at least five times since 2001 , according to Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee .
The Democrats said CIA officials had either lied or withheld information from Congress .
They also said CIA officials did not fully inform Congress about the use of enhanced interrogation techniques during a September 2002 briefing , which would validate House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s ( D - Calif . ) claim that she was lied to about the program .
The ongoing probe found the practice of incomplete briefings or outright lying was part of a “ large disease ” of misinforming even the chairmen of the select intelligence committees , Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - Ill . ) said at a Tuesday press briefing that highlighted the early findings .
Schakowsky and Rep. Anna Eshoo ( D - Calif. ) are leading two subcommittees investigating the legitimacy of intelligence briefings to Congress .

Read the rest at The Hill .
A Fox News blog notes that a “ senior intelligence official conceded Tuesday that the intelligence community has failed to fully inform Congress about some of its spying activities . ”
Robert Litt , chief counsel for the Director of National Intelligence , “ testified before the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday that the spies did n’t tell Congress about a small number of operations . ”
“ We have an obligation to get you the information that you need to provide oversight .
And the scope of what we provide you needs to be adequate to permit you to provide oversight of the intelligence community , ” Litt said .
Litt added , “ I think that when some of the agencies went back and looked at their records , they found a couple of matters where they had determined not to brief .
And they relooked at it and decided probably ought to be briefed .
But those were a few isolated instances . ”

Whether you 're deciphering a cryptic state seal or trying to impress your Catholic in - laws , knowing some Latin has its advantages .
But the operative word here is " some . " 
We 'll start you off with 10 phrases that have survived the hatchet men of time ( in all their pretentious glory ) .
1. Caveat Emptor
( KAV - ee - OT emp - TOR ) : " Let the buyer beware " 
Before money - back guarantees and 20 - year warranties , caveat emptor was indispensable advice for the consumer .
These days , it'd be more fitting to have it tattooed on the foreheads of used - car salesmen , infomercial actors , and prostitutes .
For extra credit points , remember that caveat often makes solo appearances at cocktail parties as a fancy term for a warning or caution .
Oh , and just so you know , caveat lector means " let the reader beware . " 
2. Persona Non Grata
( puhr - SOH - nah non GRAH - tah ) : " An unacceptable person " 
Remember your old college buddy , the one everybody called Chugger ?
Now picture him at a debutante ball , and you 'll start to get a sense of someone with persona non grata status .
The term is most commonly used in diplomatic circles to indicate that a person is unwelcome due to ideological differences or a breach of trust .
Sometimes , the tag refers to a pariah , a ne'er - do - well , a killjoy , or an interloper , but it 's always subjective .
Back in 2004 , Michael Moore was treated as a persona non grata at the Republican National Convention .
Bill O'Reilly would experience the same at Burning Man .
3. Habeas Corpus
( HAY - bee - as KOR - pus ) : " You have the body " 
When you wake up in the New Orleans Parish Prison after a foggy night at Mardi Gras , remember this one .
In a nutshell , habeas corpus is what separates us from savages .
It 's the legal principle that guarantees an inmate the right to appear before a judge in court , so it can be determined whether or not that person is being lawfully imprisoned .
It 's also one of the cornerstones of the American and British legal systems .
Without it , tyrannical and unjust imprisonments would be possible .
In situations where national security is at risk , however , habeas corpus can be suspended .
4. Cogito Ergo Sum
( CO - gee - toe ER - go SOME ) : " I think , therefore I am " 
When all those spirited mental wrestling matches you have about existentialism start growing old ( yeah , right ! ) , you can always put an end to the debate with cogito ergo sum .
RenÃ© Descartes , the 17th - century French philosopher , coined the phrase as a means of justifying reality .
According to him , nothing in life could be proven except one 's thoughts .
Well , so he thought , anyway .
5. E Pluribus Unum
( EE PLUR - uh - buhs OOH - nuhm ) : " Out of many , one " 
Less unique than it sounds , America 's original national motto , e pluribus unum , was plagiarized from an ancient recipe for salad dressing .
In the 18th century , haughty intellectuals were fond of this phrase .
It was the kind of thing gentlemen 's magazines would use to describe their year - end editions .
But the term made its first appearance in Virgil 's poem " Moretum "  to describe salad dressing .
The ingredients , he wrote , would surrender their individual aesthetic when mixed with others to form one unique , homogenous , harmonious , and tasty concoction .
As a slogan , it really nailed that whole cultural melting pot thing we were going for .
And while it continues to appear on U.S. coins , " In God We Trust "  came along later ( officially in 1956 ) to share the motto spotlight .
6. Quid Pro Quo
( kwid proh KWOH ) : " You scratch my back , I 'll scratch yours " 
Given that quid pro quo refers to a deal or trade , it 's no wonder the Brits nicknamed their almighty pound the " quid . " 
And if you give someone some quid , you 're going to expect some quo .
The phrase often lives in the courtroom , where guilt and innocence are the currency .
It 's the oil that lubricates our legal system .
Something of a quantified value is traded for something of equal value ; elements are parted and parceled off until quid pro quo is achieved .
7. Ad Hominem
( ad HAH - mi-nem ) : " To attack the man " 
In the world of public discourse , ad hominem is a means of attacking one 's rhetorical opponent by questioning his or her reputation or expertise rather than sticking to the issue at hand .
Translation : Politicians are really good at it .
People who resort to ad hominem techniques are usually derided as having a diluted argument or lack of discipline .
If pressed , they 'll brandish it like a saber and refuse to get back to the heart of the matter .
Who said the debate team does n't have sex appeal ?
8. Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam
( ad - MA - yor - em DAY - ee GLOR - ee-um ) : " All for the Greater Glory of God " 
Ad majorem dei gloriam is often shortened to AMDG .
In other words , it 's the WWJD of the Jesuits , who 've been drilling the mantra into their followers since ( Saint ) Ignatius of Loyola founded the Catholic Order in 1534 .
They believe all actions , big or small , should be done with AMDG in mind .
Remind your Jesuit - educated buddies of this when they seem to be straying from the path .
( Best used with a wink and a hint of irony . )
9. Memento Mori
( meh - MEN - toh MOR - ee ) : " Remember , you must die " 
Carpe diem is so 20th century .
If you 're going to suck the marrow out of life , trying doing it with the honest , irrefutable , and no less inspiring memento mori .
You can interpret the phrase in two ways : Eat , drink , and party down .
Or , less hedonistically , be good so you can get past the pearly gates .
Naturally , the latter was the one preferred by the early Christian Church , which would use macabre art — including dancing skeletons and snuffed - out candles — to remind the faithful to forgo temporal pleasures in favor of eternal bliss in heaven .
The phrase also served to prevent swelling heads .
Some historians say that victorious , parading Roman generals would have servants stand behind them and whisper " memento mori "  in their ears to keep their egos in check .
10 . Sui Generis
( SOO - ee JEN - er- is ) : " Of its own genus , "  or " Unique and unable to classify " 
Frank Zappa , the VW Beetle , cheese in a can : Sui generis refers to something that 's so new , so bizarre , or so rare that it defies categorization .
Granted , labeling something " sui generis "  is really just classifying the unclassifiable .
But let 's not over - think it .
Use it at a dinner party to describe Andy Kaufman , and you impress your friends .
Use it too often , and you just sound pretentious .
Update : CBS
News employee pleads not guilty to grand larceny
CBS News ’ Robert J. Halderman was arraigned in a Manhattan court on Friday and entered a plea of not guilty when read the charge of grand larceny .
The court has set his bail at $ 200,000 , according to the Associated Press .
Following yesterday ’s arrest , Letterman confessed to his viewers that he had affairs with female staff members and said his promiscuity had led to an attempt to blackmail him out of some $ 2 million .

– Original story follows –
WASHINGTON — US talk show host David Letterman admitted in his nightly program on Thursday to having sex with members of his staff , as he detailed an extortionist ’s efforts to relieve him of two million dollars .
“ I have had sex with women who work on this show , ” Letterman told a studio audience in New York which at times appeared unsure whether the confession was part of a skit .
The married 62 - year - old said three weeks ago a package appeared in the back seat of his car from a person who demanded two million dollars ( 1.37 million euros ) for keeping knowledge the flings secret .
Letterman went on to explain his decision to report the matter to the authorities , which led to testimony before a grand jury earlier that day .
“ I had to tell them all of the creepy things I had done , ” he said .

“ Would it be embarrassing if it were made public ?
Perhaps it would , perhaps it would , and especially for the women , ” he joked .
“ What you do n’t want is a guy saying ‘ I know you had sex with women I would like two million dollars or I ’m going to make trouble for you , ’ so that is where we stand right now . ”
He added that the person in question is under arrest .

A report from the New York Daily News this morning reveals that CBS News producer Robert Halderman has been arrested , and held on attempted grand larceny charges .
Halderman has directed dozens of “ 48 Hours ” documentaries , from the Winter Olympics to the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 . ”
Letterman , a veteran of the nightly chat shows that are immensely popular in the United States , earlier this month had President Barack Obama as a guest , the first time a sitting president had appeared on the CBS show .

Next time you get cut off by a another driver , consider giving the offender a break :
One - third of Americans might be genetically predisposed to crappy driving .
No , really , it 's not just your imagination .
In a new study of college undergraduates , those with a common genetic variation scored 20 percent worse in a driving simulator than their counterparts .
" The people who had this genetic variation performed more poorly from the get - go and learned more slowly as they went along , " said Steven Cramer , a University of California , Irvine neurologist , who works on helping stroke victims recover .
" Then , when we brought them back four days later , they had more forgetting . "
The single nucleotide polymorphism , or SNP , is just one of millions of single - letter variations between humans ' genetic codes .
This one occurs in a gene that produces a protein called brain - derived neurotrophic factor , which helps regulate the formation of new synapses , and the maintenance of old ones .
BDNF plays a very important role in what 's called neuroplasticity , or the brain 's ability to rewire itself on the fly .
As described in a paper published in the journal Cerebral Cortex , study participants were asked to drive 16 laps in a driving simulator that was essentially a screen with a steering wheel .
As they drove around the course , they attempted to keep their cars on a black strip in the center of the road .
The software grades their ability to complete that task quantitatively .
And , of a small sample of 29 students , people with that single genetic difference , called Val66 Met , performed more poorly than their demographically similar counterparts .
" It 's a very nice study , well designed , and the questions they ask are good , " said Clifford Nass , a co-founder of Stanford 's CarLab , an interdisciplinary research institute .
He was not part of the study .
Cramer considers the simulation a good proxy not just for driving , but for other complex motor skills tasks .
Because it 's not controlling a motor vehicle , per se , that he 's interested in , but how the brain learns , or relearns complex tasks .
When people have a stroke , and a portion of their brain dies , they have to relearn tasks using different parts of their brains .
Individual genes are only part of the symphony of influences that determine individual behavior , but the Val66 Met variation appears to have an unusually strong influence on the brain 's activity .
" There is mounting evidence that the one in three people who have this variation have less plasticity than the two - thirds of people who lack that genetic variation , " Cramer said .
Results from a separate study reported earlier this year in Scientific American also found that genetic variation in BDNF helped determined people 's skill at a simple computer game .
The effect is so pronounced , in fact , that Cramer said he could imagine future stroke patient routing within hospitals based on the SNP .
" I wonder if there are n't going to be treatments , when they have traumatic brain injury and you 're in the rehab ward , where they test the gene and say , ' Send them to the BDNF ward , ' " he said .
So , if the presence of the gene makes you a worse driver , a slower stroke - victim recoverer and possibly has other negative effects , why is the variant still present ?
" Variations can stick around just for the fact that they are not that bad for you , " said Bruce Teter , a geneticist who studies the brain at UCLA .
" They do n't kill you before you reproduce , in which case , there is no selective advantage or disadvantage . "
But it also turns out that people with the Val66 Met variant could be less susceptible to degenerative neurological disorders like Parkinson 's and Huntington's .
" Originally people thought plasticity had to be good , as it's related to the ability of the brain to adapt and learn and things like that , " Teter said .
" But neuroplasticity can also be bad for you in situations where the kinds of changes that are seen are deleterious . "
But if you want to stay out of car accidents , it 's better to have the dominant BDNF variant , Cramer 's study suggests .
And if further work continues to support that idea , the question is , can or should we do anything with that information ?
" Let 's pretend that the one in three people are more prone to car accidents , " Cramer said .
" It 's up to society to say , how do we deal with that fact ? "

The yellow spice gives curries their bright colour
An extract found in the bright yellow curry spice turmeric can kill off cancer cells , scientists have shown .
The chemical - curcumin - has long been thought to have healing powers and is already being tested as a treatment for arthritis and even dementia .
Now tests by a team at the Cork Cancer Research Centre show it can destroy gullet cancer cells in the lab .
Cancer experts said the findings in the British Journal of Cancer could help doctors find new treatments .
Dr Sharon McKenna and her team found that curcumin started to kill cancer cells within 24 hours .
' Natural ' remedy
The cells also began to digest themselves , after the curcumin triggered lethal cell death signals .
Dr McKenna said : " Scientists have known for a long time that natural compounds have the potential to treat faulty cells that have become cancerous and we suspected that curcumin might have therapeutic value . "
Dr Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , said : " This is interesting research which opens up the possibility that natural chemicals found in turmeric could be developed into new treatments for oesophageal cancer .
" Rates of oesophageal cancer have gone up by more than a half since the 70s and this is thought to be linked to rising rates of obesity , alcohol intake and reflux disease so finding ways to prevent this disease is important too . "
Each year around 7,800 people are diagnosed with oesophageal cancer in the UK .
It is the sixth most common cause of cancer death and accounts for around five percent of all UK cancer deaths .

Armenia and Turkey signed a landmark agreement Saturday to establish diplomatic ties , after a dramatic last - minute intervention by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to keep the event from falling apart .
The accord , aimed at ending a century of hostility stemming from Ottoman Era massacres , was brokered by the Swiss over the past two years , with the help of French , Russian and U.S. officials .
Clinton had been in frequent contact with the two sides in recent months to help seal the deal ...
Muslim Turkey and Christian Armenia have had bitter relations since a wave of bloodshed starting in 1915 left hundreds of thousands of ethnic Armenians dead .
Many historians call the killings genocide , but Turkey strongly rejects that label , saying people died in forced relocations and fighting .
If ratified , the accord could have implications well beyond Turkey and Armenia .
It may ease tensions in other parts of southeastern Europe and provide new opportunities for oil pipelines to the West , U.S. officials said .

It may ease tensions in other parts of southeastern Europe and provide new opportunities for oil pipelines to the West , U.S. officials said .
Schiff ’s non-binding resolution would recognize the massacre as genocide and has earned the passionate backing of Armenian - American groups .
The Turkish government has disputed the measure and spent millions of dollars on public relations and lobbying firms to successfully battle it back every congressional session the bill has been introduced so far .
“ We intend to push forward with the recognition of the genocide , ” Schiff told The Hill , hoping Turkey will “ come to grips with the past . ”
Despite Armenia and Turkey officially reconciling , lawmakers are still signing onto Schiff ’s bill .
Seven
House members have added their names to its co-sponsor list since the two countries announced on Aug. 31 the protocols they intended to sign .
Two lawmakers -- Reps. Brian Bilbray ( R - Calif . ) and Darrell Issa ( R - Calif . ) -- joined others in supporting the resolution this past week , bringing a total of 134 co-sponsors for the legislation .
Listening to the most extreme and radical Israeli voices on the radio , especially when it comes to settlements on Arab land in the West Bank , there is almost always an American accent .
When I visited Israel , I met a lot of just regular people with different opinions .
But the worst right - wing lunatics were always American voices .
I remember the chilling videography of Max Blumenthal when he interviewed ignorant and drunken American Jewish rightists in Israel screaming curses about Obama and racism towards Arabs .
( Both YouTube and Vimeo removed Max 's video . ) This past week Turkey and Armenia took a giant step towards ameliorating the decades - old enmity between their two nations by normalization of relations .
Largely brokered by the Obama Administration the pact has evinced howls of protest -- generally from Azerbaijan ... and Glendale .
The Armenian Diaspora , which is far bigger than the population of Armenia , is primarily in France , Lebanon , Russia , Australia , Iran , Argentina , Syria and the U.S. , although I 've run into Armenian ex-pats all over the world and even realized , when I was there , that Dakar in Senegal was filled with Armenian families .
Here in California , Armenian - Americans are a powerful political bloc that has gradually shifted its allegiance from the GOP to Democrats .
So it must be enervating to politicians dependent on Armenian support to hear from the Armenian National Committee of America that " the Obama administration 's attempts to force Armenia into one - sided concessions is short - sighted and will , in the long term , create more problems than it serves .
" Few members of Congress could be more sensitive to a statement like that than Blue Dog Adam Schiff in the Glendale / Pasadena district that is home to so many Armenian - Americans .
Though Jewish , he 's the lead sponsor for the genocide resolution in Congress , which he intends to keep pushing until it 's politically safe to stop .
Hysterical Turkish opposition to the resolution has turned a regular cottage industry for corrupt politicians .
Denny Hastert dragged suitcases stuffed with hundred dollar bills out of his office to stop the resolution from passing and now he -- like Dick Gephardt and Bob Livingston -- are well - paid lobbyists for Turkey ( ala Turkmeniscam .
No one has covered the scandal of Turkish operations against the resolution as thoroughly as Brad Friedman at Brad Blog , where he was the first to disclose allegations about bribes being paid not just to Speaker Hastert but to other congressional crooks like Dan Burton ( R - IN ) and Roy Blunt ( R - MO ) as well .

As part of the launch of Public Address System , we are proud to present a new educational series entitled ' Learning English with the Browns ' .
This first part of the series contains five lessons .
Take your time and read carefully through each English lesson .
By the end of the series you should be able to hold a rudimentary conversation , or study simple subjects at a university .
So now ... let 's learn English !
* * *
I. Introducing the Browns
The Brown family live together in England .
Mr. Brown has a car , but it is not a German car .
It is a British car .
Most Englishmen have roast beef for dinner .
" What would you like for dinner , today ? " asked Mrs. Brown .
" Roast beef , please , " said Mr. Brown .
Some Englishmen eat sausage at breakfast .
However , it is not like German sausage .
One morning Mr. Brown awoke before his wife .
" Are you awake , Hildegard ? " he asked .
Hildegard was not awake .
She had died during the night .
When someone dies in England , the body is displayed in the front garden for three days .
At the funeral no - one was very upset .
Englishmen do not cry .
" Tomorrow , if it is fine , I shall go to the grocer , " said Mr. Brown .
Above :
When someone dies in England , the body is displayed in the front garden for three days .
II .
At the Grocer
In England they do not have supermarkets .
They go to a ' grocer ' instead .
" Hello , I wish to buy some sausage , " said Mr. Brown .
" Yes , you may buy some sausage , " said the Grocer .
" However we do not have Knockwurst , or Blutwurst , or even Wienerwurst .
We only have English sausage . "
" That is good , " said Mr. Brown .
" I am an Englishman , so I like English sausage . "
In England they usually drink beer at breakfast .
" I also wish to buy some Weissbier for breakfast , " said Mr. Brown .
" But we are an English grocer , " said the Grocer .
" We do not sell Weissbier . "
" Good , " said Mr. Brown .
" Then I would like two litres of English beer , please .
I do not mind English beer , because I am an Englishman . "
" You can not take your groceries with you , " said the Grocer , " an errand - boy will deliver them later . "
" Yes , I know , this is the way we shop in England , " said Mr. Brown .
Above : English sausage .
III .
A Surprise Visitor
Most Englishmen do not die of natural causes .
Usually , they are poisoned .
A policemen came to see Mr. Brown .
" Hello , Bobby , " said Mr. Brown .
In England , all policemen are called Bobby .
English policemen are famous for being the most honest in the world .
" Do you speak English ? " asked Mr. Brown .
" Yes , " said Bobby , " I am a typical Englishman .
In England , the police do not carry sidearms . "
" I am also a typical Englishman , " said Mr. Brown , " I speak very good English . "
" We have had a report on Mrs. Brown 's death from the Gerichtsmediziner , " said Bobby .
" As per usual , she was poisoned . "
" Will you take 100 Euros to forget all about it ? " asked Mr. Brown quietly .
" No , " said Bobby , " because I am the most honest policeman in the world . "
Mr. Brown was joking .
Bobby was joking , too .
This is the famous English sense of humour .
" Would you accompany me to the police station now , " said Bobby .
Above : In England , all policemen are called Bobby .
IV .
The Brown Daughters
Mr. Brown has two daughters .
In England , the eldest unmarried daughter is always called by the family name .
Only younger daughters are called by their first names .
Mr. Brown 's daughters are called Gretchen and Miss Brown .
" What did you do at school today ? " asked Mr. Brown .
" We do not have to study for the Abitur in England , so I did nothing at all ! " said Gretchen .
" This is because I am English .
All Englishmen are very lazy at school . "
" My school has a uniform , " said Miss Brown .
" We English girls do not have boys at our school .
Boys go to a different place called Public School .
All schools are like this in England . "
" And we do not learn German at school , " said Gretchen .
" The Germans are very hard - working and can learn many languages , but we only learn English . "
" In England , " said Mr. Brown , " we do not have a judge .
We use the jury system . "
Above : A typical English jury .
V . At the Bibliothek
One day Miss Brown said : " Now I shall go to the bibliothek with my boyfriend , Klaus .
Like me , he is a typical Englishman . "
Gretchen stayed at home with the babysitter .
All English children must have a babysitter .
The babysitter was an Englishwoman called Hildegard .
However , in England , all babysitters are called Nanny .
" Would you like a cup of tea , Mr. Brown ? " asked Nanny .
Miss Brown did not come home until dinner - time the next day .
After they had eaten roast beef , Mr. Brown asked her where she had been .
" The car was broken , " said Miss Brown .
" It is a British car . "
" But why did you not call us on your handy ? " asked Nanny .
" My handy is also broken , " said Miss Brown .
" It is not a German handy .
It is British . "
" That is an extremely satisfactory answer , " said Mr. Brown .
" I shall now have some more roast beef . "
Above : A modern British handy .
NEXT WEEK : The Brown family go to the cinema .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Department of Homeland Security will hire up to 1,000 cybersecurity experts over the next three years to help protect U.S. computer networks , an Obama administration official said .
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano seeks to hire up to 1,000 cybersecurity experts .
" Cybersecurity is one of our most urgent priorities , " said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano in making the announcement Thursday .
She unveiled the plans at an event marking the beginning of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month .
" This new hiring authority will enable DHS to recruit the best cyberanalysts , developers and engineers in the world to serve their country by leading the nation 's defenses against cyberthreats , " according to Napolitano .
U.S. officials are mindful that both government and private sector computer sites have been targeted , and consequences can be dire .
The Internet , Napolitano said , is " a critical part of our everyday lives and how our society and our economy operate . "
She added , " We rely on cybernetworks to control and manage transportation , electricity , banking . "
Do n't Miss Study warns of cyberwarfare during military conflicts
Department officials could not say precisely how many cyberexperts now work at DHS and its various component agencies such as the Secret Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Napolitano said she doubts it will be necessary to fill all 1,000 of the authorized positions , but she is focused on making DHS a " world - class cyberorganization . "
The Obama administration has set cybersecurity as a top priority but has yet to hire a cyberczar to head up its efforts .
Chris Painter , the White House National Security Staff 's acting senior director for cybersecurity , said the president remains committed to finding someone for the post .

Veiled Voices is a documentary that profiles three influential women who are religious leaders , their families , and the communities they serve : Ghina Hammoud in Lebanon , Dr. Su’ad Saleh in Egypt , and Huda al - Habash in Syria .
The film is produced and directed by Brigid Maher , who is an assistant professor and head of the New Media concentration in the Film and Media Arts Division of the School of Communication at American University .
When I first heard about the documentary , I thought , “ Oh , no , not another take on veiled women who are oppressed ” , given the the cliched title , “ Veiled Voices ” .
I asked Maher about this , and she surprised me with her answer ,
Naturally we have a play on words with the title “ Veiled Voices ” , because it both confronts our obsession and moves beyond it .
The West may think women ’s voices are veiled because of the veil but when you hear the voices of veiled women you understand something very different and far more complex and shatter any notion of a verbal veil …
I particularly liked the idea of “ confronting obsessions ” , which the film does .
All three of its subjects wear headscarves , but discussion of the veil constitutes only two minutes of the hour - long film ( thank Allah ) .
This film left a lasting impression on me personally because it shows the kind of Islam I try to adhere to , from a female perspective .
The women filmed are both normal and extraordinary at once .
They are religious leaders by profession , but are also wives and mothers .
They observe hijab , they are well - traveled , well - educated , well - spoken and well - read .
I respect that all our readers do not want to fit this particular mold .
For some these women might be too liberal , for others , too conservative .
For me , they are the type of Muslim women I admire , and this is why I enjoyed watching the film so much .
Maher shows these women in several different lights , both personally and professionally .
We get to watch them interact with their families , their followers , and the media .
We also hear their views on sensitive topics like domestic abuse and divorce .
I asked Maher why she decided to focus on women as religious leaders in particular .
There has been a lot of ground covered in documentaries about women in Islam in particular with the veil .
Yet , I still felt that misunderstandings among non-Muslims was a pervasive problem .
If we have so much media on the subject , why are Muslim women still misunderstood ?
I wanted to move beyond the question of veiling , as that to me was such a small part of what it meant to be Muslim .
If women can penetrate leadership in government , agencies , companies , etc. , it can be fairly illuminating in regards to what kind of power they ’re able to wield .
So it made sense to start there in regards to Islam and women and this ground had n’t been covered yet .
I wanted to move beyond question of the veil to more pertinent questions of what kind of leadership roles women are able to have in their communities and who is influenced by them .
Maher includes several interviews with men as well , some related to the women , others from high - ranking religious and political backgrounds , which serve as both a contrast and compliment to the women in question .
Each of the three women interviewed are very influential , albeit in different ways .
Ghina Hammoud faces a personal challenge in gaining legitimacy as a leader as a divorced woman , since divorce is controversial in conservative communities throughout Lebanon .
However , she has found strength to rebuild her life through her role as a community leader .
It is incredibly heart - wrenching to hear about and watch the separation from her beautiful twin daughters .
Hammoud ”s personality shines through the camera as she laughs and cries .
The story of Dr. Su’ad Saleh demonstrates how , in a country that is known for having the highest number of women religious leaders and teachers , these women still fight for public recognition by the Egyptian religious authority at Al Azhar , the famous Cairo mosque and university founded in the 10th century .
Dr. Saleh is also media personality , and wields a lot of authority .
Whilst she has no institutional support , the story of her late - husband ’s encouragement is very touching .
Session players can be a tremendous asset to the overall sound of a tune or even the entire album .
When you ’re a solo artist , or even a band , and you bring in a session player to play an extra part or an overdub , the professionalism and skill of the player will only support the song .
Now if you are doing a recording with friends , go ahead and bring them in but if you are creating a recording to be the best it can be , do n’t cut the corners of musicianship and ability .
Decide in preproduction what you are going to need beyond the core of the band and book your session players early .
The excellent players are often booked well in advance .
Offering a chord chart , lyric chart , preproduction sheet and scratch demo on CD or by mp3 will give a player more than enough information to be able to come into the studio and knock out exactly what you need .
Be realistic about your abilities to execute parts in the studio against hiring session players that can really keep the quality at its best .
For instance , you may have a great drummer .
However , he might not be a percussionist .
His amazing drumming on the recording could be pulled down by uneven shaker patterns or a mediocre conga .
A lot of times I will hear a drummer and make sure he has strong percussion ability , enough that he will not take away from his drumming or the song .
If not , I will advise that group to bring in a percussionist to play the parts .
It may sound silly , but listen to albums with top level percussionists .
Even the small things like the tambourines and shakers are placed just right , and played with continuity and accuracy .
The idea is n’t to replace you or your members from secondary parts .
If you have already made the decision that your group will play all the instruments , that ’s fine .
But if you play guitar for the group and your guitar part is top notch and you want to add a part with an instrument that you play at a beginning level , bring in that session artist to play that part .
Replacing a Player
This is a topic that is talked about in small and careful circles .
The idea of replacing certain band members on certain songs with session players to get songs done quickly is a hard one to swallow for some people , but , in certain circumstances , it is a frequent reality in the industry .
Ghost in the Machine
Ghost players have been on the recording scene for a long time .
Very often they are the drummers and bass players that will come in and fix or play a part and be paid a little extra to not take the credit .
I have spent a great part of my session career doing ghosting sessions .
I enjoyed it and it was fulfilling even if you do n’t get the credit directly .
I have had people ask me how to build a resume doing that , and the answer is the same way as if you are hired as a session player that gets credit .
The album might not have your name in the credits , but the studios , the producers , the engineers and the labels know who did what .
Which leads to the last part of hiring a session player .
What if you are in a situation where something is not happening in the studio with a core member ?
There are three choices at this point and they all have pluses and minuses .
One - Keep trying to get the track with the band as it stands , or cut the session and go practice the hell out of the song .
Come back to the studio and try to nail it .
This can waste time in the studio as well as adding unexpected time that might not be available in your timeline .
If you are under a contract with a larger scale label , many times the producer will make the call to pull in a session player .
This happens very frequently .
It is a daily occurrence in the majors and even high level independents .
Two – Call in a session player right away .
It can be somewhat of a blow to the ego , but it will get the track done and the player being replaced can use the time to work to get the part down pat .
A good session player will not play far above the skill set of the replaced player .
Many times they will listen to what the replaced player sounds like and play a solid part that meshes with that player ’s style and ability .
Anytime I have replaced a drummer , I tried to bring his flavor into the tracks .
I would reproduce any signature fills or consistencies , and then I would tighten up any parts that needed it .
This was not my session .
It was his and that has to be considered unless the band or producer told me to go a totally different route .
Three – Call in the ghost session player .
The way it commonly works is that the label , producer and management will contact a session player who is familiar with ghost sessions .
Payment and a non-disclosure agreement will be arranged .
The non-disclosure agreement , or NDA , is a confidentiality contract with the ghost player .
By signing it , he or she agrees to keep the session a secret .
Be aware that you will pay a little more to hire someone who is not going to be receiving direct credit .
Conclusion
It ’s tough deciding whether or not to bring in session or ghost players .
But look at all the angles and make the decision based on what is best in the long run for the band and the recording .
The best approach is to be prepared .
Practice , practice and practice , and hopefully the only session players you will need are those who will embellish the band and the sound if the tune requires it .

Rough times for Ithaca College .
Stuck with an entering class 20 percent larger than anticipated , Ithaca is paying 31 students up to $ 10,000 to take off a year of school ( via NYT Choice blog . )
Why ?
Student matriculation in 2008 was extremely low , so Ithaca lowered its standards and sent out more acceptances this spring .
But a higher percentage of kids accepted a place , and now the school 's stuck with 300 more kids than it wanted without having room for all the extra bodies .
It 's like a desperate wannabe mom taking a fertility drug and having four times the children she expected .
So you see , Ithaca is kind of like the Octomom of the American colleges .
The school says it expects to run a surplus this year with the extra bodies , but the Chronicle of Higher Education notes that " coming in heavy " ( the unfortunate industry jargon for these kind of things ) " can often bring its own short - term and long - term costs , and create some added financial instability ... extra spending for financial aid , for additional instructors ( Ithaca had to hire several dozen ) , and for a new temporary residence hall , constructed in six weeks at a cost of $ 2.5 - million . "
Among the conventional wisdom that we hear every day in the business press is that developing countries should bend over backwards to create a friendly climate for foreign corporations , follow orthodox ( neoliberal ) macroeconomic policy advice and strive to achieve an investment - grade sovereign credit rating so as to attract more foreign capital .
Guess which country is expected to have the fastest economic growth in the Americas this year ?
Bolivia .
The country 's first indigenous president , Evo Morales , was elected in 2005 and took office in January 2006 .
Bolivia , the poorest country in South America , had been operating under IMF agreements for 20 consecutive years , and its per-capita income was lower than it had been 27 years earlier .
Evo sent the IMF packing just three months after he took office , and then moved to re-nationalise the hydrocarbons industry ( mostly natural gas ) .
Needless to say this did not sit well with the international corporate community .
Nor did Bolivia 's decision in May 2007 to withdraw from the World Bank 's international arbitration panel , which had a tendency to settle disputes in favour of international corporations and against governments .
But Bolivia 's re-nationalisation and increased royalties on hydrocarbons has given the government billions of dollars of additional revenue ( Bolivia 's entire GDP is only about $ 16.6bn , with a population of 10 million people ) .
These revenues have been useful for a government that wants to promote development , and especially to maintain growth during the downturn .
Public investment increased from 6.3 % of GDP in 2005 to 10.5 % in 2009 .
Bolivia 's growth through the current world downturn is even more remarkable in that it was hit hard by falling prices for its most important exports – natural gas and minerals – and also by a loss of important export preferences in the US market .
The Bush administration cut off Bolivia 's trade preferences that were granted under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act , allegedly to punish Bolivia for insufficient co-operation in the " war on drugs " .
In reality , it was more complicated : Bolivia expelled the US ambassador because of evidence that the US government was supporting the opposition to the Morales government , and the ATPDA revocation followed soon thereafter .
In any case , the Obama administration has so far not changed the Bush administration 's policies toward Bolivia .
But Bolivia has proven that it can do quite well without Washington 's co-operation .
Ecuador 's leftist president , Rafael Correa , is an economist who , well before he was elected in December 2006 , understood and wrote about the limitations of neoliberal economic dogma .
He took office in 2007 and established an international tribunal to examine the legitimacy of the country 's debt .
In November 2008 the commission found that part of the debt was not legally contracted , and in December Correa announced that the government would default on roughly $ 3.2 bn of its international debt .
He was vilified in the business press , but the default was successful .
Ecuador cleared a third of its foreign debt off its books by defaulting and then buying the debt back at about 35 cents on the dollar .
The country 's international credit rating remains low , but no lower than it was before Correa 's election , and it was even raised a notch after the buyback was completed .
The Correa government also incurred foreign investors ' wrath by renegotiating its deals with foreign oil companies to capture a larger share of revenue as oil prices rose .
And Correa has bucked pressure from Chevron and its powerful allies in Washington to drop his support of a lawsuit against the company for alleged pollution of ground waters , with damages that could exceed $ 27bn .
How has Ecuador done ?
Growth has averaged a healthy 4.5 % over Correa 's first two years .
And the government has made sure that it has trickled down : healthcare spending as a percent of GDP has doubled , and social spending in general has expanded considerably from 5.4 % to 8.3 % of GDP in two years .
This includes a doubling of the cash transfer programme to poor households , a $ 474 m increase in spending for housing , and other programmes for low - income families .
Ecuador was hit hard by a 77 % drop in the price of its oil exports from June 2008 to February 2009 , as well as a decline in remittances from abroad .
Nonetheless it has weathered the storm pretty well .
Other unorthodox policies , in addition to the debt default , have helped Ecuador to stimulate its economy without running too low on reserves .
Ecuador 's currency is the US dollar , so that rules out using exchange rate policy and most monetary policy for counter - cyclical efforts in a recession – a significant handicap .
Instead , Ecuador was able to cut deals with China for a billion - dollar advance payment for oil and another $ 1bn loan .
The government also has begun requiring Ecuadorian banks to repatriate some of their reserves held abroad , expected to bring back another $ 1.2bn , and it has started repatriating $ 2.5 bn in central bank reserves held abroad in order to finance another large stimulus package .
Ecuador 's growth will probably come in at about 1 % this year , which is pretty good relative to most of the hemisphere .
For example , Mexico , at the other end of the spectrum , is projected to have a 7.5 % decline in GDP for 2009 .
The standard reporting and even quasi-academic analysis of Bolivia and Ecuador says they are victims of populist , socialist , " anti-American " governments – aligned with Venezuela 's Hugo Chávez and Cuba , of course – and on the road to ruin .
To be sure , both countries have many challenges ahead , the most important of which will be to implement economic strategies that can diversify and develop their economies over the long run .
But they have made a good start so far , by giving the conventional wisdom of the economic and foreign policy establishment – in Washington and Europe – the respect it has earned .
Six lobbyists for every member of Congress as healthcare industry heaps cash on politicians to water down legislation
America 's healthcare industry has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to block the introduction of public medical insurance and stall other reforms promised by Barack Obama .
The campaign against the president has been waged in part through substantial donations to key politicians .
Supporters of radical reform of healthcare say legislation emerging from the US Senate reflects the financial power of vested interests ‑ principally insurance companies , pharmaceutical firms and hospitals ‑ that have worked to stop far - reaching changes threatening their profits .
The industry and interest groups have spent $ 380 m ( £ 238 m ) in recent months influencing healthcare legislation through lobbying , advertising and in direct political contributions to members of Congress .
The largest contribution , totalling close to $ 1.5 m , has gone to the chairman of the senate committee drafting the new law .
A former member of Bill Clinton 's cabinet says fears that the industry could throw its money behind the populist rightwing backlash against public insurance have scared the Obama White House into pulling back from the most significant reforms in return for healthcare companies not trying to scupper the entire legislation .
Drug and insurance companies say they are merely seeking to educate politicians and the public .
But with industry lobbyists swarming over Capitol Hill ‑ there are six registered healthcare lobbyists for every member of Congress ‑ a partner in the most powerful lobbying firm in Washington acknowledged that healthcare firms ' money " has had a lot of influence " and that it is " morally suspect " .
Reform groups say vast spending , and the threat of a lot more being poured into advertisements against the administration , has helped drug companies ensure there will be no cap on the prices they charge for medicines ‑ one of the ways the White House had hoped to keep down surging healthcare costs .
Insurance companies have done even better as the new legislation will prove a business bonanza .
It is not only likely to kill off the threat of public health insurance , which threatened to siphon off customers by offering lower premiums and better coverage , but will force millions more people to take out private medical policies or face prosecution .
" It 's a total victory for the health insurance industry , " said Dr Steffie Woolhander , a GP , professor of medicine at Harvard University and co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Programme ( PNHP ) .
" What the bill has done is use the coercive power of the state to force people to hand their money over to a private entity which is the private insurance industry .
That is not what people were promised . "
PNHP blames a political process it says is corrupted by millions of dollars poured into the election campaigns of members of Congress and influencing the discourse about health reform by funding advertising campaigns , supposedly independent studies and patients rights organisations that press the industry 's interests .
A primary target of criticism is Senator Max Baucus , the single largest recipient of health industry political donations and chairman of the finance committee that drafted the legislation criticised by Woolhander .
The committee this week twice voted against including public insurance in the legislation , with Baucus opposing it both times .
Baucus took $ 1.5 m from the health sector for his political fund in the past year .
Other members of the committee have received hundreds of thousands of dollars .
They include Senator Pat Roberts , who last week tried to stall the bill by arguing that lobbyists needed three days to read it .
Baucus holds dinners for health industry executives at which they pay thousands of dollars each to be at the table , and an annual fly - fishing and golfing weekend in his home state of Montana that lobbyists pay handsomely to attend .
They have included John Jonas , who represents healthcare firms for Patton Boggs , widely regarded as the top lobbying firm in Washington .
Jonas , who formerly worked on the congressional staff , acknowledges that political contributions are intended to buy influence and says it works .
" It would be very naive to say they 're not influenced .
The contributors certainly hope they 're influencing and the recipients probably ultimately are influenced , " he said .
" I think it 's a morally suspect practice , and then you have to look at its application to see if it 's morally bankrupt ...
I think what 's bad about the system is it 's got more and more lax over time .
" When I started in this practice you did not talk issues at a fundraiser .
It was impolite .
And then with this need for money , the system has got coarser over time so that they go around the room asking what issues you 're interested in , much more of a linkage of dollars to a discussion of the issues now . "
The health industry permeates the process in other ways .
At Baucus 's side , drafting much of the wording of the reform , was Liz Fowler , a senate committee counsel whose last position was vice - president of the country 's largest health insurer , Wellpoint , which stands to be a principal beneficiary of the new law .
Health companies and their lobby firms also recruit heavily among congressional staffers as a means of maintaining influence .
Baucus declines to discuss political donations but told Montana 's Missoulian newspaper earlier this year that " no one gets special treatment " .
Robert Reich , the labour secretary in the Clinton administration , says the Obama White House , mindful of how the health industry killed off Clinton 's attempts at reform , has grown so fearful of industry money that it has quietly reached agreement to pull back from price caps and public health insurance .
" The White House made a Faustian bargain with big pharma and big insurance , essentially scuttling both of these profit - squeezing mechanisms in return for these industries ' agreement not to oppose healthcare legislation with platoons of lobbyists and millions of dollars of TV ads . "
The pharmaceutical companies are apparently pleased enough that they are now putting $ 120 m into advertising supporting the emerging legislation .
Jonas described the bill emerging from the Senate as " in realm of what is politically possible " .
" Is the bill overly distorted by money ?
I do n't think it actually is , " he said .
" It 's a good bill in the sense that it 's a net improvement in the system ... [ but ] it 's a bad bill if you think it 's supposed to be a comprehensive solution to the US healthcare problems . "
VATICAN CITY ( AP ) 
The Vatican said Saturday that married Anglican priests will be admitted to the Catholic priesthood on a case - by - case basis as Rome makes it easier for disillusioned conservative Anglicans to convert .
A surprise Vatican decision , announced 10 days earlier to make it easier for Anglicans to become Roman Catholics while retaining aspects of Anglican liturgy and identity , had left some wondering whether Rome would embrace married Anglican clergy in large numbers .
A Holy See statement Saturday quoted Cardinal William Levada , the Holy See 's guardian of doctrinal correctness , as saying the Vatican would consider accepting married Anglican priests into the Roman Catholic priesthood as it has in the past — evaluating each case on its own merits .
The Roman Catholic church requires its priests to be celibate , except in the case of the Eastern rite Catholics , who are allowed to be ordained if married .
But over the last decades , it has also quietly allowed married Anglican clergy to stay priests when converting to Catholicism .
In no case could a married man become a bishop , and the new rules would exclude any married Anglican bishop from retaining that post .
As for possibly admitting married Anglican seminarians to the Catholic priesthood , Levada said " objective criteria about any such possibilities ( e.g. married seminarians already in preparation ) are to be developed " for approval by the Holy See.
Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi dismissed what he called some media speculation that there was " disagreement about whether celibacy will be the norm for the future clergy " among converting Anglicans .
He quoted Levada as saying " there is no substance to such speculation , " and that the only reason why the rules regarding the converting Anglicans have n't been published yet was due to " technical " reasons .
He predicted work on the new rules would be completed by the end of the first week of November .
Pope Benedict XVI has dedicated a good part of his papacy since 2005 welcoming traditionalists into Rome 's fold .
Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams , the spiritual leader of Anglicans worldwide , was n't consulted about the changes but will have the opportunity to discuss the state of Catholic - Anglican relations when he meets with Benedict on Nov. 21 during a visit to Rome .
The Vatican 's easing the way for Anglicans to convert might undermine decades of efforts between the Holy See and Anglican leaders over how they might possibly unite .
Anglicans split with Rome in 1534 when the Vatican refused to give English King Henry VIII a marriage annulment .
The Anglican communion includes the Episcopalian Church in the United States .
Some Anglican faithful , unhappy over progressive reforms in their church , consider themselves Catholics although they have not yet officially joined the Roman Catholic church .
Anglicans have been divided over such issues as admitting women to the priesthood .
The rift was torn wide open in 2003 , when the Episcopal Church in the United States consecrated V. Gene Robinson , as the first openly gay bishop .
Also disenchanting Anglican conservatives has been the blessing of same - sex marriages .

The Discovery of France : A Historical Geography from the Revolution to the First World War
Graham Robb
W.W. Norton & Co ( 2007 )
Of all the traffic you might have encountered on the road to Paris near the end of the 18th century , the most peculiar -- and heartbreaking -- would surely have been the donkeys loaded down with baskets stuffed full of drunken , illegitimate babies .
These doomed shipments were the result of well - meant legislation that made the nuns of Paris ' foundling hospital responsible for overflow from institutions as far as 250 kilometres away , as Graham Robb explains in his often revelatory history of rural France : the donkey carters started in Brittany , Lorraine or the Auvergne , with four or five infants per pannier , " but in towns and villages along the route they struck deals with midwives and parents .
For a small fee , they would push in a few extra babies .
To make the load more tractable and easier on the ears , the babies were given wine instead of milk .
Those that died were dumped at the roadside like rotten apples ... for every ten living babies that reached the capital , only one survived more than three days . "

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
Robb , a biographer and avid cyclist who conceived his book while riding the back lanes and byways of rural France , has packed it as full as any of those tragic baby baskets with vivid glimpses of life in the French countryside , from the pre-Revolutionary period to the present day .
The world he reveals is compelling , and myth - busting .
" The result of 14,000 miles in the saddle and four years in the library , " The Discovery of France could be called revisionist history , if it were n't for the fact that so little of the real past in these places has ever been written about in any coherent fashion before .
The average Francophile may be aware of De Gaulle 's famous quote : " How can anyone govern a nation that has two hundred and forty - six different kinds of cheese ? "
But cheese is just the surface of the " crazed human landscape of tribes and clans " that Robb discovers .
Far from the homogeneous nation state divided into a handful of picturesque regions that most tourists -- and indeed many Frenchmen -- imagine the country to be , he has uncovered a France that was , and to some degree still is , as tenuous and illogical as any post - colonial state .
For Canadian readers , this offers the revelation that even an ancient nation such as France is as provisional , shape - shifting and improbable as our own young , identity - conflicted country .
Using memoirs and reports from a few literate but mostly unfamous Frenchmen and the odd -- very odd -- pre-tourism foreign traveler , Robb discovers that in the not - so - distant past , the French countryside was a largely uncharted land of deserts and vast swamps , impenetrable forests and empty plains , a place " where witches and explorers were still gainfully employed while Gustave Eiffel was changing the skyline of Paris . "
Robb has great fun with a 1799 French - German phrase book written for travelers by one Mme. de Genlis .
You can follow the general tenor of travel in post -Revolution France by glimpsing some of her key phrases :
" Your carriage is heavy and overloaded . "
" I believe that the wheels are on fire . "
" The horse is badly wounded .
It is dead . "
French not spoken there
As intrepid travelers and heroic map - makers and the steady trickle of entrepreneurial peasants that journeyed the roads and tracks of La France Profonde were often reminded , to come from a village ten kilometres to the east was to be considered a foreigner ; to travel 50 kilometres was to find oneself in a new land , where customs , physiognomy and language were completely alien .
Especially language .
Robb titles his chapter on language after the many ways of saying " yes " in the different dialects of the country -- O Òc Sí Bai Ya Win Oui Oye Awé Jo Ja Oua -- and " even this is a simplification ...
As the sun travelled over the Franche - Comté , it changed its name to souliel , soulet , soulot , s'lot , soulu , sélu , slu , séleu , souriel , seriel , s'riel and seroille . "
Shortly after the Revolution , Abbé Henri Grégoire estimated that a mere three million French people -- 11 per cent of the population -- actually spoke French ( official French is the dialect of Paris and its surrounding region ) .
Six million were completely unable to speak the language at all , while another six million could barely struggle through a sentence -- all this while French , the literal lingua franca , was the continent 's international language of diplomacy .
In 1880 , it was estimated that only one - fifth of the population was comfortable in the national tongue .
( Perhaps this chaos explains much of the overprotective attitude France still has towards its language . )
What about that other great unifier , religion ?
Again , appearances are deceptive .
While the average French peasant would have been fairly sure that they were Christian , and for the most part Catholic , in truth the country was rife with cults and barely disguised pagan ritual that changed within an afternoon 's travel .
One village 's Virgin Mary was different from and superior to the next village 's -- and the Virgin was by far the most important deity .
Jesus was a character in folk tales , who walked the French countryside alongside Gargantua and a frequently gullible Devil .
God was remote and not very interesting .
Catholic dogma was absorbed into pre-existing local traditions , and rendered unrecognizable .
Priests who tried to impose orthodoxy risked assault or worse from angry villagers .
Even the saints and holy icons of a village had to watch their step : " When the phylloxera epidemic wiped out their vines , the people of Mouzon in the Ardennes threw the statue of their saint into the river Meuse ...
In 1887 a visitor to a convent in a large Provençal town noticed that Saint Joseph had been turned to face the wall .
It was explained that Saint Joseph was ' doing penance ' for having failed to persuade a landowner to leave a certain piece of land to the convent in his will .
If he failed again , he would be taken down to the cellar and thrashed . "
Stripped of romance
The lives revealed in the book , so different from those of the usual 300 or so characters that make up the cast of traditional French history , are rich and strange , even in their poverty .
You meet the stilt - walking shepherds of the Landes , able to easily overtake horse - drawn coaches , and hear the last traces of the " whistling language " of the Pyrenées .
You discover that democracy existed in France well before the Revolution , in isolated villages that elected their own officials .
Women , left on their own while male family members worked far - off fields or wandered the region selling goods , had more control over communities than their men- folk cared to admit .
( And while plenty of jobs were considered " woman ’s work , " there was no rural activity that females were not involved in . )
Life was , in some rare instances , better , but more often worse than we can imagine .
Trying to discover why mortality rates were so high in one region , an official discovered that at the first sign of illness , weary , over - taxed and underfed peasants immediately hopped into their fetid beds and hoped to die : surely the next world would be better .
The common complaint was not that life was too fleeting , but the opposite : the tedium of it went on far too long ( this in an age when life expectancies were decades shorter than our own . )
But the image of ceaseless , back - breaking labour is also untrue .
Diets were far too poor to allow such exertion , and the slow pace of country life was often a necessity born out of sheer lack of energy .
" A ploughman who took hours to reach a field beyond the town was not necessarily admiring the effect of morning mist on the furrows and the steaming cattle against the rising sun ; he was trying to make a small amount of strength last for the working day , like a cartload of manure spread over a large field . "
In many parts of France , peasants literally hibernated for the entire winter , packed tightly into their dwellings for warmth , deliberately slowing their metabolisms to get through the long , bleak season .
By the mid-19th century , the standardization of culture and language , aided by technology and the explosion of phenomenons such as tourism , was in full swing .
As France began to discover itself , most of these micro-cultures disappeared , in many cases replaced by simplified versions of regionalism imposed by Parisian " experts " and foreign visitors .
The second half of the book describes that inexorable progress with occasional regret , but Robb is no conservative fantasist , pining for the good old days .
Be glad you are alive today , rather than , say , headed for 18th century Paris in a donkey pannier .
The new France
The " process of forgetting " described by Robb in the tail - end of his book seems to be a large part of any efficient modern nation - building , but it is not complete by any means : the country is still much more than the series of clichés most tourists seek , still complicated , layered and in many cases , unknown to itself .
Above all , it is still changing .
I am lucky enough , from time to time , to visit relatives who live amid a tiny clutch of farm buildings and sunflower fields in the Poitou - Charente region of western France .
It 's a famously " backward " part of the country , in the middle of nowhere between Poitiers and the touristy harbour town of La Rochelle .
When they first arrived in the late 1980s , part of the ongoing wave of English refugees who regularly flee the U.K. , the area was nearly abandoned to a dwindling population of white - haired farmers and Anglo immigrants .
Today , the nearby town of Niort is the wealthy centre of France 's insurance industry , the Brits are in retreat thanks to the collapse of the pound , and young French families are beginning to re-fit and re-fill once - abandoned cottages and farms .
When I return from my relatives to my home in central Paris , I live in a mini-Vietnamtown , surrounded by Pho and noodle joints in 400 year - old buildings .
In my previous apartment up in the northeastern arrondissements of the city , I was just another pale newcomer among the Hutus and Tutsis , Algerian Jews , Wen Zhou Chinese and countless others .
A current controversy in the city revolves around the takeover of an old garment district near Canal St - Martin by an insular Chinese community , while in the course of my two years here , I 've noticed a steady disappearance of the traditional Auvergnat tabac owner .
In his epilogue , Robb mentions the Paris banlieues , or suburbs , infamous for their riots , disaffected youth and desolate architecture -- and their nearly impenetrable slang , which has seeped into the daily conversation of most Parisians of a certain age -- and posits them as a newly undiscovered part of France , a fresh , unknown region full of strange customs that only the most intrepid visitor dare visit .
It 's a great conceit , with a grain of truth .
But Robb 's book is already a bit behind the times .
He mentions a certain minister of the Interior and his description of the banlieue 's rioting young inhabitants as racaille -- or scum .
That minister is now the leader of France , and just this spring , announced a vast , ambitious scheme -- called Grand Paris -- to re-make the banlieues and integrate them into a larger version of the capital .
This is either , as cynical observers would have it , Sarkozy 's attempt to impose a legacy on the city in the manner of Mitterand or Pompidou , or a genuine attempt to revitalize an urban wasteland and reclaim a generation of excluded French citizens .
The only thing that can be sure at this point is that the banlieues will , like everywhere and everything else , change .
Last week 's EmTech meeting played host to a panel that focused on managing energy use in datacenters , featuring representatives from Lawrence Berkeley Labs and the Uptime Institute , along with people from Google , Intel , and Yahoo .
Almost everyone but Yahoo's Scott Noteboom discussed where power efficiencies were improving , and identified areas that still needed work , so their points are best organized by topic , rather than speaker .
Noteboom described how Yahoo built an extremely energy - efficient data center in upstate New York , which we 'll get back to in a bit .
Nearly all of the speakers recognized that , from a market perspective , building an efficient datacenter is increasingly critical .
Jonathan Koomey , who 's affiliated with LBL and Stanford , said that power use by US datacenters doubled between 2000 and 2005 , despite the fact that the period saw the dot com bust .
Uptime 's Kenneth Brill told the audience that , currently , the four - year cost of a server 's electricity is typically the same as the cost for the server itself , while John Haas of Intel said that 2010 is likely to be the point where the electricity costs of a server over its lifetime will pass the price of the hardware .
The price for power also tends to get magnified at the datacenter level .
Haas said that , based on his company 's estimates , one watt saved at the server can save 2.84W at the datacenter level , while Google 's Chris Malone claimed that cooling dominates the additional costs , running at about twice the cost of everything else combined .
When the additional infrastructure costs are considered , Brill said , the minimum capital expenditure for a $ 1,500 server has now cleared $ 8,000 when the power and air conditioning infrastructure is considered .
" Profits will deteriorate dramatically if datacenter costs do n't get contained , " he concluded .
Fortunately , the panel described potential solutions that exist at nearly every level of the datacenter .
More efficient processors are a key driver ; the LBL's Koomey said that processing efficiency , measured as computations per kilowatt - hour , has been doubling about every 1.6 years , going back to the vacuum tube era of the 1940s .
Plotted on a logarithmic scale , it made for a remarkably linear trend line .
Intel 's Haas told
Ars that it's not only the computational efficiencies that are driving this trend — current Intel processors devote a million gates per socket towards energy management and , when idle , only consume about 30 percent of what they do under heavy loads .
As a result , the company estimates that replacing 185 single - core servers from 2005 could be done with 21 modern Xeons , yielding energy savings of nearly 90 percent .
The increasing efficiency of the processor is starting to drive companies to look elsewhere for further gains .
So , for example , Malone described how Google has ditched its UPS units , and instead placed a small battery on the motherboard side of the power converters .
Charging it via the DC lines allows a UPS functionality with what he called " nearly perfect efficiencies . "
But the biggest remaining efficiencies are likely to be in management and facilities .
Nearly everyone agreed that the worst possible efficiency came when hardware is sitting idle , since even the most efficient hardware draws a significant amount of power even when not doing anything .
Both Brill and Koomey said that the companies that do cloud computing are far , far better at avoiding this than business or scientific users , and the lessons they 've learned really need to be adopted elsewhere .
Brill also pointed out that although Intel provides power management capabilities at the processor level , these often have to be activated via software , and a lot of companies do n't bother .
At the facilities level , since cooling dominates , controlling its use is the clearest path to greater efficiency .
Several of the speakers said that although a lot of the hardware has recommended operating temperatures , these are often based on out - of - date information — the hardware can actually tolerate temperatures that are quite a bit higher .
In addition to raising the temperature , Google 's Malone said that controlling the airflow and using evaporative cooling can avoid the use of chillers entirely , yielding significant power savings .
Haas pointed out that a group he works with , called The Green Grid , has an interactive map that will display how often the outdoor air temperature in a given location is below a set level , indicating that cooling can be avoided entirely .
With all these options available , the biggest problem is generally institutional inertia .
As Koomey put it , there are split incentives : the cheaper hardware may not be efficient , which produces what he termed " perverse behavior . "
Haas pointed out that a company 's energy buyers and IT managers may not report to the same executives , leaving them with little incentive to cooperate to lower a different division 's costs .
All of that nicely set the stage for Yahoo's Noteboom , who described what happens when a company does organize a data center for energy efficiency .
As recently as 2005 , Yahoo was entirely dependent on colocalization facilities that had n't been built with efficiencies in mind .
As a result , he estimated that 60 percent of the power was wasted , and the facilities went through enormous amounts of water .
Since then , Yahoo has built five new facilities , each incorporating new ideas .
Although its server footprint has grown by a factor of 12 since 2005 , datacenter costs are only one - quarter of what they used to be .
He then described Yahoo's latest facility , being built in upstate New York .
The buildings are oriented according to the prevailing winds that come off the Great Lakes , with vents along the walls and a high central cupola that allows waste heat to escape .
" The entire building is an air handler , " he said , noting that servers are also laid out within it in order to maximize their fans ' impact .
As a result , the current estimate is that it will only require external cooling for 212 hours in an average year , which will be provided via evaporative cooling .
Yahoo estimates that the cost to cool it will only be about a single percent of what they were paying during the colocation days .
The company is looking into the potential for further improvements , like shutting off server fans in favor of larger , more efficient external ones and eliminating UPS systems .
They 're also exploring cross-facilities load management — sending work to facilities where power and cooling costs are lower .
Overall , the Yahoo presentation gave a good sense of what 's possible when a company focuses its attention on datacenter energy use and does a thorough adoption of best practices .
The cost figures provided by the rest of the panel suggested that , if current trajectories continue , it will be harder to justify not making this sort of effort .

The man accused of fatally stabbing and bludgeoning his sister and her husband in El Cerrito said in court Wednesday that the couple 's son had " cleaned up his life " since his parents were " eliminated . "
" How 's your life been since all this happened ? " Edward Wycoff , 40 , who is acting as his own attorney , asked his nephew , 20 - year - old Eric Rogers , during cross-examination in Contra Costa County Superior Court in Martinez .
" Incredibly difficult , " Rogers said , looking squarely at his uncle .
The exchange came moments after Wycoff greeted his nephew by saying , " Hello , Eric . "
Rogers simply nodded .
Wycoff is accused of killing Rogers ' parents , Paul Rogers , 48 , and Julie Wycoff Rogers , 47 , on Jan. 31 , 2006 , at their home on Rifle Range Road .
Authorities say Wycoff killed the couple because he thought they were too liberal , they were raising their children wrong and they had n't invited him over for Christmas .
If convicted of murder with special circumstances , Wycoff could be sentenced to death .
In the courtroom of Judge John Kennedy on Wednesday , Wycoff asked Eric Rogers : " Did n't you think it was strange that after my dad died , that everyone was invited for Christmas except for me ? "
" I was n't aware of that - I was n't there for Christmas , either , " his nephew replied .
Wycoff repeatedly tried to ask Rogers if he had experienced any " problems with the law " before and after his parents were killed - and blurted that his nephew had been an alcoholic at the age of 15 - but prosecutor Mark Peterson objected on the grounds of relevance .
When Kennedy asked , in the jury 's presence , whether he wanted to explain the relevancy , Wycoff said , " Yes , I 'll tell you why .
The parents raised these kids wrong .
Since the parents were eliminated , I think Eric has cleaned up his life . "
Kennedy barred Wycoff from asking the questions .
During his opening statement Tuesday , Peterson told jurors that Wycoff had hoped to adopt his nephew and then - 12 - year - old niece , Laurel , after the killings .
The victims ' third child was living elsewhere at the time .
Under questioning by Peterson , Rogers said he and his sister awoke about 4:30 a.m. the day of the killings to crashing sounds in the hallway .
He said he saw a man dressed in black and wearing a motorcycle helmet struggling with someone .
Moments later , Rogers said , he found his father lying face down in an " enormous " pool of blood in the master bedroom .
A knife was stuck in his back , and Laurel Rogers was tending to him .
" I stroked his hair with my hand , " Eric Rogers testified .
Paul Rogers told his children , " I love you , no matter what , " his son testified .
He said he had replied , " I love you too , Papa . "

Grayson calls health care crisis ' holocaust '
Florida Rep. Alan Grayson , under fire for conservatives for describing the gist of their health care plans as " die quickly , " is not exactly backing down from claims he 's crossed a line of civility .
Just now on the floor , he called on members of the House to pass health care reform in the most extreme terms possible :
" I apologize to the dead and their families that we have n't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America , " Grayson said .
Brian Wilson has been given the go - ahead to finish writing incomplete music by George Gershwin .
The Beach Boys mainman will be given full access to the compositions by Gershwin ‘s estate , and will release the music on a forthcoming album of Gershwin covers .
Though the album has no fixed release date , it will come out on Walt Disney imprint Disney Pearl , whom Wilson has recently signed a deal with , reports The Wall Street Journal .

Speaking about the album , Wilson said he has always loved the music of Gershwin , who died in 1937 .
“ The earliest music I remember hearing is ‘ Rhapsody In Blue ’ , ” he said .
“ Along with Irving Berlin , Gershwin basically invented the popular song , but he did something more .
He had a gift for melody that nobody has ever equalled , yet his music is timeless and always accessible .
This is the most spiritual project I ’ve ever worked on . ”
In a statement , Todd Gershwin of the George Gershwin estate and Michael Owen of the Ira Gershwin [ George ’s older brother who wrote the compositions ’ lyrics ] estate praised Wilson as a songwriter .
“ The Gershwin families are delighted that the legendary musician Brian Wilson has chosen to record a collection of George and Ira Gershwin songs for his next project .
In every generation , American music has been pushed forward by visionaries , from the Gershwin brothers to Brian Wilson .
This latest interpretation will be a new opportunity to discover the magic of Gershwin music . ”
Wilson ‘s second release for Disney Pearl will be an album of covers from classic Disney productions , which he promises to “ Brian-ize ” .
Release dates for both albums are yet to be finalised .
AG Holder responds to queries from lawmakers ...
Brad Friedman Byon 5/16/2009 , 9:45 am PT
For those who have wondered ( particularly when looking at the incredible miscarriages of prosecutorial injustices and improprieties in cases like Gov. Siegelman's ) , no , Obama has yet to replace Bush 's partisan U.S. Attorneys , incredibly enough .
But he will , says AG Holder , according to Politico ...
President Barack Obama plans to replace a " batch " of U.S. Attorneys in the next few weeks and more prosecutors thereafter , according to Attorney General Eric Holder .
" I expect that we 'll have an announcement in the next couple of weeks with regard to our first batch of U.S attorneys , " Holder said Thursday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing which stretched out over most of the day due to breaks for members ' votes .
" One of the things that we did n't want to do was to disrupt the continuity of the offices and pull people out of positions where we thought there might be a danger that that might have on the continuity -- the effectiveness of the offices .
But ... elections matter -- it is our intention to have the U.S. Attorneys that are selected by President Obama in place as quickly as they can . "
...
Holder 's comments Thursday came in response to a question from Rep. Maxine Waters ( D - Calif . )
" Many jurisdictions are waiting desperately to see what is going to be done .
As we understand it , the protocol has been that U.S. Attorneys would hand in their resignations and would give the new administration an opportunity to make new appointments , we do n't see that happening quite fast enough , " she said , pointing to complaints about prosecutors in Mississippi , Louisiana and Alabama .
Gosh .
Take your time , kids .
Although , in fairness ( where any may be due here ) , the following bears keeping in mind ...
If the first U.S. Attorney selections from Obama do come in the next few weeks , he will still be ahead of Bush 's timetable .
He proposed his first U.S. Attorneys on August 1 , 2001 .
U.S. Attorneys require confirmation by the Senate and are usually proposed with the concurrence of the senators from that state .
Sir Alan Sugar today said he had accepted his peerage and new role as the Government 's enterprise tsar for " the need of the country " .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The multi-millionaire businessman , who will receive a seat in the House of Lords as part of a new role boosting enterprise , said the appointment would enable him to give help to small businesses .
Sir Alan , famous for his catchphrase " You 're fired " on television show The Apprentice , attacked the lack of business expertise among civil servants in the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform , pledging to " guide them in the right direction " .
Details of the appointment were thrashed out between Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Sir Alan , who is a long - standing friend of the Premier , at Number 10 yesterday .
Business Secretary Lord Mandelson welcomed the appointment .
He said : " Lord Sugar is just one heck of a man and you will see him pioneering enterprise , backing small and medium - sized enterprises around the country .
" That 's what we need .
If we are going to succeed economically in this country , we going to have that sort of success and Alan Sugar 's going to help us achieve it . "
In an interview with Sky News Sir Alan said : " It has been lacking in the past of people who really know first hand what is needed in business .
I cannot take on a ministerial role and I must not be a person making policy .
" All I can do is advise those that are in charge of making policy from a business point of view as to what is right and what is wrong .
" They need someone now in these kind of ... emergency economic times that we have got that someone who has been there and worn the T - shirt on what to do as far as business is concerned .
" That is what interests me most in this thing , I am doing it because of the need of the country really .
" If you can believe me , it is not politically motivated in any way .
It is more I think that small businesses and people need help .
" With all due respect to the people in Victoria Street , they are what they are , they are civil servants and they have never actually been in business .
You have got to have someone there to guide them in the right direction . "

Overview
The public ’s assessment of the accuracy of news stories is now at its lowest level in more than two decades of Pew Research surveys , and Americans ’ views of media bias and independence now match previous lows .
Just 29 % of Americans say that news organizations generally get the facts straight , while 63 % say that news stories are often inaccurate .
In the initial survey in this series about the news media ’s performance in 1985 , 55 % said news stories were accurate while 34 % said they were inaccurate .
That percentage had fallen sharply by the late 1990s and has remained low over the last decade .
Similarly , only about a quarter ( 26 % ) now say that news organizations are careful that their reporting is not politically biased , compared with 60 % who say news organizations are politically biased .
And the percentages saying that news organizations are independent of powerful people and organizations ( 20 % ) or are willing to admit their mistakes ( 21 % ) now also match all - time lows .
Republicans continue to be highly critical of the news media in nearly all respects .
However , much of the growth in negative attitudes toward the news media over the last two years is driven by increasingly unfavorable evaluations by Democrats .
On several measures , Democratic criticism of the news media has grown by double - digits since 2007 .
Today , most Democrats ( 59 % ) say that the reports of news organizations are often inaccurate ; just 43 % said this two years ago .
Democrats are also now more likely than they were in 2007 to identify favoritism in the media : Two - thirds ( 67 % ) say the press tends to favor one side rather than to treat all sides fairly , up from 54 % .
And while just a third of Democrats ( 33 % ) say news organizations are “ too critical of America , ” that reflects a 10 - point increase since 2007 .
The partisan gaps in several of these opinions , which had widened considerably over the past decade , have narrowed .
There are some notable exceptions to these trends , however , as Republicans increasingly see news organizations as influenced by powerful people and organizations and not professional , while Democrats ’ views have changed little .
The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press ’ biennial media attitudes survey , conducted July 22 - 26 among 1,506 adults reached on landlines and cell phones , finds that even as the party gaps in several criticisms of the press have lessened over the past few years , views of many individual media sources are deeply divided along party lines .
Democrats hold considerably more positive views than Republicans of CNN , MSNBC , The New York Times and the news operations of the broadcast networks , and their views of National Public Radio are somewhat more favorable than those of Republicans .
By contrast , views of Fox News — and to a lesser extent The Wall Street Journal — are more positive among Republicans than Democrats .
Partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007 .
Today , a large majority of Republicans view Fox News positively ( 72 % ) , compared with just 43 % of Democrats .
In 2007 , 73 % of Republicans and 61 % of Democrats viewed Fox News favorably .
Three - quarters ( 75 % ) of Democrats assess CNN favorably , while just 44 % of Republicans do so , which is little changed from two years ago .
MSNBC also rates substantially higher among Democrats ( 60 % ) than among Republicans ( 34 % ) .
But the starkest partisan division is seen in assessments of The New York Times .
Although most Americans are not familiar enough with the Times to express an opinion , Republicans view The New York Times negatively by a margin of nearly two - to - one ( 31 % to 16 % ) , while Democrats view it positively by an almost five - to - one margin ( 39 % to 8 % ) .
More independents rate the Times favorably ( 29 % ) than unfavorably ( 18 % ) .
More favorable Republican ratings are reserved for The Wall Street Journal .
Within the GOP , the balance of favorable to unfavorable assessments of the Journal is second only to that for Fox News .
Democratic and independent assessments of The Wall Street Journal are also , on balance , positive .
And the balance of opinion regarding National Public Radio is favorable across the board ; however , Democratic opinions of NPR are somewhat more positive than those of Republicans ( 50 % favorable vs. 39 % ) .
The poll finds that television remains the dominant news source for the public , with 71 % saying they get most of their national and international news from television .
More than four - in - ten ( 42 % ) say they get most of their news on these subjects from the internet , compared with 33 % who cite newspapers .
Last December , for the first time in a Pew Research Center survey , more people said they got most of their national and international news from the internet than said newspapers were their main source .
However , online news lags behind newspapers as a source for news about local issues .
As with national and international news , most people ( 64 % ) cite television as their main source for local news .
Yet despite declines in newspaper readership over the last several years , about four - in - ten people ( 41 % ) turn to newspapers for news about issues and events in their local area , more than twice the number that turn to the internet for local news ( 17 % ) .
The public ’s impressions of which news organizations do the most to uncover local news stories largely mirror the top sources for local news .
More than four - in - ten ( 44 % ) say that local television stations do the most to uncover and report on important local issues , while a quarter ( 25 % ) identify local newspapers as the primary sources of local news reporting .
Far fewer people identify local independent online organizations ( 11 % ) or radio stations ( 10 % ) as responsible for uncovering most local news stories .
Even among those who get most of their local news from newspapers , about as many say most original local reporting is done by television stations ( 41 % ) as by newspapers ( 38 % ) .
Long - Term Views of Press Performance
The public has long been critical of the press in several areas : in 1985 , majorities said that news organizations tried to cover up mistakes , tended to favor one side on political and social issues and were influenced by the powerful .
However , in that initial survey on press performance , conducted by the Times - Mirror Center , most people ( 55 % ) said that news organizations “ get the facts straight , ” while 34 % said stories were often inaccurate .
Opinions about the accuracy of news stories fluctuated over the next decade , but by the late 1990s majorities said that news stories are often inaccurate .
That has been the case for the past decade as well , with the exception of a brief period in fall 2001 , when coverage of 9/11 and terrorism boosted the press ’s positive ratings .
In the current survey , 63 % say news stories are often inaccurate .
Similarly , the proportion saying news organizations “ try to cover up their mistakes ” has reached a high of 70 % , up from 63 % two years ago .
In 1985 , a smaller majority ( 55 % ) said news organizations tried to cover up their mistakes .
And while most Americans ( 59 % ) see news organizations as “ highly professional , ” the proportion expressing this view also has slipped since 2007 ( 66 % ) .
In 1985 , 72 % said news organizations were highly professional .
The pattern is the sa
me regarding public attitudes about whether the press is biased , deals with all sides fairly , and is independent .
In 1985 , fewer than half ( 45 % ) said news organizations were politically biased , while 36 % said they were careful to avoid bias .
Today , by greater than two - to - one ( 60 % to 26 % ) , more say the press is biased .
Nearly three - quarters ( 74 % ) say news organizations tend to favor one side in dealing with political and social issues , while just 18 % say they deal fairly with all sides .
The proportion saying the press favors one side has risen eight points since 2007 ( from 66 % ) .
In 1985 , a much smaller majority ( 53 % ) said the press favored one side .
There has been a comparable shift in views of the press ’s independence .
Nearly three - quarters ( 74 % ) now say news organizations are influenced by powerful people and organizations compared with 20 % who say they are pretty independent .
In 1985 , by a far smaller margin , more said that news organizations were influenced by the powerful than said they were pretty independent ( 53 % to 37 % ) .
Notably , the balance of opinion about whether news organizations are liberal or conservative has changed little since 1985 .
At that time , about twice as many said the press was liberal than conservative ( 40 % vs. 19 % ) .
That continues to be the case today ( 50 % vs. 22 % ) , although somewhat more people offer an opinion about this issue than did so then .
Partisan Press Evaluations
In 1985 , there were at most modest differences between Republicans and Democrats in views of press bias , fairness , the accuracy of news stories and whether powerful people and institutions exert too much influence over news organizations .
By the late 1990s , more Republicans than Democrats said the press was politically biased and tended to favor one side in dealing with political and social issues .
Yet on basic issues relating to press professionalism and the accuracy of news stories , there continued to be no significant partisan differences .
During George W. Bush ’s presidency , the partisan gap over most views of press performance increased markedly .
In 2005 , the proportion of Republicans saying news stories are often inaccurate reached a high of 68 % : just 47 % of Democrats agreed .
Roughly a third of Republicans ( 34 % ) said news organizations were “ not professional , ” compared with 20 % of Democrats .
But the most striking change during the Bush years came in opinions about whether news organizations “ stand up for America ” or are “ too critical of America . ”
The proportion of Republicans saying the press is too critical of America jumped from 47 % in 2003 to 67 % in 2005 ; at the same time , the partisan gap in views on this issue nearly tripled – from 15 points to 43 points .
In the current survey , opinions about whether the press is too critical of America – as well as whether its stories are inaccurate and whether it tends to favor one side on political issues – have become less partisan as Democratic criticisms of news organizations have increased .
At the same time , however , the partisan gap has widened since 2007 in opinions about whether news organizations are not professional ( from eight to 21 points ) and are often influenced by powerful people and organizations ( from 10 points to 17 points ) .
In both cases , Republicans express more negative views of news organizations than at any point in the 24 - year history of the survey ; 39 % say news organizations are not professional while 83 % say they are often influenced by the powerful .
Fox Viewers More Critical
Attitudes about the press also differ by where people get their news .
The Fox News audience , which includes a larger share of Republicans than do the audiences for other news outlets , is far more critical of the press ’s performance .
Where Fox News viewers particularly stand out is in their low regard for the patriotism and morals of news organizations .
Nearly six - in - ten ( 59 % ) of those who say they get most national and international news from Fox News say news organizations are too critical of America .
By contrast , smaller percentages of those who rely on the internet ( 44 % ) , newspapers ( 41 % ) , CNN ( 39 % ) or the broadcast networks ( 36 % ) express this view .
In addition , Fox News viewers are the only audience in which a majority ( 51 % ) says news organizations are immoral rather than moral .
Yet those who go online for national and international news also give the press relatively low ratings .
Notably , 80 % of the online news audience says that news stories are often inaccurate , which is only slightly less than the percentage of Fox News viewers ( 86 % ) and greater than the proportions of other news audiences expressing this view .
In addition , 39 % of those who say their main source of news is the internet say news organizations are declining in influence ; that compares with roughly a third of Fox News and CNN viewers and smaller proportions of those who rely on network news and newspapers .
Views of Obama Coverage
About six - in - ten Americans ( 62 % ) say that news organizations are being fair to the Obama administration , while 23 % say media coverage has been unfair .
Nearly three - quarters of Republicans ( 73 % ) say coverage of the administration has been fair , compared with 54 % of Democrats and 67 % of independents .
Historically , members of the party controlling the White House have been less likely to see coverage of the administration as fair .
In November 2005 , for example , 50 % of the public said that coverage of George W. Bush ’s administration was fair .
While about two - thirds of Democrats ( 68 % ) viewed the coverage as fair , just a quarter of Republicans ( 25 % ) agreed .
In February 1998 , shortly after the initial allegations that President Clinton had had a sexual relationship with a White House intern , the public was divided in its views of coverage of Bill Clinton ’s administration ; 49 % said it was fair , while 44 % said it was unfair .
Only about a third of Democrats ( 34 % ) thought coverage of the administration had been fair , compared with 66 % of Republicans and 54 % of independents .
At this point , public perceptions of coverage of the new Obama administration are similar to views in August of Bill Clinton ’s first term .
At that time , 66 % said coverage of the new administration had been fair , while 21 % said they saw it as unfair .
Among partisans , 77 % of Republicans said coverage was fair , compared with 61 % of Democrats and 66 % of independents .
But the public does see the media growing increasingly critical of the Obama administration , according to a separate measure in the Pew Research Center ’s News Interest Index survey .
In mid-August , a plurality of Americans ( 43 % ) said press coverage of Obama had been fair , but that figure had declined by 10 points since early June , and was down from 64 % in January as Obama took office .
The proportion saying that coverage of Obama had become too critical increased since early June – from 16 % to 23 % ; the proportion of Democrats who said coverage of Obama was too critical nearly doubled during this period ( from 22 % in June to 40 % in August ) .
There was virtually no change in the percentage who said coverage of Obama had not been critical enough .
Most Support Watchdog Press
There is a similar pattern of partisanship in opinions about whether criticism of political leaders by news organizations keeps leaders from doing things that should not be done , or whether it keeps leaders from doing their job .
For more than two decades , majorities have expressed the view that a critical press keeps leaders from doing things that should not be done – but the views of Republicans and Democrats shift depending on which party controls the White House .
Currently , 62 % say that criticism of political leaders is worthwhile because it keeps those leaders from doing things that should not be done , while 22 % say such criticism keeps leaders from doing their jobs .
Two years ago , 58 % said that press criticism did more good than harm .
In the new survey , 65 % of Republicans believe that criticism does more good than harm , compared with 55 % of Democrats and 66 % of independents .
That stands in stark contrast to the way that Republicans viewed the press ’s watchdog role when George W. Bush was in the White House .
Two years ago , for example , just 44 % of Republicans said that press criticism of political leaders did more good than harm ; that compared with 60 % of independents and 71 % of Democrats .
The same pattern has played out since Ronald Reagan ’s presidency .
At that point – and during the presidency of George H.W. Bush – Democrats were more supportive than Republicans of the role of a watchdog press .
But when Bill Clinton came into office , partisan opinions shifted .
The balance shifted back again after George W. Bush took office and have now returned to a balance similar to that seen during the Clinton presidency .
Favorability of Traditional News Sources
While the public has become much more critical of the way news organizations do their jobs , most Americans continue to give favorable ratings to traditional news sources – local TV news , daily newspapers and network television news .
Favorable opinions of all three have declined since 1985 ; nonetheless , majorities continue to express favorable opinions of local TV news ( 73 % ) , the daily newspaper they are most familiar with ( 65 % ) , and network TV news ( 64 % ) .
Views of local TV news continue to be less partisan than opinions of other leading news sources .
As was the case in 1985 , there is very little difference between the views of Republicans ( 79 % favorable ) and Democrats ( 77 % ) ; somewhat fewer independents ( 67 % ) rate local TV news favorably .
Currently , 65 % say they have a favorable impression of the daily newspaper they are most familiar with .
Positive opinions of daily papers have decreased by 16 points since 1985 , with nearly all the decline ( 14 points ) coming in the past decade .
However , unfavorable opinions of newspapers have risen only slightly since 1999 – from 17 % to 20 % .
Since then , the proportion saying they are unable to rate daily newspapers has increased from 4 % to 15 % .
Over the past two decades , partisanship has become a much greater factor in favorable ratings of network TV news than for local TV news or daily newspapers .
In 1985 , 87 % of Democrats , 85 % of Republicans and 81 % of independents said they had a favorable impression of network TV news .
Since then , favorable opinions among Republicans have fallen by 30 points ( to 55 % ) ; the decline has been nearly as large among independents ( 27 points ) .
But nearly as many Democrats currently express positive views of network TV news ( 81 % ) as did so in 1985 ( 87 % ) .
Main Sources of National , Local News
The vast majority of Americans ( 71 % ) continue to cite television as their source for most national and international news .
This is little changed from recent years ; in December 2008 , 70 % said they got most news from television .
More than four - in - ten ( 42 % ) say they get most national and international news from the internet , which also is about the same as in December 2008 ( 40 % ) but much higher than in September 2007 ( 24 % ) .
As was the case last December , somewhat fewer ( 33 % ) get most of their news from newspapers than from the internet .
When it comes to local news , television also is where most of the public turns : 64 % say they get most of their news about issues and events in their area from television , compared with 41 % who say they get most local news from newspapers .
And while 42 % of Americans rely on the internet for national and international news , fewer than half as many ( 17 % ) say the internet is their main source of local news .
Americans are about equally likely to say radio is their main source for national and international news ( 21 % ) and local news ( 18 % ) .
While 70 % of those younger than 30 say they get most of their national and international news from television , nearly as many ( 64 % ) point to the internet .
Among those ages 30 to 49 a similar pattern is evident ; 62 % get most national and international news from television , while 54 % cite the internet .
For Americans 50 and older , television is the dominant news source .
Yet after television , the internet rivals newspapers for those ages 50 to 64 ( 37 % newspapers vs. 29 % internet ) .
Those 65 and older are the only age group in which substantially more people cite newspapers ( 55 % ) than the internet ( 10 % ) .
Television is the main local news source for all age groups ; but in contrast to national and international news , newspapers are mentioned more frequently than the internet .
Even among those younger than 30 , substantially more say they get most local news from newspapers ( 39 % ) than from the internet ( 21 % ) .
In addition for all age groups except those 65 and older , roughly equal proportions cite radio and the internet as a main source for local news .
Partisanship and Cable Sources
Four - in - ten ( 40 % ) Americans cite a major cable news outlet ( CNN , Fox News and MSNBC ) as their main source for news about national and international affairs .
As in the past , comparable percentages say they rely on CNN ( 22 % ) and Fox News ( 19 % ) while fewer ( 6 % ) say they get most of their news from MSNBC .
There has been a gradual widening in the partisan differences in the viewership of both Fox News and CNN in recent years .
More than three times as many Republicans ( 34 % ) as Democrats ( 10 % ) say they get most of their national and international news from Fox .
By comparison , Democrats are more than twice as likely than Republicans to cite CNN ( 29 % vs. 13 % ) .
A similar pattern is evident for MSNBC , with more Democrats ( 9 % ) than Republicans ( 3 % ) citing it as a main news source .
Shutdown of News Outlets Seen as Important Loss
Though the public is increasingly critical of news media organizations , most people think it would be an important loss if major news sources shut down .
More than eight - in - ten Americans ( 82 % ) say that if all local television news programs went off the air – and shut down their web sites – it would be an important loss .
About three - quarters say the same about the network evening news ( on ABC , CBS , NBC and PBS ) , cable news networks ( like CNN , Fox News and MSNBC ) and local newspapers in their area .
Somewhat fewer people ( 68 % ) say that it would be a major loss if large national newspapers ( like USA Today , The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal ) were to stop publishing and go offline .
Although fewer young people cite television and newspapers as their main news source than do those 60 and older , young people are actually more likely to say it would be an important loss if national news sources such as network TV evening news ( 83 % 18 - 29 year olds vs. 74 % 60 and older ) , cable news ( 82
% vs. 70 % ) and large national newspapers ( 78 % vs. 60 % ) shut down .
And while more Republicans than Democrats express critical views of the performance of news organizations , Republicans are about as likely as Democrats to say the loss of major news outlets would be important .
The only exception is network evening news ; even in this case , 69 % of Republicans say the shutdown of network evening news would be an important loss , compared with 85 % of Democrats .
Much of the post - game analysis of yesterday ’s big UN climate summit dwells on the lack of specifics offered by the U.S. and China — lack of specific commitments to curb emissions , pass legislation and the like .
But there was one interesting difference in the speeches of President Obama and Hu Jintao :
The specific role each country sees for nuclear power .
President Obama dedicated the first part of his talk to a recital of what his administration has done to make the U.S. a cleaner - energy economy .
He cited renewable energy , wind power , solar panels , hybrid cars , energy - efficient buildings , offshore wind power , new fuel - economy standards for cars , and work on clean coal .
He did not mention nuclear power once .
In contrast , the Chinese president embraced nuclear power as part of the country ’s clean - energy push .
Mr. Hu said the country will “ vigorously develop ” renewable energy and nuclear energy as part of the plan to generate 15 % of China ’s electricity from non-carbon - emitting sources by 2020 .
China has already said it hopes to build as many as 132 gigawatts ( Thanks , Rod ) of new nuclear power plants as part of its bid to reduce electricity - sector emissions ; nuclear is currently an almost - neglible part of China ’s energy mix .
David Rosenberg discusses ugly September data , and why this recovery is not sustainable :
THUD , DUD AND CRUD
There ’s no other way to describe the U.S. employment report that was just released for September .
And guess what ?
The rose - colored glass donning set of economists who have been talking about sequential improvement in the data and how “ less negative ” the employment numbers have become ca n’t say that after today ( thank the good lord ) .
That ’s because at - 263,000 on nonfarm payrolls , instead of the - 175,000 print that was widely expected , we actually saw sequential deterioration for the first time since May as the August decline was - 201,000 ( though revised from - 216,000 ; July was revised lower to - 304,000 from - 276,000 ) .
If you think that is bad , consider that the Household Survey showed a massive 785,000 plunge in September which again was sequential deterioration because the decline the month before was 392,000 …
These numbers far from validate the overwhelming consensus view that the recession has come to an end just because of one positive stimulus - crazed GDP print ( did n’t we have that in 2008 too ? ) ; not to mention the fact that the last time we came off such a two - month falloff in Household employment was back in March when the stock market was testing fresh 12 - year highs .
Sustainability is the key and there can be no durable recovery without net job creation and organic wage growth .
Both were lacking in today ’s report – in fact , the combination of the workweek edging back down to retest the all - time low of 33.0 hours and the near - stagnation in hourly wages dragged the proxy for personal income down 0.2 % ( reads : in nominal terms ) and the year - over - year trend is getting perilously close to deflation terrain at +0.7 % from +0.8 % in August and +1.2 % in July .
The United Nations and Interpol , the global police organization , are poised to become partners in fighting crime by jointly creating an international police force .
Interpol , which is financed by 187 member nations , says the " global police doctrine " would allow the deployment of peacekeepers among rogue nations plagued by war and organized crime .
" We have a visionary model , " said Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble , who described the joint partnership " an alliance of all nations . "
He suggested that by relying on Interpol 's resources , the United Nations would be able to handle international conflicts and transnational crime far better .
" If UN peacekeepers assigned to post - conflict zones or fragile states are asked to perform police - like functions and to combat transnational crime , then more peacekeepers should come from the ranks of police and be given access to Interpol 's global databases , " said Noble .
Modern peacekeeping efforts have evolved significantly since the blue - helmeted UN military force was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988 .
Since 2005 , the number of police forces involved in UN peacekeeping operations has more than doubled from about 6,000 to 12,200 in 17 countries .
However , Interpol officials plan to steer the organization into providing " advice and consulting services " in the area of policing during peacekeeping operations , AFP reported .
" Interpol is not going to send troops out into the field here and there throughout the world , " said Interpol director of legal affairs Joel Sollier .
" What Interpol is going to do is provide technical assistance , technical support . "
On Sunday , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in a video message told a gathering of justice and foreign ministers from more than 60 countries in Singapore that the UN welcomes the initiative .
" They forge trust in uniformed men and women .
They generate confidence that peace can succeed , " he said , describing the UN Police ( UNPOL ) .

I am not sure if this was his intent , but recent analysis of the Flow of Funds Report by Martin Weiss eloquently makes the case for deflation .
In New , Hard Evidence of Continuing Debt Collapse !
Martin Weiss Writes ...
While most pundits are still grasping at anecdotal “ green shoots ” to celebrate the beginning of a “ recovery , ” the hard data just released by the Federal Reserve reveals a continuing collapse of unprecedented dimensions .
It ’s all in the Fed ’s Flow of Funds Report for the first quarter of 2009 , which I ’ve posted on our website with the key numbers in a red box for all those who would like to see the evidence .
First and foremost , the Fed ’s numbers demonstrate , beyond a shadow of a doubt , that the credit market meltdown , which struck with full force after the Lehman Brothers failure last September , actually got a lot worse in the first quarter of this year .
click on chart for sharper image
Open Market Paper : Instead of growing as it had in almost every prior quarter in history , it collapsed at the annual rate of $ 662.5 billion .
( See line 2 . )
Banks lending : Credit markets [ collapsed ] at the astonishing pace of $ 856.4 billion per year , their biggest cutback of all time ( line 7 ) .
Nonbank lending : ( line 8 ) pulled out at the annual rate of $ 468 billion , also the worst on record .
Mortgage lenders : ( line 9 ) pulled out for a third straight month .
( Their worst on record was in the prior quarter . )
Consumers : ( line 10 ) were shoved out of the market for credit at the annual pace of $ 90.7 billion , the worst on record .
The ONLY major player still borrowing money in big amounts was the United States Treasury Department ( line 3 ) , sopping up $ 1,442.8 billion of the credit available — and leaving LESS than nothing for the private sector as a whole .
Bottom line :
The first quarter brought the greatest credit collapse of all time .
Excluding public sector borrowing ( by the Treasury , government agencies , states , and municipalities ) , private sector credit was reduced at a mindboggling pace of $ 1,851.2 billion per year !
And even if you include all the government borrowing , the overall debt pyramid in America shrunk at an annual rate of $ 255.3 billion ( line 1 ) !
Did they make any headway in stopping the ABS collapse ?
None whatsoever !
The total outstanding in this sector ( page 34 line 3 ) fell at an annual pace of $ 623.4 billion in the first quarter , the WORST ON RECORD !
U.S. security brokers and dealers were smashed ( page 36 line 3 ) .
Brokers were forced to reduce their total investments at the breakneck annual pace of $ 1,159.2 billion in the first quarter , after an even hastier retreat in the prior quarter !
Government agencies got killed ( page 43 line 6 ) .
Households dumped their Ginnie Maes , Fannie Maes , Freddie Macs , and other government - agency or GSE securities like never before in history , unloading them at the go - to - hell annual clip of $ 1,395.7 billion .
Change In Household Net Worth
In U.S. households alone , the losses have been massive : massive : $ 1.39 trillion in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 ( not shown on page 105 ) … a gigantic $ 10.89 trillion in 2008 … $ 1.33 trillion in the first quarter of 2009 … $ 13.87 trillion in all , by far the worst of all time .
Bottom line :
The first quarter brought the greatest credit collapse of all time .
Reserve Balances with Federal Reserve Banks
unprecedented
Hyperinflation , or even strong inflation predictions in the near term look rather silly in the face of this data unless one is only looking at the printing and not the destruction in credit .
Think consumers are about to go on a spending spree after a massive $ 13.87 trillion collapse in net worth ?
Think banks are going to start lending with this employment picture and household debt ?
I do n't and boomer demographics makes the situation even worse .
Do n't forget the bleak employment picture .
There is no source of jobs .

The Dreamliner project has been hit by a number of delays
The first flight of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner will take place by the end of 2009 , the company has announced .
Boeing also said it hoped to deliver the first plane for service in the last quarter of 2010 .
There has been a series of delays in the development of the aircraft , and it is now running almost two years behind its original schedule .
Boeing chairman Jim McNerney said the extra time would enable the remaining work to be completed .
" The design details and implementation plan are nearly complete , and the team is preparing airplanes for modification and testing , " he said .
Write - off
The delay was partly caused by an area within the side - of - body section of the aircraft which needed to be reinforced , Boeing added .
Risk remains the new schedule could slip given the current challenge of re-fitting the wing - body join ... and simply the poor 787 track record
Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn
The latest delay in the project , announced in June this year , was the fifth time the launch had been put back .
The company estimated that the cost of the first three test planes , which have no commercial value , would be $ 2.5 bn .
This , it said , would be included as a one - off charge in its July to September results .
" This charge will have no impact on the company 's cash outlook going forward , " Boeing said .
While analysts generally welcomed Boeing 's announcement , some cautioned that future delays may still have to be announced .
" Risk remains the new schedule could slip given the current challenge of re-fitting the wing - body join , the possibility of changes to the electrical and environmental control systems , and simply the poor 787 track record , " said Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn .
Important plane Boeing hopes to be making 10 of the 787 planes a month by the end of 2013 .
Last month , the firm said it already had 850 orders .
It also revealed that it had received 13 new orders for 787s between April and June , but that airlines had cancelled 41 others .
The 787 Dreamliner is a hugely important plane for US - based Boeing in its long standing rivalry with Europe 's Airbus .
It was the first unveiled in July 2007 and is the firm 's first all - new jet since 1995 .
It is designed to make use of carbon fibre to make it much lighter and more fuel efficient than traditional aluminium planes .

Many a seafood fan has parroted the popular idea that fish and crustaceans do not feel pain .
New research , however , suggests that they may , revealing that their nervous system may be more complex than we thought — and our own awareness of pain may be much more evolutionarily ancient than suspected .
[ For more on pain , see the special section beginning here . ]
Joseph Garner of Purdue University and his colleagues in Norway report that the way goldfish respond to pain shows that these animals do experience pain consciously , rather than simply reacting with a reflex — such as when a person recoils after stepping on a tack ( jerking away before he or she is aware of the sensation ) .
In the study , the biologists found that goldfish injected with saline solution and exposed to a painful level of heat in a test tank “ hovered ” in one spot when placed back in their home tank .
Garner labels that “ fearful , avoidance behavior . ”
Such behavior , he says , is cognitive — not reflexive .
Other fish , after receiving a morphine injection that blocked the impact of pain , showed no such fearful behavior .
Although Garner ’s findings fit with previous work that tentatively suggests that fish feel pain , some experts remain unconvinced that the reaction was not an instinctive escape behavior .
Still , the new study raises ethical concerns .
“ If we ’re going to use animals in experiments , and we ’re going to use animals as food , then it is really important to understand the consequences of our actions for those animals , ” Garner says .

The UK is now in the grip of the longest recession since records began , according to gloomy official figures published today .
Hopes for an end to recession were scuppered as the economy shrank by a shock 0.4 per cent between July and September - a record sixth quarter in a row of decline .
Output has now slumped 5.9 per cent since the onset of recession - almost as bad as the 6 per cent slump seen in the early 1980s - the Office for National Statistics said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The lingering decline comes despite interest rates at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March , additional Government spending and an unprecedented £ 175 billion boost to the money supply through quantitative easing .
And it shows the UK lagging behind other major economies such as France and Germany , which both emerged from recession in the second quarter of the year .
Chancellor Alistair Darling said he was still confident of a return to growth " at the turn of the year " but the Government 's stewardship of the economy came under heavy fire from political opponents .
" This news has destroyed Labour 's claim that Britain was better placed than other countries to weather the storms , " shadow chancellor George Osborne said .
Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the economy still faced " massive structural problems " .
He added : " It is critical ministers spell out a credible path as to how they will deal with the deficit . "
Experts had been ready to toast a technical end to the recession during the period , with forecasts of a modest 0.2 per cent advance ending five quarters of decline .
But the pound sagged against the dollar and euro on the hugely disappointing figure as markets bet on more support for the economy from the Bank of England with an extension of the QE programme to as much as £ 250 billion .

Economists warned of a potential deflation risk and said it could take at least six years to make up the output gap left by the recession .
" Even accounting for a dent to potential output from the recession , the output gap is probably already over 3 per cent of GDP and is unlikely to be closed until 2015 or so , " Vicky Redwood of Capital Economics said .
John Cridland , deputy director - general of the CBI business group , said the figures were " disappointing and concerning " .
He added : " Recovery , when it comes , will be fragile and volatile . "
The worse than expected figure could signal a downgrade to official growth forecasts in November 's Pre-Budget Report - which would mean public borrowing rises beyond the current record £ 175 billion estimated .
And the pressure on the economy will intensify in 2010 as stimulus measures such as the temporary VAT cut and the " cash - for - bangers " scrappage scheme come to an end .
Unemployment is also steadily rising towards three million .
Overall service output , which represents almost three - quarters of the UK economy , was expected to register growth but instead disappointed with a 0.2 per cent decline over the quarter .
The construction sector also remained in the doldrums - falling 1.1 per cent during the period - and is down by a mammoth 14.7 per cent since the beginning of 2008 .
Industrial production output shrank by 0.7 per cent and has declined 13.7 per cent overall since the recession began .
IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer also underlined the stiff challenges faced by the UK on the road to recovery .
He said : " High and rising unemployment , the need for consumers and businesses to improve their balance sheets , and ongoing tight credit conditions amid still - serious financial - sector problems , are particularly worrying for growth prospects .
" On top of this , economic activity will be held back ... by the need for extended , major fiscal tightening to rein in the terrible public finances . "
When was the last time when you practiced your “ No ” ‘s ?
Oh , you do n’t practice your “ No ” ‘s ?
And why is that ?
Because you ’re having a hard time saying “ No ” ?
Because you feel a little bit embarrassed by that ?
Maybe because people will turn their back on you if you dare to say “ No ” ?
With all due respect , saying “ No ” it ’s a vital part of our lives .
If you ca n’t do it whenever you feel the need , there ’s something wrong in the system .
You have the right to chose your responses and there ’s no rule which says they may not contain the word “ No ” .
Well , maybe not always in this rather bare and somehow rude form , but with this exact meaning .
Why Saying No ?
Because you really have to .
Life is made up of choices and , obviously , choices means you can pick whatever you want .
Saying “ Yes ” constantly to everything is not a choice .
The same way saying “ No ” to everything is not a choice .
Honestly putting your “ Yes ” and “ No ” on what you really want is a choice .
Too often people seem to be scared by saying “ No ” .
The fear of rejection overcome the desire of authenticity .
There ’s a subtle , unconscious block which makes you feel like an alien , an outlaw , a loser and a ridiculous person if you dare to openly express your opinion by saying “ No ” .
I found over the time that a timely “ No ” is always better than a squeezed “ Yes ” .
And you do n’t have to be rude about your refusal .
In fact , you can craft your own “ No ” strategy , which , carefully practiced , can give better results than a dumb , submissive and obedient approach .
Here are 7 ways in which you can say “ No ” to people – whenever you feel the need to say “ No ” , that is – and a little bit of background for each refusal strategy .
1. I ’m Sorry But I Think I ’ve Been There Before
And did n’t feel quite good about it .
I mean , I totally know what you ’re offering and I know it ’s great , but I do n’t have a very good memory about that .
It ’s not you .
it ’s me .
The focus here is on a previous bad experience with what you ’re asked to do .
You tell the other part you ’ve done that before and you did n’t get the expected results .
This approach has at least 2 big advantages .
First of all , it does n’t challenge the possibility .
The other part will know that what he asks was done before .
That in itself could sometimes stop the desire all together .
People may ask things from you just to see if they ’re possible .
And second , you clearly state your experience with that .
In this case , a negative experience .
From this point away , once you stated you had a bad outcome , the other part does n’t have many other options .
And you did n’t even say the word “ No ” .
2. You Might Be Right , But My Intuition Disagrees
I really ca n’t talk my intuition into this one , you know .
Maybe rationally this seems to be the best thing to do right now , but I just have this feeling …
You ca n’t beat a feeling , you know ?
Again , this does n’t openly challenge the legitimacy of the proposal : “ it might be right ” .
But it does n’t validate it either .
What it does though , it puts between you and the proposal a safety cushion called “ intuition ” .
Whenever you use words like “ intuition ” or “ feelings ” you make things really difficult for the other part .
Because everybody trust feelings .
Positioning the proposal against your feelings it ’s something perceived as plain wrong .
3. Are You Sure This Is The Best Moment To Do This ?
I mean , there are a lot of other priorities on my plate right now and I do n’t know if I can cope with all that work involved .
Really , is this the best moment ?
In this case , emphasis is on the time constraint .
It ’s not the actual thing that is refused , but the moment .
It ’s a postponing , in fact , and people are receiving postponings better than refusals .
It might be done somewhere , but just not now .
The promise of something possible , even in a distant future , as opposed to something totally out of question in the present moment , is something so powerful , that almost anyone will fall for it .
Ok , I ’ll wait .
Maybe later .
Great .
4. That Sounds Fantastic But I Have A Better Idea
Why do n’t we just do this instead , I think it ’s much more fun ( easy , timely , useful ) than doing what you just asked me .
Which , by the way , it ’s fabulous , you know …
This refusal strategy challenge the curiosity in the other person .
First of all , you do n’t go against what they said : “ that sounds fantastic ” , but at the some time you throw a little bait : “ I have a better idea ” .
Everybody falls for better ideas .
The best thing about this strategy is that you silently change the role of the other person .
From someone who commands you to someone who ’s your partner .
You go from refusing something you do n’t want , to implementing a partnership for something you want .
5. Are You Sure This Is Going To Work ?
I mean , it sounds a little bit risky .
Why do n’t we settle for something more convenient for the moment , until we see how things turn out .
How about that ?
This challenges the very core of the proposal , aiming at lowering the confidence of the other part in it .
While this is not as effective as the first strategies , it does have a decent success rate .
Especially when dealing with bully requests .
The approach in this case is to get an armistice until things can get a little better .
Usually , the other part will agree , as you do n’t openly refuse the proposal .
With some time on your part you can then wait for a more favorable context .
6. Maybe You Should Lead On This And I ’ll Follow Later
I mean , you seem to really know what you ’re doing so I really think you ’re fit to be the first in this one .
Just go ahead and I ’ll be right behind , learning from you …
This is on the verge of playing bad joke , but nevertheless , it has its success rate .
Sweet talking the other part end enforcing his leader abilities could sometime create a situation in which he ’s already doing what he asked from you .
Pretending the other part is in charge will often act like a magic mirror : they ’ll actually start to be in charge and discard your role in the whole situation .
The risk is that at some point they ’ll want to look behind and you ’d better be there .
7. Read My Lips : “ NO ”
Is that clear enough for you ?
It ’s a NO .
Capital letters .
Plain , full , simple NO .
I ’m not going to do this .
Period .
End of story .
When everything else fails , do this .
An open , honest and vocal refuse will most likely surprise the other part , especially if it comes on a history of obedience and submission .
You can even get some respect for your strong position .
From all the other strategies , this is my favorite .
I do n’t do it very often , because , believe it or not , the other ones are working just great .
But every now and then there are some situations when everything else fails . 😉
***
Which one is your favorite ?
How many of them have you experienced so far ?
Of course , if you have another one , not listed , feel free to add it in the comments , if you think it ’s worth .
Or you may as well refuse to do so . 🙂
I see this often on PerlMonks .
I have n't see it as often on the Perl Beginners Mailing List .
I think some community differences explain this behavior .
I do n't intend to answer the question of why ( though that could be amusing ; I find bleak amusement in certain PerlMonks threads that descend into several respondents flailing about to offer suggestions which they have obviously not tried because Perl does not work that way ) .
I prefer to give advice for novices who want to ask questions and get useful answers .
I could recommend How to Ask Questions the Smart Way and leave it at that .
You should skim that document .
I know most novices wo n't read it in part or in full , but they should .
Even so , that document does n't answer an important question : how can I tell if the advice I 've received is useful or a meaningless debate over brace placement that is n't worth my time ?
There 's one general rule : if you 've asked a good question ( per the linked document ) and you 've received at least one meaningful response which seems to answer your question , you can safely ignore the contents of responses which do n't answer your question directly .
In other words , if anyone on PerlMonks says " I do n't know , but you should always use strict and warnings , " you can ignore the rest of the post .
If someone gives you an answer that seems reasonable and , after you test it locally , seems to do what you need and then offers some style advice , consider it .
If someone tells you that your entire approach is wrong and gives you an alternative which seems credible , you should consider the alternative enough to get a sense of its benefits and drawbacks .
If this means posting a followup , that 's fine too .
If more than one response suggests that your code is too difficult to debug without changing your style , consider it .
If every response suggests that you 're doing something wrong , take that advice .
That 's all well and good , but how do you tell whether approaches are matters of style or the difference between correct and incorrect behavior or maintainable or unmaintainable problems ?
You cheat .
Run your program through Perl : : Critic and see which , if any , severity level discusses the style issue .
If the default , least strict severity suggests you have a style problem , address it now .
If the most strict severity level is silent about your style problem , you can ignore it for now .
If the style issue is over brace placement or indentation or something P : : C does n't care about , compare your code with Perl : : Tidy 's reformatting and see which you find easier to read .
Then ignore style discussions .
As for the rest , take advice where you can get it .
A lot of experienced developers have a lot of practical experiences using and maintaining Perl programs for many years .
They have written and maintained programs that solve a lot of problems .
They 've seen community idioms and common solutions wax and wane as community members discovered problems and new solutions and better abstractions .
Do n't walk away from that wealth of knowledge and advice in favor of a short - term solution .
Yet also do n't get confused that people care about long - term sustainability of programs and programmers ; the kind of people who care about answering novice questions -- the kind of people you want to answer novice questions -- have some interest in seeing you avoid the rough spots they had to encounter the hard way .
Safety and correctness are concerns -- but P : : C goes a long way to identify the most important antipatterns there .
Ultimately the question of whether one construct is more readable than another depends on your preferences , the coding standards of your organization , your problem domain , and your experience and familiarity with the language and its idioms .
The best thing you can do is train yourself to consider short - and long - term ideas .
That 's not easy , but fortunately many people answering novice questions will do so .
Learn from them .
The World Badminton Championships are being held in Hyderabad The England team has withdrawn from the World Badminton Championships in India because of " a specific terrorist threat " made by extremists .
The eight - strong squad pulled out of the tournament , which starts on Monday in Hyderabad , after reports of threats by Muslim extremists Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Badminton England said it was " an incredibly tough decision " .
Badminton Scotland said its players will stay , and Welsh Badminton have three players at the tournament .
The England squad arrived home on Sunday night ahead of a news conference by players and officials at the National Badminton Centre in Milton Keynes on Monday .
Anne Smillie , chief executive of Badminton Scotland , said that Badminton England had " perhaps overreacted " .
She said : " I do n't necessarily think they 've made the right decision .
" Certainly our Scottish players and our team manager who are in Hyderabad feel confident that the security is at its best .
They have been well looked after and they have no intention of coming home . "
Volatile environment Badminton England chief executive Adrian Christy said : " After the Olympic Games , this is the most prestigious championships in the world but we were not prepared to risk the safety of our players , coaches and staff in what we felt could have been a very volatile environment . "
He said the team , which included Olympic silver medallist Nathan Robertson , had " carefully considered " information from local police authorities .
Our athletes were extremely well prepared for these championships but , at the end of the day , personal safety must take priority over performance
Ian Moss
Badminton England
Games quit move is ' overreaction '
And after taking advice from the Foreign Office and British High Commission , the conclusion made by Badminton England was " that safety is of paramount importance , " he added .
Performance director Ian Moss said : " It is a disappointing outcome , especially after we had enjoyed a very good preparation at our holding camp in Doha , Qatar , last week .
" Our athletes were extremely well prepared for these championships but , at the end of the day , personal safety must take priority over performance .
Rahul Tandon , BBC News , Calcutta
The decision by the England badminton team to pull out of the World Championships came as a surprise to many here .
But it does raise questions about India 's ability to host major sporting events .
There are plenty of them coming up .
The first ever Cricket Champions League featuring teams from England , South Africa and New Zealand takes place in October .
It was cancelled last year because of the attacks in Mumbai .
Whilst India 's largest ever sporting event the Commonwealth Games will be held in Delhi next year .
Security is a sensitive issue with the sporting authorities here .
They say there was no specific threat against the championships in Hyderabad but they know that following the Mumbai attacks some sports stars are worried about coming to India .
Those fears grew when the world 's most lucrative cricket tournament , the IPL , was shifted from India to South Africa earlier this year .
The men who run Indian sport are now going to have to work hard to counter the growing perception that the world 's biggest democracy is not a safe place for international sports stars .
" This was a unanimous squad decision and is not reflective of the efforts made by the organising committee to create the safest environment possible for all athletes . "
Terror attacks Lashkar - e- Taiba is Urdu for Soldiers of the Pure , and is a Pakistan - based organisation fighting against Indian control in Kashmir .
It has been blamed for several terrorist incidents in India including the October 2005 bomb attacks in Delhi , which saw 60 people killed , and is alleged to have played a part in the armed raid on the Indian parliament in December 2001 .
It was also linked with the Mumbai terrorist attacks in November 2008 , which killed at least 188 people .
Gerry Sutcliffe , the sport minister , insisted the decision had been that of Badminton England alone .
He added : " It 's a decision that 's not taken lightly , but you have to support them , because the players ' security has to come first . "
Ms Smillie said she understood that England was the only team to pull out of the tournament .
The Scots have two singles players in the tournament - Susan Hughes and Alistair Casey .
Welsh Badminton said its three Welsh players are still at the championships , but that the situation is being closely monitored .
The Foreign Office and Department for Culture , Media and Sport had earlier issued a statement saying : " The British High Commission had been in close contact with the Indian authorities which gave assurances that the highest level of security was in place around the Badminton World Championships .

" Systemic risk " is the new financial term du jour .
I suppose that 's good news for all of us in the finance biz .
The previous term du jour , " moral hazard , " had months ago been talked , debated , lectured , explained , and milked to death .
I suspect that a few months hence , systemic risk — the risk of total financial system or market collapse — will have suffered a similar fate .
In the meantime , the current obsession with systemic risk is understandable .
After all , we came darn close to experiencing it , with every money - center bank , most secondary banks , and many tertiary banks verging on collapse only a few months ago .
That close call handed politicians a gold - plated " opportunity to do things you could n't do before . "
One of those things is increasing regulatory oversight of the financial sector .
In particular , the Obama Administration would like to give the Federal Reserve the authority to regulate any Tier 1 financial - holding company — a fuzzy category expected to include all commercial and investment banks , though likely to exclude private equity and hedge funds .
The president 's proposal includes an oversight council , to be chaired by the treasury secretary .
This council would give a key role to the Federal Reserve chairman while marshalling the forces of six other discrete agencies , including the SEC , FDIC , CFTC , and Federal Housing Finance Agency .
But does it really matter ?
If history is any guide , and it should be , the new regulatory regime will likely suffer the same fecklessness as previous regimes , because of at least two intractable shortcomings :
First , the President 's proposed oversight council , despite being pitched as a cohesive unit , is composed of entities representing different constituencies .
Therefore , it 's automatically larded with representatives of different agendas , each of which will instinctively work against each other to protect his own turf when cooperation is needed most .
Second , government regulation simply does n't work .
Nobel Prize winning economist George Stigler , who garnered fame for developing the " Economic Theory of Regulation , " better known as the " Theory of Regulatory Capture , " postulated 50 years ago that interest groups and political representatives will use the regulatory powers of government to shape laws and regulations to their advantage .
It 's no coincidence that Treasury Department heads originate from Wall Street .
Historian and ardent anticapitalist Gabriel Kolko explicated the phenomenon of capture in his book the Triumph of Conservatism .
Kolko was one of the first academics to criticize the Progressive Era — the period of reform that lasted from the 1890s to the 1920s .
Kolko's research discovered that free enterprise and competition were vibrant and expanding during the first two decades of the 20th century , until businesses began petitioning government for regulation in order to stem competition .
Indeed , the 1913 Federal Reserve
Act was the product of a banking reform movement initiated by big banks seeking to insulate themselves from small - bank competition .
An unintended consequence of capture — one on par with stifling competition — is that regulators , by guaranteeing market integrity , dilute incentives for firms and investors to exercise diligence .
Investors grow lax , believing someone has their back when no one does .
It 's a recipe for disaster when you consider that the regulators are always outmaneuvered .
Economist Hyman Minsky , in his " Financial Instability Hypothesis , " noted that banks seek profits by financing activity and bankers .
Like all entrepreneurs in a capitalist economy , bankers are aware that innovation enables profits ; thus , bankers ( Minsky uses the word generically for all financial intermediaries ) strive to innovate in the assets they acquire and the liabilities they market .
It 's a mismatch : an entrepreneurial mentality permeates private banking , and a stasis mentality permeates governments .
Government employees lack incentives to go above and beyond their job descriptions , because government lacks the carrot of profit and the stick of bankruptcy .
The only incentive government responds to is the opportunity to expand its presence into that which is already known ; hence , $ 50 billion is forked over to a shopworn , dilapidated General Motors .
The Obama Administration 's proposal is already as yesterday as General Motors .
Yes , it strengthens firewalls between banks and their affiliates to prevent conflicts of interest ; it imposes new risk - retention minimum standards — 5 percent — in the securitization market , and requires institutions to issue standardized contracts ; and it strengthens the oversight of clearing and payment - settlement organizations .
It also mandates a rapid resolution plan ( whatever that means ) in case these Tier 1 firms threaten the nation 's economic health ( but who determines that ? ) .
Unfortunately , the next systemic risk will not emerge from Tier 1 financial firms any more than it will emerge from reckless savings and loan lending or overinvestment in dotcom businesses .
But that fact fails to temper dreams that it will be otherwise .
In a July 26 New York Times op - ed , a popular Princeton economist ( hint : not Paul Krugman ) closed his eyes real tight and imagined what the world would have been like had the President 's systemic - risk regulator existed in 2005 .
This economist imagined the regulator maintaining a vigilant eye on the growing mound of residential - backed collateralized debt securities .
He then imagined this same regulator questioning the legitimacy of all those easily parsed out triple - A bond ratings .
This regulator even possessed sufficient wisdom to questioned American International Group 's addiction to writing credit default swaps on all those collateralized debt obligations the banks were issuing .
Of course , this Princeton economist 's omniscient regulator is the antithesis of the real - world heads of the SEC , who also ignored Boston investor Harry Makropoulos — the guy who mailed SEC investigators a 29 - page tip sheet , explicating Bernie Madoff 's secretive business practices , lack of oversight , and suspiciously high profits .
The year 2005 was unremarkable , but steady : in other words , a perfect year for writing as many credit default swaps as the computer could generate .
It was also an interregnum from the Dow Jones Industrial Average 's 3,000 - point upswing over 2003 and 2004 and the additional 3,000 - point upswing that occurred over 2006 and 2007 .
In short , the stock market of 2003 through 2007 was very good to many equity investors , and when times are very good , markets grow very risky ( another salient point noted in Minsky 's " Financial Instability Hypothesis " ) .
But good markets are exactly when regulators become most complacent — vigilance being the greatest risk to one 's bureaucratic career .
Imagine the vigilant regulator confronted with this comment from Rep. Barney Frank ( D - MA ) at the House Financial Services Committee hearing on September 10 , 2003 :
I worry , frankly , that there 's a tension here .
The more people , in my judgment , exaggerate a threat of safety and soundness , the more people conjure up the possibility of serious financial losses to the Treasury , which I do not see .
I think we see entities that are fundamentally sound financially and withstand some of the disaster scenarios .
What 's a self - interested regulator to do ?
The answer is easy to fathom , which is why we should jettison our fiat money system in favor of a gold or multicommodity - metal system ( such as gold , platinum , silver , and copper ) .
While we 're at it , we should jettison fractional - reserve banking in favor of full - reserve banking .
A full - reserve banking system would prevent both overextension of credit and loss of confidence in the financial system .
Both actions would remove the financial system from the aegis of a constantly wrong regulatory hegemony and place it under the aegis of a mostly right free market .
But if you prefer the status quo and believe President Obama 's latest proposal is the preferred option , because it puts all our regulators on the same page , I suggest glancing across the Atlantic to our close kin the British , and their putatively cohesive Financial Services Authority .
Then ask yourself this :
Did the FSA shield the United Kingdom from systemic risk any better than our current hodgepodge of regulatory agencies shielded us ?

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
GODDESS OF THE MARKET : AYN RAND AND THE AMERICAN RIGHT
By Jennifer Burns
Oxford University Press , $ 27.95 , 400 pages
Reviewed by Brian Doherty
Sources from the New York Times to the United Kingdom ’s Guardian agree that 2009 is the Year of Ayn Rand .
Fortuitously surfing the wave of Rand fascination is the first thorough and largely unbiased book about her life and ideas by a serious American academic , one neither a personal friend nor a bitter enemy of the controversial Russian - born novelist and philosopher .
“ Goddess of the Market : Ayn Rand and the American Right , ” by University of Virginia historian Jennifer Burns , delivers a smart assessment of Rand ’s life and ideas and how they influenced each other .
On what her book ’s title promises - the connections between Rand and the American right wing - Ms. Burns is less convincing , though she does provide enough data to make it clear why Rand has never really been a “ goddess ” to the American right .
Why is Rand , dead since 1982 , so hot again today ?
Ironically , big government , one of Rand ’s betes noires , is stimulating her sales .
Her more than 1,000 - page 1957 novel , “ Atlas Shrugged , ” sold 25 percent more copies in the first half of this year than it sold in all of last year , shipping a total of 300,000 copies so far this year - tremendous success for a 52 - year - old novel .
Readers and pundits alike look at America and see a world scarily reminiscent of Rand ’s government - choked dystopia in “ Atlas . ”
It ’s a world with a struggling economy where political pull matters more than success in the free market , where the government blithely takes over huge transportation industries .
Ms. Burns says Rand was “ among the first to identify the problem of the modern state ’s often terrifying power and make it an issue of popular concern . ”
Seeking the foundation of Rand ’s ferocious mistrust of government - especially government motivated by altruism - Ms. Burns skillfully re-creates the young Alisa Rosenbaum ’s ( Rand ’s name before creating the “ Rand ” identity when she moved to America in 1926 ) experiences watching Bolshevism destroy her family ’s way of life in Russia .
Rand saw communism purportedly motivated by a desire to help elevate the downtrodden and , as Ms. Burns writes , became fascinated with “ the failure of good intentions . ”
The novelist countered communism with her own moral philosophy that elevated “ selfishness ” - the belief that your happiness is your proper goal and your accomplishments are a necessary means to happiness .
This Randian morality was meant , Ms. Burns wrote , to “ eliminate all virtues that could possibly be used in the service of totalitarianism . ”
Rand came to America hoping to win fame as a Hollywood screenwriter ; movies formed her image of a glorious and joyous America , so different from her dismal and deprived Soviet Union .
She worked various jobs in the film industry in the 1920s and 1930s .
After years of struggle ( though with more help from family and friends than Rand , queen of the self - sufficient , liked to make people believe ) she became a fabulously successful novelist .
Her first big hit was 1943 ’s “ The Fountainhead ” ( the tale of an architect who blew up a housing project he had designed , on the grounds that his rights as a creator had been violated by unapproved changes to the structure ) and then “ Atlas Shrugged . ”
Rand was more than a teller of tales .
She was an exponent of a philosophy she called objectivism .
Ms. Burns explains thoroughly how Rand , through relationships with many other individualist , conservative and libertarian thinkers and activists in the 1930s and ‘ 40s , forged her unique approach to small - government individualism , linked with Aristotelian rationalism .
In later life , she tired of communicating with anyone but her continually narrowing circle of acolytes , and after her affair with her chief disciple , Nathaniel Branden , ended in 1968 , she largely retreated from any attempt to spread or further her philosophy , embittered with a culture she thought rejected all her values - moral , political and esthetic .
Rand undoubtedly was a ferocious defender of free markets and a great lover of America because she saw it as the closest political embodiment of her values .
But she was never , despite Ms. Burns ’ title connecting her goddesshood and the American right , any special darling of modern conservatives .
Ms. Burns ’ own book explains why .
Because Rand believed only in values she thought derived logically from observable facts of reality , she was an enemy of traditional Christianity and the standard American conservative notion of “ traditional values . ”
The standard authorities of the American intellectual and political right have mistrusted , avoided or even hated Rand .
One of the most ferocious attacks on “ Atlas Shrugged ” came from National Review and the pen of conservative hero Whittaker Chambers , a communist - turned - Christian ( two things Rand could n’t abide ) .
Ms. Burns herself notes that Rand ’s ideas presented a “ fundamental challenge to the new conservative synthesis ” and “ threatened to undermine or redirect the whole conservative venture . ”
When the right lined up behind Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 , as Ms. Burns writes , quoting Rand , the novelist realized free enterprise was not an absolute for American conservatives .
She “ knew then that there is … no help that I can expect from any of them … .
I ’m standing totally alone and have to create my own side . ”
This she tried to do , and she called herself a “ radical for capitalism , ” not a conservative or right - winger .
The reader of Ms. Burns ’ book will get a proper sense of where Rand really stands in American ideological history .
Rand ( though she herself despised the word and movement for peculiar reasons of her own ) was not a member in good standing of the American right ; she was far more a goddess of American libertarianism , that radical philosophy of consistent anti-statism and individualism unconnected to conservative traditionalism .
Ms. Burns , the historian , argues that Rand “ can only be understood against the backdrop of her historical moment . ”
Rand , who believed she had uncovered universal truths about human nature and the proper role of government , would have been outraged at this suggestion .
Even 52 years later , hundreds of thousands of Americans are buying “ Atlas Shrugged ” and getting something - whether philosophical instruction or merely wild entertainment - out of it .
As Ms. Burns successfully demonstrates , Rand ’s ideas have remained an important part of the American ideological mix , especially in how she honored the creative powers of American business in a free market to improve human lives .
Ms. Burns ’ readers will see Rand still has the power to instruct on the meaning and scary implications of government growth in the age of Barack Obama .

[ This article is excerpted from One Is a Crowd .
Robert LeFevre also gave a lecture on the biblical Joseph : " First Secretary of Agriculture " ( available in MP3 in Mises Media ) . ]
Long , long before Freud , a fellow named Joseph got himself a reputation as an interpreter of dreams .
So , when all the PhD's of Egypt failed him , Pharaoh sent for this wizard and put to him the puzzler that had come out of his subconscious mind one night — something about seven lean kine and seven fat ones .
A biographical note on this Joseph is in order .
Even as a lad he had shown himself endowed of special gifts , winning preferment in his father 's eyes over a parcel of brothers .
This aroused the envy and resentment of the fraternity — who probably considered Joseph a violation of the principle that all men are created equal — and they contrived to restore parity in mediocrity by getting him out of circulation .
By devious circumstances he was landed into the service of Potiphar , a bigwig of Egypt , which was a long way from home .
One so clever could not be denied .
He rose rapidly to head foremanship of Potiphar 's estate .
At this point , his career was almost cut short by the perfidy of a woman ; that is to say , Potiphar 's wife ( probably a homely one who was " misunderstood " by her spouse ) tried to seduce said Joseph , was repulsed , and , like a scorned female , framed her jilter .
Potiphar dumped Joseph into jail .
It was here that Joseph came into his own .
Among his fellow inmates were two who were bothered with dream problems .
Joseph applied himself to these riddles and untwisted them with uncanny exactitude .
This was remembered by one of the prisoners who , on his release , hired out to the Pharaoh household , and , when he heard that his master was deep in subconscious troubles , he recommended the diviner of the dungeon deep .
That is how Joseph came to be called to the palace .
Realizing that an unpresentable psychiatrist is without prestige , he slicked himself up , even shaved off the insignia of his tribe , and offered his services to the troubled administration .
Quickly he came up with the answer .
There was nothing to it .
The dream , he said , indicated clearly that Egypt was about to experience the well - known business cycle , sometimes called " boom and bust . "
How did he know ?
The knowledge came to him by divine revelation , he said , which was far more reliable than the wisdom of the Harvard school of economics .
At this point , and while Pharaoh was flabbergasted into speechlessness by the positiveness of his prediction , Joseph showed his true mettle .
He threw in a plan .
True , he said , the seven years ' boom was sure to come upon the realm , but the bust was not so inevitable ; Jehovah could be cheated out of it by the simple device of laying up a reserve during the years of plenty .
To execute that job , Pharaoh would have to dig up a capable secretary of agriculture .
The plan and the secretaryship had nothing to do with the riddle he had been called in to unravel , but Joseph tossed it off anyway , and was about to bow himself out .
It occurred to Pharaoh , however , that a mind that had all the answers ought not to languish in Potiphar 's jail .
So , on the very spot — confirmation by the Senate was quite unnecessary in those days — he appointed the surprised Joseph to be his secretary of agriculture .
There being no Constitution to swear by , and no Bible to kiss , Pharaoh made the appointment stick by putting his own signet ring on Joseph 's hand and a solid gold chain around his neck .
For lack of an automobile , an official chariot was assigned to the new dignitary .
No doubt , though the chronicle does not record it , Joseph must have had a big office to work from , with a lot of assistants and secretaries , for mention is made of many overseers .
His brothers probably considered Joseph a violation of the principle that all men are created equal — and they contrived to restore parity in mediocrity by getting him out of circulation .
Henceforth , Joseph had no need to interpret dreams ; he was an administrator , with a plan to carry out .
Since the economy was completely agricultural , his position made him the real boss of the country , the top commissar .
The first thing he did was to pass laws ; without them no plan can work .
And the first law on his agenda was , quite naturally , a tax law .
One - fifth of all that these profligate farmers should produce , during the years of plenty , must be taken from them and put under lock and key .
It is reported that this 20 percent income tax yielded quite an amount ; the grain piled up " as sand of the sea " and undoubtedly there was a shortage of bins , barns , and elevators , for " it was without number . "
In due time , as per prophecy , the depression came .
It is not certain whether this calamity was caused by overproduction or underconsumption , and at that time the learned professors had not yet discovered the sun - spot theory or even the velocity theory of money .
The magicians of that day were without benefit of postgraduate courses in economics .
The tale , as we get it , refers to a " famine " but we are not informed whether the shortage was due to drought , pestilence , or other unforeseeable accident — or , perhaps to the constant sapping of the economy by seven years of heavy taxation .
From what follows in the story , it is quite possible that the dream planner might have anticipated the consequence of his taxing scheme : the abject subservience of the Egyptian proletariat .
At any rate , hunger was upon the land of Pharaoh .
And the people came to the secretary of agriculture and begged him to return the grain he had taken from them .
Did he shell out ?
Of course he did , and at a price .
He took their money , and when they had no more money he took their cattle .
" And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for their horses , and for their flocks , and for their herds , and for their asses : and he fed them bread in exchange for all . "
Still the hunger was upon the people , which was natural , for their capital was all gone , and without capital there is little production .
As we know now , state capitalism had set in under Joseph 's wise regime , and there was nothing for the hungry masses to do but apply for jobs to the state , at the only wage that it was pleased to pay , which was subsistence .
They offered themselves as " servants unto Pharaoh " in exchange for bread .
Then Joseph said unto the people : " Behold I have brought you this day and your land for Pharaoh : lo , here is seed for you , and you shall sow the land . "
In common parlance that means that he had nationalized the land and the labor of Egypt .
The dream plan worked wonders — for Pharaoh and his secretary of agriculture .
There is reason to believe , however , that some of the proletariat were perturbed over a moral principle : the right of a man to his property .
The chronicle does not mention this matter , but it does speak of a migration of farmers from one end of the land to another , by Joseph 's orders .
Could it be that the slaves revolted ?
Could it be that Joseph resorted to the well - known migratory purge ?
There is no statement to that effect , but neither is there an explanation for the shifting of the population , and in the absence of explanatory comment one may surmise .
" From what follows in the story , it is quite possible that the dream planner might have anticipated the consequence of his taxing scheme : the abject subservience of the Egyptian proletariat . "
On the other hand , it is told how a delegation of Egyptians came to Joseph and declared : " Thou hast saved our lives : let us find favor in the sight of my lord , and we will be Pharaoh 's servants . "
Showing that the proletariat had come to terms with collectivism ( since that was the only way to get by in this world ) and were content with whatever security the secretary would provide .
Joseph , however , had to make some concession to private property , perhaps to encourage more taxable production ; he restored to some of the Egyptians the land he had taken from them in their adversity , on a rental basis .
The rent ?
One - fifth of all the annual output .
By this well - timed act of policy , informs historian Flavius Josephus , " Joseph established his own authority in Egypt and increased the standing revenue of all its succeeding monarchs . "
Though the succeeding monarchs and the succeeding commissars did well under the plan introduced by Joseph , it seems ( according to later historians ) that it put upon the proletarians a moral blight , so that when conquerors from other lands came to Egypt they met with little resistance ; those who had nothing to lose had nothing to fight for , so that even the monarchs had to beg the invaders for administrative jobs .
And lots of dust fell on the civilization of Pharaoh .
Four thousand years later , give or take a century or two , there was a land called America .
It was ruled by a president , which was an office attained by a complex system of parties and votes .
At the time under consideration the presidency was occupied by a person called Harry Truman , about whom little was known except that he too had a dream : farmers who should wax wealthy without working , urban toilers who should feed well without paying .
Truth is , the dream was induced by intense political preoccupation .
Having been thrust into preeminence by the Democratic Party , a peculiarly fractious sect , he was in duty bound to strengthen and perpetuate its clutch on the tax fund of the nation .
Now , as has been noted , rulership in this land was dependent on votes .
They were a strange people , these Americans , in that they loved to flavor their gross practicality with the ambrosia of idealism .
However , the fact remains they voted according to their gastronomic contentment or disorder , as the case may be .
Well , the aforesaid dream perturbed the ruler of the Americans very much .
He spoke of it often and loudly , especially when he was pleading for another term of employment .
Finally he too called upon the secretary of agriculture , one Charles Brannan , to decipher for him this manna - from - heaven fantasy .
This dignitary , it is recorded , replied :
It 's a cinch , boss , I could bust this riddle on the spot , but I 'd rather take a day or two to put the answer into protocol , for the sake of appearance , and to lend it a coat of erudition I 'll call in a couple of fellows who majored in economics .
Got to do it right , you know .
Shortly thereafter the secretary handed the president a screed , which in those days was called a legislative bill , embodying not only the solution of his subconscious conundrum but also a plan for putting its purport into execution .
The dream signified , said the secretary , that the farmers must be won to the sacred Democratic Party by assuring them of high prices for their products , and the proletarians of the cities by providing them with cheap edibles .
It can be done .
All we need is a plan .
I have it all here , in the form of a bill , and if you can get that do - nothing Congress to put the OK on it , you can leave the rest to me !
The president was pleased .
The first thing called for in the plan was an appropriation for an enforcement agency , which in itself would provide an easy living for a goodly number of loyal Democrats .
That was fine .
Then , a schedule of production would be presented to the farmers ; in effect , they would be told when , how and what they should produce .
Farmers who produced more than their allotments would be fined ; those who complied would be rewarded with subsidies .
This control over production would enable the bureaucrats to fix the prices , regardless of cost and demand .
The city dwellers , particularly in the months preceding election time , would obtain their strawberries and cream at practically nothing , for which they would be grateful to their benefactors , while subsidies to farmers who did not produce would similarly bind them to the party .
" Of course , there will have to be taxes , " continued the secretary , " for how else can the scheme operate ? "
But , as you know , boss , the voters never associate gratuities with taxation .
The farmers and artisans , if they mention the matter at all , will be told that the " rich " pay all the taxes , and that will satisfy them .
The checks we send the farmers will more than offset the distemper caused by levies on their incomes , and the housewives ' glee at the low price of cabbage will overcome the chagrin of payroll deductions .
At first the Brannan plan met with little favor among American farmers , who , though they had to rub along with an average of less than two automobiles to the family , were rather satisfied with " parity " handouts and were suspicious of any change in the status .
A few years later , however , the depression came upon the country , and in quick order there was a mad demand for controlled production and for prices fixed by political exigency .
The Truman dream , like that of Pharaoh , came into its own by way of a plan .
It goes without saying that the eventual outcome of the Brannan Plan was not unlike that of Joseph's .
Once the overseers of the Department of Agriculture got control of the farmers and the lands of America , there was no way of returning to the regime of private ownership ; there was no inclination to , for the farmers were quite content to swap the hazards of their trade for the subsistence doled out to them by the bureaucrats .
The city dwellers , likewise , managed to live and have children under the regime of fixed income and regulated prices .
Nobody yearned for more ( except a few recalcitrants who were soon made to see the error of their ways ) , and nobody cared for change .
In fact , with aspirations limited , nobody cared about anything .
And the American civilization went the way of the Egyptian .
The retention of DNA records has proved to be controversial Ministers should instruct police in England and Wales to stop retaining the DNA of innocent people , the Equality and Human Rights Commission has said .
Last year human rights judges called for an end to the holding of samples from nearly a million people arrested but never convicted of an offence .
But the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) advised staff to add new samples until the law was changed .
The human rights group said this breached the law .
In December , the European Court of Human Rights ruled that blanket retention of all suspects ' DNA was disproportionate .
And the judges focused their criticism on the " limited " opportunities for those found not guilty , or mistakenly arrested , to have their DNA data removed .
The shadow Home Office minister Damian Green called on the home secretary to bring in new rules on DNA retention .
" Completely innocent people should not be treated like suspects for life , " he said .
Last month , police agreed to delete DNA records it held of the MP .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said ministers were " dragging out " their response to the court ruling and thousands more innocent people could find themselves on the database .
Acpo advice John Wadham , of the Equality and Human Rights Commission , said : " The police are at the forefront of the fight against crime .
" The importance of this fight cannot be underestimated but it should comply with the government 's legal obligation to protect the privacy of innocent people , as outlined by the European Court .
" The government should take the opportunity to clarify the law now and avert future costly and time consuming legal action . "
A Home Office policy consultation closed more than a month ago but ministers are yet to publish a response .
Ministers have suggested setting limits on the length of time suspects ' DNA profiles can be held .
A time frame of between six and 12 years , depending on the seriousness of the alleged offence , has been mooted .
The Acpo advice , contained in a letter that was leaked to the Guardian , said changes to the law were not expected to take effect until 2010 .
' Special treatment '
It stated : " Until that time , the current retention policy on fingerprints and DNA remains unchanged . "
" Acpo strongly advise that decisions to remove records should not be based on ( the government 's ) proposed changes .
It is therefore vitally important that any applications for removals of records should be considered against current legislation . "
Meanwhile , Chief Constable Chris Sims , of Acpo , said : " At the time of the judgment it was made clear to police forces that existing law on DNA retention remains in place while the government consults on a legislative response . " .
In Scotland , DNA samples taken when people are arrested must be destroyed if the individual is not charged or convicted unless they are accused of a violent or sexual crime .
Northern Ireland 's database is administered separately but operates under the same rules as the system in England and Wales .

Is America Hooked on War ?
By Tom Engelhardt
" War is peace " was one of the memorable slogans on the facade of the Ministry of Truth , Minitrue in " Newspeak , " the language invented by George Orwell in 1948 for his dystopian novel 1984 .
Some 60 years later , a quarter - century after Orwell 's imagined future bit the dust , the phrase is , in a number of ways , eerily applicable to the United States .
Last week , for instance , a New York Times front - page story by Eric Schmitt and David Sanger was headlined " Obama Is Facing Doubts in Party on Afghanistan , Troop Buildup at Issue . "
It offered a modern version of journalistic Newspeak .
" Doubts , " of course , imply dissent , and in fact just the week before there had been a major break in Washington 's ranks , though not among Democrats .
The conservative columnist George Will wrote a piece offering blunt advice to the Obama administration , summed up in its headline : " Time to Get Out of Afghanistan . "
In our age of political and audience fragmentation and polarization , think of this as the Afghan version of Vietnam 's Cronkite moment .
The Times report on those Democratic doubts , on the other hand , represented a more typical Washington moment .
Ignored , for instance , was Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold 's end - of - August call for the president to develop an Afghan withdrawal timetable .
The focus of the piece was instead an upcoming speech by Michigan Senator Carl Levin , chairman of the Armed Services Committee .
He was , Schmitt and Sanger reported , planning to push back against well - placed leaks ( in the Times , among other places ) indicating that war commander General Stanley McChrystal was urging the president to commit 15,000 to 45,000 more American troops to the Afghan War .
Here , according to the two reporters , was the gist of Levin 's message about what everyone agrees is a " deteriorating " U.S. position : " [ H ]e was against sending more American combat troops to Afghanistan until the United States speeded up the training and equipping of more Afghan security forces . "
Think of this as the line in the sand within the Democratic Party , and be assured that the debates within the halls of power over McChrystal 's troop requests and Levin 's proposal are likely to be fierce this fall .
Thought about for a moment , however , both positions can be summed up with the same word : More .
The essence of this " debate " comes down to :
More of them versus more of us ( and keep in mind that more of them -- an expanded training program for the Afghan National Army -- actually means more of " us " in the form of extra trainers and advisors ) .
In other words , however contentious the disputes in Washington , however dismally the public now views the war , however much the president 's war coalition might threaten to crack open , the only choices will be between more and more .
No alternatives are likely to get a real hearing .
Few alternative policy proposals even exist because alternatives that do n't fit with " more " have ceased to be part of Washington 's war culture .
No serious thought , effort , or investment goes into them .
Clearly referring to Will 's column , one of the unnamed " senior officials " who swarm through our major newspapers made the administration 's position clear , saying sardonically , according to the Washington Post , " I do n't anticipate that the briefing books for the [ administration ] principals on these debates over the next weeks and months will be filled with submissions from opinion columnists ...
I do anticipate they will be filled with vigorous discussion ... of how successful we 've been to date . "
State of War
Because the United States does not look like a militarized country , it 's hard for Americans to grasp that Washington is a war capital , that the United States is a war state , that it garrisons much of the planet , and that the norm for us is to be at war somewhere at any moment .
Similarly , we 've become used to the idea that , when various forms of force ( or threats of force ) do n't work , our response , as in Afghanistan , is to recalibrate and apply some alternate version of the same under a new or rebranded name -- the hot one now being " counterinsurgency " or COIN -- in a marginally different manner .
When it comes to war , as well as preparations for war , more is now generally the order of the day .
This was n't always the case .
The early Republic that the most hawkish conservatives love to cite was a land whose leaders looked with suspicion on the very idea of a standing army .
They would have viewed our hundreds of global garrisons , our vast network of spies , agents , Special Forces teams , surveillance operatives , interrogators , rent - a- guns , and mercenary corporations , as well as our staggering Pentagon budget and the constant future - war gaming and planning that accompanies it , with genuine horror .
The question is :
What kind of country do we actually live in when the so - called U.S. Intelligence Community ( IC ) lists 16 intelligence services ranging from Air Force Intelligence , the Central Intelligence Agency , and the Defense Intelligence Agency to the National Reconnaissance Office and the National Security Agency ?
What could " intelligence " mean once spread over 16 sizeable , bureaucratic , often competing outfits with a cumulative 2009 budget estimated at more than $ 55 billion ( a startling percentage of which is controlled by the Pentagon ) ?
What exactly is so intelligent about all that ?
And why does no one think it even mildly strange or in any way out of the ordinary ?
What does it mean when the most military - obsessed administration in our history , which , year after year , submitted ever more bloated Pentagon budgets to Congress , is succeeded by one headed by a president who ran , at least partially , on an antiwar platform , and who has now submitted an even larger Pentagon budget ?
What does this tell you about Washington and about the viability of non-militarized alternatives to the path George W. Bush took ?
What does it mean when the new administration , surveying nearly eight years and two wars ' worth of disasters , decides to expand the U.S. Armed Forces rather than shrink the U.S. global mission ?
What kind of a world do we inhabit when , with an official unemployment rate of 9.7 % and an underemployment rate of 16.8 % , the American taxpayer is financing the building of a three - story , exceedingly permanent - looking $ 17 million troop barracks at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan ?
This , in turn , is part of a taxpayer - funded $ 220 million upgrade of the base that includes new " water treatment plants , headquarters buildings , fuel farms , and power generating plants . "
And what about the U.S. air base built at Balad , north of Baghdad , that now has 15 bus routes , two fire stations , two water treatment plants , two sewage treatment plants , two power plants , a water bottling plant , and the requisite set of fast - food outlets , PXes , and so on , as well as air traffic levels sometimes compared to those at Chicago 's O'Hare International ?
What kind of American world are we living in when a plan to withdraw most U.S. troops from Iraq involves the removal of more than 1.5 million pieces of equipment ?
Or in which the possibility of withdrawal leads the Pentagon to issue nearly billion - dollar contracts ( new ones ! ) to increase the number of private security contractors in that country ?
What do you make of a world in which the U.S. has robot assassins in the skies over its war zones , 24/7 , and the " pilots " who control them from thousands of miles away are ready on a moment 's notice to launch missiles -- " Hellfire " missiles at that -- into Pashtun peasant villages in the wild , mountainous borderlands of Pakistan and Afghanistan ?
What does it mean when American pilots can be at war " in " Afghanistan , 9 to 5 , by remote control , while their bodies remain at a base outside Las Vegas and then can head home past a sign that warns them to drive carefully because this is " the most dangerous part of your day " ?
What does it mean when , for our security and future safety , the Pentagon funds the wildest ideas imaginable for developing high - tech weapons systems , many of which sound as if they came straight out of the pages of sci - fi novels ?
Take , for example , Boeing 's advanced coordinated system of hand - held drones , robots , sensors , and other battlefield surveillance equipment slated for seven Army brigades within the next two years at a cost of $ 2 billion and for the full Army by 2025 ; or the Next Generation Bomber , an advanced " platform " slated for 2018 ; or a truly futuristic bomber , " a suborbital semi- spacecraft able to move at hypersonic speed along the edge of the atmosphere , " for 2035 ?
What does it mean about our world when those people in our government peering deepest into a blue - skies future are planning ways to send armed " platforms " up into those skies and kill more than a quarter century from now ?
And do you ever wonder about this :
If such weaponry is being endlessly developed for our safety and security , and that of our children and grandchildren , why is it that one of our most successful businesses involves the sale of the same weaponry to other countries ?
Few Americans are comfortable thinking about this , which may explain why global - arms - trade pieces do n't tend to make it onto the front pages of our newspapers .
Recently , the Times Pentagon correspondent Thom Shanker , for instance , wrote a piece on the subject which appeared inside the paper on a quiet Labor Day .
" Despite Slump , U.S. Role as Top Arms Supplier Grows " was the headline .
Perhaps Shanker , too , felt uncomfortable with his subject , because he included the following generic description : " In the highly competitive global arms market , nations vie for both profit and political influence through weapons sales , in particular to developing nations ... "
The figures he cited from a new congressional study of that " highly competitive " market told a different story : The U.S. , with $ 37.8 billion in arms sales ( up $ 12.4 billion from 2007 ) , controlled 68.4 % of the global arms market in 2008 .
Highly competitively speaking , Italy came " a distant second " with $ 3.7 billion .
In sales to " developing nations , " the U.S. inked $ 29.6 billion in weapons agreements or 70.1 % of the market .
Russia was a vanishingly distant second at $ 3.3 billion or 7.8 % of the market .
In other words , with 70 % of the market , the U.S. actually has what , in any other field , would qualify as a monopoly position -- in this case , in things that go boom in the night .
With the American car industry in a ditch , it seems that this ( along with Hollywood films that go boom in the night ) is what we now do best , as befits a war , if not warrior , state .
Is that an American accomplishment you 're comfortable with ?
On the day I 'm writing this piece , " Names of the Dead , " a feature which appears almost daily in my hometown newspaper , records the death of an Army private from DeKalb , Illinois , in Afghanistan .
Among the spare facts offered : he was 20 years old , which means he was probably born not long before the First Gulf War was launched in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush .
If you include that war , which never really ended -- low - level U.S. military actions against Saddam Hussein 's regime continued until the invasion of 2003 -- as well as U.S. actions in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia , not to speak of the steady warfare underway since November 2001 , in his short life , there was hardly a moment in which the U.S. was n't engaged in military operations somewhere on the planet ( invariably thousands of miles from home ) .
If that private left a one - year - old baby behind in the States , and you believe the statements of various military officials , that child could pass her tenth birthday before the war in which her father died comes to an end .
Given the record of these last years , and the present military talk about being better prepared for " the next war , " she could reach 2025 , the age when she , too , might join the military without ever spending a warless day .
Is that the future you had in mind ?
Consider this :
War is now the American way , even if peace is what most Americans experience while their proxies fight in distant lands .
Any serious alternative to war , which means our " security , " is increasingly inconceivable .
In Orwellian terms then , war is indeed peace in the United States and peace , war .
American Newspeak
Newspeak , as Orwell imagined it , was an ever more constricted form of English that would , sooner or later , make " all other modes of thought impossible .
It was intended , " he wrote in an appendix to his novel , " that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten , a heretical thought ... should be literally unthinkable . "
When it comes to war ( and peace ) , we live in a world of American Newspeak in which alternatives to a state of war are not only ever more unacceptable , but ever harder to imagine .
If war is now our permanent situation , in good Orwellian fashion it has also been sundered from a set of words that once accompanied it .
It lacks , for instance , " victory . "
After all , when was the last time the U.S. actually won a war ( unless you include our " victories " over small countries incapable of defending themselves like the tiny Caribbean Island of Grenada in 1983 or powerless Panama in 1989 ) ?
The smashing " victory " over Saddam Hussein in the First Gulf War only led to a stop - and - start conflict now almost two decades old that has proved a catastrophe .
Keep heading backward through the Vietnam and Korean Wars and the last time the U.S. military was truly victorious was in 1945 .
But achieving victory no longer seems to matter .
War American - style is now conceptually unending , as are preparations for it .
When George W. Bush proclaimed a Global War on Terror ( aka World War IV ) , conceived as a " generational struggle " like the Cold War , he caught a certain American reality .
In a sense , the ongoing war system can't absorb victory .
Any such endpoint might indeed prove to be a kind of defeat .
No longer has war anything to do with the taking of territory either , or even with direct conquest .
War is increasingly a state of being , not a process with a beginning , an end , and an actual geography .
Similarly drained of its traditional meaning has been the word " security " -- though it has moved from a state of being ( secure ) to an eternal , immensely profitable process whose endpoint is unachievable .
If we ever decided we were either secure enough , or more willing to live without the unreachable idea of total security , the American way of war and the national security state would lose much of their meaning .
In other words , in our world , security is insecurity .
As for " peace , " war 's companion and theoretical opposite , though still used in official speeches , it , too , has been emptied of meaning and all but discredited .
Appropriately enough , diplomacy , that part of government which classically would have been associated with peace , or at least with the pursuit of the goals of war by other means , has been dwarfed by , subordinated to , or even subsumed by the Pentagon .
In recent years , the U.S. military with its vast funds has taken over , or encroached upon , a range of activities that once would have been left to an underfunded State Department , especially humanitarian aid operations , foreign aid , and what 's now called nation - building .
( On this subject , check out Stephen Glain 's recent essay , " The American Leviathan " in the Nation magazine . )
Diplomacy itself has been militarized and , like our country , is now hidden behind massive fortifications , and has been placed under Lord - of - the - Flies - style guard .
The State Department 's embassies are now bunkers and military - style headquarters for the prosecution of war policies ; its officials , when enough of them can be found , are now sent out into the provinces in war zones to do " civilian " things .
And peace itself ?
Simply put , there 's no money in it .
Of the nearly trillion dollars the U.S. invests in war and war - related activities , nothing goes to peace .
No money , no effort , no thought .
The very idea that there might be peaceful alternatives to endless war is so discredited that it 's left to utopians , bleeding hearts , and feathered doves .
As in Orwell 's Newspeak , while " peace " remains with us , it 's largely been shorn of its possibilities .
No longer the opposite of war , it 's just a rhetorical flourish embedded , like one of our reporters , in Warspeak .
What a world might be like in which we began not just to withdraw our troops from one war to fight another , but to seriously scale down the American global mission , close those hundreds of bases -- recently , there were almost 300 of them , macro to micro , in Iraq alone -- and bring our military home is beyond imagining .
To discuss such obviously absurd possibilities makes you an apostate to America 's true religion and addiction , which is force .
However much it might seem that most of us are peaceably watching our TV sets or computer screens or iPhones , we Americans are also -- always -- marching as to war .
We may not all bother to attend the church of our new religion , but we all tithe .
We all partake .
In this sense , we live peaceably in a state of war .

Researchers at St. Michael 's Hospital have developed the first mathematical model in cardiology and emergency medicine to more quickly and reliably diagnose acute heart failure ( AHF ) in emergency room patients .
Research findings published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology , have been shown to help physicians diagnose AHF with greater accuracy .
" In Canada , more than 100,000 people are hospitalized each year for acute heart failure while an estimated $ 1.4 - 2.3 billion is spent to manage the disease , " explains Dr. Brian Steinhart , lead researcher and emergency medicine physician at St. Michael 's Hospital .
" Our model aims to ensure early correct diagnosis and treatment , which allows for shorter emergency department stay for these patients and could lead to improved health outcomes and better access to precious emergency department resources . "
According to researchers , the model uses natriuretic - peptide levels ( a peptide hormone released from heart muscle to help regulate body fluids and blood pressure ) and the clinician 's judgement to help diagnose patients whose history , physical or chest X - ray may not clearly indicate AHF .
Currently , accurate clinical diagnosis of AHF in the emergency department is less than 80 percent .
" In many cases , when a patient arrives in an emergency department complaining of shortness of breath , physicians are challenged to correctly diagnose patients , " says Dr. Steinhart , " Our model does not require extensive clinical information , which makes it relatively simple - to - use .
When the result is greater than 80 percent probability for heart failure , it suggests that the physician should treat for AHF and when it is less than 20 percent , the physician should be looking elsewhere for diagnosis . "
The study developed the prediction model from the emergency department experience of 534 patients with undifferentiated shortness of breath enrolled in the Canadian Improved Management of Patients with Congestive Heart Failure ( IMPROVE - CHF ) trial .
Researchers and physicians involved in the trial include : St. Michael 's Hospital 's Kevin Thorpe , Dr. Ahmed Bayoumi , Dr. Gordon Moe and Dr. David Mazer , and Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School 's Dr. James Januzzi .

Niall Heraty is just like every other 11 - year - old .
He adores the Yankees , he plays a mean game of basketball , and he loves more than anything to wind his older brother , Conor , and his younger brother , Ryan , up .
However , Niall , son of Julie and Vinny Heraty , natives of Westport , Co. Mayo , has n’t had the time or energy to enjoy such activities since March .
Niall has a rare cancerous tumor and is currently undergoing rigorous treatment to rid his young body of the disease .
Niall , a sixth grader , was in the middle of an intense game of basketball with his friends in February when he fell to the ground .
A shooting pain in his back caused him to grab his back and drop to his knees on the basketball court in pain .
Niall , who lives in Hopewell Junction , Dutchess County , with his family , was sent immediately for scans .
An MRI revealed a mass on his lower back , which was followed by biopsy , which reveled a cancerous tumor .
Niall ’s father , Vinny , 44 , told the Irish Voice over breakfast last week that doctors informed the family their son has a cancerous tumor that is n’t very common .
“ We were just shocked .
We really did n’t expect this , ” said Heraty , a custodian with the Board of Education in the Bronx .
After diagnosis , Niall ’s treatments began immediately .
“ As soon as the tests were completed and Niall was diagnosed he began chemo to shrink the tumor , ” explains Heraty .
Niall has been undergoing months of chemotherapy and radiation at Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center in New York .
“ The treatments are tough on Niall but he is so strong .
He never once complains , which has made our life and trying to deal with all of this much easier , ” smiles Heraty gently .
“ Niall has a strong and positive outlook .
You could n’t ask for a better lad . ”
Niall found it difficult to lose his hair during the treatments and was most upset when he could n’t go to school .
“ That was hard on him .
He likes school and wanted to be there .
At least now his hair has grown back , and last week he had his first hair cut since the treatment so he is delighted , ” said Heraty .
While trying to cope with the endless hours of treatments , Niall , said his father , focuses all his attention on sport .
“ He is very big into sport .
He misses playing an awful lot .
But he still follows baseball .
He has gone to a lot of games .
If you said anything wrong against the Yankees , he would n’t be too happy , ” laughs Heraty .
“ He has even met some of the players .
He was delighted . ”
Niall was sick at the beginning of his of his treatment .
He did n’t have much energy for fun and games , but as the weeks have passed his body is adjusting and the young sports star is feeling a little better .
“ After months of chemo and the radiation Niall ’s pain has gotten more manageable , ” Heraty said .
An MRI in early August revealed a reduction in the size of the tumor .
This news pleased the Heratys .
Despite Niall ’s rigorous treatments , he still finds the time and energy to make fun of his dad ’s Irish accent .
“ He loves accents , especially mine , and loves making fun of them , ” laughs Heraty .
While Niall battles his schoolwork and his Thursday visit to the city for his weekly chemo session , friends and family of the Heratys have come together to organize a fundraiser to offset the mounting costs of treating Niall at one of the top cancer hospitals in the world .
Although Niall ’s family has medical insurance , the co-pays the Heratys are required to pay and the cost of traveling to and from the city , accommodation when required and several other hidden costs , are accumulating on a rapid basis .
Heraty wants to thank his neighbors and friends for being “ outstanding ” in helping the family out at such an important time in their lives .
“ Our good friends in Dutchess County and in the Woodlawn area , and even people we did n’t know , have made our lives so much easier .
Between babysitting , taking care of our other kids , bringing them to sports and back , it ’s made it so much easier for Julie and I to concentrate on Niall , ” said Heraty .
Heraty wants to specifically thank Dawn Joyce and Assumpta Tanian , cousins of Julie , who were enormously helpful in guiding the family in the right direction when Niall was first diagnosed .

BUDAPEST , Hungary -
It was a night for unnatural beauties .
Contestants showed off breast implants , nose jobs and face lifts as Miss Plastic Hungary 2009 strove to promote the benefits of plastic surgery in a country where artificial enhancements are viewed mostly with a wary eye .
� I think this competition is long overdue , � said photographer Marton Szipal , one of the pageant judges .
� Hungarians used to laugh about plastic surgery but it 's time for Hungarian women to care more about their appearance .
They are the most beautiful in Europe . �
Plastic surgeon Dr. Tamas Rozsos said the pageant also meant to show that cosmetic corrections did not necessarily have to be about oversized breasts , bulbous lips and skin stretched to near tearing point .
� This about restoring harmony ... eliminating asymmetries and giving women the opportunity to have normal features , � Rozsos said .
� Plastic surgery has a bad reputation in Hungary but its mostly due to the exaggerations . �
Despite Hungary having been hit hard by the global economic crisis with the government forced to scale back spending on health services , Rozsos said that the number of surgeries had been rising year by year .
� People for whom this is important always find the money , � Rozsos said .
To qualify for the pageant , the 18 Hungarian residents had to prove they 'd gone fully under the knife � mere Botox or collagen injections did not count .
Nearly all the contestants showed off augmented breasts , with reshaped noses also popular .
One finalist had surgically adjusted toes .
Organizers claimed contestants were expected to show �a perfect harmony of body and soul , � but the three - part pageant concentrated almost exclusively on the women 's physical attributes and the usually conspicuous wishes for world peace went missing .
Miss Plastic candidates were at least 18 years old and included a former rhythmic gymnast , a firefighter married to a police officer , a mother of three and several strippers .
There was a special category for women over 30 .
Pageant queen Reka Urban , a 22 - year - old hostess , won an apartment in Budapest , first runner - up Edina Kulcsar was given a new car and second runner - up Alexandra Horvath took home diamond jewelry worth 2 million forints ( $ 10,800 ) .
The winners ' plastic surgeons also received awards .

The SS fascinate us till this day not only because of their blind loyalty to Hitler , but also because they were ruthlessly efficient .
Below are some snippets about them .
Read on .
Political Intimidation in Kassel 's Opera Square : " Only a Stubborn Mule Ends Up in a Concentration Camp . " ( 1933 )
Prisoners during Roll Call at the Oranienburg " Protective Custody Camp " Near Berlin .
Most concentration camp inmates were political opponents , so - called enemies of the race , common criminals , homosexuals , or “ asocials ” whom the Nazi leadership would not tolerate in the new German national community [ Volksgemeinschaft ] .
The goal was not to rehabilitate prisoners , but rather to punish them by means of daily humiliation , arbitrary violence , and forced labor .
Additionally , camps were supposed to have a deterrent effect on the rest of the population .
The surveillance , torture , and exploitation of inmates was carried out by special SS units , the so - called SS Death 's Head Units [ Totenkopfverbände or SSTV ] under the leadership of Theodor Eickes .

An SS Member Signs the Oath of Loyalty to Hitler
Himmler regarded the SS as the " executive instrument of the Führer 's will " and demanded of his men unconditional loyalty both to himself and to Hitler .
The SS motto “ My honor is loyalty ” was drilled into them as soon as they started the admissions and training procedures .

Heinrich Himmler Views Ancient Germanic Rune Markings in a Palatinate Quarry ( 1935 )
Heinrich Himmler was an advocate of racial myths , occultism , and esoteric ideas .
He founded , for example , the German Ancestral Heritage Association [ Deutsches Ahnenerbe e.V. ] , a group that engaged in pseudo - scientific research projects on the descent and characteristics of the “ Aryan race . ”
Himmler also regarded his SS as an ancient Germanic clan , and endowed it with a series of pagan or pseudo - medieval symbols and rituals .
This photograph shows Himmler ( center ) , SS Colonel [ Standartenführer ]
Weisthor ( at right , above Himmler ) , and others at a quarry in the Palatinate .
At the time , Weisthor was head of the department of early pre-history and early history at the Main Office of Race and Settlement ( RuSHA ) ; he was also considered an expert on ancient German runes .
Weisthor , whose real name was Karl Maria Wiligut , was later unmasked as a charlatan and an escapee from a mental hospital .
He was expelled from the SS in 1939 .
Hitler 's Bodyguard Regiment [ SS - Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler ] , 1936 .
The SS - Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler ( LSSAH or LAH ) was Hitler ’s bodyguard regiment ; it was one of the many specialized groups and paramilitary organizations that developed within the SS during the course of the Nazi dictatorship .
Hitler founded the LSSAH in March 1933 to protect members of the regime and government buildings ; it was a private army under his personal control .
Its first major action was " Operation Hummingbird , " which saw the elimination of the SA leadership on the evening of June 30 , 1934 / July 1 , 1934 .
After the war began , the LSSAH was incorporated into the Waffen - SS and deployed under army command on both the Eastern and Western fronts .

Reinhard Heydrich ’s Mercedes after Suffering Heavy Damage in the Ambush ( May 27 , 1942 )
On the morning of May 27 , 1942 , Reinhard Heydrich , who was then Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia , was seriously wounded in an attack by Czech resistance fighters .
He died eight days later in a Prague hospital at the age of thirty - eight .
Heydrich played an important role in developing the SS into the Nazi dictatorship 's most important instrument of terror .
He was also a key contributor to the " Final Solution of the Jewish Question . "
On January 30 , 1943 , Ernst Kaltenbrunner was named his successor as head of the Reich Security Main Office ( RSHA ) .
The Lidice Massacre – SS Members Set the Village Ablaze ( July 1 , 1942 )
The so - called Lidice Massacre is probably the best - known Nazi retaliation measure in connection with Heydrich 's assassination .
The inhabitants of the village of Lidice , about 500 in number , were falsely accused of having harbored Heydrich 's attackers .
During the night of June 10 , 1942 , German police and SS units surrounded the village .
All men over age 15 were shot , and the women and children were sent to concentration camps .
Then Lidice was burned to the ground .
A worried lot .
Female SS Guards after their Arrest in Bergen - Belsen ( May 15 , 1945 )
Formally , the SS was a purely male organization .
Women were accepted into the " clan " through marriage with SS - men , but they had no organizational rank or function .
Their job was to raise children and manage the household .
But that being said , as members of the SS entourage , women were also called on to work as concentration camp guards and in a range of service positions .
After the war began , the number of SS female aides – initially as volunteers , later as forced recruits – rose sharply .
The photo shows , among others , camp guard Irma Grese ( last row , left ) after her arrest by British troops .
Grese had distinguished herself by her extreme brutality as a guard at Ravensbrück , Auschwitz - Birkenau II , and Bergen - Belsen .
In the first Bergen - Belsen Trial , she was sentenced to death for the abuse and murder of camp inmates .
She was executed on December 13 , 1945 , at the age of twenty - two .
Also shown are concentration camp guards Magdalene Kessel ( second row , left ) , Irene Haschke ( front row , left ) and Herta Bothe ( front row , right ) .
Both Haschke and Bothe were sentenced to ten - year prison terms .
In the spring of 1933 , Himmler , then Munich 's chief of police , ordered the opening of the first concentration camp [ Konzentrationslager or KZ ] in nearby Dachau .
The camp was to provide " protective custody " for Communists , Social Democrats , and other political opponents of the regime .
Soon a network of camps stretched over all of Germany .
After the war began , the network extended into Nazi occupied territories as well .
The camp system was one of the most effective instruments of SS and police terror : political as well as racial and social enemies of the regime disappeared into them for days or even years without any form of legal protection .
The Nazi leadership made no secret of the existence of the camps .
Scenes such as the one shown below were supposed to send a message that inmates were actually to blame for their own fate .
The message in this case was : “ Only a stubborn mule ends up in a concentration camp . ”
People who followed the rules supposedly had no cause for concern .
In March 1933 , Heinrich Himmler ( then Munich 's chief of police ) opened the first concentration camp [ Konzentrationslager or KZ ] in nearby Dachau .
The facility was supposed to provide " protective custody " for Communists , Social Democrats , and other political enemies .
Soon hundreds of concentration camps modeled on Dachau were being built throughout the country .
Himmler had pursued the goal of “ upbreeding ” the SS into a racial - biological elite long before he assumed the lead role in defining Nazi policy on race and population – a position he secured by being the most radical spokesman for state - sponsored eugenics .
Himmler not only recruited " pure - blood " men for the SS , he also took complete control over their family and reproductive plans .
On December 31 , 1931 , he issued the so - called Engagement and Marriage Order , which called on SS members to protect their " racial potential " by marrying and producing offspring with women of so - called equal value .
The SS's " Main Office for Race and Settlement " ( RuSHA ) was established at the same time .
It was charged with conducting racial investigations into the backgrounds of fiancées and wives of SS members , and if the results were unsatisfactory , it could refuse to permit the marriage .
SS members who were married to women of " lesser value " were threatened with expulsion from the organization .

About 70,000 women die every year and many more suffer harm as a result of unsafe abortions in countries with restrictive laws on ending a pregnancy , according to a report .
The total number of abortions across the globe has fallen , the influential Guttmacher Institute says , but that drop relates only to legal abortions and is mostly the result of changes in eastern Europe .
There were 41.6 m terminations worldwide in 2003 , compared with 45.5 m in 1995 .
But in 2003 , says the report , 19.7 m of these were unsafe , clandestine abortions .
The numbers of those have hardly changed from 1995 , when there were 19.9m .
Almost all the unsafe abortions were in less developed countries with restrictive abortion laws .
" Virtually all abortions in Africa and in Latin America and the Caribbean were unsafe , " says the report .
In Asia , safe procedures outnumbered unsafe because of the large number of legal abortions in China .
Most of those in Europe and almost all in North America were safe .
The figures are hard to obtain in countries with restrictive laws from hospitals dealing with women damaged by backstreet or self - induced abortion .
But the institute , which has been monitoring the numbers for many years , is confident of the picture it paints and hopes it will influence policy makers .
" Our hope is that the new report will help inform a public debate in which all too often emotion trumps science , " said the institute president , Dr Sharon Camp .
Fundamental to turning the tide is preventing unwanted pregnancy , but in many countries there is little advice on family planning and contraceptive products are in short supply .
" Women will continue to seek abortion whether it is legal or not as long as the unmet need for contraception remains high , " Camp said .
" With sufficient political will we can ensure that no woman has to die in order to end a pregnancy she neither wanted nor planned for . "
The US has always been the biggest funder of family planning in developing countries , but a significant amount of it stopped under the presidency of George Bush , who reinstated a policy known as the " global gag rule " on arrival in office in January 2001 .
It removed funding from any family planning organisation overseas that had anything to do with abortion , including counselling .
Although European governments , including the UK , stepped up contributions , funds were short at a time when more couples were becoming interested in smaller families .
" It really was a lost decade , " said Camp .
President Barack Obama has rescinded the policy and more US funds are expected , but the process of ordering increased contraceptive supplies from manufacturers and getting them to where they are needed will take time .
Where contraceptive use has risen , such as in the former Soviet bloc countries , abortion rates have invariably fallen .
Worldwide , the unintended pregnancy rate has dropped from 69 for every 1,000 women aged 15 - 44 in 1995 to 55 for every 1,000 in 2008 .
The proportion of married women using contraception increased from 54 % in 1990 to 63 % in 2003 .
However , only 28 % of married African women use contraceptives .
Lack of availability is the biggest issue .
The report points to a global trend towards the liberalisation of abortion laws , which has allowed women with an unwanted pregnancy to end it safely .
Nineteen countries have relaxed their restrictions since 1997 .
But in three countries , Poland , El Salvador and Nicaragua , tougher legislation has been introduced , the latter two prohibiting abortion even when the woman 's life is at risk .
" We have seen an increase in women 's deaths and teenage suicides in Nicaragua , " said Dr Kelly Culwell , of the International Planned Parenthood Federation at the report 's launch .
Camp deplored the exit of the pharmaceutical companies from research and development work on contraceptive products .
" There used to be 13 major pharmaceutical companies with full - blown programmes of contraceptive R&D .
Now there are none , " she said .
Yet there was a real need for products women could use if they were having occasional rather than regular sex apart from the condom , which requires the consent of the man .

for your version of An Owned Life .
Many people think that submissive types should be looked down upon .
They view submission as a sign of weakness .
In my book , An Owned Life , I refer to the impact of societal conditioning on our mindsets .
However , being submissive is not a sign of weakness .
Instead , it is just one following a natural inclination .
Domination is not better , it is simply different .
That being said , I will point out that many submissive types want to play the victim .
This takes someone from a position that should be esteemed to one where they are viewed as whining babies .
People with this outlook fail to see how selfish they truly are .
Everything becomes about them instead of another .
This creates a conflict especially in a Master / slave relationship .
The truth is that everyone has problems .
There is not a person you will come across who does not encounter similar situations .
We all experience financial and legal issues , family , illness , and problems at work .
The difference is how people handle these things .
A commonsense approach leads me to tell people in this mindset to " get over it " .
Stop your whining and do something about your present circumstances .
Being submissive does not mean that you are helpless .
Life issues have to be dealt with .
We are not exempt from dealing with these circumstances just because we chose an alternative lifestyle .
Individuals who fall into the victim mindset are easy to spot .
They tend to want to cry out to others in an effort to gain sympathy .
We read about things in their post online whether it is in a forum or on a blog or in a chatroom .
They will make witty sayings that they put up in an effort to gain the condolences of others .
Naturally , they tend to find people who think like them , thus having a circle of " friends " all sharing misery .
Submission is not about being a victim .
In fact , I believe this mindset has nothing to do with the BDSM world at all .
It is something that is prevalent in every lifestyle choice .
Some people choose to take control over their affairs while others allow them to overwhelm them .
Perpetual victims are never fun to be around .
They are one of the worst forms of psychic vampires in my opinion .
The continual complaining about life situations will wear anyone down .
People like this should be made aware of what they are doing .
There is no future in playing the victim .
Life is just a continual process of moving from one crisis to another .
Meet a victim 6 months later and you will hear the latest tragedy .
This is the way people of this nature operate .
Nothing ever gets any better .
Resist the temptation to classify a submissive person as weak or a victim .
There is nothing between the two that correlates in general terms .
However , it is my experience that many will take the victim role .
These are the ones who need to be avoided .

The rich multi-ethnic polyglot of northeastern Queens extends even to the “ bass car ” phenomenon .
Not only are there genuine 80s hair metal fans still running about – bless their souls – but it seems as though every ethnic grouping here has their own preferred soundtrack to match their fast - riding , look - ma - no - eyes motoring about town .
Traditional Italian - esque “ Goodfellas / Scarface ” composite guidos have their KTU techno and freestyle , a zombified musical form that refuses all attempts to kill it with decent electro ; various “ Queens Shmoes ” – white , black , Asian , etc – really do seem to love Queensryche with a genuine heart that will never be hard - of - hearing , no matter how many pedantic guitar solos it endures ; an even wider ethnic blend enjoys the loud sounds of whatever passes for hip - hop as it coasts through its hair - metal phase right into the arms of neo - disco ; arabica and bhangra beats abound ; there ’s even plenty of that hilarious Mexican style of music with all the accordions in it .
Aside from driving like complete assholes , they share the heavier - than - heavy need to bleed from the ears .
They do this to let everyone know they ’re coming and going , as well as allow those equipped with sonar know their approximate density , speed and distance .
The one exception to this rule are the Hasidim , who prefer to do their peerless homicidal driving in a comparative near - silence – all the better to haunt my dreams as an army of Civil War reenactors dressed like obese Abraham Lincolns and guiding half - wrecked minivans towards my terrified family .
I now share the road with them all , having been a legally licensed driver in the state of New York for almost a week .
But I have studied guidos and bass cars for years .
Studied and feared them .
Not because they “ have a crew ” , or that their uncle owns a body shop in Bayonne , but simply because they exist .
If knowledge dispels mysteries , it does n’t always make fear more manageable , particularly when we ’re giving weapons to people in the form of automobiles .
I would rather they all have guns , for at least guns require some skill in aiming .
Any moron can kill with a car , as can be seen every single day in the United States .
So how can so many people from so many walks of life share this one distinct trait ?
I believe this phenomenon has its roots in the New York City housing market .
Some of the blame can be pointed at the general popularity of hip - hop and the brickwall mastering we hear on nearly everything today ; some can be given to the last twenty years of easy credit , which fuels not only car sales but drives down the price of both user modification kits and custom alterations .
But not all , not all !
The guidos of my youth ( a surprisingly diverse population [ 1 ] ) in northern New Jersey would blast their freestyle from custom - painted Irocs , letting all know that a ) they had money and b ) a working radio or cassette player .
That they lived at home and dated 15 - year - olds was , of course , merely part of their particular life script , even as they passed into the heady days of their mid-to - late - twenties .
What we all knew is tha they liked to move it , move it .
One should no more begrudge them that lifestyle than one could begrudge a glacier for crushing the landscape it travels upon .
They are , after all , merely animals .
To pretend otherwise is to misunderstand the nature of the guido [ 2 ] and its role in American culture .
But a major role has been played by the NYC real estate market .
Consistently high prices encourage a lack of migration / leaving the basement ; after all , renting is “ just throwing money away ” and familial connections can be leveraged within high - rent areas to ensure housing for their children and keep outsiders at bay .
This also ensures that folks without too much going on in the career department have plenty of disposable income for the clothes and the clubs , as well as turning relatively small cars into relatively big deals .
There are a lot of folks just on my block alone who rock the bass car and fight with their parents despite being well into their mid-20s and ( apparently ) even their 30s .
I particularly admire the overall shittiness of the gentleman with the shocker decal on the back of his car , something which never ceases to bring a smile to my face .
He is a poem written in hair gel and ethnic slurs ; a walking , talking , overly - loud private conversation held in public .
I know more about his relationship with his parents and underage girlfriend than I know about most of my family members , and I am both richer and poorer for his inability to even spell “ decorum ” .
That the kids – a term I only use evocatively , since a few of them are older than I – can balance their decaying relationships with their aging families with absurd fights and constant invocation of the regrettably - euphemistic “ N - Word ” against both themselves and their equally - fucked pasty friends is indeed a matter of wonder .
That I mostly wonder why they have n’t died of shame is a reflection of my own limitations and understanding of what it means to be an adult , and I am financially and spiritually poorer for it .
But back to real estate : their parents were either born here or moved to this particular corner 30 or 40 years ago and bought houses .
They dugg in with the dwindling population of older Irish and Italian families and against the burgeoning Greek flood .
Various Eastern European , Asian , Spanish - speaking and Arab populations followed .
I would not be too surprised to find some Eskimo guidos rolling around by Astoria Park in a bass sled , perhaps dragged by bass dogs .
What the children of these diverse immigrants all share is this need for volume .
Hell , some of them ca n’t afford either cars or travel , so they turn their parents ’ homes into bass houses .
On the subway I may call them “ earbud commandos “ , but they ’re merely manifesting their bass selves .
And housing prices rose , as they tend to in this uniquely - constrained real estate market , further penning in this new generation of the “ working class ” , ironically possessed of neither work nor class .
I feel them drive by every day , and each day I am reminded of a scene in the book The Godfather ( adapted in the second film , if I remember correctly ) where Michael Corleone asks his father why he would employ the brutish animal Luca Brasi .
His father says , in short , there are people who walk through life begging someone else to kill them , and that men like Luca Brasi exist to fulfill this request .
And then I think about how , if some kind of strange postmodern fascist movement against guidos emerged , I would likely not speak out if they came for the guidos of all races and creeds .
I would not speak out at all , I think .
In fact , I would probably work the camps for free .
Shooting attempted escapees , prying the gold chains from around their necks , pushing them into concrete bunkers with promises of Axe body spray delousing treatments – I can see myself doing all these things with a smile upon my face and a cheery song in my heart .
A song sung at an appropriate volume for a human being working to keep civilization from falling to ruin .
Perhaps we will find some use for the guidos , and not just as lampshades or furniture or cattle feed .
Perhaps we can use them in future wars , to fight the guidos of all nations .
Blowout hair shall kill blowout hair .
It might help arrest this cultural drift , nudging us away from a mockery written in bad tribal tattoos and sexually transmitted diseases .
Bread and bass circuses , in little bass ghettos , with just enough contaminants in the water to prevent fecundity but without causing too much cancer before their useful working days are over .
I too have a dream .
A bass dream .
I hate them for this bit of self - realization , a deep look into the eyes of my inner bass Nazi , and yet I feel as though I should thank the guidos that have decorated so much of the background of my life for setting me free .
Free from the assumptions of the American Dream , and free from the illusions of civil society and its centrist values .
Free from the obnoxiously obvious lies of voting and churches .
Free from the idea that walking and talking makes something human , and not a doppelganger or a burlesque that breathes and shits and holds conversations with passers - by while parked at a 45 degree angle against a street corner , impeding all comers .
Guidos are the living proof that democracy is a farce , and that any attempt to set people free from the confines of culture and the circumstances of birth results in an obnoxious cage and a debased honor culture so hideously twisted it makes hip - hop ’s calculated feuding look like genuine displays of grievance .
The future lies in a body politic forged into a single hand , turning down a human radio , forever .
[ 1 ]
There were three Iranian guidos , all brothers , who insisted on being called Persian .
These were the days of “ ayatollah asshola ” shirts , after all .
They were also exceptionally vapid , even by guido standards .
[ 2 ]
No longer an ethnic slur against Italian - American working class yutes , it is a category all its own , like “ redneck ” or “ hipster ” .
Like those terms it is both pejorative and descriptive , amorphous enough to encompass any speaker ’s sense of loathing .
As a postscript , I believe I can make the argument that the show Metalocalypse is , in some ways , a revenge fantasy for whitebread hipster types , both against the metalheads of their youths ( back when they were burnouts instead of mathletes ) and against the bass car phenomenon .
A band so loud and obnoxious that it murders large swaths of their fans , and so popular as to be able to kill at will and escape any national or legal authority .
They are both the epitome of the bass car – with billions of dollars at their disposal , of course – and its antithesis .
There ’s no guido - appropriate posing or preening to be found in blastbeats , being far too self - absorbed in their pursuit of “ brutality ” to thread an eyebrow or wax a chest .
Now this is kind of amazing .
Remember those Intel " rock star " ads -- featuring the co-creator of USB , Ajay Bhatt ?
Of course you do .
What you might not know is that the Ajay Bhatt in those commercials is actually an actor .
Apparently , Conan O'Brien made this discovery and felt compelled to sit down with the actual Ajay and pick his brain about technology ... and , er , other things .
Just watch the video after the break -- you 'll thank us later .

Christopher Columbus , Mothers , Heroes & Websites …
Today these are the “ themes ” that are running around in my head …
Christopher Columbus , Mothers , Heroes & Websites .
What do these possibly have in common ?
Well let ’s see if I can make sense of it all … .
Christopher Columbus – Today , October 12th is Christopher Columbus ’s birthday .
So what ?
– well here in the US we celebrate this day – as he is the guy that is credited with discovering America .
If you know this history – he actually made a “ mistake ” and was able to turn it into a “ discovery ” …
Many of you know … my motto is “ There are No Mistakes … ..
Only Discoveries ! ” I wrote a post about that awhile back .
So … Today I have been thinking about discoveries …..
Mothers –
Four years ago today , Oct 12th , my mother made her transition .
It was a total surprise to us all … .
She was a very special person and a huge influence in my life .
I wrote about her last year on this day .
So … Today I have been thinking about my mother …..
Heroes –
As I wrote that article , last year , about my mother – I became aware that I never considered any person a “ hero ” in my life .
If you would have asked me “ who is your hero ” – I would have answered with a blank stare on my face …
But as I wrote that article about my mother – I realized she was indeed a huge influence in my life .
I honor and respect the way she lived her life .
I was so aware of how well she taught her children – not so much by her words ( well she had lots of words ! :) ? ) mostly by how she lived and conducted her life .
Yes she is indeed my Hero .
So … Today I have been thinking about heroes …..
Websites – Today I debut my new design for this website .
( Do you like it ? )
I started this design in January …
I would pick it up and put it down — do a little here and there and go off and so something else … .
There were times I was going to force myself to complete this – then would realize that is not the road I ever want to go down — forcing myself to do something .
I let it go – I am a true believer when the time is right – I will know …
Finally last week it just all came together – Late last night I pushed the buttons and let it happen …
This morning I realized -? my website is make it ’s new design debut on the anniversary of my mother ’s transition .
I did n’t plan it that way ….
but it is kind of cool it has all unfolded this way .
So … Today I have been thinking about websites …..
Put This All Together
So here I am thinking about discoveries , my mother , my website and heros .
In essence I am thinking about my life .
The discoveries I have made through the years ( that some would call mistakes ) ….
The late night chats I would have with my mother as we each revealed the discoveries we had encountered .
This website which for the last 2 years has brought me many , many more discoveries .
After I wrote that article about my mother – I have realized that today if you ask me who my heroes are – I would answer – “ You ” ?
I believe today that this word hero – belongs to every being that walks this planet – as I truly believe “ every person does the absolute best they can do – given with what is going on in their life at that particular moment ”
This website has brought me so many opportunities to meet many heroes –
You who are reading this – the heroes that leave comments , send me emails , ask me questions , submit articles to the blog carnival .
All of you “ heroes ” have influenced my life and has deepened me .
I so very much appreciate you all !
So today , October 12th – the birthday of Christopher Columbus , the anniversary of the transition of my special hero , my Mother -? this website has made it ’s new design debut .
I did n’t plan it this way ….
but I am sure the Universe , my mother and maybe even Christopher Columbus had some doings in it !
I hope you like the new design – let me know what you think …
I hope you embrace the discoveries , which sometimes come dressed as problems and embrace the heroes , who sometimes are also dressed as problems .? 😉

" There are No Mistakes ..... Only Discoveries ! " TM ~ Ellie Walsh
After Senator Tom Coburn , Republican of Oklahoma , this month proposed prohibiting the National Science Foundation from “ wasting any federal research funding on political science projects , ” political scientists rallied in opposition , pointing out that one of this year ’s Nobel winners had been a frequent recipient of the very program now under attack .
Yet even some of the most vehement critics of the Coburn proposal acknowledge that political scientists themselves vigorously debate the field ’s direction , what sort of questions it pursues , even how useful the research is .
Much of the political science work financed by the National Science Foundation is both rigorous and valuable , said Jeffrey C. Isaac , a professor at Indiana University in Bloomington , where one new winner of the Nobel in economic science , the political scientist Elinor Ostrom , teaches .
“ But we ’re kidding ourselves if we think this research typically has the obvious public benefit we claim for it , ” he said .
“ We political scientists can and should do a better job of making the public relevance of our work clearer and of doing more relevant work . ”
Mr. Isaac is the editor of Perspectives on Politics , a journal that was created by the field ’s professional organization to bridge the divide after a group of political scientists led a revolt against the growing influence of statistical methods and mathematics - based models in the discipline .
In 2000 an anonymous political scientist who called himself Mr. Perestroika roused scores of colleagues to protest the organization , the American Political Science Association , and its flagship journal , The American Political Science Review , arguing that the two were marginalizing scholars who focused on traditional research based on history , culture and archives .
While most animals do not appreciate music , a recent study published in the latest Royal Society Biology Letters showed that monkeys , more particularly cotton - top tamarins , do ; and their musical preference is likely to surprise a few people .
University of Maryland lecturer David Teie , a co-author of the study and a cellist in the National Symphony Orchestra explains :
All of the previous studies on the effect of human music on animals has shown that they do n’t give a hoot about our music .
Did we really think that bats would get little tears flowing up their little faces when listening to the ‘ Ave Maria ’ ?
Music is a human construct designed for humans .
Absolutely everything about human music is based on human development and perception , from the speeds of the pulses to how high the melodies are .
Every part of human music is based on human appeal .
Thus ,
Teie set about music that would appeal to monkeys by using specific tamarin calls and manipulating pitch and call duration .
Teie composed two types of music : one type was to convey fear , the other friendly affiliation .
The results of the monkey music might be considered predictable , the music with fearful tamarin calls made the animals jittery , while the music that denoted friendly affiliation soothed them and some even began to forage .
Human music had little effect on the tamarins , with one notable exception .
The monkeys were soothed by Metallica .
There is no specific mention if the music played was from Metallica ’s recent releases or from their vastly superior older collection .

Holden 's Garth Tander and Will Davison have won the Bathurst 1000 , ending Ford 's three - year winning streak at Mount Panorama .
The lead changed throughout the day , but in true Bathurst fashion it all came down to the final lap and it was the Holden Racing Team duo of Tander and Davison who crossed the finish line in front , clocking six hours , 40 minutes and 2.4884 seconds .
It was a clean sweep for Holden , with Jason Richards and Cameron McConville finishing second and Lee Holdsworth and Michael Caruso in third .
Holdsworth beat Greg Murphy in a photo finish , by .004 of a second .
For the Ford duo of Craig Lowndes and Jamie Whincup , their record breaking fourth win ended in fifth place .
It is the second win for 32 - year - old Tander , who last won in 2000 with Jason Bargwanna .
Davison , 27 , celebrated his maiden triumph on the mountain .
Tander says the team had a perfect race in tricky conditions , with rain falling in parts of the 161 - lap , 1,000 kilometre enduro .
" Certainly after the dramas we 've had the last three or four years , to come here and actually have it all go to plan , and have no dramas throughout the race and throughout our lead - up , it just shows what the team is capable of doing , " he said .
Davison says it will be hard to top the feeling he has today .
" This is up there with anything and you do n't just forget about this tomorrow , this is something that will be with you forever , " he said .
The win is the first for Holden in three years and it is the first time a Holden has won since the death of Holden legend Peter Brock in 2006 .
Tander says it is an honour to bring the Peter Brock Trophy " back home " .
" I was driving the HRT car the weekend we were here after Peter passed away and there was a lot of expectation on us that weekend , " he said .
" It did n't turn out , so to finally bring it home is a fantastic feeling and one that I 'm really proud to share with Will . "
Davison 's win helped cut the margin between him and V8 Supercar series leader Whincup to 93 points .
Ford Performance Racing pair Mark Winterbottom and Steven Richards were forced out of the race on lap 50 when their car caught fire after a battery came loose and ruptured a fuel line .
Winterbottom was in the vehicle when the incident occurred , with rival team fire crews helping extinguish the blaze .
Winterbottom was taken from the car uninjured .
SideWiki is supposed to open up the next generation of honesty for the internet .
Regular users will now be able to make comments on any site at all , and webmasters will have no way to delete complaints and criticisms of their site .
Unless you ’re Google , and its your SideWiki .
Until recently , the # 2 comment on Google.com was “ Stop SideWiki Spam . ”
The comment had 221 up votes , just 3 less than the top comment .
Suddenly , the comment is n’t showing up at all on the SideWiki at Google ’s homepage .
( Update , the direct link to the comment has stopped working as well )
What does it say about the service if one of the most popular comments is about how disliked the service is ?
What does it say about Google that they would hide or delete this comment from the results while denying other webmasters a similar ability ?
The SideWiki is an utter failure .
Google pretends that webmasters do n’t deserve – or would abuse – control over comments made on their sites , yet they exercise this ability on their own sites : specifically targetting criticism !
If it was working as intended , Google would n’t need to delete complaints about it .
Complaints would n’t naturally get voted to the top of the page .
Those complaints are as valid a context for Google ’s web pages as any other SideWiki comment would provide context about a site ’s programs and features .
Really though , I ’m at a loss for words .
This is turning out to be an incredibly hypocritical double - standard .
At first , it was just kind of a joke filled with spam and noise , but now we can clearly see that Google wants to play the game with a different set of rules than they ’re forcing on everyone else .

Child rapist strikes again days after being let off because victim 's Christian family forgave him
A judge is being investigated after he freed a child rapist who kidnapped and assaulted another youngster just eight days later .
Judge Adrian Smith spared the 16 - year - old jail after the first victim ’s family apparently forgave the teenager because of their Christian faith .
He was given a community order despite protests from prosecutors and police and went on to rape a five - year - old .
Investigation : Judge Smith , who earns £ 128 k a year , freed the 16 - year - old after hearing statements from the first victim 's father ( photo posed by model )
He gave his second victim a Star Wars light sabre toy as a ‘ reward ’ for keeping quiet .
By chance the new case was due to come back before Judge Smith but he agreed to release it to another judge after Crown Prosecution Service lawyers intervened .
Protests : Judge Adrian Smith
Attorney General Baroness Scotland has been asked to investigate why the original sentence was so lenient .
Today the latest victim ’s father , a 35 - year - old printer from Greater Manchester , said : ‘ Our son was abused not only by this lad but also in effect by the British legal system that was supposed to protect him .
I always thought people who commit such serious offences like rape automatically go to prison – yet this boy was allowed to go free .
He was even allowed back onto the estate where he lived .
‘ In my eyes if someone commits an adult or grown up crime then they should serve an adult or grown up sentence – not be mollycoddled by the courts and told to get treatment . ’
He added : ‘ My son is six years old now but as a result of what happened his childhood innocence has probably been robbed .
Heaven only knows what effect it will have in him in the years to come .
We should be able to rely on our judges to use common sense to protect us and our children .
‘ In this case the judge has let us and in particular our son down .
We wo n’t be letting the matter rest until the judge is brought to book for the original sentence he passed . ’
In the first attack , the teenager lured a seven - year - old boy to a bedroom and subjected him to a horrific assault .
He was convicted of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and rape and given a three - year community rehabilitation order at Minshull Street Crown Court , Manchester , on June 26 .
Questions :
The Attorney General Baroness Scotland has been asked to investigate the case after police and prosecution lawyers expressed dismay over the original sentence
As part of the punishment he was ordered to go to counselling sessions to address his behaviour and was to be supervised by probation officers .
Judge Smith , 58 , is thought to have allowed him to go free after hearing statements from the victim ’s father , who said his ‘ religious faith ’ had allowed him to forgive the attacker .
Immediately after the case Crown Prosecution Service lawyers wrote to Baroness Scotland to try to use the Unduly Lenient Sentence procedure to have the case considered for referral to the Court of Appeal .
The rare measure allows the CPS to request a review of any sentence it believes falls below guidelines .
On July 4 the second victim was playing just yards from his doorstep when the attacker lured him away on the premise of looking for a lost football .
He was taken back to the teenager ’s house where he was repeatedly sexually abused .
The boy ’s parents realised their son was missing when they were alerted by his friend just minutes after his disappearance .
He was found emerging from the attacker ’s house as they frantically searched the neighbourhood for him .
The teenager initially claimed he was working for Christian Aid and that he ‘ helped children who had been abused ’ .
But the boy told his parents what had happened and the teenager was arrested .
The attacker , who can not be named for legal reasons , has admitted child abduction , rape and kidnap .
He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced next month after psychiatric reports have been prepared .
A history of leniency
Kelly Barton : Abused by her father
It is not the first time that Judge Adrian Smith has faced criticism over claims he has handed down an unduly lenient sentence .
In 2007 he jailed Philip Tilston , 42 , for ten years for sexually abusing daughters Emma and Kelly Barton and another girl more than 15 years ago .
But the sisters , who waived anonymity , were furious with the sentence .
Judge Smith also gave loan shark John Kiely , 36 , just five years in prison for building up a multi-million fortune through fear , menace and intimidation .
Kiely charged up to 2,400 per cent interest on loans and used an army of enforcers to collect debts owed by poor families on east Manchester housing estates .
The judge was condemned again after he jailed Adrian Bunn for 15 months and his wife Deborah for a year after they attacked 48 - year - old Stephen Hughes in his own home .
Mr Hughes was severely injured and needed 21 metal pins and several titanium plates inserted into his face to repair broken bones .
The court heard that Deborah , 36 , had ‘ enlisted ’ the attackers , including her 21 - year - old son Craig , to go to Mr Hughes ’s home and her husband , 39 , had ‘ gleefully encouraged ’ the violent confrontation .
In another case in 1999 Judge Smith tried to hold the trial of a girl of 12 accused of being a serial sex attacker in private until lawyers intervened .
The 58 - year - old judge , who has two daughters aged 32 and 30 , lives in a converted coachhouse in Cheshire .
He is a keen traveller and loves theatre and fellwalking .
He became a senior circuit judge in 1996 and was a member of the North West Mental Health Review Tribunal .
' National disaster ' looms as one in five young Britons are now unemployed
Britain is facing a ' national disaster ' as youth unemployment hits record levels , senior economists warned yesterday .
Nearly a fifth of those aged between 16 and 24 are unable to find work - a total of 947,000 young people .
That has helped drive Britain 's overall jobless total up by 210,000 in the three months to July .
Soaring : Despite talk of economic green shoots , unemployment continues to rise
The new total of 2.47 million is the highest in 14 years .
The unemployment rate has jumped to 7.9 per cent from 5.6 per cent a year ago .
The figures lay bare the toll exacted by the recession .
Only a few groups are seeing rising employment levels , including public sector and foreign - born workers and people of retirement age , yesterday 's Office for National Statistics report showed .
David Blanchflower , a former Bank of England official and labour market specialist , said the current generation of school and university leavers is the largest for 20 years , making the recession doubly harmful .
He fears the bitter experience of enterbetweening the jobs market with so few opportunities will leave ' permanent scars ' on Britain 's youth .
Professor Blanchflower said : ' Firms have stopped hiring at a time when there are lots of young people around .
This is a national disaster .
' The Government needs to do everything it can to get them off the unemployment registers .
I believe there is going to be another huge jump . '
A separate report by the respected Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development yesterday confirmed his bleak analysis , warning that joblessness will continue to rise across its 30 members .
Some 15 million jobs were lost at the end of 2007 and July 2009 , and ten million more could go by the end of next year , it said .
At 8.5 per cent the OECD - wide unemployment rate is already the highest since records began , and the institution warns that it is headed to 10 per cent .
The OECD 's Stefano Scarpetta said : ' We are facing a jobs crisis .
This is the most rapid increase in unemployment we have seen since the early 1970s .
' There has been a huge increase in youth unemployment .
We need to prevent a lost generation of young individuals who are not being given a chance . '
Yesterday 's ONS report showed that a record 19.7 per cent of young people are out of work in Britain .
Another 34.6 per cent , or 2.55 million , are classified as ' inactive ' .
This may mean they have given up looking for a job , or are in education or long - term sick .
Economic inactivity across the population hit 7.9 million , or one in five people - the highest since records began in 1971 .
Meanwhile , the number of people claiming jobless benefits rose by 24,400 in August to 1.61 million , the highest figure since May 1997 .
Most sectors of the economy are shedding jobs with financial services , construction and manufacturing leading the way .
As a result , increasing numbers of employees are accepting pay freezes or minimal increases .
Average earnings excluding bonuses increased by 2.2 per cent in the three months to July , yesterday 's figures showed , the lowest rate since records began in 2001 .
Yesterday 's figures will be particularly disappointing given recent evidence - that Britain started emerging from recession this summer .
But on Tuesday Bank of England governor Mervyn King said the likely recovery will be too feeble to persuade employers to step up recruitment .
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said : ' It might look rosier in City dealing rooms but out in the real world unemployment is the number one issue . '
Employment Minister Jim Knight said : ' Unemployment still remains a real problem .
We 've got to keep the support going and not be tempted to celebrate the recovery . '
Unemployment in the regions between May and July was :
Region Total unemployed Change on quarter Unemployment rate
North East 116,000 +13,000 9.4 %
North West 293,000 +12,000 8.6 %
Yorks / Humb 235,000 +24,000 8.9 %
East Mids 171,000 - 2,000 7.3 %
West Mids 282,000 +33,000 10.5 %
East 200,000 +20,000 6.7 %
London 371,000 +42,000 9.2 %
South East 264,000 +20,000 6 %
South West 182,000 +26,000 6.7 %
Wales 116,000 +7,000 8.1 %
Scotland 187,000 +11,000 7 %
N Ireland 53,000 +4,000 6.7 %
The United Nations ' refugee agency is planning to include the Holocaust in a new human - rights curriculum for pupils in its Gaza secondary schools despite strident opposition to the idea from within Hamas .
John Ging , the UN Relief and Works Agency 's ( UNRWA ) director of operations in Gaza , told The Independent that he was " confident and determined " that the Holocaust would feature for the first time in a wide - ranging curriculum that is being drafted .
Mr Ging , a passionate advocate for Palestinian civilians in Gaza who has recently faced increasingly personal criticism and even threats by elements in the Islamic faction , added : " No human - rights curriculum is complete without the inclusion of the facts of the Holocaust , and its lessons . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The draft , to be completed within weeks and then put out for consultation with parents and the public , is built on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which was agreed by the UN General Assembly in 1948 in the shadow of what it called the " barbarous acts " committed by the Nazis during the Second World War .
The one - time Irish Army officer has long been an outspoken critic of Israeli policy towards Gaza , including the conduct of last winter 's lethal military offensive and what he described more than once in his interview as the " illegal siege " .
Mr Ging said the curriculum would explain the genesis , and " inculcate the values " of the Universal Declaration which stipulates that " everyone has the right to life , liberty and security of person " .
He pointed out that the UN General Assembly in 2005 unanimously urged " all countries to teach the lessons of the Holocaust to children so that we learn from history , so that we do n't repeat history " .
Although the UNRWA director strongly emphasised that the de facto Hamas government had not sought to interfere with the agency – which is responsible for the welfare of some 1 million Gaza refugees – other figures in the movement have angrily condemned the idea of including the Holocaust in any part of the curriculum .
Yunis al Astal , a religious leader and a Hamas member of the Palestinian Legislative Council , said last month that it would be " marketing a lie " and a " war crime " to do so .
Mr Ging said the new curriculum would also include " tangible examples " of other " blights and stains in human history " .
He added : " We want to succeed with the active support of the civilian population who want their children to be part of the civilised world and who have no interest in challenging globally accepted facts ; no more than ... they start challenging whether the earth goes round the sun , or Hiroshima or Nagasaki , or the killing fields of Cambodia , or the ethnic cleansing of the Balkans , or the genocide in Rwanda , or apartheid in South Africa ; or , for that matter , the Nakba . "
The last event on his list was the Palestinians ' " day of catastrophe " , the flight or forced expulsion of some 700,000 refugees in the 1948 war which saw the foundation of Israel .
He continued : " This is also part of the frustration here .
There are so many global tragedies and travesties that are learned worldwide .
Who learns about the Nakba ?
Again [ that is ] a very reasonable and legitimate demand but it's not ' either / or ' ; it 's both . "
Mr Ging added that UNRWA wanted to teach children that " those who fight for justice must fight with justice – lawful actions are the only way to prevail " .
" The children of Gaza need this more than children elsewhere , because their daily experience is not giving them the example they need to have , " he said .
He cited the struggles led by such figures as Gandhi , Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela who " eventually prevailed " .
" We also want to teach them what he did when he prevailed , " he explained .
" He did n't seek retribution .
He fought for human rights for all South Africans not just for black South Africans . "
He added that the curriculum would also seek to demonstrate that war crimes , such as those in Rwanda and in the Balkans , can be punished by international law .
" We are not seeking to transform the value system of the people of Gaza .
We 're seeking to protect the value system of the people of Gaza , and that 's why the community will support us . "
He argued that tackling the issue " would be so simple if we did n't have the illegality of the [ Israeli - imposed ] siege ... and the war and all the other illegalities that are the daily life of Palestinians here in Gaza " , such as , " the fishermen not being allowed out to fish , sanitation not working , water being undrinkable , the private sector having lost all of the jobs and the dignity of work , students not being able to travel out of Gaza , sick people being trapped in Gaza .
" [ It ] is a seemingly endless list of travesty and injustice but we can't wait for those to be righted before we also do more to counter the effect of all that . "
Mr Ging said that the human - rights component in the existing curriculum had not been adequate to tackle topics of concern in Gaza , including the illegality of firing rockets , the issue of what constituted lawful resistance , and the effect of propaganda and " anti-Semitic rhetoric " .
Hamas spokesman Ismail Radwan last night declined to comment .
Bloomberg is reporting Consumer Prices in U.S. Increased at Slower Pace
The cost of living in the U.S. rose at a slower pace in September , showing inflation will not be a threat as the economy emerges from the worst recession since the Great Depression .
The 0.2 percent gain in the consumer - price index followed a 0.4 percent increase in August , as forecast , figures from the Labor Department showed today in Washington .
Excluding food and energy costs , the so - called core index also climbed 0.2 percent , more than anticipated and pushed up by health care and a rebound in auto prices .
Rents dropped for the first time in 17 years .
The number of Americans filing first - time claims for unemployment benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in nine months , indicating the improving economy is leading to a slowdown in firings , another Labor Department report also showed .
Applications fell by 10,000 to 514,000 in the week ended Oct. 10 , lower than forecast , from a revised 524,000 the week before .
The total number of people collecting unemployment insurance also decreased .
Compared with a year earlier , consumer prices were down 1.3 percent .
For the core index , prices climbed 1.5 percent from September 2008 after a 1.4 percent increase in the 12 months ended in August .
Food prices , which account for about a seventh of the CPI , decreased 0.1 percent in September , reflecting cheaper meats and produce .
Lower food prices are dragging down revenue at some businesses .
Spartan Stores Inc. , which distributes groceries and runs supermarkets , said lower prices are hurting sales .
Dennis Eidson , the Grand Rapids , Michigan - based company ’s chief executive officer , said yesterday in a statement that he expects weakness for the remainder of its fiscal year due to “ product price deflation ” as consumers “ behave cautiously given the challenging economic environment . ”
Rents , which make up almost 40 percent of the core CPI , fell .
Owners - equivalent rent , one of the categories used to track rental prices , decreased 0.1 percent , the first drop since 1992 .

New York City Landlord Chimes In
Hi Mish ,
I 'm a landlord here in NYC ( as well as an avid reader of your blog ) and I actually feel the 7 - 10 % drop mentioned in the article understates the case somewhat .
Based on what I 'm experiencing , I 'd say that rents are down 10 to perhaps as high as 20 % from their peaks .
Consumer Price Index For September 2009
On a seasonally adjusted basis , the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ( CPI - U ) rose 0.2 percent in September , the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today .
The increase was less than the 0.4 percent rise in August .
The index has decreased 1.3 percent over the last 12 months on a not seasonally adjusted basis .

ZURICH ( Reuters ) - German anatomists plan a new show dedicated solely to dead bodies having sex as part of the Body Worlds exhibitions .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Gunther von Hagens and his wife Angelina Whalley show corpses prepared using a technique invented by von Hagens called “ plastination , ” that removes water from specimens and preserves them with silicon rubber or epoxy resin .
“ It ’s not my intention to show certain sexual poses .
My goal is really to show the anatomy and the function , ” Body Worlds creative director Whalley told Reuters in an interview , adding the sex exhibition may open next year .
Body Worlds exhibitions , visited by 27 million people across the world , have been criticized for presenting entire corpses , stripped of skin to reveal the muscles and organs underneath , in lifelike and often theatrical positions .
Von Hagens has already triggered uproar with a new exhibit which shows just two copulating corpses .
German politicians called the current “ Cycle of Life ” show charting conception to old age “ revolting ” and “ unacceptable ” when it showed in Berlin earlier this year because it included copulating cadavers .
The way a plastinate is exhibited can vary from country to country to reflect local sensibilities .
A vote of local employees decided that one of the copulating female cadavers should wear fewer clothes in Zurich than was the case in Berlin .
“ Switzerland is the first country that already said from the outset that we could show whatever we wanted , ” said von Hagens .
“ Zurich is ready ... but it ’s maybe not so easy in every other town , ” he said .
“ We have discussed whether it is proper to show homosexuality and in what way .
This is a very delicate subject . ”
Von Hagens and Whalley said they both intended to donate their bodies for plastination , but would not leave instructions about how to display them , dismissing this as vanity .
“ I find it a great opportunity to give something to others by donating my body , namely self - awareness , ” said Whalley .
Von Hagens said he and some other body donors even saw plastination as an alternative to burial or cremation , giving them more certainty about would happen to their bodies after death .
“ Cremation for me is hell , ” he said .
Here 's a quick quiz in preparation for President Obama 's speech to America 's students today .
To succeed in school and in life , you should :
a. work hard
b. set goals for yourself
c. take responsibility for your own actions
d. all of the above
The correct answer is " d , " of course .
But every American kid knows that already .
And that 's the real problem with the president 's message , which will be broadcast live on the White House website and on C - SPAN :
It 's bland , neutral , and mind - numbingly obvious .
You can't even imagine a cogent objection to it .
Of course , that has n't stopped GOP firebrands from trying .
In the blogosphere , especially , Republicans have charged that Mr. Obama 's speech will indoctrinate students with his supposedly " socialist " views .
Across the country , parents have demanded that schools obtain their permission before showing Obama 's speech to their children ; others have announced that they will simply keep their kids home today .
But there 's nothing socialist – or even partisan – about Obama 's speech .
If you think otherwise , go online and read the text of the speech or the White House 's suggested classroom activities to accompany it .
One exercise asks children to make a poster of their goals ; another instructs each student to " brainstorm " about what qualities promote personal success .
Not a word about Obama 's positions on healthcare , taxes , or anything else .
And that 's precisely the problem here .
To really learn , our kids need to confront the real dilemmas that grip our country .
No one will learn anything new from yet another bromide about hard work and personal responsibility ; instead , they 'll tune out .
So how about using this week to teach our children something they do n't know ?
Consider our ongoing war in Afghanistan , which appears to be losing its support at home .
Fewer than half of Americans now say they approve of Obama 's handling of Afghanistan , where he has pledged to increase troop levels .
Indeed , 41 percent say they want the troops to start coming home , up from 33 percent in April and 24 percent in February .
Are they right ?
I do n't know , myself .
But here 's what I do know :
Our kids need to be reading , talking , and thinking about the answer .
Some of them will become soldiers one day , of course , but all of them will become citizens .
And they will have to sort these things out for themselves .
What better time than this week ?
Just three days after Obama 's school speech , after all , the nation will commemorate the eighth anniversary of the attacks on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
The 9/11 attacks remain at the heart of America 's rationale for fighting in Afghanistan , where Al Qaeda planned and financed them .
That 's why Obama referred to 9/11 no fewer than five times in his address last March justifying increased troop commitments to Afghanistan .
Unless we root out terrorists and rebuild Afghanistan , the argument goes , we will always remain in peril .
I 'm not sure I buy that .
But I 'd like to hear the president make the case for it directly to our young people .
And , most of all , I 'd like to hear them respond .
That would bring even more of Obama 's enemies out of the woodwork , of course , braying about propaganda and indoctrination .
But any teacher worth her salt would expose students to arguments against the president 's position , insisting that the kids formulate their own .
And to do that , of course , they would have to learn something about the history of the conflict .
How many American children know that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan , for example , or that the United States supported the anti-Soviet mujahadeen ?
How many kids could even find Afghanistan on a map ?
As soon as the president has finished his dull speech about hard work and personal responsibility , let 's get down to the truly hard work of teaching our children how to be citizens .
We need to give them the information and skills to debate and decide the most pressing issues of our time , including the war in Afghanistan .
That 's our biggest responsibility , as adults , and we all need to remember it .

Introducing The Christmas Light Business Kit !
Things to remember when starting your Christmas Light Installation Business
There are several things you should remember when starting a Christmas Light Installation Business .
Here are some of the principles that we discuss in our Christmas Light Business Start - Up Course .
1 . How to take advantage of your existing customer base
You may run a seasonal business during the summer .
Start talking about Christmas lights with your existing customers .
It is easy to use your existing and past customers as a database for starting your Christmas Light business .
They already know you and have an idea of the quality of work they can expect from you .
Remember that people use Christmas lights for more than just Holiday decorating .
Trees can be wrapped for parties .
Gazebos can be accented for weddings .
Christmas lights are an exciting way to make parties more fun - let your existing customer base know that this is a service that you offer .
Chapter 11 in our kit explains how to take advantage of your existing customer base in a simple step - by - step process .
2 . Use high quality commercial lights and clips
During the Christmas Light Installation season , you are busy .
Making mistakes costs you money .
That is why it is important to use high quality equipment .
We have found that the most cost - effective way to do this is by using a high - quality commercial grade clip to hang your Christmas Lights .
This will prevent future problems and will keep you from having to go back to your clients property to do expensive repairs .
In our section on Christmas Light Suppliers , we detail the best places to purchase high quality clips and other light installation equipment .
Using higher quality product up front will save you money in the long run .
Chapter 12 in our Christmas Light Installation Business
Kit lays out the tools and equipment you need to do the job right - the first time !
3 . Before the season starts - Install the lights on your own home
Not only can you have your customers drive by ( you can coordinate turning them on so all your neighbors wo n't start turning you into your homeowner 's association ! ) but you can practice and make any mistakes on your own home .
Word of mouth and drive by advertising beats every other kind of marketing - ask any real estate agent about the power of curb appeal .
Place a sign in your yard with your phone number on it while you hang your Christmas lights .
Be ready to answer your phone and change your phone message to reflect your new sideline business .
You 'll be surprised to see your business grow .
As you are hanging your own home , time yourself to give yourself an idea of how long it will take to complete a lighting job .
Nothing is worse than coming up short in an installation where after you pay your crew you take home a big thank you and nothing at all for buying Christmas presents this year .
Chapter 3 in our Christmas Light Installation Business
Kit explains the various ways you can market you business effectively .
Our Marketing Materials Package includes several sign , flyer , and business card templates that you can use to get your business running effectively with high profit margins .
This Is Great Stuff !
What Else Do I Need To Know Before I Start A Christmas Light Installation Business ?
4 . Build your business to continue year ' round and be innovative in your marketing
There is always a demand for Christmas light installation .
You can call nurseries to wrap their display trees - great for drawing in customers .
Experiment with patio lighting .
Medium base cords and bulbs are great for this type of application .
Call all the local wedding planners and let them know the services you can provide .
Setting up your own sideline Christmas light business can be profitable all year long .
You are only limited by what you want to do and how much time you want to give to it .
As self employed people , we can all use that extra stream of income .
Our Free Marketing Materials package includes all the source Photoshop .
PSD files that you will need to create effective , branded marketing material to advertise your new business effectively .
5 . Build your business as an add - on to your existing business
This Holiday light industry is the perfect add - on for seasonal businesses like , construction workers , window cleaners , junk removal services , landscape architects , painters , roofers , and framers .
The main thing that attracted me to this industry is the fact that this business is extremely low risk .
I have been able to use my current client database to create leads and get contracts .
I have also been able to keep my employees during this season whereas in other years , I have had to lay them off and often they never came back because they found other work !
This business changed all that !
Chapter 11 in our Operations Manual explains in great detail ways that you can use Christmas Light Installation as an add on business to your existing business or how to start another business such as window - washing or gutter - cleaning as a spin - off from your existing Christmas Light Installation business .

Attention : Are You Looking For The Perfect Add - On Business That Makes Money During The Winter Months ?
Do You Run A Seasonal Business ?
Do you operate a landscaping , painting , or window cleaning business ?
There are many good reasons to run a summer business .
Generally , seasonal businesses make quite a bit of money in a short period of time and you get to work out doors .
Even though there is a ton money to be made during the summer months , many seasonal business owners encounter the same problems .
The cash flow dries up and stops coming in during colder winter months .
What this means is that seasonal business owners have to find other ways to make money .
We have come up with the perfect solution which will allow seasonal business owners to make more money during the 90 days before Christmas than they make all year round running their other business !
One of the most profitable seasonal winter businesses is installing Christmas lights for for commercial and residential properties .
It actually fits right in with a seasonal business because business owners can use their summer work crews and market to their already existing client base .
It is an add - on service that will skyrocket your income and allow you to keep your employees year - round !
Best of all , you can tap into your existing database of customers !
Christmas Light Installation is the most profitable business opportunity out there .
I make over $ 100,000 in the 90 days leading up to Christmas by running several work crews .
There are many people who want their homes or businesses decorated for the Christmas season but they do n’t have the motivation , the time , or the know - how needed to do it properly .
Some people just hate climbing a ladder and standing on a roof .
These are the people who are more than willing to pay to have their Christmas lights installed for them .
You can easily charge $ 300 to install Christmas Lights on a home that only take one hour .
In our Christmas Light Business Start - Up Kit , we explain in great detail the process of finding clients and installing their Christmas Lights .
But I 'm A Painter / Landscaper / Window Cleaner etc. How Does This Benefit Me ?
Seasonal Business
Owners need to begin to plan and start advertising their Christmas light installation service before winter even comes .
Starting with existing clients is the best way to do this .
For example , a window cleaner could have a flyer or business card printed and pass it out to each existing client .
Along with the flyer could be a discount for existing clients who have their Christmas Lights installed before Halloween ..
You need to start early .
The advertising should be done before winter arrives .
You can also plan ahead to cover the other logistics .
Hiring employees and ordering supplies such as Christmas lights , clips , and extension cords should also be done early so you get them before the stores sell out .
Believe me .
The stores WILL SELL OUT !.
Many Christmas light retailers raise their prices as Christmas gets closer .
You can save yourself a lot of money by purchasing lights and supplies early .
Running a seasonal summer business and installing Christmas lights fit together like hand and glove .
When one business ends , the other is just beginning !
Best yet , you can work outdoors all year round !
An important thing to remember is that many people who hire painters , window cleaners , and landscapers in the summer months are also keen on having someone install their Christmas lights .
So , any seasonal business owner that decides to install Christmas lights will find that the transition is easy , smooth , and highly profitable !
It 's hard to say no to this amazing business opportunity when there are so many reasons to say YES !
The benefits to being a seasonal business owner are huge .
However , there is one major drawback .
During the winter months there is little or no work and most seasonal businesses are forced to lay off or fire most of their employees .
That ’s why the perfect winter business for seasonal business owners is Christmas Light Installation .
You just have to start planning the business early on and make sure all the plans are done by late September .
This is a special opportunity for anyone running a seasonal business .
Heck , if you do n't like what you are doing , why not quit your job and make the same amout in two month as you do in the other ten !

Auskunftsverlangen gemäß § 34 BDSG
Mein Girokonto
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren ,
die Stiftung Warentest berichtet , Sie hätten externen Finanzberatern , die in keinem Anstellungsverhältnis zur Postbank stehen , Zugriff auf Kundenkonten gewährt .
Diese „ Finanzberater “ sollen dadurch unter anderem die Möglichkeit gehabt haben , bei Geldeingängen Kunden auf Anlagemöglichkeiten hinzuweisen .
Ihr Unternehmen hat dies im Kern bestätigt , aber einen Verstoß gegen Datenschutzbestimmungen nicht erkennen wollen .
Ich mache hiermit meinen Auskunftsanspruch gemäß § 34 BDSG geltend und bitte Sie um Beantwortung folgender Fragen :
1. Welche Daten zu meinem Giro- oder Postcardkonten haben Sie an Finanzberater oder sonstige Dritte herausgegeben ?
2 . Wer war der Empfänger dieser Daten ?
Ich erwarte keine schwammigen Angaben , sondern fordere Sie auf , konkret zu benennen , welcher „ Finanzberater “ oder sonstige Dritte wann welche Daten ( Umsätze , Kontostände etc. ) zu meiner Bankverbindung abgefragt bzw .
auf sonstige Weise erhalten hat .
Für die Antwort setze ich eine Frist bis zum 3 . November 2009 .
Sollte die Antwort nicht zufriedenstellend ausfallen , behalte ich mir vor , den Auskunftsanspruch gerichtlich geltend zu machen .
Abschließend weise ich darauf hin , dass ich eine Übermittlung von Zahlungsdaten meiner Bankverbindung an Personen , die noch nicht einmal bei der Postbank angestellt sind , als grobe Verletzung des Bankvertrages ansehe .
Insbesondere kann ich mich nicht erinnern , mein Einverständnis zu derartigen Praktiken gegeben zu haben , schon gar nicht für Werbezwecke ( um anderes handelt es sich ja nicht ) .
Hiermit widerspreche ich einer solchen Praxis auch ausdrücklich .
Sollten
Sie sich auf ein vermeintliches Einverständnis meinerseits berufen wollen , widerrufe ich diese eventuelle Erklärung hiermit .
Bitte teilen
Sie mir mit , wie sie die Vertraulichkeit meiner Kontodaten künftig gewährleisten wollen .

They were both women's wear collections showing yesterday in Paris but they could n't have been more different – and not just because of the clothes .
Models wearing spring / summer designs by Emanuel Ungaro and Dries Van Noten took to the catwalk : one a celebrity - led aesthetic that was obvious to the point of banality ; the other complex , modern and highly personal .
The relationship between fashion and celebrity took on a new dimension when the esteemed house of Emanuel Ungaro showed its collection under the guidance of their newly installed artistic director , Lindsay Lohan .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Lohan has taken on this role in partnership with the Spanish designer Estrella Archs , a 35 - year - old graduate of Central Saint Martins school of fashion .
" It will be an explosive combination , " Ungaro 's chief executive , Mounir Moufarrige , has previously told trade paper Women 's Wear Daily .
Moufarrige is clearly not averse to such publicity - courting tactics .
And Lohan has not disappointed where that is concerned at least .
The 23 - year - old tabloid darling has also been playing publicist , busily tweeting friends – Lily Allen , Charlotte Ronson and Miley Cyrus among them – invites to the show .
However , the managerial powers that be at Ungaro preferred the front row to be a celebrity - free zone , perhaps in a bid to ensure nothing could detract from the main event .
Given the pyrotechnic build - up , what was a somewhat stoney - faced audience , gathered to see the crème de la crème of international design talent , to make of the clothes that Lohan had been involved in creating ?
Subtlety was not the issue here .
Instead , a body - conscious silhouette that was ultra-short throughout and embellished with sequinned or printed hearts signified the desire to attract a younger , cooler customer to the brand – just like Ms Lohan herself .
Vibrant colour , including most prominently hot pink , ultraviolet and flame , added impact and so too did oversized sunglasses , the lenses of which were studded with crystal .
It was entertaining , certainly , but quite what any of it had to do with a name that once stood proudly for bourgeois elegance and , even more so , Parisian sophistication is less clear .
Emanuel Ungaro , who trained under the hugely revered couturier Cristobal Balenciaga , founded his house in 1965 and retired in 2004 .
A year later , the company was sold to American entrepreneur Asim Abdullah .
Later in the day , the Belgian designer Dries Van Noten showed his collection , which could n't have been more different in flavour .
" The authenticity of local , generational , ethnic crafts , techniques and fabrics inform and define urban and occidental forms , " read the show notes , neatly summing up what this hugely successful , still independently owned designer means to an unusually loyal customer .
Van Noten and his team scour the planet in search of the finest ethnic prints and embroideries imaginable and then apply their considerable pattern - cutting skills to ensure an up - to - date , metropolitan and , this time , very Gallic end result .
Where the new Ungaro aesthetic was uber - simplified , this was hugely complex but never overwrought , luxurious but never ostentatiously so .
In particular , colour shone : saffron and canary yellow , iris , emerald and midnight blue was contrasted with softer shades of putty , ochre and dusty rose .
A man who worked in a US nursing home has been crowned king of Rwenzururu in his home country of Uganda .
Charles Wesley Mumbere , who went to the US to study in 1984 , told no - one of his royal heritage for more than 25 years .
Emma North reports .
I was on a long road trip last week and , feeling rather drowsy , stopped at a convenience store for some coffee and refreshments .
As I walked up and down the aisles to find something to munch on for the next leg of the trip , I discovered nothing that seemed to be real food on any of the shelves .
So I thought I would at least buy some chewing gum , something I used to do decades ago when gum only cost a penny a stick .
I fondly remembered the refreshing taste of Wrigley 's Doublemint , Juicy Fruit or Spearmint gum .
Reading the fine print on the gum labels ( a habit I always urged my patients to adopt whenever making purchases in grocery stores ) , I was annoyed and a bit alarmed to find that NONE of the 20 flavors had good old dextrose or sucrose in them .
Instead , 100 % of the choices contained , as their sweetener , a synthetic chemical called aspartame , AKA , NutraSweet / Equal / Spoonful .
Now I have read the book Excitotoxins : The Taste that Kills , written by Russell Blaylock , MD ( http://www.russellblaylockmd.com), one of the neuroscientists who has thoroughly studied the toxicities of the common food additives aspartame and monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) .
I have also seen the sobering video documentary about aspartame poisoning entitled : Sweet Misery : A Poisoned World , which proves without any doubt how dangerous this synthetic sweetener can be .
( You can order a copy by emailing . )
Aspartame , which is in thousands of processed food products that are usually labeled " lite " or " diet " products , was synthesized in 1965 by a G. D. Searle chemist who , when he was trying to create an anti-ulcer drug , combined two amino acids , aspartic acid and phenylalanine and found that the resulting dipeptide ( a molecule consisting of two amino acids ) had an intensely sweet taste to the tongue .
Searle soon saw aspartame as a product that could compete in the low calorie food industry and obtained , in 1974 , FDA approval for its use in dry foods .
However the FDA approval was rescinded within 6 months because of toxic reactions and widespread concerns by a number of scientists .
These scientists knew that aspartame was a lethal poison !
In fact , in a 1996 report compiled from 10,000 consumer complaints obtained during the pre-marketing testing period , the FDA listed 92 aspartame - related symptoms , ranging from seizures to death !
Still , the tenacious Searle , led by its cunning management team , refused to give up its effort to obtain FDA approval and denied that they had a sweet poison on their hands .
Suffice it to say , I passed on the chemically - contaminated chewing gum .
I have learned to avoid swallowing synthetic flavor enhancers ( or other chemicals in food ) whenever I am able , preferring to use natural , unrefined and unbleached table sugar if I feel the need to sweeten tea or coffee .
Understanding the chemical breakdown products of aspartame informed my decision long ago and will help the readers to try to break their diet pop habits also .
It is my professional duty to warn .
Each molecule of NutraSweet , when it reaches a temperature of 86 degrees F ( recall that the body 's normal temperature is 98.6 and warehouses in the summer 's sun can reach temperatures far higher than that ) ) breaks down into its two amino acids ( a molecule each of phenylalanine and aspartic acid , both excitotoxins ) and a molecule of methanol ( wood alcohol ! ) which then metabolizes into formaldehyde ( embalming fluid and a known carcinogen ) , formic acid ( the acid that causes the intense itching from the prickles of burning weed ) and diketopiperazine ( a known carcinogen ) .
Perhaps a small amount of any of these toxins can be tolerated by some people , especially those who are well nourished , but I would n't want to take the chance , for there is too much evidence for its being a poison .
The long list of neurodegenerative , psychological and other health problems aspartame can cause can be found at :
They include seizures , multiple sclerosis , headaches , lupus , insomnia , fibromyalgia , arthritis , depression , anxiety and dozens more .
If that is n't enough to convince readers to gradually withdraw ( Diet Coke is also addicting ) from your NutraSweet habit , it might give you extra motivation if you recall the list of evil geniuses listed above that have played a part in this tragedy .
There , you 've been warned .

I. Introduction
1 . The present report is submitted in accordance with General Assembly resolution 62/168 , in which the Assembly requested the Secretary - General to submit to it at its sixty - third session a comprehensive report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
2 . The report is intended to reflect the broader patterns and trends in the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran , based on international treaty obligations , and includes observations made by treaty monitoring bodies and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council .
While the concerns identified in the resolution are given special focus , the report also includes a section on economic , social and cultural rights in order to present a picture of the entire spectrum of civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
II .
Legal and institutional framework of the Islamic Republic
a. Legal Framework
3 . The 1979 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran guarantees a wide range of human rights and fundamental freedoms .
However , in practice there are a number of serious impediments to the full protection of human rights and the independent functioning of the different institutions of the State .
4 . The Iranian Constitution contains a comprehensive chapter on rights of the people encompassing civil and political rights as well as economic , social and cultural rights : non-discrimination ( art. 19 ) , equality before the law ( art. 20 ) , women ’s rights ( art. 21 ) , the right to human dignity ( art. 22 ) , freedom of belief ( art. 23 ) , freedom of the press ( art. 24 ) , secrecy of communication ( art. 25 ) , freedom of association ( art. 26 ) , freedom of assembly ( art. 27 ) , the right to work ( art. 28 ) , welfare rights ( art. 29 ) , the right to education ( art. 30 ) , the right to housing ( art. 31 ) , arbitrary arrest ( art. 32 ) , the right to residence ( art. 33 ) , the right to recourse to the courts ( art. 34 ) , the right to counsel ( art. 35 ) , sentencing in accordance with the law ( art. 36 ) , the presumption of innocence ( art. 37 ) , the prohibition of torture ( art. 38 ) , the rights of arrested persons ( art. 39 ) , limitation of rights based on public interest ( art. 40 ) , the right to citizenship ( art. 41 ) and naturalization ( art. 42 ) .
5 . In an effort to facilitate judicial enforcement of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution , the Government has developed complementary legislation on “ citizens ’ rights ” aimed at providing the courts with a new enforcement tool .
The bill was passed by Parliament and approved by the Guardian Council on 4 May 2005 .
On 22 May 2008 , it was published in the Official Gazette and given legal effect .
b. Institutional framework
8 . While the Constitution provides for a separation of powers between the executive , legislative and judicial functions , there are a number of institutional constraints on their independent functioning and ability to protect human rights .
9 . Despite the separation of powers provided for in article 57 of the Constitution , the Supreme Leader , currently Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , supervises the executive , legislative and judicial branches and other key institutions ( E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.3 , para . 12 ) .
This is reinforced by the system of advisory councils provided for in the Constitution .
The Guardian Council is composed of six theologians appointed by the Supreme Leader and six jurists nominated by the judiciary .
It has the power to veto the bills passed by Parliament if it views them as being inconsistent with the Constitution and sharia law .
The Expediency Council serves as an advisory body for the Supreme Leader with an ultimate adjudicating power in disputes over legislation between Parliament and the Guardian Council .
The Assembly of Experts , comprising clerics elected through a general election , has the power to appoint and remove the Supreme Leader .
10 . The Supreme Leader appoints the head of the judiciary who in turn appoints the head of the Supreme Court and the Chief Public Prosecutor .
The Iranian judicial system has three tiers : regular civil and criminal courts are overseen by courts of appeal that are in turn are supervised by the Supreme Court .
There are specialized courts at different levels , such as the administrative court , family courts and juvenile courts .
There are also special public and revolutionary courts that try certain categories of offences , including crimes against national security and narcotics smuggling .
Decisions rendered in revolutionary courts can be appealed , except for sentences of less than three months ’ imprisonment and fines under 500,000 rials .
Special courts handle cases involving military personnel and the clergy .
The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention , during its visit in 2003 , raised concerns about the impact of such courts on the principle of equality before the law .
The Working Group called for their functions to be transferred to the ordinary courts .
11 . The Working Group also noted that the abolition of prosecutors between 1995 and 2002 was one of the main reasons for the malfunctioning of the justice system ( E/CN.4/2004/3/Add.2 and Corr.1 ) .
Prosecutors were reintroduced to the system in 2002 ; however they remain functionally part of the judiciary under the supervision of the head of the judiciary and do not exercise a fully independent role .
12 . A further institutional problem noted in section IV below is the enforcement of directives issued by the head of the judiciary , for instance the prohibition on stoning and public executions .
Iranian judicial authorities informed the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) that these circulars are intended as interim measures until the passage of new laws .
They also informed OHCHR that there are now “ supervisory bodies ” at the lower levels of the judiciary , particularly in the regions , to ensure greater consistency in the application of such rules .
13 .
There are several other institutional mechanisms that provide opportunities for citizens to seek redress .
Article 174 of the Constitution provides for a National General Inspectorate under the supervision of the head of the judiciary that supervises the proper conduct of affairs and the correct implementation of laws by the administrative organs of the Government .
The Inspectorate reportedly handles individual complaints and is somewhat akin to an ombudsman system .
Under article 90 of the Constitution , the Parliament can also examine and investigate written complaints by the public against its own work and the work of the executive and judicial branches .
In addition , there are quasi- judicial institutions , including arbitration and dispute settlement councils , which settle large volumes of cases of a non-judicial or less complicated nature and increase the public ’s participation in and contribution to the proceedings .
Moreover , the Islamic Human Rights Commission , established in 1996 , is a consultative body composed of representatives of the Government and the judiciary that monitors the human rights situation in the country .
It has not been recognized by the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions as complying with the Principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights ( the Paris Principles ) .
In addition , the Islamic Republic of Iran has established a human rights headquarters to facilitate international cooperation and to coordinate Government bodies in human rights - related matters .
III .
Economic , social and cultural rights
14 . The Islamic Republic of Iran has made gains over the past decade or more in the area of economic , social and cultural rights , although significant disparities remain between urban centres and less - developed regions .
Since the 1979 revolution , the Government has pursued socio-economic policies centred on Islamic values , which focus very much on the redistribution of wealth and poverty reduction .
15 . While the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , it has not reported to the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights since 1993 .
The Committee raised concerns about the treatment of minority groups , discrimination between men and women , and legislation and policies on cultural freedom ( E/C.12/1993/7 ) .
16 . According to the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report for 2007/2008 , the human development index of the Islamic Republic of Iran rose from 0.649 in 1991 to 0.759 in 2005 .
This largely reflected increases in per capita income and the allocation of a large proportion of the public budget to social activities .
A review of the country ’s performance in meeting the Millennium Development Goals found that the percentage of the population living on less than $ 1 a day had decreased from 0.9 per cent in 1999 to 0.2 per cent in 2005 ; the percentage living on less than $ 2 a day had also declined , from 7.3 per cent in 1999 to 3.1 per cent in 2005 .
Those trends have reportedly slowed during recent years owing to high inflation and increases in consumer prices , but those factors have been offset to some degree by State support .
The proportion of underweight children decreased from 15.8 per cent in 1991 to 5 per cent in 2004 .
17 . The Islamic Republic of Iran has also shown greatly improved results in the education sector , while challenges include a significant rise in the school - age population and the inadequate provision of facilities in rural areas .
Net enrolment in primary education steadily increased , from 85 per cent in 1990 to 98 per cent in 2005 .
In the same period , primary school dropout rates decreased from 13 per cent to 6.6 per cent .
Literacy rates among 15 - to 24 - year - old men and women also increased and progressively equalized , rising from 92.2 and 81.1 per cent respectively in 1990 to 98.1 and 96.7 per cent in 2005 .
18 . Those demographics make employment an important challenge for the Government , with an annual demand for about 800,000 jobs among the younger generation .
Unemployment among women is especially acute and , with increased female university enrolment , rose from 26.8 per cent in 1996 to 40.6 per cent in 2001 .
19 .
In the field of health , the expansion of health facilities , particularly for primary health care , has led to significant improvement in life expectancy , which rose from 64.8 years for men and 65.8 years for women in 1991 to 70.5 and 72.8 years respectively in 2004 .
The under - 5 mortality rate also decreased , from 44 per 1,000 births in 1991 to 36 per 1,000 births in 2001 .
Maternal mortality due to complications in delivery was also reduced , from 54 to 37 per 100,000 live births during the same period .
The proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel increased to about 97.3 per cent .
20 .
These positive achievements are offset , however , by regional disparities within the country .
In terms of the human development index , there is a gap of more than 2 percentage points between the most and least developed provinces .
This appears to be driven primarily by income disparities due to a lack of employment opportunities , which in turn are contributing to internal migration from the rural areas to the cities .
Disparities are also recorded along gender lines , and these are analysed in more detail in section IV.E. Disaggregated data were not available on minority groups , although discrimination was reported against the Baha ’i community ; the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and the special procedures mandate - holders have previously expressed concern in this regard .
IV .
Civil and political rights
21 . The past year has seen both positive and negative developments in the area of civil and political rights .
Local human rights activists have continued to engage in strong advocacy on human rights issues , increasing public awareness and influencing the decision - making process in various State institutions such as the Parliament .
During past years , a public platform was created for debates on human rights issues in the Islamic Republic of Iran , including in the context of general elections .
As described in the relevant sections of the present report , the Iranian authorities have also taken positive steps that suggest responsiveness to local and international concerns on such issues as the death penalty for juveniles , stoning and public executions , although these have not been fully addressed .
Whereas steps were taken in Parliament to review legislative provisions that discriminate against women , there is still much room for improvement in this area .
22 . Some negative trends have also been reported , including an increase in rights violations targeting women , university students , teachers , workers and other activist groups .
Ongoing harassment against human rights defenders , including women ’s rights activists , has been reported .
2
The independent media have also experienced tightened restrictions , with numerous publications suspended .
While two Iranian - American dual nationals detained in 2007 have been released on bail , there were further high - profile arrests of members of the Baha ’i community .
The Iranian authorities state that those cases relate to espionage and national security concerns .
23 .
The death penalty continued to be widely applied , including in some cases involving juveniles .
There were at least some cases of stoning and public execution , despite moves by the authorities to curb such practices .
Cases of amputation and flogging and suspicious deaths and suicides of prisoners while in custody were also reported .
The information available on each of the thematic concerns identified in General Assembly resolution 62/168 is summarized in the following sections .
a. Torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , including flogging and amputations
24 .
As noted above , article 38 of the Constitution prohibits torture , however , the Penal Code does not contain a clear definition of torture as a specific criminal offence .
It was reported that the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment was submitted and approved by the sixth Parliament on 15 December 2002 , however it was rejected by the Guardian Council , reportedly because of perceived conflicts with Islamic rules and principles .
25 . The Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment has sent a large number of communications to the Iranian authorities concerning serious allegations of torture .
In 2007 alone , he sent 24 joint communications and one urgent appeal .
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of torture in most of these cases and responded that fair trials had been conducted with commensurate sentences issued .
26 . Amputation and corporal punishment , although justified by the authorities as Islamic punishments , remain a serious cause for concern .

When the last periodic report of the Islamic Republic of Iran under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was considered in 1993 , the Human Rights Committee concluded that the application of extremely severe punishment , such as flogging , stoning and amputation , was not compatible with the provisions of article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party .
In its concluding observations in 2005 , the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed its deep regret that : … under existing laws , persons below the age of 18 who have committed a crime can be subjected to corporal punishment and sentenced to various types of torture or other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , such as amputation , flogging or stoning , which are systematically imposed by judicial authorities …
( CRC/C/15/Add.254 , para. 45 ) .
27 .
An Iranian news agency reported that the hands of four people had been cut off in the city of Mashad .
In addition , on 10 January 2007 , the same news agency quoted the chief of the judiciary in the western city of Kermanshah as saying that soon there would be a number of limb amputations in public in connection with robberies in the province .
Furthermore , it was reported that those accused of homosexual acts were routinely flogged and threatened with execution .
28 . The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention , during its visit from 15 to 27 February 2003 , noted the widespread use of solitary confinement and “ incommunicado ” imprisonment for its own sake , not for traditional disciplinary
detainee in Marivan was held in a cell measuring 1 square metre , was beaten and was barely fed .
He was also repeatedly hung by his hands in a room filled with sewage and excrement and forced to keep his head lifted in order to avoid drowning .
On 3 April 2007 , the Special Rapporteur sent another communication regarding five men who had allegedly confessed under torture to a number of crimes that had taken place in March 2006 .
Reports claimed that the detainees had been branded with a red - hot iron , subjected to broken bones in their hands and feet and tortured by an electric drill applied to their limbs .
In another case raised by the Special Rapporteur on 1 June 2007 , an advocate of linguistic and social rights for Iranians of Azerbaijani ethnicity from the Khoy region is alleged to have been tortured , resulting in extensive bruising on his torso and broken ribs .
The prisoner ’s mother was informed he had been executed and was instructed to collect the body at the prison .
Upon arrival , she was informed he had not yet been executed , but she was denied visitation rights .
It is reported that during a nationwide crackdown on “ immoral behaviours ” in May 2007 , police raided a private party in Esfahan , arresting 87 persons , including 4 women and at least 8 people whom they accused of wearing the clothing of the opposite sex .
It was reported that police stripped many of them to the waist in the street and beat them until their backs or faces were bloody .
Twenty - four of those arrested were tried for “ facilitating immorality and sexual misconduct ” , as well as possession and consumption of alcohol .
In June 2007 a court in Esfahan found all of them guilty of various combinations of those charges .
Most were sentenced to up to 80 lashes and fines of 10 million to 50 million riyals ( $ 1,000 - $ 5,000 ) .
The verdicts are under appeal and have not yet been enforced .
However , the Iranian authorities informed OHCHR that such imprisonment was allowed only in exceptional cases and was limited to very serious crimes , such as murder and espionage , in accordance with the Code of Penal Procedures .
The duration of solitary confinement has been reduced from one month to 20 days .
b. Death penalty and public executions
29 . The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention noted that the Iranian Penal Code retains five categories of crimes to which diverse punishments can be applied : hudud , qisas , diyah , ta ’zir and preventive punishments .
Hudud constitutes crimes against divine will , the applicable punishments for which include the death penalty , crucifixion , stoning , amputation of the right hand and , for repeat offences , the left foot , flogging , imprisonment and exile .
Qisas is retribution in kind , broadly similar to “ an eye for an eye ” .
Proceedings against the life or physical integrity of the person are subjected to the decision of the victim , who may ask for the guilty party to suffer the same treatment or may accept financial compensation ( diyah ) in the case of murder or physical injury .
Ta’zir constitutes crimes that incur discretionary punishments applied by the State that are not derived from the Islamic sharia law .
30 .
The death penalty is imposed for certain hudud crimes , including adultery , incest , rape , fornication for the fourth time by an unmarried person , drinking alcohol for the third time , sodomy , sexual conduct between men without penetration for the fourth time , lesbianism for the fourth time , fornication by a non-Muslim man with a Muslim woman , and false accusation of adultery or sodomy for a fourth time .
Furthermore , the death penalty can be applied for the crimes of enmity with God ( mohareb ) and corruption on earth ( mofsed fil arz ) as one of four possible punishments .
Under the category of ta’zir crimes , the death penalty can be imposed for “ cursing the Prophet ” ( art. 513 of the Penal Code ) .
The death penalty may also be applied to such crimes as drug smuggling or trafficking , murder , espionage and crimes against national security .
31 . The continuing high incidence of executions remains an ongoing concern , with a sudden surge of executions reported in recent months , which the authorities argue are part of efforts to combat drug trafficking .
For instance , on 27 July 2008 , there were reportedly 29 executions , 18 for drug - related offences .
32 . The Human Rights Committee expressed grave concern over the extremely high number of death sentences , many resulting from trials in which the guarantees of due process of law had not been properly applied ( CCPR/C/79/Add.25 , para . 8 ) . Under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party , the application of the death penalty is limited to the most serious crimes and should be applied only in a most restrictive manner while ensuring for the utmost procedural safeguards .
33 .
In January 2008 , the spokesperson of the Iranian judiciary announced that the head of the judiciary had issued a circular banning public execution .
The circular applies to all cases and provides that exceptions will be formally decided and approved by the head of the judiciary when and where needed .
The circular also forbids publishing pictures of executions in the newspapers and other media .
However , public executions are reported to have still occurred .
c. Stoning as a method of execution
34 . In January 2002 , the head of the judiciary issued a circular to prohibit stoning as a punishment .
However , as in the case of the ban on public executions , this circular does not have a binding legal effect and serves only as an instruction for individual judges .
35 .
There have been several reports of stoning since this prohibition was declared .
In May 2006 , two people were stoned to death in Mashad .
In July 2007 , one male was reportedly stoned to death in Qazvin , although his partner was released from jail in early 2008 .
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed deep concern over this case in a public statement on 10 July 2007 .
The special procedures of the Human Rights Council have also voiced their concerns in several communications with the Iranian Government over the practice of stoning women , in particular for reasons of adultery .
The existing Penal Code prescribes execution by stoning as the penalty for adultery by married persons .
36 .
It is reported that stoning verdicts have been suspended for at least 14 people : 11 women and 3 men .
It was also reported , in July 2008 , that nine people had been sentenced to stoning for adultery , although those figures are disputed by the Iranian authorities .
Civil society in the Islamic Republic of Iran is also actively campaigning for the abolition of stoning .
The “ campaign to stop stoning forever ” , launched in 2006 , is aimed at documenting cases of stoning sentences , identifying attorneys willing to represent the accused and working towards the abolition of stoning altogether .
d. Juvenile executions
37 .
The head of the judiciary has reportedly established a moratorium on juvenile executions .
Once again , the moratorium is not legally binding for judges as it is in the form of an administrative circular , not a law , and cases of execution of juveniles continue to be reported .
It appears that the judicial authorities are seeking to delay juvenile death penalty cases on procedural grounds , to maximize both judicial scrutiny and the time available for the families of the victim and perpetrator to reach a diyah settlement in accordance with Islamic law .
38 . In addition , it is reported that a bill on the establishment of juvenile courts is currently under review by the Parliament .
The bill has reportedly been approved “ in general ” by a majority of parliamentarians and referred to a special committee for more detailed review .
The bill promotes principles of restorative justice and provides for diversion from the criminal system to community - based solutions and alternatives to criminal sentences .
It is understood that the bill will neither abolish the death penalty for those under the age of 18 who have committed crimes nor formally raise the age of criminal responsibility .
However , it represents an important step towards the harmonization of the Iranian legal system with relevant international standards in the area of juvenile justice .
39 .
Despite these positive developments , it is reported that a large number of juvenile executions are still carried out .
Amnesty International reported that between 1990 and 2006 , the Islamic Republic of Iran had executed 22 child offenders , constituting almost half of the total number ( 51 ) of juvenile executions worldwide during the reporting period .
It was further reported that a total of 107 offenders under the age of 18 had been sentenced to death ; 36 of those cases are now in the final stages .
The Iranian authorities dispute those figures and point to a diminishing trend in juvenile executions over time .
40 . Both the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child , to which the Islamic Republic of Iran is a party , obligate States parties not to impose the death penalty on those who commit a crime under the age of 18 .
41 . The age for criminal responsibility under Iranian law is set at 14 years and 7 months for boys and 8 years and 9 months for girls , which is not only discriminatory but also low by international standards .
Accordingly , children who commit serious crimes can be processed as adults under the Penal Code ( see E/ CN.4/2002/42 , para . 98 ) .
Furthermore , there is a possibility of death sentence under qisas ( retribution in kind ) for juvenile offenders , unless diyah is agreed or the offender is forgiven by the victim ’s family .
The sharia jurisprudence considers qisas a private right of the family of the victim that cannot be overruled by the decision of a judge or any other authority .
In this connection , Iranian officials exclude the State ’s responsibility for qisas cases .
42 . In 2005 , the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed grave concern that juvenile executions had continued and urged the Islamic Republic of Iran to take the steps necessary to immediately suspend the execution of the death penalty imposed on persons for having committed a crime before the age of 18 , to take the appropriate legal measures to convert them into penalties in conformity with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to abolish the death penalty as a sentence imposed on persons for having committed crimes before the age of 18 , as required by article 37 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child .
43 . The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has given high priority to the issue of juvenile execution in her dialogue with the Iranian authorities , which has led to a number of interventions on individual cases through private representations with the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations at Geneva , letters to the Foreign Minister and public statements .
For instance , on 6 December 2007 , the High Commissioner expressed grave concern over the execution of Makwan Moloudzadeh the previous day in a prison in Kermanshah Province .
It was reported that Mr. Moloudzadeh had been convicted of the rape of three boys seven years earlier , when he was 13 years old , and that the execution had been carried out despite his alleged victims ’ withdrawing their accusations and the head of the judiciary issuing an order to stay the execution pending a further judicial review of the sentence .
44 . On 10 June 2008 , the High Commissioner publicly expressed her concern over reports that four juvenile offenders , Behnoud Shojaaee , Mohammad Fadaaee , Saeed Jazee and Behnam Zaare , had been sentenced to death for crimes that they had committed when they were under the age of 18 .
She acknowledged the steps taken by the Iranian authorities to subject those cases to closer judicial scrutiny and to encourage settlements between perpetrators and the victims ’ families .
The High Commissioner , however , reminded the Iranian authorities of the absolute prohibition on the application of the death penalty for juvenile offenders under international law .
It was reported that their executions had been postponed , and the case of Mr. Jazee was reportedly settled with the victim ’s family .
45 .
In addition , the High Commissioner , during her visit to Tehran in September 2007 , raised the case of Mohammad Latif , who had been sentenced to death for a crime that he had committed under the age of 18 .
It was subsequently reported that a final settlement had been reached between the families of Mr. Latif and the victim .
e. Women ’s rights
46 . The Islamic Republic of Iran has yet to ratify the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women .
47 . According to the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report 2007/2008 , the Islamic Republic of Iran ranks ninety - fourth on the gender development index among the 177 countries surveyed and eighty - seventh on the gender empowerment measures .
Gender disparities remain among geographical regions in the country .
For instance , according to the Management and Planning Organization of the Islamic Republic of Iran , the gender development index is markedly lower than the national average in certain provinces , such as Sistan Baluchistan , Hormogzan and Zanjang .
48 . The Islamic Republic of Iran is reported to have made important achievements in women ’s education and health since 1990 , the baseline year for the Millennium Development Goals .
It is likely to achieve benchmarks under Goals 2 ( achieve universal primary education ) , 4 ( reduce child mortality ) and 5 ( improve maternal health ) .
For instance , the female - to - male literacy ratio in the 15 - to - 24 age group has increased from 87.9 per cent to 98.6 per cent .
The girls ’ primary , secondary and tertiary education enrolment ratio has markedly increased , from 79.2 per cent to 94.3 per cent , with female students constituting 64 per cent of all college students .
Access to health care , including reproductive health care , has become nearly universal .
As noted previously , maternal and infant mortality rates have also declined sharply .
49 .
Despite these positive achievements , the Islamic Republic of Iran is faced with a number of challenges in gender equity and equality and empowerment of women .
The penal and civil laws contain discriminatory provisions that are in urgent need of reform .
On 30 November 2007 , the Special Rapporteur on violence against women , its causes and consequences raised concerns over provisions in the family protection draft bill ( No. 36780/68357 , dated 22 July 2007 ) , which allegedly reversed rights currently enjoyed by women in the family .
The bill would , in particular , make it more difficult for women to obtain a divorce , as they would need to prove the impossibility of reconciliation by the intermediary of family counselling centres composed of experts on family studies , law and Islamic law ( A/ HRC/7/6/Add.1 , paras .
214-226 ) .
50 .
There have recently been some more promising steps to address discriminatory laws .
Under Iranian law , provisions for compensation ( diyah , or blood money ) for accidents and deaths put a value on men ’s lives ( and limbs ) that is double that of women’s .
This was recently reviewed by Parliament , and legislation has been proposed to recognize the equal value of women in such cases .
The law on inheritance for married women was also reviewed by Parliament .
Under the law , when a husband dies , a wife is entitled to a “ wife ’s share ” that excludes real property , and the land is passed directly to the children and the parents of the husband .
Furthermore , male children are entitled to double the amount of the inheritance of female children .
Women parliamentarians have championed new legislation to address this inequality , although it has met resistance from many religious scholars .
While both laws have yet to be passed , such legislative initiatives represent positive steps , particularly given the accompanying public debate and discourse on women ’s rights .
The Iranian authorities also point to legislative changes that provide for the possibility of divorce at the request of a woman and the right of mothers to custody of their children .
51 . Women have limited participation in wage labour outside of the agricultural sector , estimated at 16 per cent , which signifies that the progress achieved in female education in the recent past has not as yet translated into increased women ’s economic participation .
Concern was noted by the ILO Committee of Experts over women ’s low labour market participation , and particularly their limited access to senior positions and their high unemployment rate .
Furthermore , the Committee noted that without the express repeal of section 1117 of the Civil Code , there would be a continuing negative impact on women ’s employment opportunities .
Women ’s representatives in Parliament constitute only 4.1 per cent , and women ’s participation in governance and decision - making positions remains limited .
In addition , socio-cultural barriers and gender stereotypes in the school curricula and the media reinforce the prevailing patriarchal attitude in society
52 . Gender - based violence is also widespread .
During her visit from 29 January to 6 February 2005 , the Special Rapporteur on violence against women , its causes and consequences observed that violence against women in the Islamic Republic of Iran was due mainly to gender inequality , perpetuated by patriarchal values and discriminatory laws and procedures against women ( E/CN.4/2006/61/Add.3 ) .
53 . Concerns have been expressed over an increasing crackdown in the past year on the women ’s rights movement in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
Women ’s rights activism is sometimes presented by the Iranian Government as being connected to external security threats to the country .
For instance , the main organizers of the “ one million signatures ” campaign reportedly faced arrest and intimidation by the authorities .
On 6 March 2007 , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed public concern over the arrests of at least 31 women activists during a peaceful gathering in front of the Islamic Revolutionary Court in Tehran .
Several special procedures mandate - holders have raised concerns about the arrest , detention and ill treatment of women ’s rights defenders on numerous occasions in recent years ( see , e.g. , A/ HRC/7/6/Add.1 and A / HRC/7/28/Add.1 ) .
The Special Rapporteur on violence against women , its causes and consequences also noted with concern repeated arrests of women for wearing overtly loose headscarves or tight coats .
f. Rights of minorities
54 . The Constitution explicitly declares Islam to be the State religion , but contains two important provisions concerning religious minorities .
Article 13 states that Zoroastrian , Jewish and Christian Iranians are the only recognized religious minorities who are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies , within the limits of the law , and to act according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education .
Article 14 also provides protection for non-Muslims , provided they refrain from conspiracy or activity against Islam and the Islamic Republic of Iran .
55 . Reports continue to be received about members of the Baha ’i community being subjected to arbitrary detention , false imprisonment , confiscation and destruction of property , denial of employment and Government benefits and denial of access to higher education .
A significant increase has been reported in violence targeting Baha ’is and their homes , shops , farms and cemeteries throughout the country .
There have also been several cases involving torture or ill - treatment in custody .
56 .
The special procedures mandate holders have repeatedly raised the issue of the Baha ’is with the Iranian authorities .
Since June 2006 , the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , the Independent Expert on minority issues and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have repeatedly raised the issue of the arrest of 54 members of the Baha ’i community in the city of Shiraz who were reported to have been involved in community work .
Also on 24 April 2007 , the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief expressed concern that Baha ’i students were subjected to harassment , vilification and other forms of abuse by their teachers and school administrators .
It is alleged that the Baha ’i students were forced to identify their religion and then were insulted , threatened with expulsion and , in some cases , summarily dismissed from school .
In January and February 2007 some 150 such incidents were reported .
Many of the students were informed they had been expelled because of their faith .
Moreover , in June 2006 , the ILO Committee of Experts concluded that no progress had been made in amending or repealing legislation that was contrary to the ILO Discrimination ( Employment and Occupation ) Convention of 1958 .
The Committee also expressed continued concern regarding discrimination against members of recognized and unrecognized religious minorities and ethnic minorities .
The Committee noted that discrimination against Baha ’is remained particularly serious .
57 .
On 18 May 2008 , it was reported that six members of the Baha ’i leadership in the country had been arrested and a seventh member had been detained incommunicado in Mashhad since 5 March 2008 .
Subsequently , on 23 May , the High Commissioner wrote to the Iranian authorities asking for information on the reports in the light of the obligations of the Islamic Republic of Iran under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to ensure that no one is detained arbitrarily and to uphold the right to freedom of religion or belief .
The Iranian authorities insist that the arrests were made on national security grounds .
58 .
Other minority groups in the Islamic Republic of Iran are reported to have been subjected to a range of human rights violations .
For instance , the special procedures sent a number of communications in connection with the Arab minority in Khuzestan .
On 3 February 2006 , the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression raised concern over the arrests of seven Arab minority people in the city of Ahwaz in Khuzestan Province on 11 and 12 January 2006 after clashes between Iranian security forces and members of the Arab minority community .
On 31 August 2006 , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions drew attention to information he had received regarding a reportedly secret trial on charges carrying the death penalty of 22 Arab minority activists .
On 13 November 2006 , the Special Rapporteur wrote again to the Iranian authorities in connection with the death sentences of 10 of the 22 individuals expressing concern over reports that they had been tortured to confess and had had no access to lawyers prior to their trials .
The Iranian authorities insist that the arrests were made in connection with terrorist activities .
59 .
In addition , the special procedures have raised a number of communications concerning members of the Nematollahi Sufi Muslim community , the Kurdish community , the Sunni community , the Baluchi community , the Azeri - Turk community and the Christian community who have reportedly been subjected to arbitrary arrests and torture , allegedly in connection with peaceful demonstrations for their rights , such as the right to speak their own language and to hold religious ceremonies .
60 .
Treaty bodies have also addressed the issue of the rights of minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran .
As such , the Human Rights Committee expressed its concern at the extent of the limitations and restrictions on the freedom of religion and belief , noting that conversion from Islam is punishable and that even followers of the three recognized religions are facing serious difficulties in the enjoyment of their rights .
The Committee was particularly disturbed about the extent of discrimination against followers of non-recognized religions , notably the Baha ’is , whose rights under the Covenant are subject to extremely severe restrictions ( CCPR/C/79/Add.25 , para. 16 ) .
In 2003 , the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed its concern over the reported discrimination faced by certain minorities , including Baha ’is , who are deprived of certain rights , and that certain provisions of the State party ’s legislation appear to be discriminatory and on ethnic and religious grounds ( CERD / C/63/ CO/6 , para . 14 ) .
In 2005 , the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed concern that a large number of Baha ’i students had not been admitted to university on the grounds of their religious affiliation ( CRC/C/15/Add.254 , para. 59 ) .
61 . The Islamic Republic of Iran has been a long - standing and generous host to a substantial refugee population , particularly from neighbouring Afghanistan .
Following the voluntary repatriation of approximately 1 million Afghan refugees from 2002 to 2004 , the Bureau of Aliens and Foreign Immigrants Affairs under the Interior Ministry conducted two inclusive refugee registration exercises between 2005 and 2007 .
In 2008 , the Bureau has conducted a third Afghan refugee registration exercise and is presently in the process of issuing the corresponding refugee card to more than 850,000 Afghan registered refugees .
Commendably , it is foreseen that work permits will also be issued to refugees upon registration .
However , the Committee on the Rights of the Child noted that refugee children are currently being enrolled in schools only if their parents have registered with the authorities , and that the enrollment of refugee children was not being offered free of charge .
g. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion and expression
62 . Serious concern has been expressed by the international community regarding the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and freedom of opinion and expression .
The Human Rights Committee expressed concern over the extent of limitations to the freedom of expression , assembly and association exemplified by articles 6 and 24 of the Constitution and article 16 of the Law pertaining to Activities of Parties , Societies and Political and Professional Associations .
It noted that contrary to the provisions of articles 18 and 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , members of certain political parties who did not agree with what the authorities believed to be Islamic thinking or who expressed opinions in opposition to official positions had been discriminated against .
Self - censorship also seemed to be widespread in the media , and severe limitations appeared to have been placed upon the exercise of freedom of assembly and of association ( CCPR/C/79/Add.25 , para. 15 ) .
63 . Similar concerns have been reiterated by the special procedures mandate holders .
During his visit from 4 to 10 November 2003 , the Special Rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression ( see E/ CN.4/2004/62/Add.2 ) noted a strong desire for reform among civil society , within Parliament and at the highest levels of the Government of the time , but reforms were hampered by a number of institutional blocks .
He noted that many limitations in the Press Law and the Penal Code did not comply with the restrictions possible under article 19 , paragraph 3 , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .
He observed that the grounds for limitations such as “ insult against Islam ” or “ criticism ” lacked objective criteria and clear definition and could result in misinterpretation by judges .
He also urged the Iranian authorities to review the legislation limiting the exercise of freedom of opinion and expression and to give a clearer definition to the provisions limiting this right .
64 . Furthermore , the Special Rapporteur underlined that the use of revolutionary courts to try “ opinion - related offences ” had a negative impact on the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression .
He called upon the Iranian Government to grant amnesty to all prisoners prosecuted for press and opinion - related offences .
65 .
There have been increasing reports of tightening curbs on the media in the recent past .
The crackdown has affected print media , weblogs and websites , and journalists have been imprisoned .
A well - known human rights defender in the country said that in the period from March 2007 to March 2008 , approximately 30 newspapers and magazines had been suspended in the country , including Sharq and Hammihan dailies as well as Madrese , Zanan and Donyaye Tasvir , Sobh-e Zendegi , Talash and Haft .
Some women ’s rights activists were indicted on national security grounds owing to their weblogs .
It is further reported that during the month of May 2008 alone , more than 18 weblogs focusing on discriminatory laws against women ( the “ 1 million signatures ” campaign ) had been filtered .
The censorship of books has reportedly been tightened , affecting negatively the environment for the publishing industry and writers .
The Iranian Government appears to encourage selfcensorship openly , as the Islamic Culture and Guidance Minister was quoted in the media as saying that if book publishers were to do some self - censorship , they would n’t have to complain so much .
66 .
The right of workers to form independent trade unions has been complicated by an apparent contradiction between the national laws and the Constitution .
While the Constitution guarantees the right to association and assembly , section 6 of the Labour Law is vaguely worded in terms of workers forming free trade unions .
It is reported that attempts to create a number of workers ’ associations and strike actions over wages have been met by arbitrary arrests and violence by the security forces .
h . Lack of due process rights and failure to respect the rights
67 .
As noted above , the Iranian Constitution , the Penal Code and the Code of Penal Procedure provide for a range of procedural guarantees in connection with the due process of law .
Nevertheless , more than 65 per cent of the communications sent to the Islamic Republic of Iran by the special procedures mandate holders in 2007 related to concerns over the lack of due process rights and the failure to respect the rights of detainees .
68 . Similarly , the Human Rights Committee expressed concern over the lack of safeguards for due process and fair trials and deplored the lack of respect for due process of law , particularly before the revolutionary courts , where trials in camera tended to be the rule and where apparently no real possibility was provided to the accused to prepare a defence ( CCPR/C/79/Add.25 , para . 12 ) .
69 .
The Working Group on arbitrary detention , during its visit from 15 to 27 February 2003 , noted the failure to observe procedural formalities as a guarantee against arbitrary treatment .
Particularly in revolutionary court hearings , an extremely restrictive interpretation of article 128 of the Code of Penal Procedure and note 3 to the Law on the Selection of Counsel led to the exclusion of counsel at the discretion of the judges .
The Working Group noted that the active involvement of counsel must be provided for during all stages of the process and that access to legal aid must be made more effective ( E/CN.4/2004/3/Add.2 and Corr.1 ) .
The Iranian Bar Association has expressed concern over new legislation that establishes a parallel system for the issuance of attorney licences , which could further undermine the independence of the bar .
70 .
Women bear the negative impact of discriminatory laws and practices .
The Special Rapporteur on violence against women , its causes and consequences noted that the rules of evidence discriminated against women .
For example , in criminal offences such as murder or “ illicit sexual relations ” , the woman ’s testimony is worth only half that of a man and must be corroborated by the testimony of a man in order to be accepted .
Furthermore , she noted that the punishments imposed were disproportionate to the seriousness of the offences committed and that such arbitrary punishments frequently discriminated against women , who were punished more harshly than men who committed the same crime ( E/ CN.4/2006/61/Add.3 ) .
IV .
Cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High
a. Cooperation with the United Nations human rights treaty system
71 . The Islamic Republic of Iran is a party to four major United Nations human rights treaties : the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( ratified on 13 July 1994 ) , the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ( ratified on 29 August 1968 ) , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights ( both ratified on 24 June 1975 ) .
It has ratified some other human rights - related treaties , including the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees ( 1951 ) and the Protocol thereto ( both ratified on 28 July 1976 ) , the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide ( 1948 ) ( ratified on 14 August 1956 ) , the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid ( 1973 ) ( ratified on 17 April 1985 ) , and the ILO Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour ( No. 182 ) ( ratified in May 2002 ; the Islamic Republic of Iran has ratified 13 international labour conventions ) .
72 . The Islamic Republic of Iran has had a poor record of cooperation with treaty bodies .
It has not reported to the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights or the Human Rights Committee for more than a decade .
The concluding observations of each of those bodies adopted in 1993 remain largely unimplemented .
However , on the positive side , the more recent country reports were examined by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2000 and 2005 respectively and by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in 2003 , enabling an in - depth analysis of the various forms of discrimination and of the situation of the rights of the child .
73 .
The Islamic Republic of Iran has a practice of entering general reservations upon signature or ratification , which has repeatedly been cited by treaty bodies as one of the main factors impeding the enjoyment of some human rights protected under the conventions .
b. Cooperation with the special procedures
74 . The Islamic Republic of Iran issued a standing invitation to all thematic special procedures mandate holders in June 2002 , which coincided with the discontinuation of the mandate of the Special Representative on the human rights situation in the Islamic Republic of Iran established by the Commission on Human Rights in 1984 .
The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living , and on the right to non-discrimination in this context ( July 2005 ; see E/ CN.4/2006/41/Add.2 ) , the Special Rapporteur on violence against women , its causes and consequences ( January / February 2005 ; see E/ CN.4/2006/61/Add.3 ) , the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants ( February 2004 ; see E/ CN.4/2005/85/Add.2 ) , the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression ( November 2003 ; see E/ CN.4/2004/62/Add.2 ) , and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention ( February 2003 ; see E/ CN.4/2004/3/Add.2 and Corr.1 ) have so far visited

A bombshell article in today ’s edition of the New York Times lifts the lid on how the brother of Afghan President Hamid Karzai , a suspected kingpin of the country ’s booming opium trade , has been on the CIA payroll for the past eight years .
However , the article serves as little more than a whitewash because it fails to address the fact that one of the primary reasons behind the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was the agenda to reinstate the Golden Crescent drug trade .
“ The agency pays ( Ahmed Wali ) Karzai for a variety of services , including helping to recruit an Afghan paramilitary force that operates at the C.I.A. ’s direction in and around the southern city of Kandahar , Mr. Karzai ’s home , ” reports the Times .
An October 2008 report from the Times reveals how , after security forces discovered a huge tractor - trailer full of heroin outside Kandahar in 2004 , “ Before long , the commander , Habibullah Jan , received a telephone call from Ahmed Wali Karzai , the brother of President Hamid Karzai , asking him to release the vehicle and the drugs . ”
In 2006 , following the discovery of another cache of heroin , “ United States investigators told other American officials that they had discovered links between the drug shipment and a bodyguard believed to be an intermediary for Ahmed Wali Karzai . ”
The Times article out today also discusses how the CIA uses Karzai as a go - between between the Americans and the Taliban .
He is also directly implicated in the manufacturing of phony ballots and polling stations that were attributed to the President ’s disputed election victory .
“ If it looks like a duck , and it quacks like a duck , it ’s probably a duck , ” the American officer said of Mr. Karzai .
“ Our assumption is that he ’s benefiting from the drug trade . ”
Officials quoted by The Times described Karzai as a Mafia - like figure who expanded his influence over the drug trade with the aid of U.S. efforts to eliminate his competitors .

The Afghan opium trade has exploded since the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan , following a lull after the Taliban had imposed a crackdown .
According to the U.N. , the drug trade is now worth $ 65 billion .
Afghanistan produces 92 per cent of the world ’s opium , with the equivalent of 3,500 tonnes leaving the country each year .
Other figures put the number far higher , at around 6,100 tonnes a year .
The New York Times exposé pins the blame on Karzai , but fails to explain that one of the primary reasons behind the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was the United States ’ agenda to restore , not eradicate , the drug trade .
Before the invasion , the Taliban collaborated closely with the U.N. to reduce opium production down to just 185 tonnes , a figure at least 2000 % below current levels .
The notion that the “ Taliban benefits from the drug trade ” and that the U.S. is trying to stop it , as both Bush and Obama claimed , is the complete opposite of what is actually happening .
As Professor Michel Chossudovsky has highlighted in a series of essays , the explosion of opium production after the invasion was about the CIA ’s drive to restore the lucrative Golden Crescent opium trade that was in place during the time when the Agency were funding the Mujahideen rebels to fight the Soviets , and flood the streets of America and Britain with cheap heroin , destroying lives while making obscene profits .
The Times implies that the drug lord Karzai being on the CIA payroll is little more than an embarrassing coincidence , when in reality he is just a middle manager for the U.S. military - industrial complex ’s control of the drug trade in Afghanistan which stretches back decades and was only interrupted when the Taliban came to power .
“ Heroin is a multibillion dollar business supported by powerful interests , which requires a steady and secure commodity flow .
One of the “ hidden ” objectives of the war was precisely to restore the CIA sponsored drug trade to its historical levels and exert direct control over the drug routes , ” writes Chossudovsky .
“ As revealed in the Iran - Contra and Bank of Commerce and Credit International ( BCCI ) scandals , CIA covert operations in support of the Afghan Mujahideen had been funded through the laundering of drug money .
“ Dirty money ” was recycled – through a number of banking institutions ( in the Middle East ) as well as through anonymous CIA shell companies– , into “ covert money , ” used to finance various insurgent groups during the Soviet - Afghan war , and its aftermath . ”
Within two years of the CIA ’s covert operation in Afghanistan , “ CIA assets again controlled this heroin trade .
As the Mujahideen guerrillas seized territory inside Afghanistan , they ordered peasants to plant opium as a revolutionary tax .
Across the border in Pakistan , Afghan leaders and local syndicates under the protection of Pakistan Intelligence operated hundreds of heroin laboratories .
During this decade of wide - open drug - dealing , the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in Islamabad failed to instigate major seizures or arrests . ”
This is the history of the Afghan opium trade that the Times wo n’t tell you , and in failing to do so today ’s article serves only to whitewash the true scale of the agenda behind the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan .

I received an email from a close friend asking me to help educate the city manager in Tuttle , OK about Linux .
I told him I prefer finishing a " hack " on securing SSH .
Here 's why I 'm through orchestrating efforts for Linux in Government .
For a couple of years , I wrote exclusively for Linux Journal on Linux in Government .
I found many government units deploying Linux and other GNU software in critical infrastructure around the world .
Spurred by community members I specialized in the government arena .
I had no idea of the depth and breathe of Microsoft 's operations in Government .
As some might characterize their operations , they hide under the cover of darkness .
They operate where no one can see them .
Do n't buck them , they employ people who can take your life .
My first glimpse of the dangers inherent in tackling government adoption occurred when a state senator asked me as a specialist to look at ways to cut budget dollars in a deep hole called the Department of Information Services .
That senator filed a bill that specified the state consider the total cost of ownership including life - cycle maintenance costs , the costs associated with risk issues , including security and privacy of data , and the costs of ensuring security of the IT system itself .
Essentially , we wanted to stop budget cuts in social services and shift the revenues from dead IT projects currently drawing budget money to the general fund .
In my opinion , all hell broke loose .
I have never seen so many alter - egos , shills and groups invented by Microsoft to stop free software adoption in government .
I have also never seen as many dumb and dumber people occupying important positions in government .
I started three open source efforts .
They included governmentforge.org , the Open Government Interoperability Project and a LAMP project called Leopard .
The players in the government arena essentially took those ideas and put them in their own projects one of which is Core.gov and the other called Government Open Code Collaborative .
I would characterize the people involved in these type of organizations as nasty bureaucrats .
I have never met one of them who cared about the people they serve .
The ones I have met only care about their careers .
They would cut the heart out of the person in the next office in a minute .
I saw this as an intern at the Library of Congress , as an auditor in a DoD Management and Operations contractor , as a Oracle Financials documentation specialist at a DoE facility where I found misappropriations that ran about 50 % and how they kept them off the books .
Here 's how they did it .
The DOE used something called a WBS or work breakdown structure .
When a cost accounting manager of a segment in the current year went over budget , he would find another cost accounting manager to transfer his overages into a future year .
When they reached that future year , they would be out of money and would then make a request for additional funds .
That 's how projects have cost overruns and end up costing multiples of the original appropriation .
It gets worse though .
These crooks do it off the books and outside the computerized system .
They have a person they trust keep manual records of these cost accounting transactions and they often pay that person .
Did I give up .
You bet I did .
One of the champions of Linux and free software in a major state agency chose to purchase Windows XP desktops for everyone in the agency .
I 've heard that man speaking at National Conventions for Government CIOs exalting the benefits of free software .
I have read the serenity prayer several times in my life .
It goes like this : God , grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change , courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference .
I decided to use the wisdom I gained in a lifetime of experience to accept the things I can't change .
I also think that anyone in America who believes our government cares about us lives in a dream world .
I do n't care if you 're a Republican , Democrat , Libertarian or whatever .
The people running for office are politicians .
They do n't listen and they do n't care .
Does that mean I wo n't muckrake , write and investigate ?
No , it does n't mean that .
I just wo n't work with politicians who claim they want to save our citizens money , keep jobs in the US and help all people in the US survive above the poverty level .
