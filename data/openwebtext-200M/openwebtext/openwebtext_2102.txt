Wow !
As a nerd on the PR and marketing beat I find this to be absolutely astounding and heartening : the UK is about to make it a crime for companies to misrepresent themselves as consumers in their online marketing .
That means , for example , that a company setting up a fake blog to hype its own products could be prosecuted , fined , and jailed .
Free speech ?
Whatever .
This is an awesome development .
And bloggers can be locked up , too !
The rules make it an offense to blog , use brand ambassadors or seed viral ads while " falsely representing oneself as a consumer . "
They also apply to bloggers who fail to disclose they have accepted money to write about a product .
This is not of course , happening in the US .
But maybe bloggers should rethink their opinions about accepting free shit in return for positive reviews .
Word of mouth marketing online is big business here , but most companies and their marketing agencies are smart enough to realize already that disclosure can save them a world of scandal and bad PR .
So far the exact penalties have n't been spelled out , and it will likely take a test case , reported to the Office of Fair Trading and prosecuted , to make clear the size of the penalty and whether jail time is really likely .
Flogging ?
Also , here we gratuitously bring up once again Edelman 's famous fake Wal - Mart blog .
If only it had happened after May 26 , and in the UK .

Lots of folks ask me , “ Have you ever tried rock salt in a shotgun shell ?
Would this be a good load for personal defense ? ”
We have seen it done in the movies .
I remember an episode of “ The Rifleman ” , where Lucas McCain shot some bad guys with a load of rock salt .
I never understood why , but guess it had something to do with script writers needing a new story line every week .
I ’ve also heard that some folks used to use this load to run off “ bums ” and beggars in the old days , during the Depression .
So , would it actually work ?
Only one way to find out .
I obtained a box of genuine Morton ’s Ice Cream Rock Salt .
I will use some 12 Gauge Heavy Field Loads , which are loaded with 1 1/4 ounce of # 6 shot .
First , I open them up and pour out the lead shot .
Then , I fill each shell with as much rock salt as it will hold .
I then re-crimped the shells and was ready to go .
I was immediately surprised at how light the finished shell felt .
It felt like it had nothing in it at all .
Shotgun pellets penetrate as a direct result of the “ mass ” of the individual pellets .
Since the rock salt is so light in weight , I am already suspicious that it will not penetrate much at all .
First , we set up a cardboard silhouette at 20 yards .
This is typical across - the - yard distance .
It only managed to make two slight dents in the cardboard .
Certainly not enough to break the skin on a human or animal .
We were interested to find that the report of the shotgun was about normal , but the recoil was almost nonexistent .
None .
The lack of mass of the shot load meant no recoil .
How about 10 yards ?
We will cover the target with a terry cloth towel to simulate clothing .
It made some very slight dents in the target and a couple of grains of rock salt stuck in the cardboard .
I doubt that they would have penetrated skin .
Ten yards is pretty close , but it did n’t do much .
The shot cup dented the cardboard , but did not penetrate through .
We decided to try it at 10 yards without the terry cloth “ clothing ” to see if it would penetrate .
It made more dents in the cardboard without the clothes , but still , only a few grains of salt actually stuck in the cardboard .
Most bounced off .
One “ problem ” with shotguns is that , if you get close enough , any load will penetrate , at least a little .
Let ’s try it at 12 feet .
The shot shell wad made the biggest hole in the cardboard target .
We also see penetration all the way through the cardboard by some grains of rock salt , but only by about 10 % of the total load .
That might do the intended job of “ burning ” the “ shootee ” .
But that ’s at 12 feet !
Well , before we quit for the day , how about at 4 feet ?
Up close and personal .
The wad makes a big hole in the target , and a lot of the grains of salt go through the cardboard .
This finally looks like a shot that would cause a wound .
Maybe not death , but a “ wound ” .
Lessons learned :
At 20 yards , you might scare a dog or some other animal , but you sure would n’t break the skin .
At 10 yards , you might break the skin with a couple of grains , but nothing very serious .
At 12 feet , you might get the desired effect , if the desired effect is to “ burn ” the target with the rock salt .
At 4 feet , you might cause a wound requiring a visit to a hospital for a human , or maybe death to a small animal .
Movie plots that show someone “ burning ” a bad guy at across - the - yard distances are hogwash .
Rock salt makes a pitiful personal defense load , as if we did n’t already know that .
Got home and broke out the Tampax and soapy water , and got to work cleaning the barrel of the shotgun .
I ’m not going to take the chance of leaving salt deposits in the barrel .
I then ran very hot water through the barrel and dried it completely .
Then cleaned and oiled it as normal .
I then returned the plated 00 Buckshot to the magazine .
If I ever have to “ burn ” a bad guy , he ’s not going to have any doubts or complaints about lack of penetration .
Shooting stuff is fun , even if it is something as silly as rock salt loads in a shotgun .

Men are more likely than women to have problems with memory and other thinking skills , symptoms considered to be an early stage of dementia , research suggests .
The new study , to be presented at an annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Chicago this week , expands the field of research on aging and memory into a touchy arena — cognitive differences among men and women .
Forgetfulness linked with aging , or just a frenzied day , is normal .
Say , you misplace your car keys or wallet , or you can't remember where you parked the car .
Red flags should pop up when you start forgetting things you normally remember , and on a routine basis , such as weekly appointments , doctors say .
These are signs of so - called mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) , which can lead to dementia .
People with mild cognitive impairment are three to four times more likely than others to develop Alzheimer 's disease , according to the Mayo Clinic .
Considered the most common form of dementia , Alzheimer 's is a neurological disorder that affects your ability to think , speak , reason , remember and move .
The recent findings come from a study of nearly 2,000 residents of Olmsted County , Minn. , who ranged in age from 70 to 89 .
Dr. Rosebud Roberts of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minn. , and her colleagues followed the participants beginning in the fall of 2004 , collecting new data every 12 to 15 months .
Overall , 74 percent of the participants had normal mental function ; about 16 percent had MCI ; and 10 percent had full - on dementia .
Men were one - and - a - half times more likely to have mild cognitive impairment than women .
The prevalence in men increased from 12 percent in men ages 70 to 74 up to 40 percent in the oldest age group , ages 85 to 89 .
" This was an unexpected finding , " Roberts said during a press briefing , referring to the difference between men and women .
The finding remained the same regardless of a man 's education or marital status .
" These findings are in contrast to studies which have found more women than men , or an equal proportion , have dementia , and suggest there 's a delayed progression to dementia in men , " Roberts said .
" Alternately , women may develop dementia at a faster rate than men . "
Continued study of the participants could help to solve this mind puzzle .
" To be able to find out whether the findings are definitive , we need to follow our subjects over time , " Roberts said , " to see if men indeed develop new MCI at a faster rate than women . "
The study was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health and the Robert H. and Clarice Smith and Abigail Van Buren Alzheimer ’s Disease Research Program .
Anger grows over rising prices in Sri Lanka
By our reporters
11 April 2008
Sri Lanka ’s official annualised inflation rate skyrocketed to 28 percent in March , up from 24 percent in February .
Prices for essential food items are soaring — the inflation rate for food and beverages reached a staggering 37 percent — while transport prices and housing rents followed with 24 percent and 11 percent respectively .
Over the past three months , the Colombo Consumer Price Index ( CCPI ) has jumped by 487 points , from 5,955 in December to 6,442 in March , and the impact is sharply eroding the living standards of workers , the rural poor and students .
People are particularly angry because the price of rice , the main staple food in Sri Lanka , has nearly doubled since January last year , causing immense hardship .
Worse conditions lie ahead .
The government has admitted that bread prices could rise to 100 rupees by the end of this year , a threefold increase .
Nervous about the rising discontent , the government asked India to supply rice stocks .
However , India has curbed exports of 40 items , including rice , because of shortages and rising inflation at home .
The Colombo government then turned to Pakistan , but received a similar response , and has now sent the trade minister to Myanmar to ask for imports from there .
According to the United Nations , Cambodia , China and Vietnam have also restricted exports .
These difficulties highlight the global character of the crisis , with prices for rice , flour , milk powder and other essential food items , as well as oil , rising at unprecedented rates .
The UN under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs , Sir John Holmes , warned a conference in Dubai this week that escalating prices would trigger protests and riots in vulnerable countries .
He said food prices had risen globally by an average of 40 percent since the middle of last year .
Several factors produced by global capitalism are driving the shortages and price hikes worldwide .
These include the vast urbanisation taking place in China , India and other countries formerly dominated by small farming , the diversion of land and crops to produce bio-fuels , and widespread speculation in food and other commodities .
In its latest World Economic Outlook , issued this week , the International Monetary Fund stated that because of the losses hitting financial markets , investors were pulling funds out of financial assets to buy metals , oil and food staples .
In Sri Lanka , the situation has been exacerbated by huge increases in military spending after the government of President Mahinda Rajapakse plunged the island back to war in 2006 .
Around 167 billion rupees ( $ US1.5 billion ) has been allocated for defence expenditure this year , a 20 percent increase from the budget presented last November .
To pay for the war , the government has increased taxes , borrowed at high interest rates and run the printing presses .
All of these measures have pushed prices higher .
WSWS correspondents spoke to workers , students and youth about the increasing cost of living .
They expressed deep discontent and hostility toward Rajapakse ’s government for imposing the burden on ordinary people .
Plantation workers are among the worst affected .
Most of them still live in very small line rooms built during British colonial rule and are not provided with even basic facilities .
Now their families have started to skip one meal a day .
Subramaniyam from Strathdon Plantations in Hatton said : “ Under Rajapakse , prices have increased three - fold .
We went on strike in December 2006 , demanding the doubling of our daily wage to 300 rupees ( $ US 2.7 ) .
At that time , one kilogram of flour cost 22 rupees , a kilo of rice was 25 rupees , one litre of kerosene oil was 32 rupees , and a coconut cost 12 rupees .
See the change now !
These prices are now 75 , 80 , 80 and 45 rupees respectively .
“ This government is spending millions of rupees on war every day .
If the war were stopped , a lot of the problem would be solved .
I know that the prices of oil and flour are increasing on the world market .
But when there is a 5 - rupee increase globally , we get a 10 - rupee increase .
Workers want to fight against this oppression and improve their living standards but there ’s no leadership . ”
Jatheesan , 48 , a father of four children from the Panmoor Estate at Hatton , said : “ I just ca n’t imagine my family ’s future under this unbearable cost of living .
These days we do n’t have three meals a day like we did before .
If growing children do n’t get proper meals they become sick , and I can’t work without proper meals continuously .
If we become sick , there are no medical facilities available .
We have to travel to another estate , which is six kilometres away .
“ Trade union leaders speak and give interviews to the media , claiming that the plantation sector welfare system has improved very much , but it has gone from bad to worse .
We get only 200 rupees per day .
Very rarely do we get the attendance allowance of 120 rupees — unless you work for 25 days you do n’t get it .
Just imagine what you can buy for 200 rupees a day for a family . ”
S. Kaliammah , a retired female worker , explained that a 400 - gram packet of milk powder now sold for 275 rupees , up from 190 rupees in January .
Plantation families were compelled to dilute the milk powder with more water .
She showed us the conditions inside a line room , built in 1912 .
It had no proper water facilities and no toilet .
“ We have n’t seen any improvement in living standards during our lifetime , other than it is getting worse , ” she said .
Workers in the free trade zones are faring little better .
About 50,000 workers , mostly female , are employed in the Katunayake Export Processing Zone .
Fear has spread that the US economic slowdown will impact on their jobs because the US is the largest market for Sri Lankan garment exports .
Workers at two Jaqalanka factories did not receive their full salaries in January and the two operations closed down in early February , throwing about 1,400 people out of work .
Nishanthi , a young female employee of the US - owned Smart Garment , told us : “ I have been working for one year .
When I started , my basic salary was 6,200 rupees ( $ US59 ) per month .
As a result of a strike last December , we gained a 1,500 - rupee increase .
If we do overtime we can earn some more , but then our working hours lengthen to 12 hours .
Our attendance allowance is cut if we take leave .
“ I share my house rent of 2,000 rupees [ a month ] with another colleague .
For cooking we use kerosene oil , the price of which has gone up several times last year and this year .
Prices of rice , soap , biscuits , milk powder , clothes and other things have gone up by two - to three - fold compared to a year ago .
We ca n’t have a proper meal .
“ We have had to stop consuming many things , including milk powder .
We ca n’t buy clothes as we did earlier .
With difficulty , I deposit 1,000 rupees in a bank account for my child every month , but we ca n’t think about the future .
“ I voted for the present government , hoping it would do something for the poor .
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party [ SLFP — the main partner in the ruling coalition ] and the United National Party [ UNP ] have ruled the country successively but nothing has been done for the poor .
“ I agree that the war is contributing to the increased prices for essentials .
And there is no economic development that we can feel .
The war must be stopped — its victims are poor people .
We ca n’t even travel by bus due to fear of the war .
What we need is a peaceful society that has affordable prices for the working people . ”
L.S. De Soyza , a railway worker from the Ratmalana Industrial Zone on the outskirts of Colombo , said his take home pay was 7,000 rupees monthly , after deductions for loan repayments .
He has three children , only two of whom are employed .
He pays 800 rupees for rent , 1,000 rupees for electricity and 1,200 for the telephone bill .
“ I have debts of hundreds of thousands of rupees to banks because I use credit cards and overdrafts to bridge my family ’s monthly expenditure .
The better part of my salary goes for food .
Not enough is left to cover other expenses such as transport and clothing . ”
Soyza said that while the government insisted price increases were due only to world market changes , the prices of locally produced food items were also going up .
He explained : “ I am not a supporter of the war .
There are so many injustices happening to the Tamil people .
They are denied jobs and management positions .
This ethnic issue cannot be solved through war .
I think the government is fooling the Sinhala masses by promising a victory . ”
Soyza is disgusted with the trade union leaders in the government - owned railway service .
“ Some leaders say they are trying to get wage increases .
But others such as the JVP [ Peoples Liberation Front , a Sinhala chauvinist party ] leaders are supporting the government and praising it for launching the war .
I do not see any of the old parties fighting to improve the living and social conditions of working people . ”
Indika , a final year art student at Colombo University , said students were struggling to cope up with rising prices .
“ I have to spend 30 rupees per day for travelling .
I take breakfast and lunch from the university canteen because it is given at a subsidised rate .
For those two meals I now have to pay about 50 rupees .
In 2005 , a plate of rice and curry , with two or three vegetables , and fish , meat or egg , was 13 rupees .
Now it is 25 rupees .
They are going to increase it to 30 rupees .
It is still not a good meal and the quantity is not enough .
For stationery and photocopying I have to spend at least 1,000 rupees per month .
Poor students like me receive 2,500 rupees [ a month ] as financial assistance but that is not even enough to cover essential expenditure .
Many students are forced to do part - time jobs and we have no time or money even to see a film . ”
George Soros
As Sen . John McCain assumes the GOP front - runner mantle , his long - standing , but little - noticed association with donors such as George Soros and Teresa Heinz Kerry is receiving new attention among his Republican critics .
In 2001 , McCain founded the Alexandria , Va. - based Reform Institute as a vehicle to receive funding from George Soros ' Open Society Institute and Teresa Heinz Kerry 's Tides Foundation and several other prominent non-profit organizations .
McCain used the institute to promote his political agenda and provide compensation to key campaign operatives between elections .
In 2006 , the Arizona senator was forced to sever his formal ties with the Reform Institute after a controversial $ 200,000 contribution from Cablevision came to light .
McCain solicited the donation for the Reform Institute using his membership on the Senate Committee on Commerce , Science , and Transportation .
In a letter to the Federal Communications Commission , he supported Cablevision 's push to introduce the more profitable al la carte pricing , rather than packages of TV programming .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Yet , the Reform Institute still employs the McCain campaign 's Hispanic outreach director , Juan Hernandez , as a senior fellow of its Comprehensive Immigration Reform Initiative .
As WND reported , Hernandez serves as a non-paid volunteer for the McCain campaign .
A dual Mexican - U.S. citizen , he was a member of former President Vicente Fox 's cabinet , representing an estimate 24 million Mexicans living abroad .
Hernandez , with a " Mexico first " message , has argued aggressively against building a fence on the Mexican border , insisting the frontier needed to remain wide open so illegal immigrants could easily enter the U.S .
The July 6 , 2001 , homepage of the Reform Institute archived on the Internet lists founder McCain as chairman of the group 's advisory committee .
Prominent senior officials on the McCain 2008 presidential campaign staff found generously paid positions at the Reform Institute following the senator 's unsuccessful run for the White House in 2000 .
Rick Davis , McCain 's current campaign manager , was paid $ 110,000 a year by the Reform Institute for a consulting position , according to the group 's 2003 Form 990 filing with the IRS .
In 2004 , Davis advanced to the position of Reform Institute president , with an annual salary of $ 120,000 , according to the group 's 2004 Form 990 .
In 2005 , Davis remained president , but his salary dropped back to $ 45,000 a year , with a time commitment of five hours per week , according the 2005 Form 990 .
Carla Eudy , a senior advisor on McCain 's 2008 presidential campaign who until recently headed fundraising , was paid $ 177,885 in 2005 to serve as the Reform Institute 's secretary - treasurer .

Other McCain presidential campaign staffers who have found employment at the Reform Institute include Trevor Potter , McCain 's 2000 legal counsel , and Crystal Benton , the senator 's former press secretary , who served as institute 's communications director in 2005 for an annual salary of $ 52,083 .
The Reform Institute regularly has supported McCain in various legislative efforts , including on campaign finance reform , global warming and " comprehensive immigration reform , " all efforts widely opposed by many in the party 's conservative base .
Arianna Huffington , syndicated columnist and creator of the HuffingtonPost.com , has served on the Reform Institute 's advisory committee since the group 's inception .
According to FrontPage Magazine , Teresa Heinz Kerry has provided more than $ 4 million to the Tides Foundation , a non-profit organization founded by anti-war activist Drummond Pike in 1976 with a history of funding causes such as abortion , homosexual - rights activism and open borders .
Financial contributors while McCain was chairman of the Reform Institute also have included the Educational Foundation of America , a group that supports abortion and opposes drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve .
The Soros - Kerry funding connection with McCain was first exposed by Ed Morrissey at the Captains Quarters blog in 2005 .
Subsequently , David Horowitz 's DiscoverTheNetworks.org website and Michelle Malkin's blog gave renewed attention to the Reform Institute 's funding ties .

For now , full - fledged quantum computers are the stuff of science fiction — in last summer ’s blockbuster movie Transformers , the bad guys use quantum computing to break into the U.S. Army 's secure files in just 10 seconds flat .
But Prem Kumar , the AT&T Professor of Information Technology in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the director of the Center for Photonic Communication and Computing at Northwestern University 's McCormick School of Engineering , and his research group are one step closer to realizing that technology — though for far better purposes .
The group recently demonstrated one of the basic building blocks for distributed quantum computing using entangled photons generated in optical fibers , and their research was published in the April 4 edition of Physical Review Letters .
“ Because it is done with fiber and the technology that is already globally deployed , we think that it is a significant step in harnessing the power of quantum computers , ” Kumar says .
Quantum computing differs from classical computing in that a classical computer works by processing “ bits ” that exist in two states , either one or zero .
Quantum computing uses quantum bits , or qubits , which , in addition to being one or zero can also be in a “ superposition , ” which is both one and zero simultaneously .
This is possible because qubits are quantum units like atoms , ions , or photons that operate under the rules of quantum mechanics instead of classical mechanics .
The “ superposition ” state allows a quantum computer to process significantly more information than a classical computer and in a much shorter time .
The area of quantum computing took off about 14 years ago after mathematician / physicist Peter Shor created a quantum algorithm that could factor large integers much more efficiently than a classical computer .
Such an algorithm put the computer world in a tizzy because many web sites secure information like credit card and bank account numbers over the Internet through the public - key cryptography method known as RSA , after its inventors Rivest , Shamir , and Adleman .
This method is based on the assumption that it is computationally infeasible to factor very large integers on classical computers .
Though researchers are still many years away from creating a quantum computer capable of running the Shor algorithm , progress has been made .
Kumar ’s group , which uses photons as qubits , found that they can entangle two indistinguishable photons together in an optical fiber very efficiently by using the fiber ’s inherent nonlinear response .
They also found that no matter how far you separate the two photons in standard transmission fibers they remain entangled and are “ mysteriously ” connected to each other ’s quantum state .
For this paper , Kumar and his team used the fiber - generated indistinguishable photons to implement the most basic quantum computer task – a controlled - NOT gate , which allows two photonic qubits to interact .
“ This device that we demonstrated in the lab is a two - qubit device — nowhere near what ’s needed for a quantum computer — so what can you do with it " ” Kumar says .
“ It ’s nice to demonstrate something useful to give a boost to the field , and there are some problems at hand that can be solved right now using what we have . ”
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has funded the group ’s next effort to study how to implement a quantum network for physically demonstrating efficient public goods strategies , which are similar to the mechanism design theory that Nobel laureate Roger Myerson laid the foundation for while at Northwestern .
Kumar says such a network could help out with high stakes auctions , like if , for example , the Department of Defense wanted to build an expensive airplane and sends out a request for bids .
No one company can build the entire airplane , and there could be 15 companies that can build some part of the airplane , whether it ’s a navigation system or an engine .
But instead of just giving the project to the lowest bidder , the government could save public dollars by allowing these companies to bid in a complicated way that makes the process more efficient .
Maybe the engine company has worked with the fuselage company before and , if they worked together again , could be more efficient and less expensive than another two companies working together .
They could then send in a conditional set of bids , along with regular bids if the two companies were to work with other companies as well .
“ Figuring out the best possible outcome is possible with quantum computers , ” Kumar says .
“ Based on these fiber - type gates that we are building utilizing entanglement , the auctioneer has an efficient way of determining optimal outcomes when bidders make conditional bids .
When the computation is done , it reveals only the winning strategy , and all other bids disappear . ”
Kumar says they hope to perform this experiment sometime in the next year .

“ It ’s exactly the kind of consolidation I would hope the commission finds is not in the public interest because the free flow of information in this country is not accommodated by having fewer and fewer voices determine what is out there , ” Mr. Dorgan said .
“ They try to argue that there are all these outlets  the Internet , television , radio , newspapers and so on .
It may be more outlets , but it ’s the same ventriloquists .
You have five or six corporate interests that determine what most Americans see , hear and read . ”
Mr. Murdoch managed to control two local television stations through one permanent and one temporary waiver to the old rule .
But the renewal of the licenses of both stations , under review since 2006 , has been challenged by groups opposed to greater media consolidation .
“ He was outside the permissible rules to begin with , and since the broadcast licenses were under review , he ’s acquired The Wall Street Journal and now maybe Newsday , ” said Andrew Jay Schwartzman , the president of the Media Access Project , an advocacy organization committed to diversity of media voices .
Mr. Schwartzman has helped lead the effort against renewal of the New York broadcast licenses controlled by News Corporation .
Gary Ginsberg , a spokesman for News Corporation , declined to comment , as did Mr. Martin .
News Corporation has already joined a group of other broadcasters and newspaper companies in a lawsuit challenging the ownership restrictions as a violation of their First Amendment rights .
In the meantime , the company is expected to seek a permanent waiver from the commission to permit it to own the two stations and three newspapers .

Industry lobbyists said that News Corporation would tell the commission that its ownership interests pose no problem because New York is the most diverse media market in the world .
It is also expected to tell the commission that consolidation is vital to help the ailing newspaper industry  a variation of the claim made by Mr. Martin in justifying his decision to relax the old ownership rule modestly .
Washington Times reporters Bill Gertz and Jon Ward write that the State Department is resorting to the use of lie detectors in its investigation into improper access of the passport records of presidential candidates Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , and John McCain .
But reliance on a pseudoscientific test that is easily passed using simple countermeasures suggests that the investigation is perhaps not being taken as seriously as the State Department claims .
Regarding the polygraph plan , Gertz and Ward write :
The probe by State ’s inspector general will include polygraph tests for supervisors in the passport section to find out whether the three contract employees who accessed the records had a political motive or were part of a political operation to obtain personal data on Mr. Obama , Sen. John McCain or Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
No one should place any reliance on polygraph results .
A likely use of the polygraph in this instance would be to provide political CYA for the State Department : “ Look , there was no political motivation on the part of these employees or their supervisors , and they passed polygraphs to prove it ! ”
The battle over evolution continues at a fierce pace , as we discover in the Palm Beach Post today .
Three new counties are now added to our watchlist : St Lucie , Palm Beach , and Martin .
However , we need to keep our eyes on the ball .
The real fight that we must concentrate our energy on is at the state level .
There are a number of good quotes in that story , though :
The current standards , which are used as the basis for school curricula and standardized testing , refer only to biological “ changes over time . ”
That ’s not enough , said Mary Jane Tappen , executive director of the state Office of Mathematics and Science .
“ If you look in any biology textbook , you ’ll see a chapter or more on the theory of evolution , ” Tappen said .
“ There is a disconnect here .
If we really want to be clear , the accurate terminology should be part of our standards . ” … [ Middle School science teacher Gerard ]
O’Donnell said evolution is essential to many aspects of what he teaches and he never has heard a complaint from a parent .
” ‘ Why does mom have brown hair and I have blond hair ? ’ ” O’Donnell said . ” ‘ Why does a giraffe have a long neck ? ’
“ These are questions that are begging to have answers for . ” …
“ There has been the growing realization that our Florida graduates are not competing with students in just … Atlanta or New York , ” said Jim Warford , executive director of the Florida Association of School Administrators and former state public schools chancellor .
“ They ’re competing with students around the world . ”
The decisions about what is good science should be left to the scientific community , Warford said .
…
Intelligent design has not gone through the rigorous testing and scientific criticism to warrant time in science classrooms , he [ Wesley Elsberry , a marine biologist and Michigan State University researcher studying the evolution of intelligent behavior ] said .
“ This is not something that is accountable , ” Elsberry said .
“ Our students , in their limited time in a science class , they need to receive the information that has received scrutiny through the scientific process . ”
On that news story page is a sidebar on the left that says “ Know your theories ” and goes on to very briefly describe evolution and intelligent design .
That prompted me to write the following e-mail to the story author :
Mr. Jordan ,
First of all , I want to express my gratitude for the work you put into today ’s story “ Evolution furor flares on Florida science proposals . ”
It ’s obvious that you and Niels Heimeriks put a lot of time and effort into the story .
It ’s great to see where various education decision makers stand on this issue , and all the people you interviewed added quite a bit of depth to the piece .
However , there is one issue in the story that is important to address .
There is an error in fact in the story , specifically in the sidebar that briefly explains evolution and intelligent design .
The word theory has a definition in science that is far removed from the word ’s commonly used meaning .
Most people use the word theory to refer to their best guess or idea .
Someone might have a theory as what horse is going to win a race .
However , in science a theory means something much more concrete .
A theory is an explanation for a set of facts , observations , and evidence .
That theory undergoes rigorous testing and experimentation .
Once it withstands the test of time and testing , it accumulates the weight of the consensus of the scientific community .
Essentially , a scientific theory is the furthest thing from a guess , idea , or hunch .
Evolution is a scientific theory .
I welcome you to call Dr. Elsberry again in order to discuss this point .
Even though he is no longer living in Florida , he still has ties here and he is an active member of my organization , Florida Citizens for Science , via e-mails and phone calls .
On the other hand , intelligent design is not a scientific theory .
It ’s not even a viable hypothesis .
It has virtually zero acceptance or even interest in the scientific community , let alone a consensus , especially among scientists who use knowledge of evolution in their day - to - day work .
Beside Dr. Elsberry , I also invite you to call up any major university here in Florida and discuss the matter with working scientists in their life sciences departments .
Furthermore , I ’m sure biotech companies like Scripps also would have scientists working there who work with an understanding of evolution every day .
The reason I am devoting so much of this letter to the definition of theory and what is and is n’t a theory is that such confusion over the term fuels the fire in this public and political debate .
There is no debate in the scientific community over the viability of evolutionary theory .
But there is a huge debate in the public and political spheres .
A lot of it has to do with lack of scientific knowledge among citizens and decision makers .
To call evolution “ just a theory ” is a gross mischaracterization of science .
And to elevate intelligent design to the same theory status of evolution is quite simply an error in fact .
This is not my personal opinion , and I encourage you to verify what I have written here by talking to those who would know : the scientists .
I believe that a correction needs to be printed to clarify this important matter .
If there is anything else my organization or I can do for you , please do not hesitate to contact us .

I heard back from the reporter .
He had spoken with his editor about my letter and decided that a correction was not in order .
However , I agree with their reasoning , part of which was that a correction would barely be noticed .
They instead suggested that I chop down my above e-mail into a 250 - word letter to the editor .
I have now done so and shipped it off just a few minutes ago .
Furthermore , they suggested that I correspond with the newspaper ’s ombudsman .
I have also done that and will await a response .
Here is my shortened letter to the editor :
Re : “ Evolution furor flares on Florida science proposals ” Dec. 31 , 2007 .
Mr. Jordan and Mr. Heimeriks did a wonderful job on this in - depth story .
However , there is an error in fact in the story , specifically in the sidebar that briefly explains evolution and intelligent design .
The word theory has a definition in science that is far removed from its commonly used meaning .
Most people use the word theory to refer to their best guess or idea .
Someone might have a theory as what horse is going to win a race .
However , in science a theory means something much more concrete .
It ’s an explanation for a set of facts , observations , and evidence .
That theory undergoes rigorous testing and experimentation .
Once it withstands the test of time and testing , it accumulates the weight of the consensus of the scientific community .
Evolution is a scientific theory .
On the other hand , intelligent design is not a scientific theory .

It has virtually zero acceptance or even interest in the scientific community , let alone a consensus .
I invite you to call any major university here in Florida and discuss the matter with working scientists in the life sciences departments .
Furthermore , biotech companies like Scripps also have working scientists whose work is based on an understanding of evolution every day .
To call evolution “ just a theory ” is a gross mischaracterization of science .
And to elevate intelligent design to the same theory status of evolution is quite simply an error in fact .
Mancano meno di due settimane alle elezioni , e l’Italia affronta un momento difficile per molti motivi ( congiuntura internazionale , vari disastri interni , disaffezione degli elettori ) .
Non è questo il momento migliore per non andare a votare .
Non bisogna farsi prendere dall ’ ondata di qualunquismo e populismo che sembra attrarre molti indecisi : la cosiddetta antipolitica non è un rimedio , non fa altro che suscitare le emozioni e gli istinti della folla , del popolo .
Che non portano a una soluzione dei problemi : questi si che sono veri , sono le soluzioni che non vanno bene .
Come dice qualcuno , c’è da sperare che a nessuno salti in mente di risolvere le cose con la violenza .
L’unica vera arma che abbiamo è il voto .
Certo , si dice che ormai sono i partiti a decidere , e non più l’elettore .
Vero , ma sarebbe peggio se l’astensione fosse molto alta : i politici non aspettano altro ; si è eletti lo stesso , si ha la maggioranza lo stesso , sia che siano in pochi che in tanti a votare .
E’ una tattica utilizzata da molti quella di non votare , e poi lamentarsi della situazione : troppo comodo .
Molti si asterranno purtroppo , ma non potranno lamentarsi .
Hanno scelto di non scegliere , di non fare sentire la propria voce , per quanto debole questa sia stata resa dal sistema .
Per questo invito tutti ad andare a votare domenica 13 e luned ì 14 aprile !
In fondo non è solo un diritto , ma anche un dovere civico !
PS . : qui l’antipolitica c’è entrata di sfuggita , ma un giorno scriverò bene quello che penso…ah se lo scriverò …
The Washington Post revealed Friday that the FBI is continuing its systematic violation of Americans ’ Fourth Amendment guarantees against “ unreasonable searches and seizures . ”
A Justice Department report concluded that the Bureau had repeatedly abused its intelligence gathering “ privileges ” by issuing bogus “ national security letters ” ( NSLs ) from 2003 - 2006 .
On at least one occasion , the FBI relied on an illegally - issued NSL to circumvent a ruling by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to obtain records the secret court deemed protected by the First Amendment .
While the Bush regime claims that the Bureau requires sweeping authority to invade the privacy of American citizens to “ protect the homeland ” from the Afghan - Arab database of disposable intelligence assets , al - Qaeda , Justice Department Inspector General Glenn A .
Fine determined that fully “ 60 percent of the nearly 50,000 security letters issued that year [ 2006 ] by the FBI targeted Americans , ” according to Post reporter Dan Eggen .
Despite the FISA court twice rejecting Bureau requests to obtain sensitive private records , determining “ the ‘ facts ’ were too thin ” and the “ request implicated the target ’s First Amendment rights , ” the FBI used an NSL as a “ work around ” and proceeded anyway .
The stunning disregard for all legal norms under the Bush regime is encapsulated by FBI general counsel Valerie E. Caproni ’s statement to investigators that “ it was appropriate to issue the letters in such cases because she disagreed with the court ’s conclusions . ”
Fine asserted in the Inspector General ’s report that the Bureau has recklessly used NSLs to sweep - up vast quantities of telephone numbers and internet searches with a single request .
Jameel Jaffer , national security director at the American Civil Liberties Union , told Eggen ,
“ The fact that these are being used against U.S. citizens , and being used so aggressively , should call into question the claim that these powers are about terrorists and not just about collecting information on all kinds of people .
They ’re basically using national security letters to evade legal requirements that would be enforced if there were judicial oversight . ”
Dean Boyd , a Justice Department spokesperson , said Fine ’s report “ should come as no surprise , ” tendentiously claiming new “ procedural changes ” would ameliorate future problems .
According to FBI Assistant Director John Miller , a former correspondent and anchor for ABC News , NSL requests “ are now reviewed by a lawyer before they are sent to a telephone company , Internet service provider or other targets . ”
Meanwhile , the Bush administration has quietly stripped the independent Intelligence Oversight Board ( IOB ) of much of its authority to root out illegal spying activities by the intelligence “ community , ” Boston Globe journalist Charlie Savage reports .
A little noticed February 29 executive order signed by Bush gutted the board ’s mandate to refer illegal activities by an ever - expanding national security state to the Justice Department .
According to Savage ,
Bush ’s order also terminated the board ’s authority to oversee each intelligence agency ’s general counsel and inspector general , and it erased a requirement that each inspector general file a report with the board every three months .
Now only the agency directors will decide whether to report any potential lawbreaking to the panel , and they have no schedule for checking in .
In other words , we ’ll police ourselves .
Move along !
The IOB was created in 1976 by president Gerald Ford following congressional revelations that a panoply of U.S. intelligence entities including the CIA , FBI , NSA and DIA , had engaged in illegal domestic spying operations , organized the assassination of foreign leaders , incited coups and other destabilization campaigns around the world to advance US geopolitical goals during America ’s anticommunist Cold War jihad .
On the domestic front , the FBI ’s COINTELPRO , the CIA ’s Operation CHAOS , the NSA ’s Project SHAMROCK and the DIA ’s domestic operations under control of various Military Intelligence Groups , conducted illegal surveillance of antiwar , socialist , feminist and black liberation groups targeted for “ disruption and neutralization ” during the 1960s and ’70s .
Federal intelligence agents , in addition to conducting illegal surveillance and infiltration of domestic dissident groups , worked closely with local police “ red squads ” and actually financed and controlled far - right terrorist gangs such as the Minutemen , the San Diego - based Secret Army Organization and the Legion of Justice in Chicago .
Dozens of attacks , including fire - bombings , physical assaults and attempted “ targeted assassinations ” of vocal antiwar activists and socialist organizers were the result .
Even after the “ COINTELPRO era ” presumably ended with the 1971 Media , PA raid by the “ Citizens Committee to Investigate the FBI ” that exposed the Bureau ’s illegal operations , abuses continued — and multiplied .
* In 1979 , five members of the Communist Workers Party were murdered by a combined Ku Klux Klan / American Nazi Party hit team in Greensboro , NC .
The anticommunist death squad had been recruited , organized and led by an FBI infiltrator , Edward Dawson .
Dawson was also a paid informant for the Greensboro Police Department .
* During the 1980s , the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador ( CISPES ) , opposed to U.S. intervention in support of El Salvador ’s death squad state , was infiltrated by FBI informants and far - rightists ’ associated with Rev. Sun Myung Moon ’s Collegiate Association for the Research of Principles ( CARP ) .
The ultra-right wing Council for Inter - American Security , working as public relations apologists for death squad leader Roberto D’Aubuisson , compiled a dossier on CISPES that was subsequently passed to the FBI .
The Bureau then recommended “ active measures ” be taken to destroy the group .
* In May 1990 , Earth First !
leaders Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney were targets of a politically - motivated assassination attempt .
A bomb was detonated in their car by unknown assailants .
At the FBI ’s instigation , Oakland Police immediately arrested the pair and charged them with terrorist crimes .
After two months of adverse media publicity targeting the victims , charges were dropped .
Twelve years later , the environmentalists were awarded $ 4.4 million in a federal civil suit when a jury determined the FBI had acted recklessly in their handling of the case .
The FBI was doomed when their own forensic lab specialist testified the bomb was under the car seat not on the floorboard behind Bari as Bureau counterterrorism “ experts ” alleged .
* Counterintelligence Field Activity ( CIFA ) is another in a long - line of corrupt Pentagon “ public - private partnerships . ”
Initially authorized by president William Clinton ’s Presidential Decision Directive ( PDD ) - 75 , CIFA and its associated TALON / CORNERSTONE database provide “ threat assessments ” for DoD facilities and personnel .
One CIFA - supported database project , managed by defense giant Northrop Grumman was designated “ Person Search . ”
It was designed to “ provide comprehensive information about people of interest . ”
Its intended use included the ability to search government and commercial databases “ to track and monitor activities of suspect individuals . ”
However , numerous reports and internal memoranda published by the National Security Archive clearly document that CIFA ’s military and private contractors systematically conducted surveillance and data - mining operations against the antiwar movement .
The Archive has posted 9 TALON reports collected by the 902nd Military Intelligence Group documenting CIFA ’s repressive activities .
Originally falling under the purview of Stephen A. Cambone , Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence , CIFA ’s intelligence and data - mining programs are being spun - off to private contractors .
Cambone has since gone on to an executive position with QinetiQ North America .
QinetiQ signed a $ 30 million Pentagon contract in January 2008 for unspecified “ security services ” to CIFA , according to CorpWatch investigative reporter , Tim Shorrock .
* CISPES is again a target of the Justice Department .
Citing the Foreign Registration Act of 1938 , Bush ’s DOJ is questioning the organization ’s relationship with the Farabundo Marti Front for National Liberation ( FMLN ) , a legal political party in El Salvador .
With elections looming in 2009 , the Bush regime is terrified that another Latin American country will elect a leftist government , thus further weakening US regional domination and control over its shrinking imperialist empire .
The Bush plan ?
Target solidarity activists in an attempt to smear the group as “ foreign agents , ” or worse .
The gutting of the Intelligence Oversight Board ’s authority to investigate criminal activities by the Bush administration comes at a time when domestic spying operations have multiplied exponentially .
Last week The Wall Street Journal exposed the NSA ’s data - mining capabilities and revealed that the agency was targeting millions of Americans in its electronic driftnet and has compiled terabytes of data on every aspect of lives .
While administration apologists claim such sweeping and intrusive spying is necessary to “ keep America safe , ” if history is any judge of past intelligence abuses these practices are designed instead , to “ keep America in line , ” ever - fearful and obedient servants of our capitalist masters .
How proud the Clintonistas must be .
They have learned how to rival what Hillary once termed the “ vast right - wing conspiracy ” in the effort to destroy a viable Democratic leader who dares to stand in the way of their ambitions .
The tactics used to kneecap Barack Obama are the same as had been turned on Bill Clinton in earlier times , from radical - baiting associates to challenging his resolve in protecting the nation from foreign enemies .
Sen .
Clinton ’s eminently sensible and centrist — to a fault — opponent is now viewed as weak and even vaguely unpatriotic because he is thoughtful .
Neither Karl Rove nor Dick Morris could have done a better job .
On primary election day in Pennsylvania , even with polls showing her well ahead in that state , Hillary went lower in her grab for votes .
Seizing upon a question as to how she would respond to a nuclear attack by Iran , which does n’t have nuclear weapons , on Israel , which does , Hillary mocked reasoned discourse by promising to “ totally obliterate them , ” in an apparent reference to the population of Iran .
That is not a word gaffe ; it is an assertion of the right of our nation to commit genocide on an unprecedented scale .
Should n’t the potential leader of a nation that used nuclear bombs to obliterate hundreds of thousands of innocent Japanese employ extreme caution before making such a threat ?
Neither the Japanese then nor the Iranian people now were in a position to hold their leaders accountable , and to approve such collective punishment of innocents is to endorse terrorism .
This from a candidate who attacked her opponent for suggesting targeted strikes against militants in Pakistan and derided his openness to negotiations with other national leaders as an irresponsible commitment on the part of a contender for the presidency .
Clearly the heat of a campaign is not the proper setting for consideration of a response to a threat from a nation that is a long way from developing nuclear weapons .
Obviously the danger of Iran ’s developing such weapons can be met with a range of alternatives , from the diplomatic to the military , that do not involve genocide and at any rate must be considered in moral and not solely political terms .
Or is it base political ambition that would guide Clinton if she received that middle - of - the - night phone call ?
If so , it cannot be assumed that Hillary Clinton as president would be less irrationally hawkish and more restrained in the unleashing of military force than John McCain .
The latter , at least , has personal experience with the true , on - the - ground costs of militarism gone wild .
Yes , I know that McCain still holds out the hope of winning the Iraq war that both he and Hillary originally endorsed , but for Clinton to raise the rhetoric against Iran in the midst of a campaign is hardly the path to Mideast peace , whether it concerns Israel or Iraq .
It is bizarre that a politician who bought into the phony threat about Iraq ’s nonexistent WMD arsenal now plays political games with the alleged threat posed by Iran .
The war has accomplished only one major change in the configuration of Mideast power : Iran now holds uncontested supremacy as the region ’s key player .
Whatever chance there is for stability in Iraq now depends on the blessings of the ayatollahs of Iran , whose surrogates were put in power in Baghdad as a consequence of the American invasion .
It is totally hypocritical for Clinton or McCain to now talk about getting tough with Iran over the nuclear weapons issue , when both contributed so mightily to squandering U.S. leverage over Tehran .
To meet that potential nuclear weapons threat from Iran requires a serious , non-rhetorical , multinational response that makes clear that no nation has the right to obliterate the population of another , and that nations , even our own , that claim that right should be challenged as unacceptably barbaric .
Instead , Clinton played into the thoughts of fanatics throughout the world who believe that might makes right and who take the United States — which spends more on its military than the rest of the world combined ( including many billions on new sophisticated and “ usable ” nuclear weapons ) — as both their enemy and an example to emulate .
What better argument do the ayatollahs need to justify their obtaining a nuclear “ deterrent ” than that the possible leader of the first nation to develop nuclear weapons , and the only one to ever use them to kill people , now threatens the people of Iran with obliteration ?
Sigh .
Google as a company takes privacy very seriously .
I personally feel strongly about protecting our users ’ privacy .
So I ’m frustrated by a recent study that Privacy International did , and I want to know if I ’m off - base in my reaction .
I got back home from SMX and I ’m surfing the web when I see this AP article entitled “ Watchdog group slams Google on privacy ” :
In a report released Saturday , London - based Privacy International assigned Google its lowest possible grade .
The category is reserved for companies with “ comprehensive consumer surveillance and entrenched hostility to privacy . ”
None of the 22 other surveyed companies — a group that included Yahoo Inc. , Microsoft Corp . and AOL — sunk to that level , according to Privacy International .
So I surf over to Privacy International ( PI ) to read the actual report , and I have to be honest with you — it made me mad .
But I try not to blog when I ’m angry , so I decided to sleep on it .
After sleeping on it , I ’m still pretty frustrated with Privacy International ’s conclusions .
Here ’s my take .
Google did n’t leak user queries
In this past year , AOL released millions of raw queries from hundreds of thousands of users .
Within days , a journalist had determined the identity of an AOL user from the queries that AOL released .
But AOL got a better grade than Google .
Google did n’t give millions of user queries to the Dept. of Justice
In 2005 /2006 , the Department of Justice sent subpoenas to 34 different companies requesting users ’ queries and other data .
In fact , the original subpoena requested all queries done by users for two full months .
AOL , Microsoft , and Yahoo all gave some amount of users ’ queries to the Department of Justice .
Google fought that subpoena ( full disclosure : I filed a declaration in that case ) .
The judge sided with Google ; no queries from Google users were given to the DOJ .
But Yahoo , Microsoft , and AOL got better grades in this report than Google .
Google will anonymize query logs
In March , Google announced that it would begin anonymizing its logs after 18 - 24 months .
Google has continued to communicate on the issue , including a post on the Google blog in May discussing the reasoning behind that decision .
In fact , we talk a lot about privacy , from blog posts to Op - Ed pieces in the Financial Times .
To the best of my knowledge , no other major search engine has followed suit in a plan to anonymize user logs .
Misc bits
Other parts of the study just baffle me .
The report claims ( I am not making this up ) that “ Every [ Google ] corporate announcement involves some new practice involving surveillance . ”
I know that my years of working at Google may bias me , but does that sound impartial ?
Let ’s test that claim .
Here ’s a Google corporate announcement we made on our blog in March .
Google expanded our support for open - source in our third annual “ Summer of Code ” :
Last year we paid 630 students from 450 schools in 90 countries $ 4,500 each to work on open source software projects .
These projects , selected by some 100 open source mentoring organizations from over 6,000 applications , provided students with invaluable real - world programming experience .
That ’s over three million dollars in open - source development last year , with even more money set aside for this year .
The program introduces students to open - source programming .
In return the open - source community and regular users benefit from students ’ projects .
Does Google ’s Summer of Code program have anything to do with surveillance ?
Nope , not even close .
Conclusions
Sigh .
Okay , take deep breaths , Matt .
My spleen is vented .
🙂
Personally , I think Privacy International should feel remorse about walking right past several other companies to single out Google for their lowest rating .
But I think that there ’s a larger danger here too .
I believe this report could corrode earnest efforts to improve privacy at companies around the internet .
Why ?
Because the bottom - line takeaway message that I got from the report is that a company can work hard on privacy issues and still get dragged into the mud .
Consider : in the last year or so , other companies gave users ’ queries to the government , leaked millions of raw user queries , or even sold user queries and still came off better than Google did .
Wait — someone sold my data ?
If I ran a privacy group , I would * find out which ISPs sell their user data * .
While Privacy International was conducting its six - month - long study , credit bureau Experian committed to buy Hitwise for $ 240 million dollars .
From the press release :
Hitwise collects and aggregates information from Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) on how over 25 million consumers use and search the Internet in the US , UK , Australia and other countries in Asia Pacific .
If you check Hitwise ’s most recent blog post about UK site Gumtree , they discuss collecting user queries : “ Hitwise captured 4,201 unique terms sending visits to the website . ”
Did those queries come from opted - in users , or from ISPs ?
If I ran a privacy organization , I ’d want to know which ISPs sell user data .
I ’ve pointed out before that ISPs have a superset of data on a user compared to almost any other online company .
Some have suggested that ISPs sell user data for as little as 40 cents per month per user .
It looks like Privacy International did n’t include any ISPs in its study of online companies .
Luckily , some other folks are looking into it .
A Wired blog enlisted readers and started to get some answers on the topic .
If Privacy International really wants to focus on Google rather than digging into companies that are , you know , actually buying and selling user data , that ’s their choice .
🙂
Note that I have nothing against Hitwise , Compete , or ISPs at all ; I just think it ’s unwarranted to call out Google when user data is being bought , sold , given to the government in the millions , or being leaked — by other companies .
And I think Privacy International missed the mark badly by giving those companies a better rating than Google , or by not including the right online companies in their study .
Now it ’s your turn .
Am I off - base on this issue ?
Or did this study miss the mark ?
( I ’m going to bed now , so I ’ll approve comments in the morning . )
MIT scientists propose that blood may help us think , in addition to its well - known role as the conveyor of fuel and oxygen to brain cells .
" We hypothesize that blood actively modulates how neurons process information , " Christopher Moore , a principal investigator in the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT , explained in an invited review in the October issue of the Journal of Neurophysiology .
" Many lines of evidence suggest that blood does something more interesting than just delivering supplies .
If it does modulate how neurons relay signals , that changes how we think the brain works . "
According to Moore 's Hemo - Neural Hypothesis , blood is not just a physiological support system but actually helps control brain activity .
Specifically , localized changes in blood flow affect the activity of nearby neurons , changing how they transmit signals to each other and hence regulating information flow throughout the brain .
Ongoing studies in Moore 's laboratory support this view , showing that blood flow does modulate individual neurons .
Moore 's theory has implications for understanding brain diseases such as Alzheimer 's , schizophrenia , multiple sclerosis and epilepsy .
" Many neurological and psychiatric diseases have associated changes in the vasculature , " said Moore , who is also an assistant professor in MIT 's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences .
" Most people assume the symptoms of these diseases are a secondary consequence of damage to the neurons .
But we propose that they may also be a causative factor in the disease process , and that insight suggests entirely new treatments . "
For example , in epilepsy people often have abnormal blood vessels in the brain region where the seizures occur , and the hypothesis suggests this abnormal flow may induce epileptic onset .
If so , drugs that affect blood flow may provide an alternative to current therapies .
The hypothesis also has important implications for functional magnetic resonance imaging , or fMRI , a widely used brain scanning method that indicates local changes in blood flow .
" Scientists looking at fMRI currently regard blood flow and volume changes as a secondary process that only provides read - out of neural activity , " explained Rosa Cao , a graduate student in Moore 's lab and co-author of the paper .
" If blood flow shapes neural activity and behavior , then fMRI is actually imaging a key contributor to information processing . "
Again , studies in Moore 's lab support this interpretation .
For example , his fMRI studies of the sensory homunculus -- the brain 's detailed map of body parts like fingers , toes , arms , and legs -- show that when more blood flows to the area representing the fingertip , people more readily perceive a light tap on the finger .
This suggests that blood affects the function of this brain region and that information about blood flow can predict future brain activity .
This finding does not undermine prior studies , but adds another , richer layer to their interpretation and makes fMRI an even more useful tool than it already is .
How could blood flow affect brain activity ?
Blood contains diffusible factors that could leak out of vessels to affect neural activity , and changes to blood volume could affect the concentration of these factors .
Also , neurons and support cells called glia may react to the mechanical forces of blood vessels expanding and contracting .
In addition , blood influences the temperature of brain tissue , which affects neural activity .
To Moore 's knowledge , the Hemo - Neural Hypothesis offers an entirely new way of looking at the brain .
" No one ever includes blood flow in models of information processing in the brain , " he said .
One historical exception is the philosopher Aristotle , who thought the circulatory system was responsible for thoughts and emotions .
Perhaps the ancient Greeks were on to something .
This work was funded by Thomas F. Peterson , the Mitsui Foundation and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research at MIT .
A version of this article appeared in MIT Tech Talk on October 17 , 2007 ( download PDF ) .
He poured scorn on the modern trend to treat a new version or update of an operating system as a cause for major celebration and marketing .
" An operating system should be completely invisible , " he said .
" To Microsoft and Apple ( it is ) a way to control the whole environment ... to force people to upgrade their applications and hardware . "
As for his own operating system , Linus said the most exciting developments were Linux 's improving green credentials , and a push into mobile devices such as the One Laptop per Child project and Asus 's new ultra-cheap Eee PC .
The latter , he said , could be a sign that Asian hardware manufacturers were starting to bypass Western commercial operating systems in order to get more control over their products .
" That 's the primary area that open source ( software like Linux ) is useful .
Software is really expensive to produce and takes years .
If you 're a hardware company you can't really afford that , you either have to be controlled from the outside or take a pre-existing software stack that you can make changes to . "
Linux would be an obvious choice for anything from full - blown PCs to phones or video players , Torvalds said .
" I think it 's one pretty exciting possibility and it's where the market really wants to go , " he said .
" The hardware in a mobile device now outweighs anything in a desktop 15 years ago - which is where Linux came from .
The ( Linux ) kernel is already being used in things like cell phones , but the problems have been in the UI ( user interface ) . "
He said he finally saw Linux as able to boast genuine green credentials , after years of hard work .
He and fellow programmers modified almost every part of the operating system 's core to improve power management .
They also enhanced the ability to track down the most power - hungry parts of a hardware and software system .
" Everybody wants to be power - aware , " he said .
" It 's not just that you want to be green - it 's eating up your batteries . "
Linus also praised Google for its contribution to the development of open source software , after a shaky start in which it had been a " black hole " for talented programmers .
My friend Phil Attey asks why Obama keeps mentioning gays and lesbians in his speeches – speeches he makes to the public at large , not just gay audiences – and Hillary never does .
Phil writes :
Last month , a gay Philadelphian LGBT publisher raised the issue that Senator Obama , though often addressing LGBT issues and including us in his major speeches , was not granting his publication an exclusive interview .
Senator Obama quickly addressed the issue and granted an exclusive interview to the national LGBT publication , The Advocate .
Tonight , following the Pennsylvania Primary , Senator Obama once again showed his commitment to our community by including us in his address to the nation .
Senator Clinton , speech , once again , did not include us , and it brings up the issue that hers never do .
Phil is right .
And he ’s not the only one to notice :
But Obama speaks movingly of gay equality , and not just before gay audiences .
He has raised the issue among white farmers and in black churches , where the message is both unwelcome and needed .
Clinton , by contrast , rarely raises the issue on her own , never does so before unfriendly audiences , and seems reluctant even to say the word “ gay . ” Obama “ gets it ” in a way that no previous candidate for president has .
Part of this is generational , but it is nonetheless real .
Obama mentions us in his speeches , a lot .
And yes , Hillary will say those are just words .
But you know , Obama was willing to chastize his own community for their homophobia in a speech given on Martin Luther King ’s birthday in MLK ’s own church to thousands of black leaders .
Those are words that matter .
Here ’s to hoping that Hillary can find it in herself to utter the word gay ( and even lesbian ) in a setting that is n’t limited to a gay audience .
One more thing , watch this interview Hillary did with the gay cable network , Logo .
First , the issue comes up about her never using the g-word , and she does use it , once during an entire 5 minute interview with a gay station about gay issues , while mentioning “ gay organizations . ”
But notice how repeatedly in the interview Hillary hesitates and stumbles at places where you would naturally expect her to say the word “ gay ” – she does n’t say it – she kind of stops , does n’t say gay , then moves on .
Watch the video for yourself .
She ’s not comfortable saying the word .
Obama is .
I think that tells you something about how they feel about the issue inside .
It ’s likely generational – he ’s in his 40s , my generation , she ’s 60 .
A transcript of the worst part follows the video , below – note particularly the question and her answer 1 minute and 2 seconds in :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hep7iVSOswo]
1:02 LOGO : “ Your opponent , Senator Obama , regularly mentions gay people in his stump speech …
You do n’t mention gay rights all the time in your stump speech , you do when you ’re in front of gay audiences , why is that ? ”
1:21 CLINTON : “ Well I do mention , uh , from time to time , um , you know I do n’t mention , you know , everything in every speech that I give , but uh people , you know , know how committed I am and they know what I ’ve done , and that I led the efforts uh to try and defeat the Federal Marriage Amendment , working with you know all of the major uh gay rights organizations , uh , so you know I ’m gonna continue to not just talk about what I will do but demonstrate by my actions what I have done and will do . ”

Last year the union warned that the world faced ' the sixth great extinction of life on earth ' as mammals , amphibians , birds , insects , fish and plants were being lost at ' unprecedented rates ' .
One in four mammals and one in eight bird species have been labelled ' threatened ' .
News that the list will show another deterioration will prompt fresh warnings about the danger of ecosystems collapsing , leading to problems with food supply and other ' biological services ' such as the provision of clean water .
Although some species are expected to be put into ' safer ' categories after successful projects to protect them , more are believed to face a vulnerable future .
' It 's a natural process : species are born , they evolve and they die out , ' said Mark Wright , science adviser to WWF , formerly the World Wildlife Fund .
' What 's different now [ is ] for every million species we 'd expect one to die out per year ; but we 're ranging between 100 and 1,000 times faster than that .'
The union says that 784 species of plant and animal have become extinct in the past 500 years , with 65 recorded as extinct in the wild .
It blames ' human actions ' for this : including habitat loss due to urbanisation , agriculture and deforestation ; hunting for meat , medicines and luxury products , and other modern problems - such as drugs for cattle which are blamed for poisoning 99 per cent of three species of vultures in India .
Experts also warn that expected climate change will push many species out of their habitats and some close to extinction - most dramatically polar bears .
Vulnerable species range from the Iberian lynx and snow leopard to the less glamorous partula snail from French Polynesia .
Some , like the Arabian oryx in Oman and Saudi Arabia , have been pushed to extinction in the wild , reintroduced , and are under threat again .
The Red List already monitors 41,000 species and is trying to increase that to 50,000 - 60,000 by next year .
The growing threats to species across the world should be a warning for humans , said Wright : ' These habitats provide us with food , water and so on : that 's why we should be concerned . '
Experts also warn the world cannot rely on captive breeding programmes to ' save ' species which become extinct in the wild .
One reason is the interconnectedness of complex eco-systems : ' Every species on the planet has a role to play in nature : losing that is going to have an impact , ' warned Nick Lindsay , acting head of field conservation for the Zoological Society of London .
' It 's not just the food chain , take the linkage to prey : rhinos and elephants play a key role in keeping what would otherwise be closed [ forested ] environments open for other animals . '
Another fear is that when species die there is no incentive to protect their habitat ; and in the case of ' flagship ' species protected areas can lose their special status , leaving remaining ecosystems at the mercy of human damage , said Raul Matamoros , campaigns officer for the International Fund for Animal Welfare .
However , for many the problems of relying on animals in captivity are more personal .
' Animals have evolved to be in their environments and that 's where we want to see them , ' said Lindsay .

BAE sold Tornado and Hawk jets to Saudi Arabia under the deal Former Attorney General Lord Goldsmith has defended the decision to scrap the corruption probe into a £ 43bn BAE arms deal with Saudi Arabia .
The High Court has said the decision by the Serious Fraud Office was unlawful .
But Lord Goldsmith said it was right because the inquiry might have jeopardised national security .
BAE maintains it acted lawfully and the SFO is now considering whether or not to re-open its investigation into the al - Yamamah controversy .
Intelligence
It originally launched a probe into the deal with Saudi Arabia in 1985 , which provided Tornado and Hawk jets plus other military equipment .
Tony Blair said that the Saudis had privately threatened to cut intelligence co-operation with Britain unless the inquiry was stopped .
Lord Goldsmith announced in December 2006 that the investigation into the arms company was to be discontinued but it was SFO Director Robert Wardle who took the decision .
Lord Goldsmith said he hoped the SFO would appeal
The peer told Sky News he did not regret the decision : " It was of course uncomfortable ... but I believe it was the right decision to take , in the public interest , in order to prevent terrorism . "
He said he had been convinced the case was " doomed to failure " and not worth pursuing further given the risks .
" The consequence would have been that we would have waited for 18 months , all this damage to the country , all this damage in relation to terrorism could have taken place and at the end of the day we would have said ' terribly sorry , but we 're not going to proceed with this case in any event ' .
" It would have been a dereliction of duty to have taken that view and it would have been absolutely no comfort to people who , heaven forbid , had been injured or lost loved ones in a terrorist attack to say ' we 're terribly sorry but we thought we ought to wait 18 months to see if this case could go ahead ' . "
' Unrealistic '
The High Court judgement found that Mr Wardle had failed to satisfy the court that all that could reasonably be done had been to resist the threats .
But Lord Goldsmith criticised that approach .
" The final core decision of the court , as I read it , I fear is rather unrealistic because what they say is that instead of concentrating on the effects of what they say was a threat , what Robert Wardle ought to have done was to consider how that threat could be resisted .
" I 'm afraid that in the real world , the risks to national security , the risks from a withdrawal of Saudi Arabian co-operation in relation to intelligence and terrorism prevention , would have been very , very serious and that 's what all the experts said and that 's the reality he had to face . "
He said he hoped the Serious Fraud Office would appeal against the decision .
' Blackmail ' But Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called for the inquiry to be reopened .
He said : " I want it restarted because we cannot allow the precedent to be set that blackmail by other powers or individuals should stop the course of justice . "
But he said he was opposed to government proposals to give the attorney general specific powers to intervene in future .
" The present situation where the SFO can do so is certainly something which should not be altered in the way the government now proposes .
" I am very uncomfortable with the scope of that power at the moment and I do n't want to see it widened , " he said .
Shadow chancellor George Osborne said they would back the new powers - but only with increased safeguards .
" We believe there are circumstances where the attorney general should be able to stop a prosecution in the interests of national security , " he said .
" But importantly , and this is a distinction as I understand it with what the government is proposing in new legislation , we think that decision should be subject to judicial scrutiny .
" Yes , give the attorney general the power but make sure that decision can be scrutinised by the judges . "

What are these ?
NASA said today it would team with m2 mi to develop very small satellites , called nanosats which weigh between 11 to 110lb , for the development of telecommunications and networking services in space .
NASA says large groups of nanosatellites can be grouped in a constellation , that will be placed in low Earth orbit to offer new telecommunications and networking systems and services .
NASA and m2mi will develop what they call fifth generation telecommunications and networking systems for TCP / IP - based networks and related services .
The cooperative effort will combine NASA 's expertise in nanosensors , wireless networks and nanosatellite technologies with m2 mi's unique capabilities in software technology , sensors , global system awareness , adaptive control and commercialization capabilities .
Fifth Generation technology , or 5G , incorporates VoIP , video , data , wireless , and an integrated machine - to - machine intelligence layer , for information exchange and use , NASA said .
Nanosatellites will be produced using low - cost , mass - production techniques , according to m2mi .
" The constellation will provide a robust , global , space - based , high - speed network for communication , data storage and Earth observations , " said m2 mi Chief Executive Officer Geoff Brown .
The move is but the latest NASA has made to develop and promote the widespread use of nanosatellites .
In November , NASA said it built a tiny , low - cost satellite it says will be ideal for adventure seekers or companies with high - tech space applications who need to get into space quickly and relatively inexpensively .
The Fast , Affordable , Science and Technology SATellite ( FASTSAT ) is 39.5 inches in diameter - not much larger than an exercise ball .
It is hexagonally shaped and clocks in at a little less than 200 Lbs .
It can carry a payload up to 110 Lbs .
NASA in the past has worked to develop a volleyball - sized Miniature Autonomous Extravehicular Robotic Camera ( Mini AERCam ) .
The Mini AERCam is designed to help astronauts and ground crews see outside the spacecraft during a mission .
During ground - based testing , the device was able to work with the docking system that serves as an exterior home base for housing and refueling the nanosatellite .
The Mini AERCam prototype is just 7.5 inches in diameter and weighs only 10 pounds .
The post More Data Beats Better Algorithms generated a lot of interest and comments .
Since there are too many comments to address individually , I 'm addressing some of them in this post .
1 . Why should we have to choose between data and algorithms ?
Why not have more data and better algorithms ?
A . There are two parts to the answer .
The first is resource limits ; if , for example , you are a startup that has to choose where to invest resources -- in gathering or licensing data , or hiring the next PhD -- then I think beyond a certain level you are better off getting more data .
If you a startup that does n't need to make that choice , more power to you .
The second reason is more subtle , and has to do with the structure and computational complexity of algorithms .
To a first approximation , simple data mining algorithms ( e.g. , page rank ; market baskets ; clustering ) take time roughly linear in the size of their input data , while more complicated machine learning algorithms take time that is quadratic or even cubic in the size of their input data ( e.g. , Support Vector Machines ; Singular Value Decomposition ) .
As a simple rule of thumb , simple linear algorithms scale to large data sets ( hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes ) , while quadratic and cubic algorithms cannot scale and therefore need some data size reduction as a preprocessing step .
For those familiar with Computer Science basics , scalable algorithms involve only a fixed number of sequential scans and sorts of data ( since large data sets must necessarily reside on disk and not RAM ) .
Most algorithms that require random access to data or take time greater than O ( N log N ) are not scalable to large data sets .
For example , they cannot easily be implemented using methods such as MapReduce .
Thus , choosing a more complex algorithm can close the door to using large data sets , at least at reasonable budgets that do n't involve terabytes of RAM .
2 . Does your argument hold only for the addition of an additional independent data set ( as in the IMDB / Netflix case ) , or does it hold also when we add more of the same kind of data ( e.g. , more user ratings in the case of Netflix ) ?
Adding independent data usually makes a huge difference .
For example , in the case of web search , Google made a big leap by adding links and anchor text , which are independent data sets from the text of web pages .
In the case of AdWords , the CTR data was an independent data set from the bid data .
And Google went even a step further : they became a domain registrar so they could add even more data about domain ownership and transfers into their ranking scheme .
Google consistently has believed and bet on more data , while trumpeting the power of their algorithms .
You might think that it wo n't help much to add more of the same data , because diminishing returns would set in .
This is true in some cases ; however , in many important cases , adding more of the same data makes a bigger difference than you 'd think .
These are cases where where the application sees the data embedded in a very - high - dimensional space .
For example , in the case of Netflix , we can think of dimensions as users ( or movies ) ; and in the case of web search , the dimensions are k - grams of terms .
In such cases , the available data is usually very sparse and has a long - tailed distribution .
For example , in the Netflix example , we have ratings available for less than 1 % of all movie - user pairs .
We can add lots of ratings data before diminishing returns becomes a real issue -- say add 10 times more .
In such cases , adding lots more of the same kind of data makes a big difference .
3 . Can you provide more specifics about the algorithms used in the student projects ?
I do n't plan to do so at this time , because I do n't have permission from the student teams and do n't wish to jeopardize their chances in the Netflix competition .
MIAMI  Tania Julin remembers hearing the distinct sound of feet racing through the dark Panamanian forest moments before armed masked men burst through the door of the modest hut she shared with her husband .
Ms. Julin and her husband , Mark Rich , were missionaries living in a remote village just miles from the Colombian border when the gunmen  leftist rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia , or FARC  descended on the village .
At gunpoint , Ms. Julin was ordered to pack a bag for her husband , and then Mr. Rich and two other men , Charles David Mankin and Richard Lee Tenenoff , were marched out of their homes , flanked by the gunmen who chattered in Spanish and fired into the air .
“ That was the last time we saw ours husbands , ” Ms. Julin said , recalling the night of Jan. 31 , 1993 .
Poor , poor client number 9 , Eliot Spitzer .
Having suffered a humiliating week in the US press , corporate Canada is now taking its shot at the disgraced New York governor .
That 's the actual print ad which Virgin Mobile will run in Toronto newspapers this week with the following subtext :
" At Virgin Mobile , you 're more than just a number .
When you call us we 'll treat you like a person , not a client .
Whether you 're # 9 or # 900 , you 'll get hooked up with somebody who'll finally treat you just how you want to be treated . "
Let 's just see if Spitzer swallows the jab , or comes out fighting this unauthorized use of his image .

Cities are changing .
Populations and economies in Oakland , Dakar , and beyond .
Globally , our cities are changing from population to economies near and far .
We , as designers , community members , leaders , and environmental stewards , need to be prepared to champion and shift the issues of our current structures to more equitable systems .
We must fight to provide access for all to quality public spaces and create opportunities for the masses to enter and engage in our professions .

If nothing else results from the conversation America is having , however dysfunctionally , about Rev. Wright and Obama ’s speech , we ca n’t help but learn to take the black church seriously as the ultra - complicated reality it truly is .
It ’s not just about rousing gospel songs , old ladies in big hats , and ministers foaming at the mouth — all insulting sins even I have long committed .
I was raised a hard - core black Protestant and considered myself well versed in its contours , but I now find myself challenged and informed in ways I ’d never expected .
I never really understood the significance of the black prophetic tradition , or that it even was one .
Nor did I properly understand or evaluate the schism that the modern black church ’s focus on prosperity , vice prophecy , represents .
That history is rich and troubling .
It also situates the black church at a Gladwellian tipping point ; will the current controversy silence the voice of black prophecy and strident critique and replace it with a ‘ feel good , get rich ’ religiosity to which whites wo n’t object ?
From CNN this week :
The contemporary white church has largely accepted King as a religious hero .
Yet some observers say there is one religious community that continues to shun King — the largest black churches .
Forty years after his death , King remains a prophet without honor in the institution that nurtured him , some black preachers and scholars say .
They also say King ’s “ prophetic ” model of ministry — one that confronted political and economic institutions of power — has been sidelined by the prosperity gospel .
Prosperity ministers preach that God rewards the faithful with wealth and spiritual power .
Prosperity pastors such as Bishop T.D. Jakes have become the most popular preachers in the black church .
They ’ve also become brands .
They ’ve built megachurches and business empires with the prosperity message .
Black prophetic pastors rarely fill the pews like other pastors , though , because their message is so inflammatory , says Henry Wheeler , a church historian .
Prophetic pastors like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , the former pastor for Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama , often enrage people because they proclaim God ’s judgment on nations , he says .
“ It ’s dangerous to be prophetic , ” said Wheeler , …
Rev .
Wright would certainly offer a hearty amen to that .
And to this brilliant , beautifully written piece by Kelefa Sanneh in the April 7th New Yorker .
I ’ve read this very long piece three times now , along with Glenn Loury ’s eloquently indignant response to Obama speech and …boy does my head hurt .
I praised Obama to Katie Couric loud and long for his Black But More Than Black speech , and I now have to admit , as publicly as I entered the fray , that I did n’t know what I was talking about .
I was n’t wrong entirely , just far from well informed enough to be taking stands .
My analysis was simplistic and inadequate .
It makes me nerd - happy now to be getting the schooling I need to be a worthy voice in this national consciousness - raising .
I ’m also happy to have helped enrage enough well - informed , fearless thinkers to set us all straight .
We ’ve all got a lot to learn about each other ( not to mention , ourselves ) and Hallejuah !
we ’re having the full frontal dialogue which alone will make ours a more perfect union .
I ’ve always been baffled by blacks ’ fervent embrace of Christianity during , and certainly since , slavery .
Christianity justified slavery !
Though I was raised in the church , mine was n’t a Wrightian one .
Our preachers were ‘ jack leg ’ .
No theological training , or even much beyond a grade school education , Jim Crow sharecroppers that they all were .
Our only requirement was that they ’d been ‘ touched by God ’ and ‘ called to preach ’ .
Drive a cab or work the assembly line by day , lead a flock come Sunday .
My religious training at Emmanuel Missionary Baptist , and others like it in the St. Louis inner city circuit , was about how dreary this life was , and that its only point was to persevere until we got our eternal reward in the great by and by .
Far from prophecy and denunciation of white supremacy , classism , or god forbid sexism , we were exhorted to humble ourselves , wretches that we were , before an inscrutable God whose decision to stake us to the bottom of the totem pole was not ours to critique .
That was blasphemy !
Which was a word hurled at us routinely .
My church years were the 1960s ; my mother ignored the Movement and my father furiously opposed it .
“ Those knuckleheads need to take they fists out the air and get jobs ! ”
Both were afraid that whites would be so enraged by the calls for change that we ’d end up worse off .
Back picking cotton , I guess .
My five siblings and I were totally shielded from those wild political times ; both the Movement and Vietnam raged throughout my childhood .
I did n’t know a thing about either until I was in college .
When change came , no one was as thunderstruck as my two uneducated manual laborers .
So you ’ll understand why the prophetic tradition takes me by surprise .
No one was taught to be as humble , self - effacing , grateful , silent , and well - mannered as an inner city black girl in the 60s , so the Wrights of the world seem …rude to me .
Suffer in silence he does not .
I abandoned my religion because it was so passive and determined to make me keep my peace in the world .
What if I ’d been exposed to a Wright ?
Now I see the line that connects those ‘ rude , kinda crazy ’ Christian leaders one to the other — Sojourner Truth , Frederick Douglass , Dr. King … Jeremiah Wright ?
I ’m not saying that Obama is now wrong and Wright is , you know , right .
I ’m saying that most of us have a lot more articles to read and a lot more nuances to incorporate into our opinions .
Giving black religiosity its due as the voice of a historically oppressed group might be a good place to start .
We have to ask ourselves — is black anger still legitimate ?
If no , discussion over .
If yes … ?
As Jesse Jackson once quipped , “ you ca n’t tell a man who ’s hurting how to holler . ”
I ’m beginning to understand how the slaves and the Jim Crow ’d had to embrace Christianity &mdashwhat else could get them through those terrible days ?
But ai n’t nobody stupid ; the hypocrisy of Christianity was quite obvious to them .
They would n’t have been human had they not found a way to surrender into its soothing embrace while also fashioning it into a militant counter narrative that told the truth on America and racism .
Why would n’t we be angry and open to ‘ seeing ’ America ’s flaws ?
You must read Sanneh ’s piece .
Here ’s a long excerpt that will force you to engage with it in its entirety .
Unless you already know everything about black religiosity .
You know , like me :
“ Christianity is the white man ’s religion . ”
That was Malcolm X’s verdict , and though he meant it to be final , a generation of black Christian leaders decided to treat it as provisional .
In 1969 , a thirty - one - year - old theologian named James H. Cone published “ Black Theology & Black Power , ” a short , astringent book that Wright would use as a blueprint for Trinity .
Cone proposed a reciprocal arrangement : just as the Black Power movement could find redemption in the Church , so the Church — dominated and distorted by generations of white men— could find redemption in the Black Power movement .
He wrote that there was “ a need for a theology whose sole purpose is to emancipate the gospel from its ‘ whiteness ’ so that blacks may be capable of making an honest self - affirmation through Jesus Christ . ”
And he argued that , since African - American suffering was such a powerful metaphor for the suffering of Christ , color - blind Christianity was a contradiction in terms .
“ To be Christian is to be one of those whom God has chosen , ” he wrote .
“ God has chosen black people ! ”
… Cone was careful to explain that a black - centered Church need not be a black - separatist Church .
And even the simplest phrases — ” black people , ” for instance — turned out to be slippery .
It was n’t about being “ physically black , ” he wrote .
“ To be black means that your heart , your soul , your mind , and your body are where the dispossessed are . ”
In his view , blackness was as radically inclusive as Christianity itself , and just as demanding . …
“ It was the riots in Detroit , in Newark , both in ’ 67 — that was what shook me , ” he recounted .
“ I said to myself , ‘ I have to have a theology that speaks to the hurt in my community .
I want a theology that would empower people to be more creative .
To be just as aggressive as they are in the riots , but more constructive . ’ “
The Fibonacci sequence is one of the best - known number sequences :
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 …
Each Fibonacci number above 1 is defined as the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers :
F(0 ) = 0
F( 1 ) = 1
F( n ) = F( n - 1 ) + F( n - 2 )
Just for fun , here ’s another way to specify the Fibonacci sequence .
It takes fewer calculations , especially for large numbers .
The math is basic algebra substitutions .
This could be old news — if you ’ve seen this before , I ’d love to hear from you .
Deriving the new Fibonacci definition
Before we begin , let ’s notate F ( n ) as Fn , and F ( n - 1 ) as Fn 1 — it ’ll make everything tidier .
That Fn 1 +
Fn 2 part , to me , always begged for substitution .
Fn 1 should equal Fn 2 +
Fn 3 , right ?
What if we re-write Fn in terms of Fn 1 ‘s definition ?
What might that lead to ?
Fn = Fn 1 + Fn 2
Fn 1 = Fn 2 + Fn 3
Fn = Fn 2 + Fn 2 + Fn 3
Fn = 2Fn 2 + Fn 3 , as long as n > 2 .
Pretty basic : substitute the definition for Fn 1 back into the definition for Fn , and simplify .
We can keep going :
Fn 2 = Fn 3 + Fn 4
Fn = 2Fn 2 + Fn 3 , from above
Fn = ( 2Fn 3 + 2Fn 4 ) + Fn 3
Fn = 3Fn 3 + 2Fn 4 , for n > 3
… and then :
Fn 3 = Fn 4 + Fn 5
Fn = ( 3Fn 4 + 3Fn 5 ) + 2Fn 4
Fn = 5Fn 4 + 3Fn 5 , for n > 4
… and again :
Fn 4 = Fn 5 + Fn 6
Fn = ( 5Fn 5 + 5Fn 6 ) + 3Fn 5
Fn = 8Fn 5 + 5 Fn 6 , for n > 5
… just one more time :
Fn 5 = Fn 6 + Fn 7
Fn = 8Fn 6 + 8Fn 7 + 5Fn 6
Fn = 13Fn 6 + 8Fn 7 , for n > 6
See the pattern ?
Look at the coefficients :
Fn = 2Fn 2 + 1Fn 3 , for n > 2
Fn = 3Fn 3 + 2Fn 4 , for n > 3
Fn = 5Fn 4 + 3Fn 5 , for n > 4
Fn = 8Fn 5 + 5 Fn 6 , for n > 5
Fn = 13Fn 6 + 8Fn 7 , for n > 6
They ’re the Fibonacci sequence starting up .
Do the math , and you ’ll see that the next few steps follow along .
What if we replace the coefficients with their Fibonacci indexes ?
If F( 6 ) = 8 and F ( 7 ) = 13 , we can rewrite 13Fn 6 + 8Fn 7 as F( 7 ) Fn 6 + F( 6 ) Fn 7 .
Let ’s carry that out :
Fn = F( 3 ) Fn 2 + F( 2 ) Fn 3 , for n > 2
Fn = F( 4 ) Fn 3 + F( 3 ) Fn 4 , for n > 3
Fn = F(5 ) Fn 4 + F( 4 ) Fn 5 , for n > 4
Fn = F( 6 ) Fn 5 + F(5 ) Fn 6 , for n > 5
Fn = F( 7 ) Fn 6 + F( 6 ) Fn 7 , for n > 6
Let ’s quickly verify this .
We know from the original definition that F ( 10 ) = 55 , so let ’s see whether these new versions agree .
( I ’ll only test the first and last versions , to save space , but you can verify as many as you like . )
F( 10 ) = 55 = F( 3 ) Fn 2 + F( 2 ) Fn 3
F( 10 ) = 55 = F( 3 ) F ( 8 ) + F( 2 ) F( 7 )
F( 10 ) = 55 = 2 * 21 + 1 * 13
F( 10 ) = 55 = F( 7 ) Fn 6 + F( 6 ) Fn 7
F( 10 ) = 55 = F( 7 ) F ( 4 ) + F( 6 ) F( 3 )
F( 10 ) = 55 = 13 * 3 + 8 * 2
They both pass .
More generally :
Fn = F( x ) Fn y + F(y )
Fn x , for n > x , and y = x – 1
It ’s not terribly wordier than the original definition , Fn = Fn 1 +
Fn 2 , for n >
2 .
Putting this to use
A nice property of this new version is that it lets us skip some steps .
If we ’re calculating F( 1000 ) with the traditional definition , we have to calculate each Fibonacci along the way ; but now , we can set x = 500 , and skip down to the neighborhood of F( 500 ) :
F( 1000 ) = F( 500 ) * F( 501 ) + F( 499 ) * F( 500 )
We can continue to skip down to about n/2 , decreasing the amount of calculations we need to do .
Just for fun , I implemented both fib_orig and fib_new in ruby : here ’s the file .
I memoized the methods , for two reasons :
It ’s clearly much faster , and it ’s simple to do .
It lets us see exactly which Fibonacci numbers were calculated .
I put the two methods in a test case , with four test methods .
The first test ensures that the new equation matches the old .
Unfortunately , I could only reach 6000 with the fib_orig , before I ran out of stack space .
The second test benchmarks the two versions .
It reports the memo array size ( 6000 for fib_orig , as expected , and 40 for fib_new — 99.3 % fewer calculations ) .
When fib_orig ran out of stack space so quickly , I wondered how far I could take the new version ( which should recurse many fewer times ) .
So in the third test , I benchmarked it with progressively bigger numbers .
It starts to slow down around the millionth Fibonacci number : it completes in about 12 seconds on my machine .
I suspect it ’s spending the extra time array - seeking at that point , since the array gets pretty sparse — the last few non-null array indexes are : 125001 249999 250000 250001 499999 500000 500001 1000000 .
Maybe I ’ll try a hash …
The fourth test is a bit of extra-credit , and a sanity check .
Fn / F( n+1 ) approaches the golden ratio , 1.61803398874 … , as N approaches infinity .
So I calculated F( 1401 ) / F( 1400 ) with fib_new , and it ’s accurate to 15 decimal points , rounding the last one , which seems to be the limit of precision on my WinXP machine .
I tried using higher Fibonacci numbers , but was warned that I was exceeding the range of ruby ’s floating point numbers .

According to Department of Energy statistics , the price of oil rose from about $ 20 per barrel to about $ 30 per barrel over the course of 2000 to 2001 .
And oil prices were actually falling in 2001 and declined sharply after the 9/11 terrorist attacks .
But since early 2002  after President Bush ’s “ axis of evil ” State of the Union Address , which can be thought of as the kickoff point of the run-up to the Iraq war  the price of oil has steadily gone up .
As this is written , the price of oil is at a record high of nearly $ 114 per barrel .
( It ’s worth noting that in terms of inflation - adjusted constant dollars , the peak price of oil was during the Iran - Iraq War in 1981 . )
Three summers ago  when the price of oil was “ only ” $ 60 per barrel 
I had a conversation with a former special assistant to President Bush for combating terrorism ( no , not Richard Clarke ) about the price of oil and national security .
At the time , he was concerned about the price of oil going to $ 75 per barrel and what would happen if it hit triple figures .
Like so many others , he was equating national security with the need for energy security which , in turn , means either cheap oil or alternative energy .
Unfortunately , this type of thinking is conventional wisdom and drives national security decision - making .
Israel aside , the primary reason the Middle East is and has been a U.S. national security issue is oil .
Even as the Bush administration makes democracy in Mesopotamia the raison d’être for its foreign policy and the Iraq War , the United States continues to have a cozy relationship with Saudi Arabia  the world ’s largest oil producer with the largest estimated oil reserves , yet anything but democratic  on the belief that such a relationship will somehow ensure at least access to oil , if not stable oil prices ( that the price of oil has nearly tripled in the last three years should be enough to disprove the need for President Bush to hold hands with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah ) .
Oil is also a reason ( not necessarily the reason , but certainly an important reason )
Iran is demonized as not only a threat to the region , but to world peace .
If the Iranians were not the fourth largest oil producing country in the world and sitting atop the world ’s third largest oil reserves , the United States would probably care a lot less that they ( meaning the regime , not necessarily the Iranian people ) are anti-American .
Oil was a reason for the first Gulf War against Iraq .
It probably would have mattered less had Iraq ( fourth largest reserves in the world ) invaded a country other than oil - rich Kuwait ( remember then - Secretary of State James Baker ’s “ jobs , jobs , jobs ” rationale in 1991 ? ) .
And certainly one reason Saddam Hussein became a target for the second Bush administration was that the neocons had already preordained that such a regime  one accused of developing dreaded WMD and having ties to terrorists in the aftermath of 9/11  was a threat because of “ longstanding American interests in the region ” [. pdf ] ( a euphemism for oil ) .
Finally , oil is a reason Venezuela ’s Hugo Chavez ( Venezuela is the tenth largest oil producer in the world ) has been portrayed as a threat to U.S. security .
But oil is not a national security issue .
Oil is an economic issue .
It ’s true enough that the United States ( and the rest of the world , for that matter ) is “ dependent ” on oil ( although less than half of the oil imported to the United States is from the Persian Gulf ) .
But it ’s also true that countries such as Saudi Arabia need to sell oil ( particularly if a country ’s economy is primarily based on oil sales ) .
So we do n’t need any special relationships to have access to oil .
Supply and demand ultimately determines the flow of oil .
To be sure , from time to time OPEC tries to control the supply of oil to influence prices to maximize profits , but OPEC does not represent the entire world oil market ( non -OPEC countries account for 60 percent of the world ’s oil supply ) .
As a result , OPEC cannot control either supply or price .
If OPEC tries to limit supply , non-OPEC countries have an incentive to increase supply to increase their revenues .
And OPEC members themselves have an incentive to cheat by increasing production over their quotas to increase revenues even as the organization is trying to constrain the supply of oil to maximize price .
So the price ( and supply ) of oil is dictated by the market .
And there is no escaping this reality by trying to break our so - called dependence on foreign oil .
Indeed , in the late 1970s the United Kingdom was essentially oil self - sufficient  virtually all of its oil consumption came from the North Sea .
Yet when the price of oil spiked in 1979 , the UK was hit just as hard as Japan  a country that was almost entirely dependent on imported oil .
Why ?
Because oil is a commodity traded on the worldwide market and both its supply and price are indifferent as to where it comes from or where it ’s going .
Thus , the price of oil is the price of oil .
OK , but would n’t we better off if we did n’t need oil ( or at least needed it less ) ?
Environmental and pollution concerns aside , would n’t we then not need to focus so much of our foreign policy on the Persian Gulf and Middle East ?
And would n’t that make us less susceptible to radical Islamic terrorism ?
Ultimately , that was what my conversation with the former White House special assistant was about .
Of course , we would be safer if we were not so involved in the Middle East  which does next to nothing in terms of assuring the supply of oil or stabilizing its price , but which is a significant factor in making us a target for terrorism .
But if oil is the primary factor driving our Middle East policy yet the price of oil is the price of oil , the reality is that we do n’t need to be less dependent on oil to be less involved in the Middle East .
In other words , we do n’t need to achieve energy independence by weaning ourselves off of oil to be able to adopt a different  preferably less interventionist  Middle East foreign policy .
And the paradox of trying to break free of oil is that the only way to do that is for the price of oil to go up .
Even if it is expensive , as long as oil is still cheaper than other sources of energy there is no rational economic reason to pay more .
Therefore , oil actually has to become more expensive than other forms of energy .
But even at more than $ 100 per barrel , it ’s not yet .
Three summers ago a certain special assistant was worried about the price of oil breaking the $ 100 per barrel barrier .
Now it has ( despite oil hitting a new record high on April 16 , it ’s worth noting  although certainly not for cause and effect  that the Dow Jones Industrials closed up more than 250 points on the same day ) .
We are neither more nor less secure as a result .
We are only paying more at the pump .
There are legitimate economic reasons to be concerned about the price of oil , but there are no national security reasons for the United States to take action or continue to build our Middle East and Persian Gulf foreign policy around oil .
The only dependency we need to overcome is the myth that we are dependent on oil .
A problem which has defeated mathematicians for almost 140 years has been solved by a researcher at Imperial College London .
Professor Darren Crowdy , Chair in Applied Mathematics , has made the breakthrough in an area of mathematics known as conformal mapping , a key theoretical tool used by mathematicians , engineers and scientists to translate information from a complicated shape to a simpler circular shape so that it is easier to analyse .
This theoretical tool has a long history and has uses in a large number of fields including modelling airflow patterns over intricate wing shapes in aeronautics .
It is also currently being used in neuroscience to visualise the complicated structure of the grey matter in the human brain .
A formula , now known as the Schwarz - Christoffel formula , was developed by two mathematicians in the mid-19th century to enable them to carry out this kind of mapping .
However , for 140 years there has been a deficiency in this formula : it only worked for shapes that did not contain any holes or irregularities .
Now Professor Crowdy has made additions to the famous Schwarz - Christoffel formula which mean it can be used for these more complicated shapes .
He explains the significance of his work , saying :
" This formula is an essential piece of mathematical kit which is used the world over .
Now , with my additions to it , it can be used in far more complex scenarios than before .
In industry , for example , this mapping tool was previously inadequate if a piece of metal or other material was not uniform all over - for instance , if it contained parts of a different material , or had holes . "
Professor Crowdy 's work has overcome these obstacles and he says he hopes it will open up many new opportunities for this kind of conformal mapping to be used in diverse applications .
" With my extensions to this formula , you can take account of these differences and map them onto a simple disk shape for analysis in the same way as you can with less complex shapes without any of the holes , " he added .
Professor Crowdy 's improvements to the Schwarz - Christoffel formula were published in the March - June 2007 issue of Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society .

The download service is due to debut soon
The creators of the BitTorrent file - sharing network have opened the doors on a legal download service .
The BitTorrent Entertainment Network launched on 26 February and gives subscribers access to a large catalogue of movies , music and videos .
It has the backing of several movie and TV studios and will build on the large numbers of existing BitTorrent users .
However , it will face stiff competition from the many other multimedia stores and video sites found online .
Hard task
At launch the service will have about 3,000 movies and TV shows available from companies such as Warner Brothers , Paramount , MTV , MGM , 20th Century Fox and Lionsgate .
New releases will include films such as Superman Returns and featured TV shows will include 24 and Prison Break .
We need to give them a price that feels like a good value relative to what they were getting for free
Ashwin Navin , co-founder and president of BitTorrent
New movies will cost $ 3.99 ( £ 2 ) but older films will cost $ 2.99 to download .
TV shows will be $ 1.99 though high definition versions will be $ 2.99 .
There is no official word yet on non-US prices .
Once downloaded the TV shows available via the service can be kept indefinitely but movies can only be stored for up to 30 days .
Anyone signing up must also use Windows Media Player to watch or listen to anything they download .
BitTorrent also hopes to encourage the creation of a community around the entertainment site where customers will be able to post videos they have made for others to download .
The market for multimedia portals is starting to get crowded and BitTorrent will face competition from Amazon , Apple , Wal - Mart , Microsoft 's Xbox as well as from YouTube , Joost and the CinemaNow and Movielink sites .
The BitTorrent software is thought to have been installed on more than 135 million computers and the BitTorrent company hopes to persuade some of those users to sign up for its entertainment service .
However , it acknowledges that it will have a hard task convincing those who currently get all the movies , TV shows and music they want without paying .
" We 're really hammering the studios to say , ' Go easy on this audience , ' " said Ashwin Navin , co-founder and president of BitTorrent .
" We need to give them a price that feels like a good value relative to what they were getting for free . "
While bombing Iraq and Afghanistan in the name of the “ War on Terror ” , George Bush allowed (s ) millions of unidentified people from around the world a free pass into the United States daily for the past seven years of his presidency .
His terrorism war proves a complete fraud on the American public when placed under the scrutiny of verifiable facts .
Bush shoved the United States of America into a fraudulent war based on falsification of the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
He pursued war at any expense for any reason .
He arrogantly strode across the aircraft carrier like a male peacock strutting his ego for the world to despise .
He proceeded against common sense , reason and advice from wiser men .
His “ Mission Accomplished ” placard proves incongruent after five years of continued war .
Thus far , Bush destroyed 4,000 American soldiers and 30,000 heinously damaged lives of our brave soldiers while killing 100,000 and more Iraqi men , women and children .
In last week ’s 60 Minute interview , the Dali Lama said , “ Iraq and Afghanistan wars not really successful ! ”
Bush says his “ War on Terror ” makes our country safe from further attacks after 9/11 .
Bush ’s first officer , Michael Chertoff , shakes down old ladies at airports while tens of thousands of illegal aliens walk across our borders weekly .
Estimates show 30 percent of visitors with visa overstays -- blend into the American workforce and Muslim mosques without a trace .
Any of them could be a terrorist .
The Department of Homeland Security claims three major immigration - related missions : 1 . Secure the nation ’s borders .
2 . Combat terrorism .
3 . Enforce immigration laws inside the United States by removing illegal aliens .
The U.S. Border Patrol , totally understaffed , guards our southern borders , but catches only 1 in 4 border crossers by its own admission .
At the same time , we give South Korea 35,000 American troops year around for the past 50 years to guard their border .
The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) enforces our immigration laws inside the country .
According to Edwin Rubenstein , “ What Price Mass Immigration ” , reporting in the Social Contract Quarterly , Winter 2008 , www.thesocialcontract.com, in 2005 , “ … after capturing 98,000 ‘ other than Mexicans ’ , Chertoff released 70,000 into American society without inspection .
For that , American taxpayers shelled out $ 3.5 billion for agents and staff . ”

The rising world food prices seem to have forced the UK government to take a second look at its transport fuel policy which compels suppliers to provide 2.5 per cent of their sales as bio-fuel .
The policy took effect last week .
The proportion is to rise to five in 2010 .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said in a statement last Tuesday , ahead of a meeting on food prices with industry leaders and development experts , that if a UK government review of the impact of biofuels now under way “ shows that we need to change our approach , we will also push for change in EU biofuels targets ” .
The review was launched in February and is due to deliver initial conclusions next month , with a full report by the end of June .
As food prices have risen environmental and social groups have intensified their campaigns , arguing that governments are diverting production away from food and animal feed .
Until now , the government ’s policy has been to support the increased use of biofuels .
Biofuels produced from crops such as corn and soya provide a small but fast - growing share of motor fuel , and had been expected to make an important contribution to meeting growing demand for fossil fuel .
Biofuels have strong political support in many countries .
Angela Merkel , Germany ’s chancellor , said last week : “ Those rising global food prices have nothing to do [ with ] biofuels . ”
Agriculture diplomats have expressed concern that governments are focusing on biofuels as the main reason for rising food prices .
They argued that the use of agricultural land and crops for fuel is only part of a mix of problems including higher demand in Asia , climate change , declining growth in farming productivity and water scarcity .
The European Commission has been defending its 10 per cent biofuel mix target for motor fuels .
Asked by reporters last Monday whether the EU was reconsidering its position on the biofuels target , a spokesman said : “ The answer is very simple .
No . ”
Meanwhile , the world is still not very sure what is causing the international oil prices to shoot up so steeply over the last one year .
The price has almost doubled in the 12 months from $ 60 to $ 120 a barrel .
The producers claim that there has not been any disruption in supplies during this period .
There has also been no significant increase in consumption in major consuming countries like the US , Europe , Japan and the UK .
China ’s consumption is said to be rising at a breakneck rate .
Chinese demand for oil is said to be accelerating ahead of the Olympics with crude oil imports up by almost a quarter to 4.07 million barrels a day in March , compared with the same month last year .
For the first quarter , crude imports rose by 14 per cent compared with the same period last year .
But then it has also been busy in Africa exploring new fields and developing them .
One would certainly find it hard to disagree with the argument that the declining dollar could have forced the exporters to push up the prices of their commodity to protect the purchasing parity of the currency they receive in exchange for their oil .
But the increase in the price of oil is decidedly too high compared to the dollar ’s decline .
So , there certainly appears to be a very generous speculative component in today ’s oil prices .
But who is fueling this speculation and why ?
Nobody has an answer .
Opec ministers have blamed rising oil prices on speculators and the weakness in the dollar at last week ’s meeting of the International Energy Forum in Rome .
But in an effort to reassure the market , Opec ’s secretary general highlighted the cartel ’s plans to expand capacity .
Right now , Opec has 120 projects worth $ 160 billion just to increase capacity by five million barrels a day to 2012 .
However , Opec is said to have no plans to meet before September , suggesting little prospect of any relief on supplies before then .
Developments in the dollar are likely to dominate oil price movements in the short - term and could even drag Brent crude as high as $ 125 per barrel this quarter .
Nevertheless , with a recovery of the dollar and easing of oil market tightness in the pipeline , the Capital Economics ( CE ) a London based research firm expects prices to drop back to around $ 85 per barrel by the end of the year .
The three key drivers of the recent rise in oil prices ( a falling dollar , tight fundamentals and speculative pressures ) look set to ease and probably reverse in the second half of the year .
Another factor blamed for high oil prices is the inflow of capital from investors , partly as a hedge against general inflation .
However , the argument for buying commodities to hedge against commodity - driven inflation is dangerously circular and it is only a matter of time , according to CE , before fundamental demand and supply conditions reassert themselves .
The demand for commodities such as industrial metals is expected to moderate on slower economic growth , while the supply response to high food prices has historically been quicker than in energy markets .
The upshot is that as general inflationary pressures ease , speculative positions in oil should also be unwound , potentially leading to a very sharp correction .
The increases in world oil and food prices have devastated the economies of low and middle income oil importing countries .
With soaring oil and food import bills and not much to export to pay for the costly oil and food , these countries are now looking at multilateral aid agencies for help .
But there is said to be an upside as well to this steep increase in the world prices of these two essentials .
At $ 120 a barrel , oil exploration and development is said to have become not only an economically viable venture the world over but profitable as well for even those countries which are blessed with shallow fields .
At these prices even the windmill driven energy and solar energy too are said to have become commercially economical for developing countries .
And those developing agricultural countries which so far had found it economically unprofitable to invest in food crops because of the heavy subsidies that the rich countries were giving to their farmers would now find it commercially viable to grow food commodities for home consumption as well as for export .
CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Soaring food prices are a “ massacre ” of the world ’s poor and are creating a global nutritional crisis , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez said on Tuesday , calling it a sign that capitalism is in decline .

His comments came only hours after the United Nations ’ World Food Program called more expensive food a “ silent tsunami ” that threatens to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger .
“ It is a true massacre what is happening in the world , ” Chavez said in a televised speech , citing U.N. statistics about deaths caused by hunger and malnourishment .
“ The problem is not the production of food ... it is the economic , social and political model of the world .
The capitalist model is in crisis . ”
The self - styled revolutionary and Cuba ally has won popular support by subsidizing food for the OPEC nation ’s poor majority , although his administration struggled last year to keep products such as milk and sugar on store shelves .
Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage , visiting Caracas to meet with Chavez and other allied leaders on Wednesday , accused developed countries of spurring food prices through biofuels .
“ Developed countries want to feed the cars of the rich with food -- this is the irrational world we live in today , ” Lage said , echoing Chavez ’s frequent accusations that Washington ’s promotion of biofuel is boosting prices of staples like corn .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-Moon warned earlier this week that high food prices could wipe out progress in reducing poverty and hurt global economic growth .
Riots in poor Asian and African countries have followed steep rises in food prices caused by a range of factors including pricier fuel , bad weather and the conversion of land to grow crops for biofuel .

The Roman Catholic Church is very influential in the Philippines
The group - 16 women and four of their husbands - are fighting a policy which they say denies them access to condoms , to the pill and other effective forms of family planning .
This has had a devastating effect on their lives , they argue , causing unwanted pregnancies , pushing them further into poverty and harming their health and wellbeing .
The case has sparked debate in the Philippines where , says Professor Michael Tan , chair of the anthropology department at the University of the Philippines , there is no national policy on family planning .
More than 80 % of Filipinos are Roman Catholics and the Church is hugely influential .
Abortion is banned and President Gloria Arroyo openly backs the Church 's anti-contraception stance .
The city will not use funds for the procurement of contraceptives
Dr Gina Pardilla ,
Manila City health official
Previous attempts to pass laws requiring government funding for services like family planning and Aids prevention have been blocked by conservatives , Mr Tan says .
This has left crucial decisions in the hands of local officials and resulted in a very mixed picture nationwide - so this case is very significant .
" People recognise that the courts must decide once and for all whether local government officials can unilaterally ban family planning services , " he said .
' Culture of life
The policy at the centre of the controversy was introduced in February 2000 by the then Manila City Mayor Jose Atienza , a staunch Catholic .
He backed " natural " family planning - a less reliable method which involves couples not having sex when the woman is at her most fertile - and called the use of alternative contraceptives " a very , very destructive practice which ruins Filipino values " .
We want to say that this cannot be done in Manila or anywhere else
Elizabeth Pangalangan ,
lawyer for the plaintiffs
Mr Atienza passed Executive Order 003 , which " upholds natural family planning not just as a method but as a way of self - awareness in promoting the culture of life while discouraging the use of artificial methods of contraception " .
Although carefully worded to avoid an outright prohibition on " artificial " contraception , it was interpreted as such by city health officials , campaigners say .
Condoms and pills - which had been free - disappeared from local health centres .
Hospitals turned down requests for sterilization operations .
Many health workers stopped providing any information whatsoever on contraception .
Some family planning services did remain available at government - run hospitals or in other districts of the sprawling capital which did not fall under Mr Atienza .
But these services came at a price , people had to travel to get them and many simply did not know where to go .
NGOs who tried to fill the gap reported harassment by city officials .
Unwanted pregnancies
Lawyers for the group - from Philippine - based rights organisations LIKHAAN and Reprocen , and the US - based Center for Reproductive Rights ( CRR ) - argue that EO 003 has caused " serious and lingering damage " to residents .
The policy has hit poorest people the hardest , they say , forcing people to choose between a packet of pills or food for their families .
President Arroyo says that natural family planning is best for Filipinos
Several of the petitioners have had many more children than they wanted - some at the expense of their health - because they could not afford to pay for contraception .
The policy also exposed women to violence from husbands who did not want to abstain from sex , the rights groups found in an earlier report , and meant more women were resorting to illegal and unsafe abortions .
Mr Atienza is no longer mayor - he is now secretary for the Department of Environment - and his replacement Alfredo Lim is currently looking at the issue .
But EO 003 remains in place and there are no plans to start providing free contraceptives again - not even condoms for sex workers .
" The city will not use funds for the procurement of contraceptives - not when we have a budget deficit of more than 1bn pesos , " said Dr Gina Pardilla of Manila City health department .
" We need the money for other social and health needs . "
' Held hostage '
The plaintiffs argue that EO 003 violates the constitution - which gives couples the right to plan a family in accordance with their beliefs - as well as several international conventions to which the Philippines is a signatory .
Similar orders have been enacted in two other areas , which is why Elizabeth Pangalangan , Reprocen director and a lawyer for the petitioners , says it is important that the case sets a legal precedent .
" We want to say that this can not be done in Manila or anywhere else , " she said .
The group will take their case to international courts if necessary .
Success in the courts would be welcomed by a silent majority , Professor Tan said , citing surveys which show most Filipinos want access to family planning .
" Demand is very clear , but the problem is that the Catholic Church works on the supply side , getting to politicians like Mayor Atienza and threatening them with the so - called Catholic vote . "
A court decision might also embolden government officials to implement nationwide policies , he said .
" The Department of Health is currently held hostage to the views of Arroyo - officials fear that they will lose their jobs if they promote family planning . "
" A court decision would free people by taking away the Sword of Damocles hanging over them . "

( Bloomberg ) --
Crude oil rose above $ 111 a barrel in New York and gasoline surged to a record after a government report showed that U.S. supplies unexpectedly dropped .
Crude oil inventories fell 3.15 million barrels to 316 million last week , the first decline since February , the Energy Department said .
A 2.3 - million - barrel gain was forecast , according to a Bloomberg News survey .
Supplies of gasoline and distillate fuel , including heating oil and diesel , also fell .
`` The crude stock draw was obviously the big surprise and leaves supplies too tight for comfort , '' said Antoine Halff , head of energy research at New York - based Newedge USA LLC .
``Refineries are operating at a very low rate and we still did n't get an inventory gain . ''
Cassini scientists know for sure their spacecraft is n’t in Kansas anymore .
Cassini ’s been keeping an eye on a powerful electrical storm that ’s been raging on Saturn for five months now , with lightning bolts 10,000 times more powerful than those found on Earth .
But Cassini has also been busy flying by moons like Enceladus and Titan during this time , and therefore can’t constantly watch the storm .
So amateur astronomers have been assisting the Cassini science team by monitoring this tempest in the “ Storm Alley ”  region of Saturn .
It ’s no Great Red Spot , but it ’s the longest lasting electrical storm ever detected in our solar system .
This prolonged storm is located in Saturn ’s southern hemisphere –in a region nicknamed “ Storm Alley ” by mission scientists –where previous , but much shorter - lived lightning storms ( if month - long storms can be called short ! ) were observed by Cassini .
Saturn ’s electrical storms are similar to thunderstorms on Earth , but they ’re much bigger and longer lasting .
Storms on Saturn have diameters of several thousand kilometers ( thousands of miles ) , and radio signals produced by their lightning are thousands of times more powerful than those produced by terrestrial thunderstorms .
The storm was first detected on Saturn on Nov. 27 , 2007 .
The electrostatic discharges were picked up by Cassini ’s radio and plasma wave science instrument .
“ The electrostatic radio outbursts have waxed and waned in intensity for five months now , ” said Georg Fischer , an associate with the radio and plasma wave science team at the University of Iowa , Iowa City .
“ We saw similar storms in 2004 and 2006 that each lasted for nearly a month , but this storm is longer - lived by far .
And it appeared after nearly two years during which we did not detect any electrical storm activity from Saturn . ”
Amateur astronomers have kept track of the storm over its five - month lifetime .
“ Since Cassini ’s camera cannot track the storm every day , the amateur data are invaluable , ” said Fischer .
“ I am in continuous contact with astronomers from around the world . ”
The long - lived storm will help provide information on the processes powering Saturn ’s intense lightning activity .
Cassini scientists will continue to monitor Storm Alley as the seasons change , bringing the onset of autumn to the planet ’s southern hemisphere .

You are charmed by the friendly and beautiful people , even though underneath it all there are many aspects of the lives of poor Indians that are difficult to accept with equanimity .
Nevertheless you are bound to fall in love with the country even though the harsh reality is so visible everywhere .
For our third visit to India we had chosen to visit only Tamil Nadu , very different from the north that we had visited twice already , and completely different from Sikkim where we went last October , a northern state between Nepal and Bhutan ( and formerly an independent country with a king ) , right in the lower Himalaya mountains .
Tamil Nadu is a country of multicolored temples , vast rice fields , huge loads of sugar cane or hay pulled by skinny bulls with colored horns , palm thatched huts where people live in one - room houses and seem perfectly happy with their lot .
I do n't believe there are many countries in the world that can stand up to India in terms of variety , color , movement and joie de vivre .

Sadly though , India is also outstanding when it comes to the enormous number of beggars and street children , incredibly hardworking women not just in the rice fields but also in other cruelly hard jobs such as in road construction .
The ubiquitous poverty is visible to anybody on their first visit to the country .
There seems to be much less begging and true misery , however , in Sikkim where we were last October as well as in Tamil Nadu .
Sure , people work hard but they seem to earn a fairly decent living .
The majority of the dwellings of the poor seem very rudimentary , at least to Westerners , but nevertheless there are smiling , happy looking people everywhere , friendly and seemingly full of love for each other and for others .
How is this apparently contradictory state of things possible ?

Have you ever noticed that the more intelligent a man is the less masculine he tends to be ?
And does n’t it seem like the smarter a woman is the less feminine she is ?
Why is that ?
The answer to that question , along with the implications thereof , constitute no less than the keys to relationship bliss .
The basic explanation for this phenomenon is that rationality lies in the middle of a sliding scale where femininity is on the left , and masculinity is on the right .
As a person becomes increasingly controlled by their intellect as opposed to their masculine or feminine ( primal ) tendencies , they move toward the center of the scale .
Men move left , women move right .

This may seem like an unimportant observation , but in fact the world of relationships revolves around this very same scale .
Trophy wives life on the extreme left , alpha - males live on the extreme right , and these two groups seek each other out as the epitomes of desire .
The key to relationship bliss is mastering this scale .
Each partner must be able to move back and forth on it as required in order to simultaneously be attractive in a primal sense while using logic and reason as relationship glue .
In other words , if you ’re totally primal you basically meet people , shag , get in fights , make babies , shag , make up , go to court , shag , meet new people , etc .
Life becomes a never - ending circus ride of pain and pleasure .
If , on the other hand , you ’re an over - analyzer who is out of touch with your inner animal , life is somewhat meaningless .
The joy of being human is repressed and much of the color fades from life .
The answer , of course , is one of balance .
Specifically , it entails each partner learning to experience and embrace their respective extremes — the primal and the intellectual .
Assuming each has a scale of 1 - 10 , with 1 being the intellectual and 10 being the primal , most only have 2 - 3 points of mobility .
So the average person sits between 4 - 6 , which just straddles the center ( 5 ) .
If we imagine an average geeky guy , he probably lives between 3 - 5 .
So his intellectual side is good ( 2 points better than average ) , but his primal rating ’s maximum is at 5 , which is not good .
And the average brute ( Putty from Seinfeld ) lives at 6 - 8 — which is precisely the opposite and has its own set of strengths and weaknesses .
The ideal situation is to have as many points of mobility as possible , and we can rate this by subtracting the two numbers .
The best situation is a rating of 1 - 10 , which yields a score of 9 , while average people like the geek and brute listed above only have 2 points of range .
Of course , the real magic is not just having a good range but knowing how to use it .
Each partner has to decide where they are going to reside normally on the scale , while remaining constantly aware of when they may need to slide in one direction or another .
And here ’s where it gets controversial 1 .
We are animals .
We might be special animals , but we are in fact extraordinarily similar to the baboons and wolves we see on TV .
As such , anyone who wants to succeed in the realm of human interaction needs to learn the rules of the animal world .
To deny these rules shows either ignorance , political / intellectual cowardice , or both .
The Illogical Animal
Think about the people you know personally and the various types of relationship structures that exist .
Have you noticed that the most stressed out and unhappy women are those who are forced to develop dominant tendencies because they ’re married to under - confident , non-masculine men ?
We also know of legions of women who sacrifice a perfect marriage , a perfect family , and their entire livelihoods to be with a man who is extremely domineering and controlling over them — especially sexually .
I ’m talking about Mrs. Cleaver risking it all to sneak out at night and get brutally shagged by a man who constantly degrades her , tells her exactly how to dress and look for him ( slutty ) , and says unspeakable things to her while they have sex in way she would never consider with her husband .
Why does she endure this at the risk of losing everything ?
Because at a most primal level — she loves it .
Quite simply , I think this submission stimulates a deeply primal pleasure center within the female and signals a sense of security and happiness .
It actually makes excellent sense evolutionarily — with happiness coming from safety and security , and those things only coming from being with a man who ’s forceful and powerful .
A man in the past who was passive and non-dominant was likely to fail , and this fact is programmed into women .
Hence it ’s often the case that when a woman is with a non-masculine man who treats her as an absolute equal and never takes charge , there is a part of her that secretly resents him for it .
This is completely hidden from the woman , as she has been trained to ignore her primal side just as the man has been trained to ignore his .
Her intellect says she ’s happy , but her primal side starts to betray her .
And as time wears on this inner tension continues to build2 .
I believe the presence or lack of this tension contributes greatly to the happiness of a woman , and serves as the reason that wives who are free to let go are often happier than those who are treated as asexual and equal partners .
It ’s because — when given voluntarily — submission can be quite relaxing , and pampered women often feel extraordinarily feminine and loved when they are able to give their trust and relinquish control to a kind man .
In fact I believe there is a part of the female psyche that absolutely craves this feeling .
The Feminized Man
Many men ( just as their women ) have bought into the whole notion of rejecting the animal when it comes to relationships , and while there is good reason for this in principle it has been severely maligned by current culture .
We all know men who basically mope through life in constant fear of their wives .
They cower in the face of confrontation and do pretty much anything to stay on the good side of their women .
These are the “ Yes Dear ” men , and they are most happy when they are away from their wives .
The irony of the situation is that it does n’t make their women happy when they submit .
In fact , I ’m quite sure it is THOSE women who are most unhappy and cheat the most .
Why ?
Because this type of man a pseudo - man .
He exudes no characteristics of a powerful male , and as a result she has no respect for him .
Conclusion
The answer here is to not to run out and try and act like a bimbo or a caveman to satisfy your mate .
My point is simply that there is more to satisfying relationships than promoting absolute equality and rational discourse within a relationship .
We are still animals , and as animals there is a core of happiness and contentment that can only be stimulated by the expression of our primal identity .
We must learn to leverage these vestiges of our previous forms in order to maximize our enjoyment of each other .
This means to some degree sexually polarizing our behavior in order to maintain the animal harmony that has defined us for millions of years .
Many will recoil at this idea , as the practice happens to correspond pretty strongly with what maligned Republicans like to call “ traditional family values ” .
But their views are polar opposites of mine , as my theory sits atop a foundation of equality and respect .
I condone this exploration as an active , conscious effort on the part of both the man and the woman to milk every bit of happiness and pleasure from a relationship — both from the animal the intellectual sides of our personalities .
All enlightened people know that women are truly equal , as it is humanism and logic that define our values rather than the Bible or religion .
This is not a rejection of that equality ; it ’s a consciously generated augmentation to it for the purposes of increasing happiness .
It means learning to acknowledge the differences between men and women on a primal level , and use that information to make our relationships more rich and rewarding .
This means being able to slip back and forth on the scale as needed — going from man-and - woman to human - to - human interchangeably .
In other words , we need to use our intellect to build relationship structures that make the best use of our innate abilities to generate happiness .
When we deny our animal origins we forfeit our ability to tap into a huge vein of contentment that comes from satisfying our animal nature .
In subsequent pieces I ’m going to discuss how an implementation of this theory might take form .

We 're sick of watching our would - be commanders in chief descend into mean - spirited wrangling , so early into this presidential election year .
If only they could take their cue from our greatest presidents .
Like Lex Luthor in the Superman comics .
Or Sylar on Heroes , who got to be POTUS in an alternate future .
Now those were some presidents we could all salute .
Which science fiction villain would win your vote for president of these great United States ?

( Kosher ? )
UPDATE : The Kosher Guide to Imaginary Animals will be published in February 2010 , hopefully in time for Purim !
You can preorder it here .
It is a lavishly illustrated book with humorous descriptions of all of the beasts on display , with an intro by Ann , a forward by Joseph Nigg , the bestselling author of How to Raise and Train and Dragon , and a discussion about imaginary animal recipes with Food Network star Duff Goldman .
It ’s a 5 x 7 small - sized hardcover –the perfect gift .
In honor of upcoming holidays like Passover , I thought I would ask Jeff ’s better half , Ann VanderMeer , editor of Weird Tales , co-editor of New Weird and Steampunk , and a practicing Jew who teaches bat / bar mitzvah students , to give us an idea of which fantastical animals and beings would be kosher and which would not be kosher , in terms of gnawin ’ off a bit o’ that .
Answers below … – Evil Monkey
Abumi-Guchi ( furry creatures formed from the stirrup of a mounted military commander ) – Ann [ with look of disbelief ] : “ Do they chew their prey ? ” EM : “ I think so . ” A : “ Then no .
Besides , the provenance is suspect . ”
Aigi Kampoi ( fish - tailed goat ) – A : “ Yes , that would be kosher because it has cloven hoofs , chews its cud , and has fins and scales .
Although , it would still be considered a meat meal , even though it ’s partially fish .
So you ca n’t eat dairy with it . ”
Amikiri ( snake - bird - lobster ) – A : “ No . Absolutely not .
The snake and lobster parts make it treyf . ”
Arkan Sonney ( fairy hedgehog ) – A : “ No , because hedgehogs are n’t kosher , so a fairy hedgehog would n’t be any different , monkey . ”
EM : “ But they ’re delicious ! ” A : “ Even so . ”
Baku ( dream - devouring tapir ) – A : “ That ’s considered a swine .
It does n’t chew its cud . ” EM : “ What if it was a dream - devouring cow ?
Would the dream - devouring disqualify it ? ” A : “ No .
As long as you do n’t consider that scavenging . ”
Brag ( malevolent water horse ) – A : “ Horses are not kosher , no matter how aquatic . ”
Bugbear ( bearlike goblin ) – A : “ Bears have paws .
Things with paws are not kosher .
And they eat meat . ”
EM : “ If it was a bear with hooves that chewed cud and the goblin part was just in its stomach , would it be kosher ? ”
A : “ Then it would n’t be a bear , idiot . ”
Chupacabra – A : “ It ’s definitely a carnivore . ” EM : “ What if it ’s just for show and they do n’t eat their prey ? ”
A : “ Well I ’m sure they do n’t chew their cud and have cloven hooves unless the chupacabra turns out to be some kind of mutant cow . ”
Cornish Owl - Man – A : “ Unfortunately an owl is not kosher because it is a bird of prey–Lev. 11:17 , and obviously you cannot eat a man because that is cannibalism . ”
EM : “ Again , though–delicious ! ”
Dragon – A : “ No reptiles or amphibians . ” EM : “ No exceptions ?
What about if it chews its cud ? ” A : “ Shut up . ”
Encantado ( dolphin - human shapeshifter ) – EM : “ Surely it ’s kosher when it ’s a dolphin . ” A : “ A dolphin is a mammal just like you .
It has no scales , even though it has fins .
Besides , what if it starts changing while you ’re eating it ? ”
ET – A : “ …..? ” EM : “ It had cloven hooves . ” A : “ It ’s a humanoid . ” EM : “ It looked like a pile of dung .
It seemed to chew cud .
Would any alien be automatically un-kosher ? ” A : “ I guess it really depends on the alien–like a plant ? ” EM : “ An alien that comes down to Earth . ” A : “ No , because they would n’t be considered an animal . ” EM : “ What if they looked just like a cow , but with a brain ? ” A : “ Cows have brains . ” EM : “ Arggh ! ” A : “ But cows do n’t travel to other planets using their brains . ”
EM : “ My point exactly ! ” A : “ Anything intelligent is not kosher . ”
Headless Mule ( fire - spewing , headless , spectral mule ) – A : “ No , because the mule itself , even if it were n’t fire - breathing , is n’t kosher .
The fire does n’t cleanse it . ”
EM : “ But it ’s self - cooking ! ”
Hippocamp ( horse - fish ) – A : “ Unfortunately , the horse part makes it treyf , and a little bit of treyf makes everything treyf .
So if you had 99 percent fish and one percent horse it would still be treyf . ”
EM : “ And a really fucked up looking hippocamp ! ”
Hobbits – A : “ Not kosher at all .
They are sentient beings . ”
EM : “ That brings up a point .
They ’re actually not sentient because they ’re not real , so are n’t they just as kosher as air . ”
Ann : “ No comment . ”
Hoopoe ( rooster - swallow - chicken - snake- goose-lobster-stag- fish hybrid ) – A : “ The snake and the lobster make it unkosher–see Hippocamp above for percentages . ”
Jackalope – A : “ No , rabbits are not kosher . ” EM : “ Not even rabbits ?!!
Why not ? ” A : “ Because although it chews the cud , it does not have hooves . ”
Jaud ( vampirized premature baby ) – A : “ Oh . Do I even have to tell you ? ” EM : “ I guess not . ” A : “ Number one , a vampire drinks blood .
Blood ingesting is a no - no .
Number 2 – baby ?!?! ”
Jotai ( animated folding screen cloth ) – A : “ Sure , why not ?
It ’s not a food item .
Scarf it down to your heart ’s delight .
So long as it ’s made from plant fibers , not a treyf animal .
And only one type of fiber–no mixing of wool and linen . ”
EM : “ Does n’t sound too good … ”
Man-Eating Tree – A : “ Tree part yes , man-eating no , therefore treyf . ”
Mermaid – A : “ No , for the obvious reasons . ” EM : “ What if you marry one ?
Is that kosher ?
Will a rabbi marry you ? ”
A : “ Kosher is a term about eating , not about sex . ” EM : “ I ’m not talking about sex–I ’m talking about marriage ! ” A : “ If the mermaid is Jewish , the rabbi will probably marry you .
But only if you ’re Jewish too .
But you ’ll definitely have to find the right rabbi … ”
Mongolian Death Worm – A : “ No , because you can not eat anything that crawls on its belly . ”
EM : “ Does that mean an injured kosher animal that is crawling along is n’t kosher any more ? ” A : “ Yes , because you ca n’t eat an animal that ’s been injured or is sick . ”
EM : “ It ’s a wonder you have n’t all starved to death . ”
Pollo Maligno ( cannibalistic chicken spirit ) – A : “ When you say cannibalistic , do you mean a chicken that eats other chickens or a chicken that eats humans ? ” EM : “ When I say Pollo Maligno , I have no idea what I mean except I sound fierce . ”
A : “ Well , chickens are kosher , but if it ’s eating meat , probably not … ”
EM : “ POLLO MALIGNO ! POLLO MALIGNO ! ”
Pope Lick Monster – A : “ I do n’t know what that is . ” EM : “ I think it ’s a monster that licks the Pope . ” A : “ If it ’s licking the Pope , it ’s probably treyf . ”
Sasquatch – A : “ What is sasquatch like ? ” EM : “ I ’d imagine kind of stringy . ” A : “ No , that ’s not what I mean . ” EM : “ Kind of ape - like I guess . ”
A : “ If it ’s still undetermined , it might be kosher , but maybe not . ”
Sea Monkeys – A : “ Only if they have fins and scales .
Wait a minute–are n’t they actually brine shrimp ?
Then no . ” EM : “ I do n’t think so .
The package shows these cute little things with human faces . ”
A : “ Well , in that case … NO ! ”
Shedim ( chicken - legged demon ) – A : “ If you have to eat a demon , you really ought to just go off and die somewhere . ”
EM : “ Good point . ”
Vegetable Lamb of Tartary – A : “ Oh , absolutely kosher !
Vegetables are kosher and lambs are kosher !
Nice combination .
How about some mint with that meal ! ”
EM : “ And monkeys are n’t kosher , right ? ”
A : “ You certainly are n’t . ”

From the reports of a February 21st Rasmussen Poll :
The latest Rasmussen Reports telephone survey of Virginia voters found Democrat Mark Warner still holding a significant lead over Republican Jim Gilmore in the race for the U.S. Senate .
Warner leads Gilmore by twenty percentage points , 57 % to 37 % .
More interestingly , Warner has significant back from conservatives :
Warner earns high levels of support from liberals ( 88 % ) and moderates ( 70 % ) and even a third of conservative voters ( 34 % ) .
Gilmore attracts 60 % of conservatives and 24 % of moderate voters .
Is this the ripple down effect we can expect in the 2008 elections from 8 years of the Bush Administration ?

What was lost tens of millions of years ago is now found .
A fossil animal locked in Lebanese limestone has been shown to be an extremely precious discovery - a snake with two legs .
Scientists have only a handful of specimens that illustrate the evolutionary narrative that goes from ancient lizard to limbless modern serpent .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Researchers at the European Light Source ( ESRF ) in Grenoble , France , used intense X - rays to confirm that a creature imprinted on a rock , and with one visible leg , had another appendage buried just under the surface of the slab .
" We were sure he had two legs but it was great to see it , and we hope to find other characteristics that we could n't see on the other limb , " said Alexandra Houssaye from the National Museum of Natural History , Paris .
The 85 cm - long ( 33 in ) creature , known as Eupodophis descouensi , comes from the Late Cretaceous , about 92 million years ago .
How Eupodophis descouensi might have looked .
The legs are far down the body
Unearthed near the village of al - Nammoura , it was originally described in 2000 .
Its remains are divided across the two interior faces of a thin limestone block that has been broken apart .
Synchrotron - radiation computed laminography produces fine detail A portion of the vertebral column is missing ; and in the process of preservation , the " tail " has become detached and positioned near the head .
But it is the unmistakable leg bones - fibula , tibia and femur - that catch the eye .
The stumpy hind - limb is only 2 cm ( 0.8 in ) long , and was presumably utterly useless to the animal in life .
Current evidence suggests that snakes started to emerge less than 150 million years ago .
Two theories compete .
One points to a land origin in which lizards started to burrow , and as they adapted to their subterranean existence , their legs were reduced and lost - first the forelimbs and then the hind - limbs .
The second theory considers the origin to be in water , from marine reptiles .
This makes the few known bipedal snakes in the fossil record hugely significant , because they could hold the clues that settle this particular debate .
The top picture is a synchrotron view of the visible snake leg Synchrotron light in the bottom view illuminates the hidden limb
" Every detail can be very important in establishing the great relationships and that 's why we must know them very well , " explained Ms Houssaye .
" I wanted to study the inner structure of different bones and so for that you would usually use destructive methods ; but given that this is the only specimen [ of E. descouensi ] , it is totally impossible to do that .
" 3D reconstruction techniques were the only solution .
We needed a good resolution and only this machine can do that , " she told BBC News .
EUROPEAN LIGHT SOURCE
Electrons are fired into a linac , or straight accelerator .
They 're boosted in a small ring before entering the storage ring .
The superfast particles are corralled by a train of magnets .
Energy lost by turning electrons emerges as intense light ( X - rays ) .
The 850 m - circumference ring has 32 magnet clusters , or cells .
Electrons turned by plain magnets produce ' standard ' X -rays .
Particles ' wiggled ' at undulator magnets emit stronger X - rays .
X - rays can't turn with electrons and head straight down beamlines .
Experiment ' hutches ' receive the most intense X - rays in Europe .
The light probes materials on the atomic and molecular scale .
Robots can place many samples in the beam for rapid science .
ESRF data leads to new materials , drugs , electronics , etc. BACK NEXT 1 of 3 That machine is the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility .
This giant complex on the edge of the Alps produces an intense , high - energy light that can pierce just about any material , revealing its inner structure .
For this study , the fossil snake was clamped to an inclined table and rotated in front of the facility 's brilliant X - ray beam .
In a process known as computed laminography , many hundreds of 2D images are produced which can be woven , with the aid of a smart algorithm , into a detailed 3D picture .
The finished product , which can be spun around on a computer screen , reveals details that will be measured in just millionths of a metre .
The E. descouensi investigation shows the second leg hidden inside the limestone is bent at the knee .
" We can even see ankle bones , " ESRF 's resident palaeontologist Paul Tafforeau said .
" In most cases , we can't find digits ; but that may be because they are not preserved or because , as this is a vestigial leg , they were never present . "
To modern eyes , it may seem strange to think of a snake with legs .
But look at some of the more primitive modern snakes , such as boas and pythons , and you 'll see evidence of their legged ancestry - tiny " spurs " sited near their ends , which today are used as grippers during sex .

99.9999999 uptime ( nine nines )
09/04/2007
Concurrency , scalability , uptime .
As internet - based computing and the internet grow in ubiquity , these characteristics become much more than buzzwords or sales points — they become vital to the life of your company , whether you are hosting or using web services , selling or buying .
Uptime is often stated in terms of a percentage of availability , something like 99.99 % ( one hour downtime a year ) is desirable , or perhaps even the fabled " five nines " , 99.999 % , which comes out to something around 5 minutes downtime a year .
Hardly worth monitoring :-) .
But how would you like " nine nines " reliability ?
That 's 99.9999999 % uptime , which pretty much means that if you blink sometime over the next year , you 'd miss the downtime completely .
It can be done , and apparently has been done , in Erlang .
Steve Vinoski mentions this in his article in IEEE Internet Computing , where he talks about his own introduction to Erlang :
Unfortunately , the more I learned about Erlang , the more I also had that sinking feeling about how much time I ’d spent over the years trying to ( re ) invent the wheels that * Erlang / OTP already provides * .
Historically I think many project teams have ended up with a pile of re-invented wheels over in the corner .
Most folks have wised up over the years , and no longer embark on disastrous errands such as re-inventing their own object - relational database mapping layer , etc .
But these core problems of high concurrency , fault tolerance , and reliability really cry out for a new approach .
These are particularly hard wheels to manage , especially in standard environments such as Java or C++ , and re-inventing them is less appealing than ever .
And of course , as with all languages and technologies , just seeing what 's possible — and how others have solved these problems — can help you directly , even if you never use the technology itself .
Steve sums it up nicely at the end of the article :
Meanwhile , do yourself a favor and get a copy of Programming Erlang .
Even if you never write a single line of production Erlang code , reading and understanding this excellent book and the language it describes will make you a better developer .

Advertisement Astronomers have captured the first footage of a solar " tsunami " hurtling through the Sun 's atmosphere at over a million kilometres per hour .
The event was captured by Nasa 's twin Stereo spacecraft designed to make 3D images of our parent star .
Naturally , this type of tsunami does not involve water ; instead , it is a wave of pressure that travels across the Sun very fast .
Details were reported at the UK National Astronomy Meeting in Belfast .
In half an hour , we saw the tsunami cover almost the full disc of the Sun
David Long
In a solar tsunami , a huge explosion near the Sun , such as a coronal mass ejection or flare , causes a pressure pulse to propagate outwards in a circular pattern .
Last year 's solar tsunami , which took place on 19 May 2007 , lasted for about 35 minutes , reaching peak speeds about 20 minutes after the initial blast .
Co-author David Long , from Trinity College Dublin ( TCD ) , Ireland , commented : " The energy released in these explosions is phenomenal ; about two billion times the annual world energy consumption in just a fraction of a second .
Two Stereo spacecraft are monitoring the Sun 's activity " In half an hour , we saw the tsunami cover almost the full disc of the Sun , nearly a million kilometres away from the epicentre . "
His colleague Dr Peter Gallagher , who is also from TCD , said the shockwave moved out exactly like a tsunami on Earth .
" A series of troughs and crests in pressure causes it to propagate outwards .
But on the Sun , we have hot gas , " he explained .
" When I m talking to someone in a room , my voice is carried by pressure waves in the gas that 's between us ; it 's the much the same on the Sun . "
However , it was not exactly the same , Dr Gallagher added , because on the Sun , magnetic fields also helped the waves along .
The phenomenon is therefore known as a magneto - acoustic wave .
Theory problem Solar tsunamis were originally discovered by the Soho spacecraft almost a decade ago .
However , the observations did not fit at all well with theory : the problem was that the waves were travelling too slowly .
After the two Stereo spacecraft launched in 2006 , scientists were able to get images of the Sun at a much higher rate than was possible with Soho .
And when they observed a solar tsunami again last year , their observations matched theoretical predictions .
Stereo mission guide " We found that the speed was probably twice as fast as we had previously thought , " Dr Gallagher told BBC News .
" We 've seen from this set of observations that if the time interval between images is too long , its easy to underestimate the speed that the waves are moving . "
With Soho , the researchers were only able to take images in the upper section of the corona - the outer part of the Suns atmosphere .
Stereo's Extreme Ultraviolet Imager ( EUVI ) instruments monitor the Sun at four wavelengths , which allowed astronomers to see how the wave moved through the different layers of the solar atmosphere .
" We were able to show for the first time that this wave actually propagates almost all the way from the surface of the Sun to high up in the Sun 's atmosphere , " said Dr Gallagher .
The researchers even saw the pressure wave bouncing off irregular regions of the Suns atmosphere , generating reflections or diffraction patterns - exactly as tsunamis have been observed to do on Earth when they crash against land .

What are these ?

A future value ( or simply “ future ” ) is a value that might not be knowable until a later time , such as “ the value of the next key you press ” , or “ the value of LambdaPix stock at noon next Monday ” ( both from the time you first read this sentence ) , or “ how many tries it will take me to blow out all the candles on my next birthday cake ” .
Unlike an imperative computation , each future has a unique value — although you probably cannot yet know what that value is .
I ’ve implemented this notion of futures as part of a library Reactive .
Edits :
2008 -04 -04 : tweaked tag ; removed first section heading .
You can force a future , which makes you wait ( block ) until its value is knowable .
Meanwhile , what kinds of things can you do a future now ?
Apply a function to the not - yet - known value , resulting in another future .
For instance , suppose fc :: Future Char is the first character you type after a specific time .
Then fmap toUpper fc :: Future Char is the capitalized version of the future character .
Thus , Future is a functor .
The resulting future is knowable when fc is knowable .
is the first character you type after a specific time .
Then is the capitalized version of the future character .
Thus , is a functor .
The resulting future is knowable when is knowable .
What about combining two or more future values ?
For instance , how many days between the first time after the start of 2008 that the temperature exceeds 80 degrees Fahrenheit at ( a ) my home and ( b ) your home .
Each of those dates is a future value , and so is the difference between them .
If those futures are m80 , y80 :: Day , then the difference is diff80 = lift A2 ( -) m80 y80 .
That difference is becomes knowable when the later of the m80 and y80 becomes knowable .
So Future is an applicative functor ( AF ) , and one can apply a future function to a future argument to get a future result ( futRes = futFun <*> futArg ) .
The other AF method is pure :: a ->
Future a , which makes a future value that is always knowable to be a given value .
, then the difference is .
That difference is becomes knowable when the later of the and becomes knowable .
So is an applicative functor ( AF ) , and one can apply a future function to a future argument to get a future result ( ) .
The other AF method is , which makes a future value that is always knowable to be a given value .
Sometimes questions about the future are staged , such as “ What will be the price of milk the day after it the temperature next drops below freezing ” ( plus specifics about where and starting when ) .
Suppose priceOn :: Day ->
Future Price gives the price of milk on a given day ( at some specified place ) , and nextFreeze :: Day ->
Future Day is the first date of a freeze ( also at a specified place ) after a given date .
Then our query is expressed as next Freeze today >>= priceOn , which has type Future Price .
Future is thus a monad .
( The return method of a monad is the same as the pure method of an AF . )
From another perspective on monads , we can collapse a future future into a future , using join :: Future ( Future a ) ->
Future a .
These three ways of manipulating futures are all focused on the value of futures .
There is one more , very useful , combining operation that focuses on the timing of futures : given two futures , which one comes first .
Although we ca n’t know the answer now , we can ask the question now and get a future .
For example , what is the next character that either you or I will type ?
Call those characters mc , yc :: Future Char .
The earlier of the two is mc `mappend` yc , which has type Future Char .
Thus , Future ty is a monoid for every type ty .
The other monoid method is mempty ( the identity for mappend ) , which is the future that never happens .
Why are n’t futures just lazy values ?
If futures were just lazy values , then we would n’t have to use pure , fmap , ( <*>) ( and liftA _n_ ) , and ( >>= ) .
However , there is n’t enough semantic content in a plain - old - value to determine which of two values is earlier ( mappend on futures ) .
A semantics for futures
To clarify my thinking about future values , I ’d like to have a simple and precise denotational semantics and then an implementation that is faithful to the semantics .
The module Data .
SFuture provides such a semantics , although the implementation in Data .
Future is not completely faithful .
The model
The semantic model is very simple : ( the meaning of ) a future value is just a time / value pair .
The particular choice of “ time ” type is not important , as long as it is ordered .
newtype Future t a = Future ( Time t , a ) deriving ( Functor , Applicative , Monad , Show )
Delightfully , almost all required functionality comes automatically from the derived class instances , thanks to the standard instances for pairs and the definition of Time , given below .
Rather than require our time type to be bounded , we can easily add bounds to an arbitrary type .
Rather than defining
Time t now , let ’s discover the definition while considering the required meanings of the class instances .
The definition will use just a bit of wrapping around the type t , demonstrating a principle Conor McBride expressed as “ types do n’t just contain data , types explain data ” .
Functor
The Functor instance is provided entirely by the standard instance for pairs :
instance Functor ( ( , ) a ) where fmap f ( a , b ) = ( a , f b )
In particular , fmap f ( Future ( t , b ) ) == Future t ( f b ) , as desired .
Applicative and Time
Look next at the Applicative instance for pairs :
instance Monoid a => Applicative ( ( , ) a ) where pure x = ( mempty , x ) ( u , f ) <*> ( v , x ) = ( u `mappend` v , f x )
So Time t must be a monoid , with mempty being the earliest time and mappend being max .
We ’ll define Time with the help of the Max monoid :
newtype Max a = Max { getMax :: a } deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show , Bounded ) instance ( Ord a , Bounded a ) => Monoid ( Max a ) where mempty = Max minBound Max a `mappend` Max b = Max ( a `max` b)
We could require that the underlying time parameter type t be Bounded , but I want to have as few restrictions as possible .
For instance , Integer , Float , and Double are not Bounded , and neither are the types in the Time library .
Fortunately , it ’s easy to add bounds to any type , preserving the existing ordering .
data AddBounds a = MinBound | NoBound a | MaxBound deriving ( Eq , Ord , Read , Show ) instance Bounded ( AddBounds a ) where minBound = MinBound maxBound = MaxBound
With these two reusable building blocks , our Time definition falls right out :
type Time t = Max ( AddBounds t)
Monad
For our Monad instance , we just need an instance for pairs equivalent to the Monad Writer instance .
instance Monoid o => Monad ( ( , ) o ) where return = pure ( o , a ) >>= f = ( o `mappend` o' , a ' ) where ( o ' , a ' ) = f a
Consequently ( using join m = m >>= id ) , join ( ( o , ( o ' , a ) ) ) == ( o `mappend` o' , a ) .
Again , the standard instance implies exactly the desired meaning for futures .
Future ( t , a ) >>= f is available exactly at the later of t and the availability of f a .
We might have guessed instead that the time is simply the time of f a , e.g. , assuming it to always be at least t .
However , f a could result from pure and so have time minBound .
Monoid
The last piece of Future functionality is the Monoid instance , and I do n’t know how to get that instance to define itself .
I want mappend to yield the earlier of two futures , choosing the first argument when simultaneous .
The never - occuring mempty has a time beyond all t values .
instance Ord t => Monoid ( Future t a ) where mempty = Future ( maxBound , error " it 'll never happen , buddy " ) fut@( Future ( t , _ ) ) `mappend` fut ' @( Future ( t ' , _ ) ) = if t <= t' then fut else fut '
Coming next
Tune in for the next post , which describes the current implementation of future values in Reactive .
The implementation uses multi- threading and is not quite faithful to the semantics given here .
I ’m looking for a faithful implementation .
A following post will then describe the use of future values in an elegant new implementation of functional reactive programming .
A future value ( or simply “ future ” ) is a value that might not be knowable until a later time , such as “ the value of the next key you press ” , or “ the ...

We often think of the Internet as a platform for unfettered global communication , where information flows freely , innovators can launch new applications at will , and everyone can have a voice .
But it ’s unlikely that our children ’s Internet will look anything like what we have now .
How might the Internet as we know it die ?
Here are 10 possibilities .
Someone subverts the Domain Name Service .
The Internet relies on DNS .
But if someone broke — or worse , subverted — the fundamental way in which we find web sites , we would n’t trust URLs any more .
Phishing would be easy .
Own the DNS and you own the Internet .
Zombie networks attack !
Untold numbers of enslaved PCs are waiting to do the bidding of shadowy hackers .
Matt Sergeant of MessageLabs puts the size of the Storm botnet at between five and 10 million machines ( though others peg the size of the network at much less . )
Today , bots fill our inboxes with spam .
But in the past , they ’ve been used to take out companies and countries and to blackmail sites .
In the end , it ’s an arms race in which only one side has to play by the rules .
Massive physical infrastructure failure .
If an accident involving a couple of cables in the Mediterranean can make the Internet unusable for hundreds of millions , imagine what an intentional attack could do .
Death by a thousand fragments :
Ever since Usenet , people have been grouping together with those who think like them .
In his book “ The Big Switch , ” Nicholas Carr cites one study that claimed more than 90 percent of the links originating within either the conservative or liberal community stay within that community .
Some link referral tools can even be configured to keep visitors on sites with the same world view .
The end result ?
Islands of like - minded people , increasingly sure there is only one right answer and that they ’re in sole possession of it .
And an end to the dreams of a global community envisioned by the Internet ’s creators .
A really good virus breaks the routers .
The Internet ’s self - healing mechanisms rely on the Border Gateway Protocol , or BGP .
But what if someone gets inside the routers ?
In a 2006 NANOG presentation , Cisco looked at claims of vulnerability and concluded that “ the most damaging attacks are caused by the deliberate misconfiguration of a trusted router . ”
Corrupt BGP , and you not only stop the Internet from forwarding traffic , you interfere with our ability to get to the routers and fix them .
Updates break how updates work .
Most software these days is designed to patch itself and remain current .
But sometimes the process of automated upgrades triggers its own problems .
On Aug. 16 , 2007 , Skype went down in what the company claimed was a side effect of a massive automatic update to Windows .
It ’s only a matter of time before an update makes a fundamental piece of software , like a networking stack , unable to update itself , cutting off millions and requiring manual intervention .
The Net stops being neutral .
If the carriers start to charge us for access to sites the way cable companies charge for premium television , pretty soon you ’ll have a “ Google fee ” on your monthly bill .
This already happens with many mobile phones that feature the services of Facebook and YouTube .
It ’s perhaps the most insidious death , because it would signal the end of innovation — no one would be able to launch the next Skype , Twitter or YouTube without the tacit approval of carriers .
The lawyers get involved .
The Internet has been an experiment in free speech .
That may be coming to an end .
Unable to go after the sites themselves , lawyers go after the hosters and registrars .
That ’s how Swiss banking group Julius Baer took whistleblower Wikileaks off the air .
And once there ’s precedent , others are sure to follow .
The recording industry is already wondering if it can go after carriers for enabling copyright infringement .
This is the irony of Net Neutrality :
When telcos start treating different bytes differently , they are n’t “ common carriers ” and may be liable for what they transmit , including illegal content .
So they ’ll comply .
Walled gardens :
Many countries already restrict how the Internet is used .
China ’s firewall — which includes 30,000 people tasked with finding improper users — is a good example .
But the Internet is a tool for social change and revolution that could threaten any government .
Imagine , for example , a U.S. Congress that outlaws online pornography and blocks known adult sites ( which accounted for 18.8 percent of all web visits in 2004 , according to Hitwise , although the U.S. government says that figure is actually a mere 1 percent . )
Instead of a global Internet , we ’d have a return to localized standards of decency imposed by legislators .
It ’d be like “ Dirty Dancing ” all over again .
Humans take themselves out :
As Discover Magazine pointed out years ago , we ’ve got plenty of ways to do ourselves in , from nukes to plagues to sucking ourselves into a black hole of our own making .
And what ’s an Internet without users ?
The Internet has already morphed from its initial aspirations of open academia to a commercial platform controlled by corporations and carriers .
[ digg=http://digg.com/tech_news/10_Ways_the_Internet_As_We_Know_It_WillnDie]In many ways , the time between the start of ARPAnet in 1969 and the end of Netscape this past February is just a brief period in history that the Facebook generation wo n’t miss .
At first in Austin , Hillary did not channel Jane Austen .
She tried once more to cast Obama as a weak sister on his willingness to talk to Raúl Castro .
Obama tapped into his inner chick and turned the other cheek .
To cheers , he said , “ I think that it ’s important for us , in undoing the damage that has been done over the last seven years , for the president to be willing to take that extra step . ”
Hillary tried to rough up Obama on copying his pal ’s language even as she copied her husband ’s line from 1992 : “ The hits that I took in this election are nothing compared to the hits that the people in this state and this country are taking every day of their lives under this administration . ”
While Obama looked at her warily , even fearfully , Hillary suddenly switched to her feminine side .
Getting New Hampshire misty , she said she was “ absolutely honored ” to be there with him and that “ whatever happens , we ’re going to be fine . ”
( Her campaign defended the originality of the John Edwardsian sentiment , saying it had even been expressed by the likes of Lindsay Lohan ) .
The press hailed the moment as heartfelt , but it was simply Hillary ’s calculated attempt to woo women and protect her future in the party  by seeming more collegial .
She ’s furious that the Chicago kid got in the picture .
Her “ My sister , my daughter ” flip from muscular to tremulous left everyone confused .
Many characterized her emulation of empathy as elegiac and submissive .
But she dispelled that Friday morning when she told Evan Smith , the editor of Texas Monthly , that she will push for Florida and Michigan delegates to be seated , despite her promise .
Not for herself , mind you , but for them .
“ It ’s in large measure because both the voters and the elected officials in Michigan and Florida feel so strongly about this , ” she said .
A. looks a lot different now —
I ’ve caught the TV interviews and op - ed opining — but the old self - righteousness is still there .

I have no apologies to make .
When you ’re born in a backwater shack in Pin Point , Ga. ; when you grow up poor , cold and hungry ; when you get a bellyful of racial slights and condescension ; when you ca n’t get a job after graduation , even with a degree from Yale , because you ’re competing with rich , white , well - connected guys who were legacies at Yale , that ’s when the anger boils up in you .
Every Southern black who lived through Jim Crow knows the feeling .
From the time I was a kid , when my white classmates made fun of me as “ ABC ” — “ America ’s Blackest Child ” — the beast of rage against The Man has gnawed at my soul .
Your Yale law degree is n’t worth 15 cents when everyone assumes you got special treatment because of the color of your skin , when , really , it was the witless Wonder Bread elites who got special treatment because of the color of their daddy ’s money .
I still have a 15 - cent sticker on the frame of my law degree because it ’s tainted .
I keep it in the basement .
That ’s why I refuse , as a justice , to give a helping hand to blacks .
I do n’t want them to suffer from the advantages I had .
Few of them will be able to climb to my heights , of course , but if they do , they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they made it on their own , as individuals .
I ’m a writer , podcaster , and once and future game developer .
My two novels , Grey and Yarn , were both nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award and are set in the same future dominated by celebrity , fashion , satire , and violence .

「 空気」とはまことに大きな絶対権をもった妖怪である。一種の「超能力」かも知れない。何しろ、専門家ぞろいの海軍の首脳に、「作戦として形をなさない」ことが「明白な事実」であることを、強行させ、後になると、その最高責任者が、なぜそれを行ったかを一言も説明できないような状態に落とし込んでしまうのだから、スプーンが曲がるどころの比ではない。こうなると、統計も資料も分析も、またそれに類する科学的手段や論理的論証も、一切は無駄であって、そういうものをいかに精緻に組み立てておいても、いざというときは、それら一切消しとんで、すべてが「空気」に決定されることになるかも知れぬ。とすろと、われわれはまず、何よりも先に、この「空気」なるものの正体を把握しておかないと、将来何が起るやら、皆目見当がつかないことになる。
一体、以上に記した「空気」とは何であろうか。それは非常に強固でほぼ絶対的な支配力をもつ「判断の基準」であり、それに抵抗する者を異端として、「抗空気罪」で社会的に葬るほどの力をもつ超能力であることは明らかである。以上の諸例は、われわれが「空気」に順応して判断し決断しているのであって、総合された客観情勢の論理的検討の下に判断を下して決断しているのでないことを示している。だが通常この基準は口にされない。それは当然であり、論理の積み重ねで説明することができないから「空気」と呼ばれているのだから。従ってわれわれは常に、論理的判断の基準と、空気的判断の基準という、一種の二重基準（ダブルスタンダード）のもとに生きているわけである。そしてわれわれが通常口にするのは論理的判断の基準だが、本当の決断の基本となっているのは、「空気が許さない」という空気的判断の基準である。
一体「空気」とは何か。これを調べるための最もよい方法は、単純な「空気発生状態」を調べ、まずその基本的図式を描いてみることであろう。以下は大変興味深い一例なので、『比較文化論の試み』でも取り上げたが、もう一度ここで取り上げさせていただく。
大畠清教授が、ある宗教学専門雑誌に、面白い随想を書いておられる。イスラエルで、ある遺跡を発掘していたとき、古代の墓地が出てきた。人骨・髑髏がざらざらと出てくる。こういう場合、必要なサンプル以外の人骨は、一応少し離れた場所に投棄して墓の形態その他を調べるわけだが、その投棄が相当の作業量となり、日本人とユダヤ人が共同で、毎日のように人骨を運ぶことになった。それが約一週間ほどつづくと、ユダヤ人の方は何でもないが、従事していた日本人二名の方は少しおかしくなり、本当に病人同様の状態になってしまった。ところが、この人骨投棄が終ると二人ともケロリとなおってしまった。この二人に必要だったことは、どうやら「おはらい」だったらしい。実をいうと二人ともクリスチャンであったのだが――またユダヤ人の方は、終始、何の影響も受けたとは見られなかった、という随想である。
骨は元来は物質である。この物質が放射能のような形で人間に対して何らかの影響を与えるなら、それが日本人にだけ影響を与えるとは考えられない。従ってこの影響は非物質的なもので、人骨・髑髏という物質が日本人には何らかの心理的影響を与え、その影響は身体的に病状として表われるほど強かったが、一方ユダヤ人には、何らの心理的影響も与えなかった、と見るべきである。おそらくこれが「空気の基本型」である。
といえば不思議に思われる向きもあるかもしれないが、われわれが俗にいう「空気」とこの「空気の基本型」との差は、後述するように、その醸成の過程の単純さ複雑さの違いにすぎないのである。従って、この状態をごく普通の形で記すと、「二人は墓地発掘の『現場の空気』に耐えられず、ついに半病人になって、休まざるを得なくなった」という形になっても不思議ではない。
物質から何らかの心理的・宗教的影響をうける、言いかえれば物質の背後に何かが臨在していると感じ、知らず知らずのうちにその何かの影響を受けるという状態、この状態の指摘とそれへの抵抗は、『福翁自伝』にもでてくる。しかし彼は、否彼のみならず明治の啓蒙家たちは、「石ころは物質にすぎない。この物質を拝むことは迷信であり、野蛮である。文明開化の科学的態度とはそれを否定棄却すること、そのためには啓蒙的科学的教育をすべきだ、そしてそれで十分だ」と考えても、「日本人が、なぜ、物質の背後に何かが臨在すると考えるのか、またなぜ何かが臨在すると感じて身体的影響を受けるほど強くその影響を受けるのか。まずそれを解明すべきだ」とは考えなかった。まして、彼の目から見れば、開化もせず科学的でもなかったであろう ” 野蛮”な民族――たとえばセム族――の中に、臨在感を徹底的に拒否し罪悪視する民族がなぜ存在するのか、といった点は、はじめから見逃していた。無理もない。彼にとっては、西欧化的啓蒙がすべてであり、彼のみでなく明治のすべてに、先進国学習はあっても、「探究」の余裕はなかったのである。従ってこの態度は、啓蒙的といえるが、科学的とは言いがたい。従ってその後の人びとは、何らかの臨在を感じても、感じたといえば「頭が古い」ことになるから感じても感じていないことにし、感じないふりをすることを科学的と考えて現在に至っている。このことは超能力ブームの時に、非常に面白い形で出てきた。
私がある雑誌に 「いわゆる超能力は存在しない」と記したところ、「おまえがそんな科学盲従の男だとは思わなかった」といった投書がきた。超能力なるものをたとえ感じても感じていないことにすること、いわば「福沢的啓蒙主義」をこの人は科学と考え、この啓蒙主義への盲従を科学への盲従と考え、それに反発しているのである。従って多くの人のいう科学とは、実は、明示的啓蒙主義のことなのである。しかし啓蒙主義とは、一定の水準に ” 民度”
を高めるという受験勉強型促成教育主義で、「かく考えるべし」の強制ではあっても、探究解明による超克ではない。従って、否定されたものは逆に根強く潜在してしまう。そのため、現在もなお、潜在する無言の臨在感に最終決定権を奪われながら、どうにもできないのである。
一体なぜわれわれは、人骨、車、金属棒等に、また逆の形で戦艦大和といった物質・物体に何らかの臨在感を感じ、それに支配されるのであろうか。それを究明して、「空気の支配」を断ち切ることのほうが、むしろ科学的であろう。
＜中略＞
臨在感の支配により人間が言論・行動等を規定される対一歩は、対象の臨在感的な把握にはじまり、これは感情移入を前提とする。感情移入はすべての民族にあるが、この把握が成り立つには、感情移入を絶対化して、それを感情移入だとは考えない状態にならねばならない。従ってその前提となるのは、感情移入の日常化・無意識化乃至は生活科であり、一言でいえば、それをしないと「生きている」という実感がなくなる世界、すなわち日本的世界であらねばならないのである。
聖書学者の塚本虎二先生は、「日本人の親切」という、非常に面白い随想を書いておられる。氏が若いころ下宿しておられた家の老人は、大変に親切な人で、寒中に、あまりに寒かろうと思って、ヒヨコにお湯をのませた、そしてヒヨコを全部殺してしまった。そして塚本先生は「君、笑ってはいけない、日本人の親切とはこういうものだ」と記されている。私はこれを読んで、だいぶ前の新聞記事を思い出した。それは、若い母親が、保育器の中の自分の赤ん坊に、寒かろうと思って懐炉を入れて、これを殺してしまい、過失致死罪で法廷に立ったという記事である。これはヒヨコにお湯をのますのと全く同じ行き方であり、両方とも、全くの善意に基づく親切なのである。
よ く 「 善意が通らない 」 「善意が通らない社会は悪い」といった発言が新聞の投書などにあるが、こういう善意が通ったら、それこそ命がいくつあっても足りない。従って、「こんな善意は通らない方がよい」といえば、おそらくその反論は「善意で懐炉を入れても赤ん坊が死なない保育器を作らない社会が悪い」ということになるであろう。だが、この場合、善意・悪意は実は関係のないこと、悪意でも同じ関係は成立つのだから。また、ヒヨコにお湯をのませたり、保育器に懐炉を入れたりするのは“科学的啓蒙”が足りないという主張も愚論、問題の焦点は、なぜ感情移入を絶対化するのかにある。というのは、ヒヨコにお湯をのまし、保育器に懐炉を入れるのは完全な感情移入であり、対者と自己との、または第三者との区別がなくなった状態だからである。そしてそういう状態になることを絶対化し、そういう状態になれなければ、そうさせないように阻む障害、または阻んでいると空想した対象を、悪として排除しようとする心理的状態が、感情移入の絶対化であり、これが対象の臨在感的把握いわば「物神化とその支配」の基礎になっているわけである。
この現象は、簡単にいえば 「 乗り移る」または「乗り移らす」という現象である。ヒヨコに、自分が乗り移るか、あるいは第三者を乗り移らすのである。すなわち、「自分は寒中に冷水をのむのはいやだし、寒中に人に冷水をのますような冷たい仕打ちは絶対にしない親切な人間である」がゆえに、自分もしくはその第三者を、ヒヨコに乗り移らせ、その乗り移った自分もしくは第三者にお湯をのませているわけである。そしてこの現象は社会の至る所にある。教育ママは「学歴なきがゆえに……」と見た夫を子供に乗り移らせ、子供というヒヨコの口に「教育的配合飼料」をむりやりつめこみ、学校という保育器に懐炉を入れに行く。そして、それで何か事故が起れば「善意から懐炉を入れたのだ、それが事故を起すような、そんな善意の通らない『保育器＝社会や学校制度』が悪い」ということになる。そしてそういわれれば、だれも一言もない。
Ａ君：人間の脳は、何かを理解したいという場合に、システマタイズ（システム化）、エンパサイズ（感情移入）という二種類のアプローチをする。システム化を狙って得る報酬は、コントロールできるという楽しさである。一方、感情移入による楽しさは、「分かり合えたね」ということである。重要なことは、システム化側に存在するのが、・エンジニア、・科学、・一神教、・政治、・官僚、・法学であり、感情移入側に存在するのが、・アミニズム、・他者理解、・物語、・経営、・カウンセリング、・心理療法などがある。
Ｂ君：これらのバランスがうまく取れるかどうか、それが重要だな。
Ａ君：科学が進歩しすぎると、感情移入の対象としては不適当になるので、反科学的な心理状態が高まる。そこで、感情移入型の対応が可能な対象として、疑似科学的な動きを増加させることが起きるのは事実でしょう。その典型例が、「水からの伝言」。これだって、感情移入型の人間を取り込む目的で作られている本だ。
Ｂ君：システム化をするには、実は、全体観をもてることが必要。それが難しい。それがストレスになる。だから、適切な全体観を把握することを専門とする人間を養成しない限り、科学全体は徐々に困難になるかもしれない。
さて、 「 『空気』の研究」から「『水＝通常性』の研究」まで、臨在感的把握とか、空気の醸成とか、「父と子」の隠し合いの倫理とか、一教師・オール３生徒の一君万民方式とか、それを支える情況論理と情況倫理とか、実にさまざまなことをのべてきた。では以上に共通する内容を一言でのべれば、それは何なのか。言うまでもなく、それは「虚構の世界」「虚構の中に真実を求める社会」であり、それが体制となった「虚構の支配機構」だということである。
虚構の存在しない社会は存在しないし、人間を動かすものが虚構であること、否、虚構だけであることも否定できない。従ってそこに「何かの力」が作用して当然である。それは演劇や祭儀を例にとれば、だれにでも自明のことであろう。簡単にいえば、舞台とは、周囲を完全に遮断することで成立する一つの世界、一つの情緒論理の場の設定であり、その設定のもとに人々は演技し、それが演技であることを、演出者と観客との間で隠すことによって、一つの真実が表現されている。端的にいえば、女形は男性であるという「事実」を大声で指摘しつづける者は、そこに存在してはならぬ「非演劇人・非観客」であり、そういう者が存在すれば、それが表現している真実が崩れてしまう世界である。だが「演技者は観客のために隠し、観客は演技者のために隠す」で構成される世界、その状況論理が設定されている劇場という小世界内に、その対象を臨在感的に把握している観客との間で“空気”を醸成し、全体空気拘束主義的に人びとを別世界に移すというその世界が、人に影響を与え、その人たちを動かす「力」になることは否定できない。従って問題は、人がこういう状態になりうると言うことではなく、こういう状態が社会のどの部門をどのように支配しているかと言うことである。
ただ問題は、この秩序を維持しようとするなら、すべての集団は「劇場の如き閉鎖性」をもたねばならず、従って集団は閉鎖集団となり、そして全日本をこの秩序でおおうつもりなら、必然的に鎖国とならざるを得ないという点である。鎖国は最近ではいろいろと論じられているが、その最大の眼目は、情報統制であり、この点では現在の日本と、基本的には差はない。従って問題は、この日常性が政治、経済、外交、軍事、科学等々と言った部門を支配し、こういう形で、すなわち「父と子の隠し合い」の真実に基づく状態で、種々の決定が行われて果たしてそれで安全なのか、という問題である。そしてこのような方法に基づく決定が、その最弱点を露呈する部分が、おそらく外来思想、外交、軍事、科学的思考、すなわち鎖国が排除した部分なのである。
久々に書評。今日紹介するのは山本七平の『「空気」の研究』である。最近KYやらブログ炎上やらとの関係で再び注目を集めているこの本だが、私は疑似科学との絡みというちょっと違った側面からこの本を取り上げてみたい。日本を取り巻くこの「空気」は、日本におけるニセ科学、オカルト、スピリチュアルの問題にも一役買っているのだ。さて、ちょっと長くなるが、適当にコメントを挟みつつ引用する。「空気」の研究P.19より。「空気」の研究P.22より。日本の社会は、往々にして「空気」なるよくわからないものに支配され、動かされている。それは戦前、戦後を通じて一貫して変わらないものであり、現在でもＫＹなる言葉が流行語になるほどに、この「空気」という妖怪は相変わらず跳梁跋扈している。しかし、それでは一体この空気とは何かと問われると、きちんと答えられる人はほとんどいない。そしてそんな「わけのわからないもの」に支配された社会というのは非常に危うい。たとえば本書でも取り上げられているように、戦前勝利の根拠なく「空気」によって太平洋戦争に突入し、不利な戦況にもかかわらず降伏を許さない「空気」によっていつまでもずるずると犠牲を増やしていったように、現在でも明確な根拠もないのに「空気」のせいで社会が誤った方向に進む可能性は常にある。というかその事例は現在も枚挙にいとまがないと言ってよい。そしてまた、疑似科学の問題に関しても、この「空気」という妖怪は重要な役割を担っている。ゆえに、日本人がこの「空気」という妖怪を退治し、過去の過ちを繰り返さないようにするためには、まずこの「空気」とは何かを知り、どうすればそれに対処できるのかを学ばなくてはならない。「空気」の研究P.32より。単なるモノに何か（臨在感）を感じるというのは、人間が生得的に持つ性質である。通常このような心理的性質はアニミズムと呼ばれ、これはもっとも原始的な宗教でもある。山本七平は、このアニミズムこそ「空気」の原型であり下地であると喝破する。モノをモノと割り切れない人の心こそが「空気」を生み出す下地となり、そして疑似科学の跳梁跋扈を許す余地となるのだ。無論これが人間の生得的な性質である以上、欧米でのスピリチュアリズムの流行が示すように、「空気」の元は世界中に存在する。にもかかわらず日本でことさら「空気」が猛威をふるっているのは、欧米では「空気」に対処する社会的メカニズムが存在するのに対し、日本にはそれがないためである。本エントリのテーマから外れてしまうので詳しくは述べないが、そのあたりも本書では考察しているので興味のある人は本書を購読されたし。「空気」の研究P.33より。山本七平が問題視する、明治期の啓蒙主義の弊害は、現在の科学教育にもそのまま残っている。科学を体系的に学んだ人間は、「モノから感じられる何か（臨在感）」は錯覚に過ぎず、実際にはそんなものはないということを教えられる。しかし、好き好んで心理学をかじるようなものでもない限り、人間が「モノに何かを感じる」性質を生まれつき持っているということを習うことはない。その結果何が起こるかというと、例え科学教育を受けたものでも、「何か」を感じてしまったときにその経験と知識の矛盾に混乱を来し、その体験自体を否定するか疑似科学に転ぶかという両極端に走ってしまうことになるのだ。オウムにはまった理系学生などは後者の典型的な例であろう。ましてや白紙状態で何かを感じる経験をしたものは、その経験を絶対視し、それと矛盾する知識を頑として受け入れられなくなってしまう。かくして疑似科学やオカルトのビリーバーが誕生するわけである。「空気」の研究P.34より。しばらく前に「疑似科学批判批判」であちこち盛り上がっていたことがあったが、あの時の疑似科学批判批判者のピントの外しっぷりは、山本七平が指摘するこの思い違いに完全に重なるものがある。まあ彼らの意識する『科学』が受験勉強型速成教育に毛が生えた程度のものであり、また大槻教授のように未だに明示啓蒙主義的な疑似科学批判を繰り広げる人間もいる以上、完全に的外れというわけでもないのだが。それに疑似科学批判者の側も、批判批判者の科学認識のずれをきちんと捕捉できていない場合が往々にして見受けられるので、相互理解という点ではある意味おあいこかもしれない。また、現在の受験勉強型義務教育がこのような浅薄な科学理解を量産し続けているのであれば、それはそれで深刻な問題である。この本が書かれた当時から現在に至るまで、義務教育が科学の本質を伝えることなく表面的な理解にとどまっていることを意味しているからである。この問題を解決するためには、彼らの主張を頭ごなしに否定することは何の役にも立たない。現状を改善するためには、科学リテラシー教育に合わせて人間の心の性質についての教育、特に日本人の心のありようの特性についての教育を、義務教育レベルでもっと行う必要があると私は考える。「空気」の研究P.37より。小さな親切大きなお世話の典型的な例で、日本中どこにでも似たような話はころがっている。だが、これもまた「空気」と根を同じくする問題なのだ。このような感情移入に対する氏の心理的分析がなかなか興味深い。「空気」の研究P.39より。「空気」の研究の一つのキーワードとなるのが臨在感、もしくは対象への感情移入である。誤解して欲しくないのだが、私は「臨在感」や「感情移入」が良くない物だと言っているわけではない。自覚の無いままにこれらの「空気」に引きずられて、本来合理的な判断が必要な時でさえ、そうできずに判断を誤ることが問題だと言っているのである。そしてそうならないためにも、日本人に特有の心理的傾向、自身の心の動きについてきちんと把握しコントロール下に置くべきだと私は主張する。さて、話を疑似科学に戻すと、このような感情移入の最たるものが、「水からの伝言」であることは言うまでもないだろう。ちょっと調べてみたら「市民のための環境学ガイド」の安井さんがそのものズバリなことを書いていたので引用しておく。「空気」の問題に見られるように、日本の社会構造は、元々感情移入型の理解を優先しやすいようにできている。そして科学のような外来のシステマティックな営みは、元々ある感情移入型社会とまだきちんと折り合いが付いていない。そこに様々な問題が生じる余地があり、疑似科学の問題にも一役買っているというのが私の理解だ。さて、その後も以前書いたモノサシの話に通じる話など、疑似科学の問題に通じる様々な興味深い考察が続いているのだが、いちいち取り上げているといつまでたっても終わらないので、最後に最も重要であろうと思われる部分を引用する。「空気」の研究P.161より。日本の社会が虚構の支配に満ちた社会であるというこの指摘は、何度もその虚構と衝突してきた経験を持つ一モヒカン族として納得である。また、この虚構がそれを共有しないものと対峙した時にはあっさりと崩れるものであり、それゆえに日本だけで完結しない領域、外交・軍事・科学の領域において最大の弱点を晒すというのも同感だ。外交・軍事の世界については何かを語れる程詳しくないが、科学の世界に限っても、簡単にいくつも世界では通用しない日本だけのお約束（最近は国内でも通用しなくなって来ているものも多いが）を挙げることができる。最後に疑似科学に関して。疑似科学のビリーバーが彼らだけの虚構の世界に暮らしているというのは、疑似科学をウォッチしていると誰しもすぐに気づくことだろう。なぜなら疑似科学ウォッチャーは彼らの虚構を共有していないし、彼らの虚構は大抵現実とはうまく折り合いをつけることができないからだ。しかしビリーバー達は、通常その世界が虚構であることに気が付いていないし、気が付きたくもないと思っている。なぜなら往々にしてその虚構は彼らの心の拠りどころであるからだ。ゆえに彼らは、その虚構を壊そうとするものに対しては、激しい拒絶を示すし、どれだけ事実を突き付けられたところで、決して態度を変えることはない。それを認めてしまえばそれまで自分が安住してきた虚構の世界が崩壊してしまうからだ。そして、それを認めず目を背けさえすれば、とりあえず彼らの虚構は保たれるのである。彼らの虚構はもともと彼らの心の中にしかない、現実に根ざさないものだから。・日本に根ざす「空気」という妖怪と疑似科学は同根の問題であり、疑似科学の根を把握するには「空気」についても理解することが望ましい。・「空気」や疑似科学の根とは、「モノに何かを見出す心の働き（アニミズム）」である。・「空気」とは人々の間の「お約束」によって成り立つ社会的な虚構である。・「空気」に引きずられることなく理性を保つためには、空気とは何かを理解し、その特性と影響を把握して、自身と社会を相対化できる必要がある。最後に。この本は出版されたのが4半世紀前であるにも拘らず、扱うテーマが普遍的かつ生活に密着したものであるため、現在読んでもまるで違和感なく理解することができる。内容はかなり重いが、460円とワンコインで買える値段なので、「空気」という妖怪にいいようにされないためにも、未読の人はこの機会にぜひ読んでみてほしい。に続く
( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton will stop telling an emotional story about a uninsured pregnant woman who died after being denied medical care , Clinton 's campaign said .
Sen . Hillary Clinton was repeating a story she heard from someone on the campaign trail .
A hospital has raised questions over the accuracy of the story , and Clinton 's campaign has said although they had no reason to doubt the story , they were unable to confirm the details .
In the story , Clinton describes a woman from rural Ohio who was making minimum wage at a local pizza shop .
The woman , who was uninsured , became pregnant .
Clinton said the woman ran into trouble and went to a hospital in a nearby county but was denied treatment because she could n't afford a $ 100 payment .
In her speeches , Clinton said the woman later was taken to the hospital by ambulance and lost the baby .
The young woman was then taken by helicopter to a Columbus hospital where she died of complications .
Watch why the story is raising questions »
The New York senator heard the story during a campaign visit to a family 's living room in Pomeroy , Ohio , in late February .
Bryan Holman was hosting the candidate and told Clinton the story .
She has repeated it frequently since then .
As recently as Friday night in Grand Forks , North Dakota , Clinton said she was " just aching inside " as she was listening to the story .
" It is so wrong , in this good , great and rich country , that a young woman and her baby would die because she did n't have health insurance or a hundred dollars to get examined , " she said .
While Clinton never named the hospital in her speech , the woman she was referring to was treated at O'Bleness Memorial Hospital in Athens , Ohio .
The hospital said the woman did indeed have insurance , and , at least at their hospital , she was never turned away .
Hospital Chief Executive Officer Rick Castrop in a statement said , " we reviewed the medical and patient accounts of the patient " after she was named in a newspaper story about Clinton 's stump speech .
" There is no indication that she was ever denied medical care at any time , for any reason .
We clearly reject any perception that we ever denied any care to this woman . "
A hospital spokesperson confirmed to CNN the woman had insurance .
She said the hospital decided to come forward after people in the community began to question if they had denied her care .
Clinton 's speech accurately reflects what she was told that day , but the campaign admits they were not able to confirm the account .
Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee said , " She had no reason to doubt his word . "
" Candidates are told stories by people all the time , and it 's common for candidates to retell those stories .
It 's not always possible to fully vet them , but we try .
For example , medical records are confidential .
In this case , we tried but were n't able to fully vet the story , " he said .
Elleithee added , " If the hospital claims it did n't happen that way , we certainly respect that , and she wo n't repeat the story . "
" She never mentions the hospital by name and is n't trying to cast blame .
She tells this story because it illustrates the point that we have a very serious health care problem in America .
That 's a point very few people will dispute . "

Advertisement Residents in an English village have " voted " to become part of Wales , even though the border lies nine miles away .
What started as a 1 April spoof in Audlem , Cheshire , has gathered support and resulted in 63 % of those voting in an online poll supporting the move .
Some residents want to make a case for securing Welsh benefits such as free hospital parking and prescriptions .
" The vote might be light - hearted , but there 's a very serious message there , " said one villager .
The poll running on local website Audlem Online shows 80 residents have voted to become part of Wales , with 44 against .
One resident , who did not want to be named , said local people were angry at a recent rise in parking charges at Leighton Hospital in Crewe .
AUDLEM FACTS
Nearly 2,000 people live there
It won the 2005 Cheshire and Northern England Village of the Year awards
The local tourist attraction is the Shropshire Union canal Audlem 's three main roads are Cheshire St , Stafford St and Shropshire St , but no Denbighshire St - yet The village has a football and cricket team , but no rugby team St James 's church with its walled mound dominates the village Local residents have also been posting messages in a forum dedicated to the subject .
One wrote : " I know of at least four Welsh - speakers in Audlem - that 's probably more than Newport and Cardiff can muster between them .
So Audlem is already ahead in the bilingual stakes . "
Another said : " We should try to be part of Shropshire .
This is a serious suggestion which I have made before .
A wander around the village leaves visitors to Audlem in no doubt which country they are in .
A basketball hoop near the local park was presented by the Sport England Lottery Fund .
And in the middle of the village , the parish church of St James the Great boasts the cross of St George on its steeple .
But that has not deterred some residents from backing the campaign .
Judy Evans , who works in a newsagents , said her Welsh - speaking husband Brian , from Llanbrynmair in Powys , was delighted .
She added : " I 'm all for it too .
My husband is really keen because he can wear his Grand Slam T - shirt and feel safe .
We 're so close to Wales , we get more response from Wales , we get a lot of tourists from Wales and we feel we should be part of Wales
Ralph Warburton , Audlem resident " He 's also hoping the pubs will start showing the important matches from now on .
And he 's offered to help out with Welsh lessons in the school which of course would become a legal requirement . "
Elsewhere though opinion was divided .
Janet Sumner , who runs the local chip shop , said : " We 're too far away from Wales to be in Wales .
" This is the first time I 've heard about this .
I think it 's just a few people who want free prescriptions - it 's probably some Welsh people who started it . "
In the local chemist - on aptly named Cheshire Street - one woman said : " Wales ?
Oh God , no .
Why would we want to do that ?
I would n't want to be part of Wales but I do think we should get free prescriptions . "
Another resident said : " People have been complaining about the hospital parking charges and the cost of prescriptions .
" It certainly does n't pay to be ill here , so Wales have got that right but I definitely would n't want to be part of Wales . "
Audlem is in the south of Cheshire and nine miles from the border Keith West , 70 , originally from Neath , said : " It 's an anomaly that needs resolving - devolution has got the UK into a mess .
" We 're worse off in England than you are in Wales or they are in Scotland .
It seems logical that there should be an English parliament . "
Another local , Ralph Warburton said : " We 're so close to Wales , we get more response from Wales , we get a lot of tourists from Wales and we feel we should be part of Wales .
So we 're making a bid to be Welsh . "
One resident , who did not want to be named , said local people were angry at a recent rise in parking charges at Leighton Hospital in Crewe .
She said : " The charges have gone up from £ 2 to £ 3 for more than 20 minutes .
It 's a big rise . "

What are these ?
By Richard Black
Environment correspondent , BBC News website
Cloud cover affects temperature - but what determines cloud cover ?
Scientists have produced further compelling evidence showing that modern - day climate change is not caused by changes in the Sun 's activity .
The research contradicts a favoured theory of climate " sceptics " , that changes in cosmic rays coming to Earth determine cloudiness and temperature .
The idea is that variations in solar activity affect cosmic ray intensity .
But UK scientists found there has been no significant link between cosmic rays and cloudiness in the last 20 years .
Presenting their findings in the Institute of Physics journal , Environmental Research Letters , the University of Lancaster team explain that they used three different ways to search for a correlation , and found virtually none .
The IPCC has got it right , so we had better carry on trying to cut carbon emissions
Terry Sloan
This is the latest piece of evidence which at the very least puts the cosmic ray theory , developed by Danish scientist Henrik Svensmark at the Danish National Space Center ( DNSC ) , under very heavy pressure .
Dr Svensmark 's idea formed a centrepiece of the controversial documentary The Great Global Warming Swindle .
Wrong path
" We started on this game because of Svensmark 's work , " said Terry Sloan from Lancaster University .
Terry Sloan has simply failed to understand how cosmic rays work on clouds
Henrik Svensmark
" If he is right , then we are going down the wrong path of taking all these expensive measures to cut carbon emissions ; if he is right , we could carry on with carbon emissions as normal . "
Cosmic rays are deflected away from Earth by our planet 's magnetic field , and by the solar wind - streams of electrically charged particles coming from the Sun .
The Svensmark hypothesis is that when the solar wind is weak , more cosmic rays penetrate to Earth .
That creates more charged particles in the atmosphere , which in turn induces more clouds to form , cooling the climate .
The planet warms up when the Sun 's output is strong .
Professor Sloan 's team investigated the link by looking for periods in time and for places on the Earth which had documented weak or strong cosmic ray arrivals , and seeing if that affected the cloudiness observed in those locations or at those times .
FEELING THE HEAT
Three theories on how the Sun could be causing climate change
In graphics
" For example ; sometimes the Sun ' burps ' - it throws out a huge burst of charged particles , " he explained to BBC News .
" So we looked to see whether cloud cover increased after one of these bursts of rays from the Sun ; we saw nothing . "
Over the course of one of the Sun 's natural 11 - year cycles , there was a weak correlation between cosmic ray intensity and cloud cover - but cosmic ray variability could at the very most explain only a quarter of the changes in cloudiness .
And for the following cycle , no correlation was found .
Limited effect Dr Svensmark himself was unimpressed by the findings .
" Terry Sloan has simply failed to understand how cosmic rays work on clouds , " he told BBC News .
" He predicts much bigger effects than we would do , as between the equator and the poles , and after solar eruptions ; then , because he does n't see those big effects , he says our story is wrong , when in fact we have plenty of evidence to support it . "
But another researcher who has worked on the issue , Giles Harrison from Reading University , said the work was important " as it provides an upper limit on the cosmic ray - cloud effect in global satellite cloud data " .
Climate change : No Sun link A cosmic climate connection ?
Dr Harrison 's own research , looking at the UK only , has also suggested that cosmic rays make only a very weak contribution to cloud formation .
The Svensmark hypothesis has also been attacked in recent months by Mike Lockwood from the UK's Rutherford - Appleton Laboratory .
He showed that over the last 20 years , solar activity has been slowly declining , which should have led to a drop in global temperatures if the theory was correct .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , in its vast assessment of climate science last year , concluded that since temperatures began rising rapidly in the 1970s , the contribution of humankind 's greenhouse gas emissions has outweighed that of solar variability by a factor of about 13 to one .
According to Terry Sloan , the message coming from his research is simple .
" We tried to corroborate Svensmark 's hypothesis , but we could not ; as far as we can see , he has no reason to challenge the IPCC - the IPCC has got it right .
" So we had better carry on trying to cut carbon emissions . "

ROOMMATES.COM …. This is interesting .
In an 8 - 3 ruling , the 9th Circuit Court has ruled that Roommates.com is breaking the law :
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided Thursday that a website may be found liable for violating fair housing laws by matching roommates according to gender , sexual orientation and parenthood .
…. ” A real estate broker may not inquire as to the race of a prospective buyer , and an employer may not inquire as to the religion of a prospective employee , ” Chief Judge Alex Kozinski wrote for the majority .
“ If such questions are unlawful when posed face - to - face by telephone , they do n’t magically become lawful when asked electronically online . ” …. Thursday ’s majority said Roommates.com differed from the other sites because it was not a mere passive conduit of information .
Site users are required to select from drop - down menus whether they want to live with “ straight or gay ” males , only with “ straight ” males , only with “ gay ” males or with “ no males , ” the court said .
I have n’t thought about this enough to really have an opinion about it , and I have no idea if it will be upheld or reversed on appeal .
But it ’s yet another indication that the web triumphalists of the 90s , who were convinced that the internet was a special little playground immune from the dead hand of plodding real - world governments , were wrong .
That never made any more sense than the notion that the web would put plodding old multinational corporations out of business either , but there you go .
Turns out the plodders still have some life left in them after all .

A local company has designed a new type of wind - turbine blade that mimics the aerodynamic performance of a humpback whale 's flipper , allowing a turbine to capture more of the wind 's energy at much lower speeds .
The odd - looking blades , which have teeth - like bumps along their leading edge , are a dramatic departure from the smooth and sleek design that graces most wind turbines .
But Stephen Dewar , co-founder of Toronto - based WhalePower Corp. , says the new approach could have a profound impact on wind - energy economics .
It means turbines manufactured with WhalePower blades would be capable of capturing energy where the wind is less strong , as conventional turbines tend to stall when wind speeds fall too low .
Not only would this improve the business case for individual wind farms , it broadens the natural geography suitable for large - scale wind generation .
" This changes the game , " says Dewar , adding that any system using a fan or turbine could also benefit from the new design .
This includes everything from better turbines for hydroelectric generation to residential ceiling fans that use less electricity .
" If we 've got what we think we 've got , then the range of applications is staggering . "
The potential was enough for the Ontario Centres of Excellence and the Ontario Power Authority to contribute about $ 70,000 in early - stage research funding , and to encourage collaboration with the wind - engineering group at the University of Western Ontario .
Independent third - party verification of the new blade 's performance will be a crucial step toward commercial production .
" It 's high risk , high return , " says Ben Greenhouse , a manager of business development at OCE .
" The business models will depend on how well this works . "
Marine scientists have long marvelled at the acrobatics and agility of humpback whales , given these monster swimmers can reach 16 metres in length and weigh as much as 13 Hummer SUVs .
Despite their enormous size , humpbacks are efficient hunters able to make sharp , tight turns .
It turns out the key to a humpback 's agility lies in its long flippers , which feature a unique row of bumps or " tubercles " along their leading edge that give the wing - like appendages a serrated look .
Researchers such as Frank Fish , a professor of biology at West Chester University in Pennsylvania , have found that the tubercles dramatically increase the whale 's aerodynamic efficiency .
In one particular study conducted inside a controlled wind tunnel , Fish and research colleagues at Duke University and the U.S. Naval Academy saw 32 per cent lower drag and an 8 per cent improvement in lift from a flipper with tubercles compared to a smooth flipper found on other whales .
They also discovered that the angle of attack of the bump - lined flipper could be 40 per cent steeper than a smooth flipper before reaching stall – that is , before seeing a dramatic loss in lift and increase in drag .
In an airplane scenario , that 's typically when you lose control and crash .
" That stall typically occurs on most wings at 11 or 12 degrees at the angle of attack , " says Fish , adding that with the humpback design " stall occurred much later , at about 17 or 18 degrees of attack .
So the stall is being delayed . "
The implications are potentially enormous .
Delayed stall on airplane wings can improve safety and make planes much more manoeuvrable and fuel - efficient .
The same benefits can also be found on ship and submarine rudders , which explains the U.S. Navy 's quiet involvement .
Dewar , a former broadcast journalist and co-producer of the 1980s nature series Lorne Greene 's New Wilderness , is also a self - taught student of science with a fascination for linear and non-linear physics .
He 'd heard about Fish 's research and , after a few chats over the phone , raised the idea of using the humpback design for wind turbines .
" I saw it as a natural application of this technology , " recalls Fish .
One thing led to another and the duo formed WhalePower , with Fish taking on the role of president and Dewar handling business development and R&D from a headquarters in Toronto .
Laurens Howle , Fish 's research partner from Duke University , is an adviser and shareholder in the company who has contributed software for designing the new blades .
" We have an international patent going through everywhere , " says Dewar .
" It applies to all forms of turbines , compressors , pumps and fans . "
WhalePower can retrofit blades on existing turbines or build new blades from scratch .
Dewar says prototype tests to date have demonstrated " outstanding performance , " most importantly during light winds , with the tubercle - lined blades capable of more than doubling performance at wind speeds of 8 metres per second .
" In fact , we 're getting the kind of power ( regular blades ) produce at 8 metres per second at 5 metres per second , " says Dewar , describing the results as " spooky " because of the dramatic improvement .

Fish says the better performance at low speeds is what makes the design stand out .
" Since there are probably more days when you do n't have gusty winds but instead have lower wind speeds , that means you can generate electricity on those lower energy days . "
The reason is because the tubercles channel the wind as it hits the front or " leading " edge of the blade .
The channels cause separate wind streams to accelerate across the surface of the blade in organized , rotating flows .
These energy - packed vortexes seem to increase the lift force on the blade .
As well , the channels prevent airflow from moving along the span of the blade and past its tip , a troubling situation on smooth blades that can cause noise , instability and lead to a loss of energy .
By keeping the airflow channelled , more of the wind is captured and noise is greatly reduced .
Dewar says the same aerodynamic principle applies to water flow through hydroelectric turbines – in other words , more electricity can be generated at lower water speeds , making it possible , particularly in a water - rich province like Ontario , to reconsider hydroelectric or pump - storage sites previously thought uneconomic for power generation .
" I 'm honestly scared of making claims at this point , " says Dewar .
" The results are so good that we know everybody who knows anything about aerodynamics will think we 're salting the goldmine . "
That 's why third - party verification will be essential .
The research , he says , has to be " bullet proof . "
But even if WhalePower can prove beyond a doubt that its blade design is better , it does n't necessarily ensure success .
Wind - turbine manufacturers can't keep up with demand for current product , so there 's little incentive to dramatically alter the design of their blades – at least not yet .
There 's also no incentive for banks to lend money to wind - farm projects taking a risk on a new blade design .
" It 's like trying to break into the semiconductor business , " says Kerry Adler , chief executive of Toronto - based wind developer SkyPower Corp .
" You 're going to be hard - pressed to convince Dell Computer to put a new processing chip on their motherboards , particularly if it 's not proven .
In the wind industry , you 'll have to have a thousand turbines in the ground before anybody gives ( a technology ) a second look . "
WhalePower 's hope of retrofitting existing turbine blades – an estimated $ 50 billion worth around the world – could also prove a tough sell .
Adler says retrofitting a blade with tubercles would void the warranty .
" Who 's going to take that chance ? "
Fish appreciates that WhalePower 's approach may be considered radical , and he understands that many wind - turbine manufacturers will operate on the premise :
If it is n't broken , do n't fix it .
But he says any business will change its course if the economic benefits are compelling enough .
" It takes a while to get any sort of new technology into the marketplace , " says Fish , at the same time convinced that the study of biomimicry – the melding of biology and engineering – will help shape the future of energy production , transportation and medicine .
" We 're starting to see more and more engineers grabbing on to this . "
Possibility is n't limited by technology .
And it 's certainly not limited by human imagination .
What makes something impossible is the lack of cold , hard , cash .

Assuming it was the agency 's main priority , it would have easily added up to more than $ 50bn in the first three years , with the lion 's share of the work still ahead of us .
The real deal could cost more than twice that when it 's finally built : do n't forget all the regular service missions it'll require until self - sufficiency or ( far more likely ) abandonment .
__
Orbital Hotel__
Cost : $ 1.2bn ( Britain's Proposed ISS Astronaut 's Lounge )
The International Space Station , at $ 20 m a trip , is n't exactly a week in Tahiti .
Hell , it 's not even a dirty weekend at the local Lamplighter , as far as amenities are concerned .
A dedicated hotel ?
It makes a big difference who builds it : NASA managed to pork away about $ 50bn not finishing the International Skipping Stone , but Russia will complete its share of the project at a fraction of that cost .
Neither seem interested , however , in space hotels .
Leave it to the Brits .
After decades of disengagement from human space exploration , it recently reversed its position — to propose a lounge for the station .
Either it understands something about space travel NASA does n't , or it 's mad .
Can you say Virgin Orbital , Sir Richard ?
So , how much would it cost to make a permanent hotel in space ?
If we do n't allow ourselves the luxury of appending it to the ISS , it 's going to cost tens of billions of dollars .
Britain 's supplemental habitation module , used as a hotel , would be far more economical : its proposal is tagged at $ 1.2 bn .
At $ 10 m for a week on board , it could pay for itself in a couple of years — if the buyers are out there .
Transatlantic Tunnel
Cost : $ 1.6 trillion to $ 10 trillion , depending on how it 's cut .
How long is a piece of string ?
Figure that out , and you have the cost of building an intercontinental bridge or tunnel .
Istanbul can sit this one out : it 's already got more than one !
( And is about to build another , over a nearby 2 km span between Europe and Asia , at a cost of a billion dollars . )
One such project is on the cusp of reality , linking Spain to Morocco beneath the Mediterranean sea .
In essence , however , it 's little different to the existing rail tunnel between England and France , with a similar cost in adjusted terms : about 27 billion euros .
A proposed bridge or tunnel between Alaska and Chukotka , Russia is touted as the " Intercontinental Peace Bridge , " and could turn the intermediary Diomede Islands into the world 's most remote rest stop .
The total length is about fifty - five miles , and the total cost about that in billions .
Some claim as little as $ 15 - 25 bn : one estimate places the cost at $ 105bn .
Italians plan to build the longest suspension bridge in the world , between the mainland and Sicily , but the latest E4.6bn proposal died in 2006 with the incoming government of Romano Prodi .
But none of this is what we want : a sleeper express between London and New York , right ?
An immersed tube under the Altantic could cost half a billion dollars a mile , about three times the cost of a modern bridge .
We 're already looking at about $ 1.6 trillion dollars , at that burn rate — and this does n't account for the precipitous drops at the continental shelves , or , indeed , the engineering problem of deep - ocean tunnel immersion .
If you 're thinking of cutting a tunnel the traditional way , under the sea bed , it gets even crazier .
Extrapolating the cost of the Channel Tunnel , built in this fashion , and the price lands somewhere in the $ 10tn region .
Start saving your pennies !

Supersonic Transport__
Cost : $ 30 m ( Repair decaying BA Concorde ) to $ 180 m ( Inflation - adjusted cost of a new one )
With the retirement of Concorde , the only supersonic commuter airliner , 2 - hour trips over the Atlantic are a thing of the past .
It 's perhaps the first tech to go from sci - fi to reality and right back again , all in the space of a generation : no zombie apocalypse required .
When British Airways killed the beast ( now generally thought to be a ploy to move its first - class addicts to more profitable planes ) , Virgin offered to buy them for the same price BA bought them from the British taxpayer : $ 1 each .
Ultimately offered $ 5 m for each , BA preferred to let them fall into disrepair : to get one of the rotting hulks airworthy again may now cost far more than that .
Experts estimate that it would cost billions to develop a new supersonic airliner , however , so restoration of the existing ones remains a more likely scenario .
New York - L.A. Maglev Express
Cost : $ 70 bn ( Based on established construction costs )
At $ 70bn , it 's tantalisingly affordable by the standards of this roundup : a train that could beat airliners from one side of the country to the other .
Many agree that Maglev has enormous potential .
Bite - sized examples are in operation all over the world .
Birmingham , England , had the first in the 1980s , though the promise of airliner - like speeds on land is still unrealized .
The British system sped along at a pathetic 26MPH and was designed to get air travelers to the planes , not to outrun them .
In fact , Maglev carriages , forced along by magnetic fields instead of traditional propulsion systems , still struggle to outpace normal high - speed trains : both forms of transit post speed records at about 360 MPH .
In everyday use , modern Maglev systems manage about 260MPH — still ten times as fast as the first one , which ran only 20 years ago .
Nonetheless , they 're extravagantly expensive to build , even if maintenance is relatively cheap .
Based on current construction estimates of $ 25 m a kilometer , that 400MPH New York - L.A. 's $ 70 bn route would be hard - pressed to find itself funding .
Let 's get BosWash covered first , shall we ?
A Floating City
Cost : $ 11bn For 18,000 Homes
International waters offer plenty of real estate , but getting foundations to stay put is another matter .
Micronations like Sealand do n't count : we want the gigantic floating pyramid cities ( pictured here ) that Future Cities promised us in 1979 .
The nearest real - life analogs to that particular wonder — perfectly possible as it is — are found in land reclamation efforts by the Dutch , in Japan and elsewhere .
Kansai International Airport cost $ 20bn , and is a good example of a " city " built where waves once lapped .
As for something on the water itself , however , the best example is probably the Queen Mary 2 , Cunard 's most expensive and majestic cruise liner .
It cost $ 900 m to put into service , and accommodates nearly 4,000 passengers and crew .
A rival , the $ 800 m Freedom of the Sea , packs in 5,730 : it 's practically an ocean - going skyscraper .
The next - generation of liners will hold as many as 10,000 , and cost $ 1.2 bn to build .
Realistic proposals for more grand sea-cities are thin on the ground .
The Freedom Ship , proposed by Norman Nixon , is about four times the size of cruise liners .
It would permanently accommodate some 50,000 people and cost more than $ 11bn to build .
Android Armies
Cost : $ 1bn a battallion
Seen Asimo ?
If you want your own , expect to pay Honda about a million dollars .
Cheapskates can lease one for $ 166,000 a year .
And he still can't handle stairs .
Still , if you need to defend something very flat with robots ( rather than automatic turret guns ) , simply because that 's a totally bad - assed thing to do , we could put out a battalion for about a billion dollars .
Not too shabby , eh ?
Blasters and Railguns
Cost : $ 10 m for a field - effective weapon
Directed energy weapons are so well - understood that there are dozens of variations on the same basic theme .
Unfortunately , available batteries and coolants are just are not up to snuff .
For a laser gun , for example , we need a luggable assembly that can power a beam strong enough to match a firearm 's effectiveness , and a way to siphon away the heat such a gun would leak .
Such tech does n't exist yet , at any cost .
We 're making progress : the U.S. now has test laser installations able to take out fighter jets and missiles , including a mobile one stashed aboard a Boeing 747 .
Railguns are another sci - fi staple finally bearing fruit in portable - ish form .
Just this morning , the Naval Surgace Warfare Center in Dahlgren , Virginia , fired a 10 megajoule electromagnetic railgun .
They 're talking about using these to replace 5 - inch guns in the 2020s , though there 's no mention of cost .
Finally , no mention of death rays is complete without a tip of the hat to Nikola Tesla .
Priceless stuff .
Interstellar Exploration
Cost : Unimaginable .
Scientists think that a probe could be sent to nearby stars , if it was light enough to be accelerated to relativistic speed with a giant laser .
Let us not forget this would still be a decades - long mission , with a probe so small as to be measured in grams , not kilos .
Screw that nonsense : I want a warp drive .
Pricing up the mathematical exegeses behind such notions , however , is simply beyond calculation .
Rios was a member of the Farc 's seven - man secretariat
Pedro Pablo Montoya , known as Rojas , killed Ivan Rios , a member of the leftist rebel group 's ruling body , the Secretariat , then turned himself in .
The Colombian government has made the paying of rewards to informants central to its fight against Farc .
The death came amid a regional row over the killing of another Farc rebel .
Montoya , described by the BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Colombia as a guerrilla with a long and bloody history in the Farc rebel army , shot his boss Rios with a single bullet to the head , and then murdered Rios 's girlfriend .
Rojas proceeded to cut off Rios 's right hand to take to the security forces to prove he had killed the rebel leader , a member of Farc 's seven -man Secretariat .
Controversy
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe said on Monday that they were awaiting the results of an investigation into the killing to determine whether Rojas was entitled to a reward .
" We must wait to see what the judicial authorities say ... for them to determine what state the Farc group led by Ivan Rios was in , what was the degree of pressure or threats upon its members ... to weigh risk against action taken by the person who is claiming the reward , " said Mr Uribe .
If Rojas is paid the $ 2.5 m , it would be part of the government reward scheme for information leading to the capture or killing of wanted rebel leaders or drugs traffickers .
Our correspondent says there is debate in Colombia as to why a killer like Rojas , who would normally be charged with murder , should be rewarded .
The government has answered that it must support the system of rewards that has proved vital to securing intelligence .
Mr Uribe said the scheme was aimed at discovering the whereabouts of the guerrillas but stressed that Colombia , a state of law , was not in the business of encouraging massacres .
Rojas has said his reward would encourage other rebels to kill their commanders and desert .
President Uribe has made the military defeat of the Farc the cornerstone of his government 's policy , with the blessing and support of Washington .
He has dealt a series of blows to the guerrillas , killing leaders and undermining key rebel units through desertions .
Rios 's death came just a week after Farc commander Raul Reyes was killed by Colombian troops in a raid inside Ecuador .
The violation of Ecuador 's territory sparked the worst diplomatic crisis in the region for years , which saw Ecuador and Venezuela break off diplomatic ties with Bogota and send extra troops to their borders with Colombia .
Ministers want to see more universities get into bed with industry in this way One of England 's newest universities is offering tailor - made degrees in the management of selling beds .
Buckinghamshire New University in High Wycombe is offering a retail management foundation degree developed in partnership with bed company Dreams .
This is the kind of collaboration between industry and higher education the government wants to encourage .
Most of the sector 's expansion is through such two - year courses mixing academic and work - based learning .
We pride ourselves on our work - based foundation degrees that are designed in conjunction with employers
Ruth Farwell
Vice - chancellor Bucks New University
Like the much - publicised " McDonald 's A - level " , the Dreams degree incorporates the existing company training package .
But Buckinghamshire New University vice - chancellor Ruth Farwell said : " Whilst we recognise the impetus behind the decision to allow companies such as McDonald 's to award their own qualifications , we believe that it is better for employers to partner with universities in initiatives such as this one . "
Skills base Dr Farwell added : " We pride ourselves on our work - based foundation degrees that are designed in conjunction with employers , and enable students to gain qualifications whilst they are working and on the basis of their work experience .
" Offering Dreams ' managers this opportunity is a natural extension of our work , especially since Dreams ' head office is in our home town .
" It fits perfectly with the government 's drive for greater participation in higher education and the need to enhance the skills base of the nation . "
Dreams founder Mike Clare said many of his staff had attended the university .
" The university 's pragmatic approach and understanding of the challenges we face has enabled us to launch a development programme which will enable staff to continue their education whilst also focusing on their careers , " he said .
The first course begins in mid-April , with 12 Dreams managers specially selected to be fast - tracked through the foundation degree in one year .
Two years will be the norm for subsequent students .
Flexibility On Monday , Higher Education Minister Bill Rammell is launching a consultation , Higher Education at Work - High Skills : High Value , on how best " to build stronger and more flexible links " between business and universities .
The Department for Innovation , Universities and Skills said the independent Leitch review of the nation 's skills requirements in 2006 had argued there was a need for a significant increase in the proportion of workers with degree level skills .
Currently 30 % , the review said the aim should be more than 40 % by 2020 .
A spokesman said that 70 % of what will be the 2020 workforce had already left school .
So new types of higher education needed to be provided , including more flexible courses designed and co-funded by employers .
However , a report from the Higher Education Policy Institute think tank has said the potential market for such degrees is untested .
It says expanding them at a reduced rate of state funding risks repeating the underfunded growth of the 1990s .

The Highly Extensible CSS Interface ~ The Series
~ 25 February 2008 ~
It ’s been nearly three years since publishing a series of articles on this site .
I ’ve got an irresistible yearning to publish anew .
Introducing “ The Highly Extensible CSS Interface , ” a four - part series of how - to ’s and savvy conversation to be published in the coming weeks , with the first article debuting this week .
The phrase “ highly extensible ” is in reference to designing and coding interfaces that are flexible enough to adapt in ways the designer or developer may not foresee when handing off coded templates , while still retaining the overall aesthetic integrity of the layout .
I hope you come to discover extensibility as being broader than just “ bulletproofing , ” though bulletproofing is certainly a significant part of it .
Here ’s what to expect :
Part One : The Foundation
This first article will briefly discuss the importance of producing visually rich interfaces with semantic , accessible , and portable markup underneath .
We ’ll then dive into code with a reset stylesheet and structure for a resolution - dependent layout .

Part Two : CSS Selectors & jQuery
Shifting to a more intermediate discussion of code , this second article will present examples that demonstrate how to take advantage of the now - supported CSS2 and CSS3 properties previously ignored by Internet Explorer , such as min/ max - width , child and adjacent sibling selectors , and others .
We ’ll also take a look at jQuery , a lightweight scripting library for enhancing UI elements .

Part Three : Adding Ajax Interactivity
The third article will lightly cover Ajax implementation and its role within the interface .
This wo n’t be a highly technical discussion that covers such things as XMLHttpRequest , but rather a demonstration of a few ways to leverage Ajax judiciously .

Part Four : Testing for Extensibility
Lastly , the final article will look back at the chunks of code presented in the three previous articles to assess how they combine to produce a completed interface .
We ’ll then subject the interface to a series of “ extensibility tests ” such as translation , text resizing and browser width resizing , the addition of new content , and so forth .
Code samples will be available for viewing and downloading with each article .
Much of the discussion will be based on material and a demo interface created for a recent workshop , the likes of which you can preview by clicking this screen capture :
See you back here in a couple days .

Audio : Tony Kushner : ' Racist Pornographer Hack '
by Jeremy Hooper
We 've already showed you and decried the way that the Concerned Women For America are referring to the legendary and literary play Angels In America as " racist gay porn . "
But since it 's always more revelatory to hear the words come out of our opposition 's mouth rather than to just read them on paper , here is CWA 's Matt Barber making the same unfair " racist " and " pornographic " assertions in an audio chat with activist Lora Sue Hauser :
powered by ODEO
" This is not even good writing " ?
Pulitzer Prizes are simply the product of " self aggrandizing liberal elites " ?
Angels is nothing more than " B - line trash that belongs in a homosexual adult book store somewhere in the Castro district of San Francisco " ?
Who the hell needs the NY Times Book Review when you can instead turn to the literary opinions of one Matt Barber ?!
High School Pushes Racist “ Gay ” Porn on Kids [ CWA ]
** UPDATE , 3/13 : Even more from Matt [ G - A - Y ]
Your thoughts
Yeah , I 'm going to side with the Pulitzer Prize committee ...
Posted by : Scott B. | Mar 11 , 2008 1:59:22 PM
These people are so fucking stupid !!
Have they not heard of all the other books that have been baned in the past ?
Books that most schools do NOT ban !
Ha ...
Posted by : Justin | Mar 11 , 2008 2:41:05 PM
Oh for God 's sake who are these people ?
These people are preaching hate .
" Vulgar words , the content , the dialogue , the actions " ?
It 's life .
Inappropriate for high school kids ?
Calls for resignation ?
Yikes , they are nuts !
What about depictions of war , violence , etc Does n't Laura
Sue have better things to worry about in schools , like kids killing each other ?
Now there 's some concern honey .
Posted by : nicholasg | Mar 11 , 2008 3:51:20 PM
What 's ironic is these people base their whole lives on a book the features among other things wanton violence , incest , rape and other forms of sexual immorality and also the justification of slavery .
Furthermore Angels in America is a book that students have the option of reading it ’s not a requirement – which people like CWA seem to keep forgetting when this issue comes up .
BTW : Matt ’s comment " B - line trash that belongs in a homosexual adult book store somewhere in the Castro district of San Francisco ” proves what a BIG FAT MEATHEAD that he really is !
( I know you do n’t like name calling but I think it fits ) .
Posted by : Alonzo | Mar 11 , 2008 5:00:58 PM
This made me so angry , so I wrote a letter to CWFA .
To CWFA : I am concerned with your lack of concern .
You seem to be focused on a text that you assume will destroy the very fabric of your idealistic " American " life .
Angels in America is one of the more important literary and dramatic accounts of an era when people were being wiped out by the HIV / AIDS epidemic .
This still continues ...
Lora Sue Hauser in her discussion with Matt Barber , calls for prosecution and resignations from Deerfield High school , Ill .
Well Lora
Sue , like many students of strong will and open mind , they will make their own judgements on the text and should be encouraged to do so .
Afterall , I imagine they are intelligent kids , who witness language in the school yard far more colourful than in this text .
Unless of course , they 're living in that fantasy world , the " American " life , I briefly mentioned above .
Ever seen " Pleasantville " Lora Sue ?
Lora
Sue seems quick to jump on the N word in the alleged " racist gay porn " , which I may add is used by the text 's Roy Cohn character - of course this character ( based on the real Roy Cohn ) was himself a campaigner against the very basic rights that GLBT people should all be afforded .
His dialogue is in suiting with his attitudes of the time .
Attitudes that are destructive and hateful .
Roy Cohn , stated " homosexuals should not be allowed to be schoolteachers " .
/ In 1984 , Cohn was diagnosed with AIDS , and he attempted to keep his condition secret while receiving aggressive drug treatment .
He was known for being able to obtain the real drugs not control drugs .
He died in 1986 of AIDS complications ./
He preached the very vitriol that this text attempts to dispel through it 's frankness , honesty and understanding and message of greater good for those caught up or affected by the epidemic of HIV / AIDS .
Teenagers are shown the destruction of humankind on a daily basis through newswire , cable and internet .
They bare witness to the horrors of genocide in areas such as Darfur and watch as their world unfolds against a backdrop of terror , yet , you feel compelled to protect them from a pulitzer prize wining work of text .
The text serves as a journal to an era of prejudice , an era when many lives were lost , when the world believed that HIV / AIDS was a gay disease , which we know it is not .
If you truly are Concerned Women for America , I would divert your concern to far more pressing issues such as Gun control .
The shootings that occur in your US schools require urgent change to state and federal laws to save young lives , more so than the worry of a dramatic work with a few F words or a graphic sex scene here and there .
And what of Darfur ?
Oh , Concerned Women .
You could do so much to change the world with your concerns directed correctly .
The world is in need of concerned women , while thousands die displaced and executed at the hands of brutal regimes .
What concerned women could achieve with an alternative and possible re alignment of their fears could be breathtaking .
But , back to the text that you think is going to destroy lives .
I would of course be concerned - as you obviously are - if the text caused a gunman to run rampant in the school and shoot dead twenty of their classmates ?
But , I think not .
On the contrary , that you want to ban text like this will send the message to a student perhaps attempting to identify with being gay or different , that they are invisible , they are not accepted and only cause them to experience feelings of disassociation and perhaps develop anti social behavious .
I believe your concern for this text is misplaced and is simply , quite possibly a result of your own insular fear .
Perhaps the best place to start is to ask the kids if they would be offended by this text ?
By the way , have you seen Fahrenheit 451 ?
I thank you .

So , when I loaded this audio on your site , it played at about double speed .
Perhaps a bit more .
It was like listening to the Chipmunks , only worse ( assuming that 's possible ) .
The woman speaks so quickly that it was nearly impossible to understand her when sped up .
It actually made the whole thing much more pleasurable than when I followed the link and listened to their posted mp3 ...

How bizarre , PSUdain .
Although that really does sound more enjoyable .

You obviously have no idea what your children know and participate in .
I just graduated from high school .
These young people are living in a world full of profanity , sexual confusion , and racism .
However , obtuse parents and schools refuse to address the reality of what is going on around them .
These helicopter mamas like to live an a make believe land of puppies and innocence .
Perhaps , if these kids had a chance to talk about real issues ( all of which they are dealing with ) in a safe environment like a classroom , they would be able to deal with them in a non-self destructive way .
I have been exposed to literature like this since the beginning of hig school .
By your standards I should be a nympomaniac , drug addict , and perhaps , god forbid a homosexual .
I am a strait woman ; I have never touched drugs ; and I have great respect for my body .
From being exposed to serious , thought - provoking material that sored past or prescribed bounderies , I also have great respect and empathy for the people around me .
( I am not a bigot or a racist . )
But do n't listen to me , keep repressing your children 's curiosity and you will see how well they grow as people .

MG :
You are aware that you are addressing a gay activism site , right ?
Posted by : G - A - Y | Mar 12 , 2008 12:36:00 PM
I 've just looked at the " concerned " women for america website , and to be quite frank I was more disgusted with that .
[ they do n't much like people of other ethnic backrounds do they ?
let alone homosexuality ]
I read the text and the thing that stuck out to me most was that they only highlighted the parts that related to homosexuality in some way .
There were sentences with WAY more severe profanity than the ones highlighted but the difference is that they did n't reference homosexuality .
What sense does that make ?
It makes me glad that I no longer live in the US because people like that sheltered woman Lora Sue make me sick .
Posted by : nick | Mar 12 , 2008 7:27:58 PM
This is just disgusting , i personally would like to beat the crap out of these people with a stick .
I also love how he names the castro district in san francisco specifically , stupid freakin prejudiced against san francisco .
As he mentioned " Indoctrination of our students ? " well , yes , i'm sure that really happens , And also , i'm sure that no conservative has ever won a pulitzer prize either .....

I read top to bottom Matt Barber 's article on this at Townhall .
Only myself , and a few gay men who are regulars to the site , actually read or saw Angeles in America .
I own the book , saw the play twice , saw the movie three times .
I saw " Caroline or Change " a blues opera about Kushner 's childhood in Kennedy era Louisiana and his relationship with his family 's black housekeeper .
And I read " Homebody ? Kabul " about a British matriarch 's venture into Afghanistan on a journey of charity and self discovery .
Matt Barber did n't mention Kushner 's body of work .
He just cherry picked what he though were the ' dirty bits ' enough to indict ONE part of one play .
What an A$ $ .
And he'd only fool those ignorant of those who never read or are familiar with Kushner .
The thing is , I 'd RATHER read or experience Kushner , than take Barber 's word .
And maybe the sharper tools at TH would .
However , I doubt it .
Barber is in no way likely to win a Pulitzer or any other accolade for literature or even journalism .
" It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness . "
Barber ... is clueless as to what that proverbial candle is .

Businesses using some of the more advanced methods for securing connections to Wi-Fi access points need to take a hard look at the configuration settings of client computers .
So say researchers who have documented a simple way to impersonate trusted networks .
The attack works on access points that use the Wi-Fi Protected Access ( WPA ) in concert with Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol ( PEAP ) or other so - called Extensible Authentication Protocols ( EAPs ) .
Such technologies use public - key certificates to authenticate a trusted network to a laptop or other connected device and provide an encrypted SSL tunnel through which the two can communicate .
Problem is , laptops running Windows , OS X and various versions of Linux frequently have the security settings mis-configured , according to researchers Brad Antoniewicz and Josh Wright .
Using a program called FreeRADIUS - WPE ( short for FreeRADIUS Wireless Pwnage Edition ) , it 's easy to dupe the clients into connecting to imposter networks and giving up critical information , they say .
The attack relies on a technology known as a wireless supplicant , which sits on the client and checks the validity of a network 's credentials .
All too frequently , the researchers say , it 's not configured to validate a certificate at all , or at the very least , not to properly validate a server 's RADIUS TLS certificate .
" In either of these scenarios , FreeRADIUS - WPE ( our modified version of the open source RADIUS server ) can be used to gain access to the inner authentication credentials passed in the TLS tunnel that is established between client and the authentication server , " Antoniewicz writes here .
" In some cases these protocols reveal the client 's username and password in clear text , while other cases require a brute force attack .
Due to active directory integration , these credentials may also be those used for domain authentication . "
The researchers envision a scenario where a vulnerable client could be induced to give up sensitive information while connected to a public hotspot that 's in close proximity to a corporate access point .
Microsoft's Windows Zero Configuration ( WZC ) by default is set to validate server certificates and we suspect the same can be said about wireless supplicants contained in competing operating systems .
But Antoniewicz says these settings are frequently turned off , presumably at the first sign of connectivity problems , and then never turned back on .
What 's more , Windows users can easily be misled by prompts that ask if they want to connect to a network whose validation does n't check out .
" When using WZC and other supplicants , you 'll want to make sure that the client clearly validates the server certificate by only trusting certificates that match the signing authority , and hostname of the RADIUS server , " Antoniewicz advises . ®
When fantasizing about the future of computer games , we often think of the Holodeck : an area from the Star Trek science fiction universe where reality can be simulated in extremely convincing ways .
The residents of the starships that house these Holodecks , however , do not use them for games .
Games on the Enterprise , on Voyager and in Deep Space 9 , are generally more like electronic versions of our current board games than anything resembling a simulation .
Kal - toh is a Vulcan puzzle game .
Kadis - kot is a board game for two players .
Strategema seems like an extreme version of Go .
Dabo is a game of chance .
None of these games take place on the Holodeck .
There are some sports that use holographic elements .
Velocity takes place in a very bare Holodeck .
But other than that , the Holodeck is mostly used for more informal forms of playful interaction .
Environments to hang out in .
Alone or with friends .
Fair Haven
Paxau Resort
Café des Artistes
Or opportunities to play stories .
Captain Proton
The Adventures of Flotter
Beowulf
In one of the early Star Trek Next Generation episodes , Captain Picard expresses what the Enterprise crew wants from the Holodeck , after almost getting shot at by a villan :
Computer , freeze program !
Computer , this is n’t what I wanted at all .
It ’s much too violent .
I ’m here to relax not to dodge bullets .
Reconfigure .
- Please define .
Umm. More… ambience !
Less … substance .
Wise words to remember , next time we dream of the Holodeck ?…

You ' know ' a man is a terrorist but cannot prove it .
What do you do ?
If you are President Bush , you have the CIA pluck him off the streets , deny him access to anyone and fly him to Egypt , Syria or Jordan to be tortured .
This is known as extraordinary rendition .
You might have thought torture happened only in the barbaric Middle Ages .
But as renditions expert Stephen Grey and human rights organisation Amnesty have recently pointed out , it is happening right now with the full approval of a supposedly civilised nation : the United States .
The US has also sanctioned the shackling of prisoners ’ limbs , the threat of dog attacks and the prolonged maintenance of stress positions or repetitive exercises while attacking China , Eritrea , Burma , Iran and Libya for carrying out
those same abuses .
Here is what happened to Maher Arar , a Muslim with dual Canadian - Syrian nationality who had lived in Canada for 15 years .
Changing planes in New York in 2002 he was arrested , wrongly accused of belonging to Al Qaeda , sent in chains to Jordan and driven to Syria .
He spent ten months in a cell measuring 3ft by 6ft where he was repeatedly beaten on the back , buttocks and feet with a two - inch thick electric cable .
Finally released and cleared of all charges , he sued the US government – and lost .
It seems so obvious that torture is despicable that I am always surprised whenever I am asked why I feel so strongly about it .
When I used to kneel down at night and say my prayers – only as a child I am afraid – my first request to the Almighty was to spare me pain .
I have never suffered anything that compares to torture and shall probably never be tortured .
But my concern is for those who are – which is why I have decided to put my money where my mouth is .
In early 2001 , it was reported that I was giving £ 5 million to the Conservative party .
Although I still give money to the party , in the last year I have donated considerably more to organisations concerned with campaigning against torture – including Human Rights Watch , Amnesty and The Medical Foundation For The Care Of Victims Of Torture .
I also helped part - finance Tory MP Andrew Tyrie ’s all - party parliamentary commission investigating extraordinary rendition .
Set up in late 2005 , one of its first achievements was to reveal how Britain may have been complicit in the rendition of two British residents at Guantanamo , Bisher al - Rawi and Jamil al - Banna .
Last year I said I would provide £ 25,000 to the committee .
Also , I have partly financed Rendition , a feature film out later this year which illustrates just what the CIA can do .
Elsewhere in the world there are so many examples of torture it is difficult to know where to begin .
In 2002 , two men were boiled to death in Jaslyk prison in Uzbekistan .
When the body of one was returned to his family it was covered in burns with the fingernails missing .
Meanwhile , in Egypt , common methods range from brutal beatings to electric shock treatment to dousing in water .
In Sierra Leone civilians ’ hands and feet are sometimes cut off , while in Uganda methods include suspension from the ceiling while enduring ‘ kandoya ’ ( tying hands and feet behind the victim ) or a particularly brutal form of torture known as ‘ Liverpool ’ – in which a victim is forced to lie face up , mouth open , under a flowing water spigot .
These horrific abuses take place mostly in undemocratic nations .
But by endorsing extraordinary rendition America is reducing itself to similar unacceptable levels of maltreatment .
I am not anti-American : far from it .
But on this one issue the record of the Bush administration is appalling .
And we know why torture happens – almost always the justification is national security .
But does it work ?
One of the most notorious examples was by the French in the war in Algeria .
General Massu , who at the time described its use as a cruel necessity , later changed his mind and said the French could have got on perfectly well without it .
A policy of torture has one obvious and crucial disadvantage .
It creates hatred and tremendous desire for revenge .
What makes apparently normal individuals willing to torture or abuse others ?
Adolf Eichmann , who personally arranged the transport of four million Jews to the death camps , said at his trial , " I was only following orders " .
So ' authority ' might be a key factor .
But there are others .
It helps if we can think of the victims as mere cattle , subhuman , not like us .
That is how US troops , and at least some British troops , thought , and probably still do , of Iraqi prisoners .
Who is responsible ?
Obviously the torturers cannot escape blame but the chief responsibility should , in my view , go much higher – to Rumsfeld , Cheney and , yes , most of all , to Bush .
Our own politicians here in Britain also bear a very heavy responsibility .
If only they would speak out , not in words carefully chosen to avoid giving offence , but with obvious horror and emotion , the torture might well stop .
We are talking of the worst type of man ’s inhumanity to man and Blair , Cameron , Campbell and Salmond are , albeit indirectly , responsible by not speaking out .
I have discussed the issue briefly with David Cameron , who said he thought he had come out clearly in favour of human rights , and other members of the Tory High Command .
But I have the impression that the shadow cabinet is split .
Some think they should speak out strongly .
Others consider the alliance with America so important that it would be wrong to risk offending the Americans .
I entirely disagree , partly because our General Election is very likely to be after the presidential election , so Bush will not be in power when / if the Conservatives form a government .
But even if politicians do not care about the suffering of the victims , can they not see that allowing the abuse creates huge numbers of terrorists ?
Let us give credit where credit is due .
The Prime Minister ’s wife Cherie has come out very strongly against torture , at the risk of embarrassing No 10 .
And you , the reader , have a responsibility to be heard as well .
Will you write to your MP ?
Are there circumstances in which the law should permit torture ?
Absolutely not .
Consider the following : there is a bomb which will destroy all life on earth , set to explode in five minutes .
One man can stop it .
Surely it must be legally justifiable to torture him ?
This is the so - called ‘ ticking bomb ’ argument and I reject it .
What happened in Israel in the 1990s shows why .
For many years Israel was the only country in the world to attempt to justify torture , on the basis of that argument .
But what happened in practice was torture became so widespread it became the normal procedure with Palestinian prisoners .
Eventually , in 1999 , Israel 's Supreme Court changed the rules– torture was no longer permissible under any circumstances .
I have no doubt the United States will follow suit – in the end .
I just hope the end arrives soon .
Do n't have 12 minutes and / or the ability to boil water ?
Someone has gone and done the impossible work of hard - boiling eggs — and sticking them in a bag — for you .
Sure , they cost 400 % more than regular eggs , come in a recession dozen ( 9 or 10 to a bag ) , and were given a glowing review of tasting " stale , rubbery , and hard " , but hey , it 's a time - saver .

Indian army chiefs are set to deploy a " curry bomb " to win the war on terror .
India 's weapons development experts have developed an eye - watering spice bomb , packed with a potent mix of red chilli and pepper which will be used to smoke out militants during counter - insurgency operations .
As Britain 's legion of Friday night Vindaloo casualties will testify , too much chilli can be debilitating .
But scientists from India 's Defence Research and Development Organisation have discovered that the spices which make your curry so hot can also bring an enemy to his knees in seconds .
Scroll down for more ...
Eye - watering :
The spice bomb will be packed with a potent mix of red chilli and pepper
They have created an 81 - mm grenade packed with red hot chilli , pepper and phosphorus to use in Kashmir where Islamic separatists linked with al Qaeda are fighting a long - running insurgency war .
Their enemy is often unseen , and can easily disappear in civilian crowds .
India 's curry bomb however will help its soldiers to immobilise enemy fighters , and allow them to be captured , without long - term injury .
The mix of spices and phosphorous chokes the enemy 's respiratory tract , leaving targets barely able to breathe for a time .
Their eyes , throat and skin burn and sting .
Army scientists have also discovered the " curry bomb " can be used to block enemy attacks by creating a smoke screen and preventing snipers from using night - vision devices and thermal imagers .
From being fired by a grenade launcher , it creates an effective smoke screen ninety metres away within five seconds .
The curry bomb will be used both as a hand grenade by police and armed forces , and as a tank - mounted device .
Experts from India 's Defence Research and Development Organisation have already tested their new " grenade masala " in a series of " spice raids " close to the Line of Control which separates Indian and Pakistani forces in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region .
" The field trials have been completed with success in several areas along the Line of Control .
The grenades would be successful in forcing out militants from their hideouts . "
India 's weapons development establishment has developed a good reputation for innovation .
They have developed a nuclear missile capability , and have become leaders in rocket and satellite launch technology .
Britain's Ministry of Defence has recently sealed a series of deals with their Indian counterparts under which British fighter jets will be manufactured in India .
It may be some time before western governments develop an appetite for the curry bomb .
Based on the intrinsic complexity of personal feelings , there are an endless number of reasons why relationships fail .
However , I believe there are 3 primary factors that form the basis for which every other problem stems .
When a relationship turns sour you can be sure that at least 1 of these 3 factors is to blame .
1 . Do I really like her , or just her gestures ?
– Everyone loves attention .
When a member of the opposite sex goes out of their way to make you aware of it , it feels good .
If they repeat the action a few more times and you return the favor , a shallow relationship forms .
The true measure of compatibility occurs shortly there after .
Once the initial excitement of this attention wears thin , what are you left with ?
Do you really like who this person is , or did you just enjoy their gestures ?
On occasion people you like will take actions you dislike .
Likewise , people you dislike will get your attention by taking actions you do like .
It ’s important to understand both sides and be capable of distinguishing between the two .
2 . We have stability and reliability , but I ’m bored .
–
Once a relationship gets serious this is one of the top killers .
We all want excitement in our lives .
One of the most exciting things in life is discovering the unknown .
Curiosity is what keeps us moving forward , but one must learn to properly hone curiosity .
The first part of a serious relationship is primarily about the discovery of your partner ’s entire aura .
But once you know everything about them , where do you turn for a source of excitement ?
The answer is quite simple .
Discover new things and create new experiences together .
The only thing more fulfilling than a new experience is the act of sharing that same experience with someone else .
3 . She has wonderful qualities , but I get stuck on her flaws .
–
It ’s always easier to destroy than to create .
Likewise , it ’s easier to be negative than it is to be positive .
Many relationships fail because both parties concentrate their attention on their partner ’s flaws instead of the qualities they love about them .
You learn the most about somebody by figuring out their strong points , rather than disputing their weak points .
Over time both partners can work on their weak points collectively , so long as each person keeps a positive attitude and an honest line of communication .
Keep in mind that it is impossible work on the weak points of a relationship if you are incapable of seeing your partner ’s strong qualities .
The function of horned beetles ' wild protrusions has been a matter of some consternation for biologists .
Digging seemed plausible ; combat and mate selection , more likely .
Even Charles Darwin once weighed in on the matter , suggesting -- one imagines with some frustration -- the horns were merely ornamental .
In this month 's American Naturalist ( Dec. 2006 ) and the Nov. 2006 issue of Evolution , Indiana University Bloomington scientists present an entirely new function for the horns : during their development , Onthophagus horned beetles use their young horns as a sort of can opener , helping them bust out of thick larval shells .
The finding will surprise anyone who assumed hornless Onthophagus adults ( usually the females ) never form the horns in the first place .
They do , the scientists say , but the nubile horn tissue is reabsorbed before the beetles ' emergence as adults .
" The formation of horns by beetle pupas that soon lose them just does n't seem to make sense , so obviously we were intrigued , " said IU Bloomington evolutionary biologist Armin Moczek , lead author of both papers .
" It appears these pre-adult horns are not a vestigial type of structure , which many of us thought was the case .
Instead we have shown these horns actually serve an important function regardless of whether they are resorbed in the pupal stage or maintained into the adult . "
Because all the Onthophagus beetles the scientists examined form horns during development , Moczek and colleagues also argue the evolution of ornate horns in the adult beetles may actually have happened second -- that is , some time after their initial evolution as larval molting devices .
In the Evolution report , the scientists examined literature describing the evolutionary relationship of 47 Onthophagus species .
They also studied the development of eight beetle species in the laboratory ( seven Onthophagus species and one species from the closely related but hornless genus Oniticellus ) .
The scientists found that all seven Onthophagus species examined in the laboratory develop horns during their larval and pupal development .
That finding should instigate a complete revision of the evolutionary history of Onthophagus beetles , which are largely categorized according to their adult shapes with little or no heed given to the quirks of the beetles ' development .

Despite the growing presence of developmental biology in evolutionary studies , " Even today , evolutionary theory is very much a theory of adults , " Moczek said .
" But evolution does n't morph one adult shape into another .
Instead there 's an entire lifetime of development that we can't afford to ignore . "
Curious as to whether or not the horns had a function , the scientists destroyed the horn tissue of beetle larvae using electrosurgery : minute voltage arcs that permit precise destruction of targeted cells while nearby tissues are left intact and undamaged .
With the larval horn tissue destroyed , the scientists observed most larvae were unable to break the husks of their larval head capsules , resulting in young adult hatchlings whose heads were tightly ( and lethally ) encased within larval helmets .
Altered Oniticellus , on the other hand , had no trouble breaking free of their former exoskeletons .
" It may be that these larval horns enabled Onthophagus beetles to grow a thicker carapace , " Moczek said .
" But it is also possible a thicker carapace made horns necessary .
We are left with the commonly asked question in evolutionary developmental biology , ' Which came first " ' "
Most scientists have assumed the sexual dimorphism of some Onthophagus beetles was borne of differential growth ; flamboyantly horned male beetles grow them , hornless females simply can't .
But the American Naturalist report shows that even within sexually dimorphic horned beetle species , both sexes initially form the horns , even if one or both sexes reabsorb the horn tissue sometime before adulthood .
In the American Naturalist report , Moczek examined the development of four Onthophagus species .
Both species nigriventris and binodis exhibit typical sexual dimorphism -- adult males have horns , females are hornless .
In sagittarius , the sexual dimorphism is reversed .
Adult females and males of the fourth species Moczek examined , taurus , are both hornless .
Despite the differences in adult appearance , all four species begin to grow horns as larvae -- regardless of sex , Moczek found .
The hornlessness of some adult beetles is therefore not the result of an inability to make horns , Moczek says , but the reshaping or reabsorption of horn tissue before the beetles become adults .
" I think these findings illustrate quite clearly the importance of development to evolutionary biology , " Moczek said .
" By including studies of your organism 's development , at the very least you stand to gain fundamental insights into its biology .
More often than not , however , you may prevent yourself from making big mistakes when drawing up evolutionary histories .
In this case , I think we did both . "
Research reported in both papers was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute .
Moczek , graduate student Tami Cruickshank and undergraduate student Andrew Shelby coauthored the Evolution paper .
Moczek is the American Naturalist paper 's sole author .
NEW YORK --
A construction worker 's bid to curse the New York Yankees by planting a Boston Red Sox jersey in their new stadium was foiled when the home team removed the offending shirt from its burial spot .
After locating the shirt in a service corridor behind what will be a restaurant in the new Yankee Stadium , construction workers jackhammered through the concrete Sunday and pulled it out .
The team said it learned that a Red Sox-rooting construction worker had buried a shirt in the new Bronx stadium , which will open next year across the street from the current ballpark , from a report in the New York Post on Friday .
Yankees president Randy Levine said team officials at first considered leaving the shirt where it was .
" The first thought was , you know , it 's never a good thing to be buried in cement when you 're in New York , " Levine said .
" But then we decided , why reward somebody who had really bad motives and was trying to do a really bad thing ? "
On Saturday , construction workers who remembered the employee , Gino Castignoli phoned in tips about the shirt 's location .
" We had anonymous people come tell us where it was , and we were able to find it , " said Frank Gramarossa , a project executive with Turner Construction , the general contractor on the site .
A worker at the new Yankee Stadium pulls a David Ortiz jersey out of the concrete .
A Red Sox fan had placed the jersey in the concrete beneath the stadium in the hopes of jinxing the Yankees .

It took about five hours of drilling Saturday to locate the shirt under 2 feet of concrete , he said .
On Sunday , Levine and Yankees CEO Lonn Trost watched as Gramarossa and foreman Rich Corrado finished the job and pulled the shirt from the rubble .
In shreds from the jackhammers , the shirt still bore the letters " Red Sox " on the front .
It was a David Ortiz jersey , No. 34 .
Trost said the Yankees had discussed possible criminal charges against Castignoli with the district attorney 's office .
" We will take appropriate action since fortunately we do know the name of the individual , " he said .
A spokesman for Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said Sunday he did not know whether any criminal charges might apply .
" It 's typical Yankees , " Castignoli told the Boston Herald on Monday .
" It 's not like I snuck in there .
It did n't do any structural damage .
I did n't put anyone in harm 's way . "
Castignoli , 46 , said he became a Red Sox fan during his childhood in 1975 when he idolized slugger Jim Rice .
As construction began for the new Yankee Stadium , Castignoli said his union got after him to work on the project .
The Red Sox fan was reluctant .
" I would not go near Yankee Stadium , not for all the hot dogs in the world , " he told the Herald .
But he relented , and hatched the plan to plant the jersey .
He said he worked just a single day at the stadium project .
" It was worth it , " he said .
Levine said the shirt would be cleaned up and sent to the Jimmy Fund , a charity affiliated with Boston 's Dana - Farber Cancer Institute .
Along with that , New York will send a Yankees Universe T - shirt , which is sold to benefit Memorial Sloan - Kettering Cancer Center .
" Hopefully the Jimmy Fund will auction it off and we 'll take the act that was a very , very bad act and turn it into something beautiful , " he said .
Outsourcing Passports
The U.S. is outsourcing the manufacture of its RFID passports to some questionable companies .
This is a great illustration of the maxim “ security trade - offs are often made for non-security reasons . ”
I can imagine the manager in charge : “ Yes , it ’s insecure .
But think of the savings ! ”
The Government Printing Office ’s decision to export the work has proved lucrative , allowing the agency to book more than $ 100 million in recent profits by charging the State Department more money for blank passports than it actually costs to make them , according to interviews with federal officials and documents obtained by The Times .

American consumers are steering clear of shopping centres , as home repossessions and surging household bills hit them in the wallet , according to dismal high - street spending figures that sent the dollar and Wall Street stocks tumbling yesterday .
As the treasury secretary , Henry Paulson , attacked banks for creating obscure financial instruments that exacerbate market turmoil , analysts reacted gloomily to a 0.6 % drop in February retail sales - far worse than the widely forecast 0.2 % rise .
Mark Vitner , senior economist at the US bank Wachovia , said soaring oil and food prices were leaving shoppers with little spending money .
" High gasoline prices have pushed consumers to breaking point , " he said , adding that a recession had become undeniable .
" Once the economy slides into recession , my experience from history is that things tend to get worse faster than anybody 's expecting , " he said .
Scores of major shopping chains , including Wal - Mart , Nordstrom and Abercrombie & Fitch , have reported disappointing takings so far this year .
Even luxury boutiques such as Tiffany are suffering from the downturn .
Dean Maki , chief US economist at Barclays Capital , said : " We 're seeing softer spending in the first quarter .
Inflation is rising significantly , especially for oil and food .
On top of that , the softer labour market is holding back income growth . "
Pessimism is taking root in boardrooms : a Duke University survey of 475 chief financial officers found the worst level of sentiment in the study 's six - year history : 54 % believe the US is already in recession and a further 24 % think there is a high risk of one shortly .
The Wall Street Journal 's economic forecasting survey showed 71 % of respondents putting the US in recession , and 48 % of the 55 responses said a 2008 recession would be worse than the last two .
The Bush administration has set out reform proposals which are intended to tackle the credit meltdown through better regulation of mortgage companies , tightening credit - rating procedures , and higher capital ratios for the banking sector .
In a speech to the National Press Club in Washington , Paulson accused financiers of devoting too much energy to inventing esoteric securities that leverage mortgages and other debt , making it impossible to find where ultimate risks lie .
" Some financial products have become overly complex , " he said .
" Excessive complexity is the enemy of transparency and market efficiency .
Investor sentiment has swung hard to risk - aversion , and now the markets are punishing not only complex but non-complex products as well . "
A working group set up by George Bush has proposed strengthening Basle II - the international agreement setting minimum capital requirements for banks .
The group also recommends cracking down on firms that " shop around " among rating agencies for lenient treatment .
" Market participants ' behaviour must change , " Paulson said .
Although he was not interested in finding excuses and scapegoats , he said the financial sector 's turmoil was partly self - inflicted : " Poor judgment and poor market practices led to mistakes by all participants . "
Homeowners in the US heartland are still struggling to make repayments on risky subprime mortgages , which sparked the downturn last year .
The property firm RealtyTrac calculated that foreclosure papers were filed on 223,651 properties in February - one in 557 households .
The figure was slightly lower than in January but Realty Trac 's chief executive , James Saccacio , said the dip was seasonal : " We have still not reached the peak of foreclosure activity in this cycle . "
The worst - hit areas include Cape Coral , Florida and Stockton , California .
Arizona and Texas also saw a big increase in their rates of repossession .
Among those served with foreclosure documents was the singer Aretha Franklin , who is at risk of losing her $ 700,000 ( £ 350,000 ) mansion in Detroit over back taxes of $ 19,192 .
Less dough
Even America 's pizzas are set to shrink as the nation grapples with a toxic recipe of weak consumer spending and surging prices .
The delivery chain Domino 's Pizza is drawing up plans for a " value menu " likely to involve smaller sizes .
The move is in response to customers ' thrifty mood , as well as pressure from rising wheat costs .
" We 're going to try to take an approach where you still see the same product quality , " said chief executive Dave Brandon .
" But perhaps a different size and perhaps a different bundle so you wo n't disappoint the customer . "
Reflecting America 's tradition for enormous helpings , Domino 's Pizza sizes are half an inch larger in its home market than in Britain .
Michigan - based Domino's has already laid off 50 staff in response to America 's economic slowdown .
Some VoIP ( voice over Internet Protocol ) and mobile phone service providers are riding free when connecting to the traditional telephone network in the U.S. , potentially costing carriers billions of dollars , according to testimony at a Senate hearing Wednesday .
Many voice calls now do n't include the identification needed for carriers to charge access fees for calls coming into their networks , said Raymond Henagan , general manager of Rock Port Telephone , based in Missouri .
These so - called phantom calls are particularly hard on rural telephone carriers , which receive an average 29 percent of their revenues from the intercarrier compensation system , he told the Senate Commerce , Science and Transportation Committee .
Some VoIP providers have refused to pay access fees by saying the U.S. Federal Communications Commission has " given them permission to use the networks for free because they 're IP , " Henagan said .
" You and I both know these are regular voice calls , people talking to people .
Because these companies have sprinkled IP fairy dust on them , they think they get a free ride . "
In 2007 , 18 percent of Rock Port Telephone 's voice minutes were unbillable , and some rural carriers are seeing up to 30 percent of their minutes from phantom traffic , Henagan said .
He asked senators to push the FCC to require that all voice traffic pay intercarrier compensation fees .
" If the FCC lets this continue , Americans who live in rural areas will likely see their phone bills escalate , " he said .
" Their quality of service will be decreased , and [ there will be ] large reductions of investments in broadband . "
Phantom traffic costs traditional carriers between $ 600 million and $ 2 billion a year , added Lawrence Sarjeant , vice president of federal legislative and regulatory affairs at Qwest Communications International .
Sarjeant urged Congress or the FCC to fix problems with the complicated intercarrier compensation system , saying the FCC does n't require VoIP providers to include traditional call identification protocols on their calls .
Traditional telephone carriers have " made a lot of investments " in their networks and deserve to be compensated for traffic coming from outside the network , he said .
Without the access fees , Qwest has less money to upgrade its network and roll out new broadband services , he said .
" If this happens , consumers lose , " Sarjeant added .
But representatives of wireless carrier Sprint Nextel and VoIP provider Covad Communications downplayed the problem .
Charles McKee , Sprint Nextel 's director of government affairs , said he does not believe that a " significant amount of traffic is being manipulated " for fraudulent purposes .
The traditional telephone carriers often have n't updated their networks to identify new forms of voice calls , he said .
In addition , the intercarrier compensation rules are complicated and sometimes unclear , McKee added .
" What one carrier characterizes as fraud , another carrier will consider entirely appropriate under the existing rules , " he said .
Many VoIP providers have tried to work out compensation agreements with rural carriers , but the rural carriers have spurned the offers , added Angela Simpson , Covad 's senior counsel for government and regulatory affairs .
Lawmakers should be wary of imposing new regulations on Internet - based services , and instead should research further the extent of the problem , she added .
New regulations could slow down adoption of broadband , Simpson said .
" We are concerned that proponents of a new ... regulation have not adequately demonstrated a quantifiable problem , " she said .
" There 's no need to conduct open - heart surgery to fix a paper cut . "
Still , Senator Ted Stevens , an Alaska Republican , said he would introduce legislation that would require the FCC to establish new rules for intercarrier compensation and VoIP providers within 12 months .
" It 's unfair to the system that some people disguise their traffic and not pay for it , as others do , " Stevens said .
With the recent news that anticonvulsants double the rate of suicide , I got to thinking : is n't Klonopin ( clonazepam ) an FDA approved anticonvulsant ?
Sure , it has different pharmacology than the other 11 studied , but Lamictal , Lyrica , Depakote , etc are equally different .
So if we 're going to pretend that we never had to take pharmacology in med school , if we 're talking class effect , then Klonopin gets the warning .
Which may mean that all benzos should get the warning , since , well ... But why stop there ?
Antidepressants carry the warning across pharmacology .
SSRIs , TCAs -- even Seroquel has the warning ONLY because it's now an " antidepressant " for bipolar disorder .
Again , the FDA would like us to pretend that doctors had every M , W , F 9 am - 10 am off in med school .
We 're not postulating the pharmacology is the cause , since they are all different -- we 're saying it 's a class effect .
Ok , well , what else is an antidepressant ?
Well , a number of medicines not FDA approved .
Lithium , even though that 's supposed to reduce suicide .
CBT or other therapies ?
They must ultimately act on some biological pathway , right ?... inevitably , there can only be one conclusion : .
You are all on notice .
And so , , let 's all stop this nonsense .
Some have trouble with my seemingly out of hand dismissal of a link between medications and suicidality .
The problem , like everything else , is semantics .
If they had said meds cause dysphoria , or confusion , I 'd buy on board .
The problem is the link to -- a complex behavior .
If SSRIs cause suicide , then they should just as logically promote the sudden need to buy a Volvo .
Yes , that specific .
Not cause a feeling of emptiness you need to fill with a material object , or even the sudden need to purchase an object -- but rather the .
These warnings are n't saying the patients are miserable , they 're thinking of running away from home , or cheating on their spouse -- they are thinking of Not other people , either -- themselves .
You might say that the med is simply one factor , it adds to other things -- like another log on a fire .
Ok , fine .
But that 's not the same as causing suicide , it 's not even the same as " increasing the rate " of suicide .
Being on an antipsychotic for schizophrenia may lead to more regular credit card payments since you 're thinking more clearly , but no one would ever say Zyprexa doubles the rates of Visa payments , I have an additional philosophical problem with it all : these warnings do n't just exaggerate a medication 's side effects , they demote suicidality to little more than a side effect .
In essence , these black box warnings reduce the complexity of suicidality into less of a behavior or activity and more of a reaction , a reflex .
You might think that 's not the intention , and I 'm sure you'd be right , but that is the result .
Note that no one is attributing any other complex behaviors to these meds as a side effect -- not increased marriage , or desire to learn French , etc.
Suicide thus becomes MORE of something that can happen to you and LESS of something you do because you feel a certain way .
It 's subtle , but it matters .
It 's a corruption of language to escape the -- well , nausea -- of massive freedom ; it says behaviors occur , not get chosen .
Psychiatry rarely argues nature vs. nurture anymore , not because it 's been solved but because it 's become irrelevant -- either way , you were now made and will inevitably act accordingly .
Though Mr. Lewis had praise for Mrs. Clinton and for her historic candidacy , he said he could decide within days whether to formally endorse Mr. Obama .
He also said he and other lawmakers would meet in the coming days to decide how they intended to weigh in on the nominating fight .
If neither Mrs. Clinton nor Mr. Obama receive enough pledged delegates to win the nomination , superdelegates like Mr. Lewis may play the deciding role in who wins .
“ If I can be used as a mediator , a negotiator or a peacemaker , I ’d be happy to step in , ” Mr. Lewis said , adding that he intends to speak to both candidates in hopes of ending the race amicably in the next month .
“ I do n’t want to see Mrs. Clinton damaged or Mr. Obama damaged . ”
Jay Carson , a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton , said Thursday : “ Congressman Lewis is a true American hero , and we have the utmost respect for him and understand the great pressure he faced .
And Senator Clinton enjoys incredibly strong support from superdelegates around the country from all regions and races . ”

The comments by Mr. Lewis underscored a growing sentiment among some of the party ’s black leaders that they should not stand in the way of Mr. Obama ’s historic quest for the nomination and should not go against the will of their constituents .
As superdelegates , they may have the final say , which is something Mr. Lewis said he feared would weaken Democrats and raise Republicans ’ chances of winning the White House .
Still , the Democratic nominating fight clearly has many turns ahead .
On Thursday , Mrs. Clinton unleashed the most ambitious mobilization of her forces in weeks , reflecting the intense pressure she is under from Mr. Obama , the political necessity for her of towering performances in the delegate - rich primaries in Ohio and Texas on March 4 , and her fresh hope of an upset victory in Wisconsin .
NEW YORK , April 10 ( Reuters ) - A handful of media companiesare gearing up to submit second round bids for the Weather Channel , although a sale of the asset could go for significantly less than the $ 5 billion its owners originally sought , two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters .
Fewer than five companies are putting together the second - round bids , which will be due in early to mid-May , the sources said .
All the bidders are media companies and the buyer , likely to be announced by early June , could pay as low as $ 3 billion for the U.S. cable network , the sources said .
Separately , another source briefed on the matter said Time Warner Inc TWX.N is in talks to buy the Weather Channel from privately held Landmark Communications .
Landmark announced earlier this year it hired JP Morgan and Lehman Brothers to study its options .
Several sources told Reuters last month that General Electric Co's NBC Universal GE.N , CBS Corp CBS.N and Comcast Corp CMCSA.O had examined the financial materials that were assembled for the auction .
It is unclear if any of those companies made a bid for the channel .
CBS declined comment and Comcast was not immediately available for comment .
In an interview with Reuters earlier this week , NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker declined to comment on whether NBC had made a bid for the Weather Channel but said : “ The Weather Channel is a very good opportunity and certainly something we would take a look at . ”
While considered a prized asset , auction of the Weather Channel has failed to attract private equity as the credit crunch has restricted financing for major leveraged buyouts , sources have said .
The Weather Channel appeals to media companies looking to enter cable or expand their holdings , since the network ’s time - sensitive broadcasts and programming about hot - button issues on the environment have proven to be attractive to audiences and advertisers , industry experts have said .
The Weather Channel produces continuous , 24 - hour national , regional and local weather - related programs and is received by more than 96 million U.S. households .
It can be seen in more than 97 percent of all cable TV homes nationwide .
The channel ’s accompanying Web site attracts about 35 million unique users each month , Landmark said .
That puts it among the Web ’s 20 most popular sites , and the top destination for online weather , news and information .
Landmark , based in Norfolk , Virginia , declined to comment on the auction process .
Landmark ’s interest in selling The Weather Channel comes amid broader shifts in the cable TV landscape .
Discovery Communications , which includes , the Discovery Channel , Science Channel and Animal Planet networks , is expected to become a publicly traded company in the second quarter .
Sundance Channel , the joint venture between CBS , NBC Universal and Sundance founder Robert Redford , also is for sale , according to one of the sources .
In addition , IAC / InterActiveCorp IACI.
O is spinning off its HSN shopping network as part of a larger restructuring , and E.W. Scripps Co SSP.N plans to split itself into two publicly traded companies , one that will center on its cable channels and another that will include its newspapers and broadcast TV stations .

The infamous anti-piracy organization IFPI sent an email to warn its members NOT to any send email to colleagues that use an [ email protected ] email address because that domain is now owned by their rivals from the " International Federation of Pirate Interests " .
Unfortunately the members did not listen , and even the email about the leak leaked .
Last month a leaked email from The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) – the anti-piracy organization that represents the recording industry worldwide – revealed that they had plans to request confidential information from an ongoing police investigation of The Pirate Bay .
Several people were wondering how this email leaked , and rumors about hacked mail servers started to circulate .
It now now becomes clear how the email leaked – and there is not much hacking involved – it seems that some of their members were still sending emails to [ email protected ] addresses – not that smart .
The IFPI of course warned their members not to use any .com addresses anymore , but ironically , this email was forwarded to a .com address a few hours later .
Here ’s a quote from the leaked email correspondence that was anonymously forwarded to TorrentFreak .
“… please be aware that the person operating the domain is also collecting emails that are sent in error to [ email protected ]
You may have seen press reports regarding an email leak from IFPI , this was a result of an email being sent in error to an ifpi.com email address and is not indicative of any more serious problem with email security . ”
Can you be even more stupid than to forward this message to someone using an IFPI.com address ?
I ’ve always doubted the rumors that most people who work at these anti-piracy organizations are too dumb to tie their own shoes , but I ’m starting to believe it now .
Unfortunately there was not much news in the email , the huge list of anti-pirate email addresses may come in handy sometime though .
In addition , there was some info about the domain dispute the IFPI filed to get their .com domain back , as they write : “ … we filed a complaint at WIPO under the dispute resolution procedure designed for cyber - squatting cases like this one .
We are hopeful of a result from the WIPO procedure soon , and we will keep you updated . ”
… I guess that means that we ’ll be updated too ?

Yipee !Â
Thanks to everyone who told me not to re-invent the wheel on this one .
Â
I spent a large bit of the week thinking about doing that , but eventually I gave up the idea because I was feeling kind of worn out .
Â
So I just threw together a google code and google group and slapped a website in front of it all .
If you ’re interested in tinypy in any way , be sure to go to the site then navigate to the google group from there and join in the fun .

I suppose I could have direct links from this post , but then you ’d miss out seeing my new swell site 🙂

Americans , perhaps like all people , have a remarkable capacity for tuning out unpleasantries that do not directly affect them .
I ’m thinking here of wars on foreign lands , but also the astonishing fact that the United States has become the world ’s most jail - loving country , with well over 1 in 100 adults living as slaves in a prison .
Building and managing prisons , and locking people up , have become major facets of government power in our time , and it is long past time for those who love liberty to start to care .
Before we get to the reasons why , look at the facts as reported by the New York Times .
The U.S. leads the world in prisoner production .
There are 2.3 million people behind bars .
China , with four times as many people , has 1.6 million in prison .
In terms of population , the US has 751 people in prison for every 100,000 , while the closest competitor in this regard is Russia with 627 .
I ’m struck by this figure : 531 in Cuba .
The median global rate is 125 .
What ’s amazing is that most of this imprisoning trend is recent , dating really from the 1980s , and most of the change is due to drug laws .
From 1925 to 1975 , the rate of imprisonment was stable at 110 , lower than the international average , which is what you might expect in a country that purports to value freedom .
But then it suddenly shot up in the 1980s .
There were 30,000 people in jail for drugs in 1980 , while today there are half a million .
Other factors include the criminalization of nearly everything these days , even passing bad checks or the pettiest of thefts .
And judges are under all sorts of minimum sentencing requirements .
Now , before we move to causes and answers , please consider what jail means .
The people inside are slaves of the state .
They are captured and held and regarded by their captors as nothing other than biological beings that take up space .
The delivery of all services to them is contingent on the whims of their masters , who have no stake in the outcome at all .
Now , you might say that this is necessary for some people , but be aware that it is the ultimate assault on human dignity .
They are “ paying the price ” for their actions , but no one is in a position to benefit from the price paid .
They are n’t working off debts or compensating victims or struggling to overcome anything .
They are just “ doing time , ” costing taxpayers almost $ 25,000 a year per person .
That ’s all these people are to society : a cost , and they are treated as such .
And the communities in which they exist in these prisons consist of other un-valued people , and they become socialized into this mentality that is utterly contrary to every notion of civilization .
Then there are the relentless threat and reality of violence , the unspeakable noise , the pervasiveness of every moral perversity .
In short , prisons are Hell .
It can be no wonder that they rehabilitate no one .
As George Barnard Shaw said , “ imprisonment is as irrevocable as death . ”
What ’s more , everything we know about government applies to this ultimate government program .
It is expensive ( states alone spend $ 44 billion on prisons every year ) , inefficient , brutal , and irrational .
The modern prison system is also a relatively new phenomenon in history , one that is used to enforce political priorities ( the drug war ) rather than punish real crimes .
It is also manipulated by political passions rather than a genuine concern for justice .
The results of the drug war are not to reduce consumption but rather the opposite .
Illegal drugs are now a $ 100 billion dollar industry in the US , while the drug war itself costs taxpayers $ 19 billion , even as the costs of running the justice system are skyrocketing ( up 418 % percent in 25 years ) .
People say that crime is down , so this must be working .
Well , that depends on what you mean by crime .
Drug use and distribution are associated with violence solely because they are illegal .
They are crimes because the state says they are crimes , but they do not fit within the usual definition we find in the history of political philosophy , which centers on the violation of person or property .
What ’s more , the “ crime ” of drug use and distribution has n’t really been kept down ; it has only gone further underground .
It ’s a major irony and commentary on the workability of prisons that drug markets are very active there .
Now to causes .
Some social scientists give the predictable explanation that all this is due to the lack of a “ social safety net ” in the U.S .
In the first place , the U.S. has had such a net for a hundred years , and yet these people seem not to have noticed , even though no such net is big enough for some people .
Moreover , it is more likely the very presence of such a net — which creates a moral hazard so that people do not learn to be responsible for their own well - being — that contributes to criminal behavior ( all else being equal ) .
There are those on all sides who attribute the increase to racial factors , given that the imprisoned population is disproportionately black and Hispanic , and noting the disparity in crime rates in such places as Minnesota with low levels of minority populations .
But this factor too could be illusory , especially as regards drug use , since it is far more likely that a state system will catch and punish people with less influence and social standing than those whom the state regards as significant .
A more telling point comes to us from political analysts , who observe the politicization of judicial appointments in the United States .
Judges run on their “ tough on crime ” records , or are appointed for them , and so have every incentive to lock people up more than justice truly demands .
One factor that has n’t been mentioned so far in the discussion is the lobbying power of the prison industry itself .
The old rule is that if you subsidize something , you get more of it .
And so it is with prisons and the prison - industrial complex .
I ’ve yet to find any viable figures on how large this industry is , but consider that it includes construction firms , managers of private prisons , wardens , food service providers , counselors , security services , and a hundred other kinds of companies to build and manage these miniature societies .
What kind of political influence do they have ?
Speculation here , but it must be substantial .
As for public concern , remember that every law on the books , every regulation , every line in the government codebook , is ultimately enforced by prison .
The jail cell is the symbol and ultimate end of statism itself .
It would be nice if we thought of the interests of the prisoners in society and those that will become so .
But even if you are not likely to be among them , consider the loss of privacy , the loss of liberty , the loss of independence , the loss of all that used to be considered truly American , in the course of the building of prison nation .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
Life is not all about the haves and have - nots .
New research reveals a more nuanced approach to life : Individuals who want what they have tend to be happier than others .
The study results , detailed in the April issue of the journal Psychological Science , suggest one key to achieving greater happiness is to continue wanting the things you have .
That is , keep those rosy first - time - buyer lenses in place .
The spanking - new iPhone or the latest digital all - in - one gizmo could seem like the best buy upon purchase .
But over time , the greatest purchase ever can become so yesterday and , the researchers say , you will derive less happiness from that item .
" Simply having a bunch of things is not the key to happiness , " said Jeff Larsen , a psychologist at Texas Tech University .
" Our data show that you also need to appreciate those things you have .
It 's also important to keep your desire for things you do n't own in check . "
Larsen and Amie McKibban of Wichita State University surveyed 126 male and female undergraduate students who indicated whether or not they owned 52 material items , such as a car , stereo , rollerblades or bed .
Students who indicated owning a car , for instance , would then rate how much they wanted that car on a scale from " not at all " to " a lot . "
Those who did n't possess the item , rated how much they wanted it .
Results from the survey and questionnaires for life satisfaction and overall well - being revealed that students who wanted more of what they had were happier than individuals less fond of their possessions .
Individuals satisfied with their possessions were also happier than students who owned fewer items from their " want " list .
The extent to which students wanted things they did n't own had no impact on happiness .
Beach Impeach III in San Francisco was another resounding success .

No , not that N word , the other N word .
Nationalize .
As in nationalize a financial institution here and there .
Do you know how Paul Krugman is following the TED spread as an indicator of current financial troubles ?
I ’ll be following how many times the N word pops up in Google News .
Right now the top mentions all concern other countries , of course including Northern Rock in Great Britain .
So far this is the closest I ’ve found to hints of nationalization for the United States ; in the blogosphere Nouriel Roubini is saying nationalization is better than bailouts .
The Swedes , of course , nationalized Nordbanken , their # 2 bank at the time , in the early 1990s , during their financial crisis .
They also nationalized Gotabanken and supplied funds to several other institutions .
The belief at the time was that loan liquidation would have been even worse .
And since Nordbanken was on life support anyway , and the government had to limit systematic risk by paying off creditors anyway , why not just control the bank directly ?
The bank was subsequently re-privatized .
You ’ll find more background on the Swedish experience here .
Of course in these situations none of the options are pretty .
But keep in mind that the Fed ( and ultimately , the taxpayer ) is already residual claimant on the Bear Stearns deal and then read Mises on the dynamics of interventionism .
There are many things we do not do as well as the Swedes .
In any case , if use of the N word remains spotty or non-existent in the U.S. , you ’ll know that things are going OK , at least relative to what might have happened .
Addendum : Brad DeLong has much to add , including some policy recommendations .
Arnold Kling does n’t agree .
Some people go to great lengths to stay young , but this is really strange : Human Placenta treatment .
In the 2004 movie Three Extremes , Chinese actress Bai Ling raised eyebrows playing an unlicensed midwife who makes dumplings out of aborted foetuses and placentas .
She sold them to rich women who believed that consuming them would reverse the signs of ageing .
Although Bai herself claims to be disgusted by the idea of eating placentas , there are rumours aplenty of other celebrities who do it in the hope of improving their health and regaining a youthful complexion .
Dr. Peter Chew , a consultant OB / GYN at Gleneagles Hospital , Singapore , did n't think that it worked , but also did n't see any harm in eating human placenta :
A placenta is an organ rich in blood vessels that develops in female mammals during pregnancy .
It lines the uterine wall and partially envelopes the foetus , to which it is attached by the umbilical cord .
At full - term , it is about 18 cm long and 5 cm thick .
It is expelled during child birth , forming part of the afterbirth .
Its function is to transfer oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the foetus .
It also releases carbon dioxide and waste from the foetus through the umbilical cord to be disposed of by the mother .
Dr Peter Chew , a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Gleneagles Hospital , says that though people have been talking about " frying , drying and eating placentas " for years , his patients rarely ask to keep theirs .
He says : " Placentas are full of hormones , so theoretically , they should improve the complexion , even though there 's no medical evidence to support this . "
As for the possibility of dangerous side effects from consuming it , he says " there 's no harm , seeing it 's your own body 's organ " .
But to be on the safe side , he recommends cooking the placenta before consumption .

If you 're squeamish about eating human placenta , there 's an alternative : Placenta Essence Whiting [ sic ] and Revitalizing facial mask powder , made from sheep placenta .

How can we tell who ’s lying , who ’s not ?
New research out of Stephen Porter ’s Forensic Psychology Lab at Dalhousie University determines the face will betray the deceiver ’s true emotion , but not in the stereotypical ways we think .
In making a public appeal for the safe return of his missing wife , Michael White broke down in tears and sobbed .
“ My wife is a good person , never hurts anybody .
If she ’s out there and you see me or you see this , just stay out there and we ’ll find you , ’ said the tearful husband , sitting on the sofa in his living room in Edmonton after his pregnant wife Liana White disappeared in July 2005 .
Canadians watching his plea could n’t help but be moved by the plight of the distressed man .
Three days later , flashes of anger broke through his sadness when talking with reporters .
He said he was so frustrated with the police investigation that he was going to go and find his wife himself .
He led volunteer searchers directly to her body in a ditch on the outskirts of the city , and was immediately arrested by police .
He ’d been lying all along .
Michael
White was charged and convicted with second - degree murder and committing an indignity to a dead body .
How can we tell who ’s lying , who ’s not ?
New research out of Stephen Porter ’s Forensic Psychology Lab at Dalhousie University determines the face will betray the deceiver ’s true emotion , but not in the stereotypical ways we think .
It ’s not the shifty eyes or sweaty brow or an elongated nose ( à la Pinocchio ) the lie detector should look for .
Instead , other elements of a liar ’s face will give them away – “ cracking ” briefly and allowing displays of true emotion to leak on to the face .
In fact , when Porter and his team analyzed White ’s plea frame by frame , they found hints of anger and disgust in his face , not noticed by most of the supportive public .
advertisement
“ The face and its musculature are so complex — so much more complex than anywhere else in our external bodies , ” says Leanne ten Brinke , a graduate student in experimental psychology who collaborated on the new research .
“ There are some muscles in the face you ca n’t control … and those muscles wo n’t be activated in the absence of genuine emotion — you just ca n’t do it . ”
Adds Dr. Porter : “ If someone is telling a really important lie in which the consequences are dire , say life imprisonment , the lie will be revealed anyway .
Because unlike body language , you ca n’t monitor or completely control what ’s going on your face .
This research was the first detailed experimental demonstration of the secrets revealed when people put on a “ false face , ” faking or inhibiting various universal emotions . ”
An article based on their research , “ Reading between the Lies : Identifying Concealed and Falsified Emotions in Universal Facial Expressions , ” appears in the May issue of Psychological Science .
The research is the first comprehensive study of the secrets revealed by the human face for four of the universal emotions : happiness , sadness , disgust , and fear .
They also tested a hypothesis originating with Charles Darwin in 1872 — that there are certain specific facial actions that cannot be created just because we want them to .
As well , facial actions may be involuntarily expressed in the presence of a genuine emotion .
In The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , Darwin noted : “ A man when moderately angry , or even when enraged , may command the movements of his body , but … those muscles of the face which are least obedient to the will , will sometimes alone betray a slight and passing emotion . ”
In conducting the research , Dr. Porter and Ms. ten Brinke enlisted adult participants to view images that ranged from happy ( puppies playing ) to fearful ( a close - up of open - mouthed rabid dog ) and disgusting ( a severed hand ) and were instructed to respond with genuine or deceptive emotional expressions .
( For example , they ’d be directed to smile when viewing the severed - hand photo . )
Their reactions were watched and judged by other volunteer observers , who could not see the corresponding images , and recorded on video .
The 697 emotion clips were exhaustively analyzed frame by frame for more than 100,000 frames .
The results were that no one participant was able to falsify emotions perfectly .
Odd or out - of - place expressions — such as smirking or rapid blinking in a supposedly sad face — were more likely to show up when the participant was attempting to be deceptive .
Some emotions were harder to falsify than others : happiness is easier to fake than disgust or fear .
advertisement
The researchers were able to discern rare “ microexpressions , ” flashes of true emotion that show briefly , from one - fifth to one - 25th of a second , on the faces of participants when instructed to deceive .
“ The facial expression appears to crack and another emotion leaks on the face , however briefly , ” says Ms. ten Brinke .
“ When you see a facial expression like this , you ’ve got to probe with questions to find out why the person is feeling this way . ”
The authors noted that most flashes of inconsistent emotion usually showed in either the upper or lower face only .
Further , meaningless muscle twitches sometimes occurred even in genuine expressions , meaning that correct interpretation can only occur by following up with the right questions .
Detecting liars is a tricky business and one that most people — especially people who are highly motivated to catch liars — are particularly bad at .
“ There are all kinds of potential applications for this research , from our daily lives to settings like police interrogations , security checks in airports and courtrooms , ” says Dr. Porter .
“ Everyone ’s trying to figure out who ’s telling the truth , who ’s not … we ’re just so sick of being lied to . ”
The next step in the research is examining the faces of known liars , liars like Michael White , who ’ve fabricated stories and made highly publicized appeals .
Ms. ten Brinke and Dr. Porter have collected and are analyzing more than 60 videos of such real - life , high - stakes cases from Canada , the United States , Britain and Australia .
“ It ’s to try and give the police a more objective look at whether people in these kinds of situations might be lying , ” Ms. ten Brinke explains .
It seems the face does reveal all .
Stone -age figurines depicting what could be the oldest pornographic scene in the world have been unearthed in Germany .
Archaeologists have discovered what they believe to be the 7,200 - year - old remnants of a man having intercourse with a woman .
The extraordinary find , at an archaeological dig in Saxony , shatters the belief that sex was a taboo subject in that era .
Until now , the oldest representations of sexual scenes were frescos from about 2,000 years ago .
Harald Stäuble of the Archaeological Institute of Saxony , based in Dresden , discovered the 8 cm lower half of a man , which has been named Adonis von Zschernitz .
" A unique find , " reported Spiegel magazine .
" This is the oldest male clay figurine ever discovered in the world . "
But the most amazing find came at the dig in Leipzig one month later , when Dr Stäuble found what could be the matching female figurine .
Dr Stäuble , who is due to publish a paper on his findings this year , said : " After finding Adonis , we got the team to sieve every speck of soil for a whole month .
We were well rewarded because we then found fragments of a female figurine of the same size . "
He added : " Adonis is bent forward and the female figure is bent forward even more .
" There are two ways of looking at this .
The first is that they were doing a ritual dance , but the other possibility is that the man and woman were copulating and that he was standing behind her .
The copulation option is far more likely , and would make this the oldest representation ever of a pornographic scene . "
Until now , there have been discoveries of clay models of women with large breasts and bottoms , which have always been interpreted as connected with fertility .
But Adonis was the first figurine that clearly depicted male sexual organs .
" This is such an interesting discovery , " said Dr Sträuble , " as these figurines are not stylistic , but realistic .
They open up a gateway for historians and anthropologists to discuss whether sex really was a taboo subject in the stone age . "
Tell me again :
Why should we get all worked up over the revelation that the New York governor paid for sex ?
Will it bring back to life the eight U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq that same day in a war that makes no sense and has cost this nation trillions in future debt ?
Will it save those millions of homes that hardworking folks all over the country are losing because of financial industry shenanigans that Eliot Spitzer , as much as anyone , attempted to halt ?
Perhaps it provides some insight into why oil has risen to $ 108 a barrel , benefiting most of all the oil sheiks whom our taxpayer - supported military has kept in power ?
Sure , the guy , by his own admission , is quite pathetic in all those small , squirrelly ways that have messed up the lives of other grand public figures before him , but why is an all - too - human sin , amply predicted in early Scripture , getting all this incredible media play as some sort of shocking event ?
The answer is that , while having precious little to do with serious corruption in public life , it does have a great deal to do with stoking flagging newspaper sales and television ratings .
The sad truth is that reporting on major corruption , say , the rationalizations of a president who has authorized torture , does n’t cut it as a marketing bonanza .
Just days before this grand exposé , the president vetoed a bill banning torture , and instead of being greeted with horrified disgust , the president ’s deep denigration of this nation ’s presumed ideals was met with a vast public yawn .
Torture , unlike paid sex , does n’t have legs as a news story .
Sex sells , and frankly it would seem far more exploitative for the news media to pimp this tale to the public than anything that VIP escort service did with the pitiable governor .
His behavior was not really any more wretched than messing around with a young and vulnerable White House intern who did n’t even get paid for her efforts , yet Bill Clinton survived that one , whereas Spitzer was presumed dead on the arrival of this “ news . ”
The New York Times , which editorially has supported the candidacy of Hillary Clinton , whose vast White House experience clearly did not include corralling her husband , now editorializes contemptuously about Spitzer ’s betrayal of the public trust as well as about his exploitation of his “ ashen - faced ” wife , who , like Hillary , stood by her man .
The media consensus from the opening salvo was that Spitzer must resign and he will be thrown to the dogs , which is unfortunate because , like Clinton , he has done much valuable work in the public interest , and the outrage over this personal dereliction , tawdry in the extreme , is excessive .
I certainly never wanted Clinton to resign , let alone be impeached , but why is Spitzer ’s paying for sex more disgraceful than ripping it off ?
Yes , Spitzer allegedly broke a law that should n’t be on the books , and his resignation in disgrace is inevitable , but it bothers me that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney remain in office despite having violated enormously more serious laws .
Frankly , I do n’t care what any of these politicians do in their personal lives as long as the practice is consensual , and the thousands of dollars that exchanged hands in this case would provide a presumption that the lady in question was indeed a willing partner in this commercial transaction .
True , Spitzer is an outrageous hypocrite for having prosecuted others caught in what should not be considered criminal behavior , but since when is hypocrisy on the part of a politician , particularly as to sex , so shocking ?
I would n’t have written this column had I not read The Wall Street Journal ’s Page 1 news story headlined “ Wall Street Cheers as Its Nemesis Plunges Into Crisis . ”
The article begins with the crowing statement “ It ’s Schadenfreude time on Wall Street ” and goes on to quote those whom Spitzer went after over what should be considered the criminal greed that has predominated on Wall Street .
It was Spitzer , as much as anyone , who sounded the alarm on the subprime mortgage crisis , the obscene payouts to CEOs who defrauded their shareholders and the other financial scandals that have brought the U.S. economy to its knees .
The best rule of thumb these days is that ordinary Americans should be mightily depressed over any news that Wall Street hustlers cheer , for they have been exposed as a dangerous pack of scoundrels quite willing to rob decent , hardworking people of their homes .
And of course no one on Wall Street ever paid for sex .

I have to say , by the way , that the relevant parts of the SVG spec are truly worthless .
Where are the UA conformance criteria ?
You'd think a spec that was so verbose and detailed would actually tell you stuff , instead of just rambling on without actually saying what the requirements were ...
Just as Reddit is celebrating Opera reaching 100/100 , with the misleading headline Opera the first browser to pass the Acid3 test ( hey , submitter : it would n't hurt to read the Opera blog post before submitting it to Reddit ) , the Apple guys track me down and point out that there 's yet another bug in the test .
With heycam 's help , we have now fixed the test .
Again .
This presumably means Opera is now at 99/100 ... the race continues !
When we released Acid2 , the first browser passed it in about a fortnight .
Acid3 is orders of magnitude more complicated .
I really did n't expect to see passing browsers this side of August , let alone within a month .
I am really impressed by the level of commitment to standards that Opera and the WebKit team ( and Apple in particular ) are showing here .
Of course , with a test as complex as this one , I was bound to make some mistakes , which the browser vendors were very quick to tell me about .
Sometimes they were mistaken , and the test was actually correct ; other times I was wrong , and had to fix the test , and in one case , the spec changed .
Since we announced the Acid3 test a few short weeks ago , two major browser vendors have been tripping over themselves trying to pass the test , with both Opera and Safari getting very close in the last few hours .
Meanwhile , HTML5 continues to make good progress .
I have a page now which shows my progress in replying to e-mails , and as you can see from the changelog tracker , checkins are as fast and furious as ever .
Speaking of standards , and of good news from browser development teams , Microsoft 's IE team announced today that they were changing their mind about their mode switch , and that bug fixes they make to their rendering engine will be applied to pages in what HTML5 calls " no- quirks " mode ( what has historically been known as " standards mode " ) .
I 'd like to congratulate the IE team on this brave decision .
It 's the right thing for the Web .
I have to say straight up that I 've been really impressed with the WebKit team .
Even before the test was finished , they were actively following up every single bug the test showed .
Safari 3 ( the last released version ) scores 39/100 with bad rendering errors .
At the start of last month their nightly builds were scoring about 60/100 with serious rendering errors .
Now barely a month later the nightly builds are already up to 87/100 and most of the rendering errors are fixed .
That 's a serious testament to their commitment to standards .
( Also , I have to say , it was quite difficult to find standards compliance bugs in WebKit to use in the test .
I had to go the extra mile to get WebKit to score low !
This was not the case with most of the other browsers . )
After baking it for several weeks , we have finally decided Acid3 is stable enough to announce it is ready .
We 'll be working on a guide and other commentary in the coming weeks and months , but it 'll take a while — Acid3 is far more complex than Acid2 was .
There were several announcements yesterday .
First :
The W3C finally got around to publishing one of the drafts of the HTML5 spec as a " first public working draft " ( a misnomer if ever there was one , given the history of HTML5 ) .
This is news for one reason and one reason only : it starts the W3C patent policy clock , which means that within a few months we will know if any of the browser vendors have patents they wish to use to block progress on the Web .
Still , a step forwards .
Second :
The syntax for Microsoft 's plans for yet another quirks mode switch in IE8 were announced .
Basically they are offering authors the option to pick a specific set of bugs , defaulting to IE7's .
The idea is that with each new major IE version , they can decide to simply freeze their last set of bugs forever .
If Web authors actually use this feature , and if IE does n't keep losing market share , then eventually this will cause serious problems for IE 's competitors — instead of just having to contend with reverse - engineering IE 's quirks mode and making the specs compatible with IE 's standards mode , the other browser vendors are going to have to reverse engineer every major IE browser version , and end up implementing these same bug modes themselves .
It might actually be quite an effective way of dramatically increasing the costs of entering or competing in the browser market .
( This is what we call " anti-competitive " , or " evil " . )
It will also increase the complexity of authoring by an order of magnitude .
Big sites will become locked in to particular IE version numbers , unable to upgrade their content for fear of it breaking .
Imagine in 18 years — only twice the current lifetime of the Web ! — designers will not have to learn just HTML , they 'll have to learn 4 , 5 , maybe 10 different versions of HTML , DOM , CSS , and JS , just to be able to maintain the various different pages that people have written , as they move from job to job .
I mentioned all this on public - html last April , pointing out that if Microsoft was really interested in not breaking the Web they would instead send technical comments on the HTML5 spec , explaining what exactly the spec requires that is incompatible with deployed content .
( Microsoft have yet to send any technical feedback on HTML5 at all , 8 months later . )
I 've been shocked to see several people in the industry supporting this move , including people whom I have met personally and whom I know know better , but I 'm in no position to criticise people who should have known better .
I 'm glad to see that at least people from Opera , from Mozilla ( continued ) , from Webkit , and even from the WaSP , and from the community as a whole ( if the comments on Slashdot and other sites are representative ) see this for what it is .
There are several directions we can go in from here .
We could prematurely claim that our pages want IE8's new quirks mode , which would likely cause pages to change rendering in IE8 as compared to IE7 .
However , that 's mostly a futile exercise , as either few people will do this , and it wo n't matter , or a lot of people will do this , and Microsoft will just change the syntax before IE8 comes out .
We could use the " edge " feature that is apparently being provided to always trigger the latest mode .
However , that would be even worse : if enough people use this feature , then Microsoft will feel compelled to just make " edge " equivalent to " IE8 " and introduce a new way to trigger the " latest " mode .
This is what happened with the original DOCTYPE - switched " standards mode " : many people wanted their pages to use the latest standards , but found that they ran into bugs in IE6 , so they worked around those bugs with hacks — which relied on simple parsing bugs — to pass content specifically to IE6 .
With IE7 , many of the simple parsing bugs that these hacks relied on were fixed , but the bigger underlying problems that the hacks were working around were n't .
The pages thus broke in IE7 .
Microsoft 's reaction was to make " standards mode " mean " IE7 " mode , and to introduce a new mode ( " IE8 " ) .
The same will happen if so many people use " edge " that a significant number of pages break in IE8 or IE9 .
We could encourage everyone to actually use this feature , but actually then we 're just contributing to making the syntax legitimate , and we end up fragmenting the Web , on Microsoft 's terms .
This is possibly the worst outcome .
Finally , we could just ignore the feature altogether , continuing to use JS compatibility libraries for the time being , the same way that everyone has been doing for years .
Authors would also have to support IE7 anyway , at least for the forseeable future , so it would n't be an additional cost .
This would make the experience on IE worse than on other browsers , but not so much worse as to turn users away from the sites themselves .
Microsoft would find themselves having to support a number of rendering modes that were not being used , which is not a cost - effective measure ; they would find their market share eroding , as customers switched to browsers that actually followed standards ; and they would find their developers still asking for standards compliance that was actually compliant to the specs and interoperable with other browsers .
Therefore I recommend not including the meta tag , or , if you are forced to include it , making sure it says " IE=7 " , even once IE8 ships .
This seems to me to be the best way to show your support for an open , interoperable Web on the long term .
It will be interesting to see whether IE8 really supports Acid2 , since that test page does n't include any of the special magic words being proposed here .
Will they hard - code the URI ?
Will they check every page against a fingerprint and if it matches the fingerprint of the Acid2 page , trigger the IE8 quirks mode instead of the IE7 quirks mode ?
Third :
Well , not really an announcement , but Sjoerd Visscher pointed out something that for some reason I had never heard of , and which nobody I have spoken to about it since has ever heard of : using document.createElement ( ) with the tag name of an unknown tag causes IE7's HTML parser to start parsing that tag differently .
This piece of information makes building an HTML5 compatibility shim for IE7 far easier than had previously been assumed .
This is probably the most noteworthy news of the day .
I do n't really know why I did n't know this before .

Forget about wussy force - feedback vests .
Compressed air is for wimps .
Real ( or stupid ) men want to be electrocuted .
The MindWire V5 hooks up to a games console ( PS2 , Gamecube , XBox , or PC ) and ties into the force - feedback signals .
Only instead of a vibration , you get zapped .
Based on muscle - toning exercise machines , the five electrodes stick to your skin and deliver a current every time you get shot , crash your car or otherwise fail in the game .
The V5 is battery powered , so electrocution is n't a risk , but for anyone except serious masochists , the jolt should be plenty shocking enough .
The setup , which will make you look something like the Borg with all the included wiring , costs £ 100 ( $ 200 ) .

The lack of concrete research has given rise to all kinds of theories , including a sudden drop in the use of hormone - replacement therapy by menopausal women after health warnings in 2002 , higher rates of depression among baby boomers or a simple statistical fluke .
At the moment , the prime suspect is the skyrocketing use  and abuse  of prescription drugs .
During the same five - year period included in the study , there was a staggering increase in the total number of drug overdoses , both intentional and accidental , like the one that recently killed the 28 - year - old actor Heath Ledger .
Illicit drugs also increase risky behaviors , C.D.C. officials point out , noting that users ’ rates of suicide can be 15 to 25 times as great as the general population .
Jeffrey Smith , a vigorous fisherman and hunter , began ordering prescription drugs like Ambien and Viagra over the Internet when he was in his late 40s and the prospect of growing older began to gnaw at him , said his daughter , Michelle Ray Smith , who appears on the television soap “ Guiding Light . ”
Five days before his 50th birthday , he sat in his S.U.V. in Bloomfield Hills , Mich. , letting carbon monoxide fill his car .
Linda Cronin was 43 and working in a gym when she gulped down a lethal dose of prescription drugs in her Denver apartment in 2006 , after battling eating disorders and depression for years .
Looking at the puzzling 28.8 percent rise in the suicide rate among women ages 50 to 54 , Andrew C. Leon , a professor of biostatistics in psychiatry at Cornell , suggested that a drop in the use of hormone replacement therapy after 2002 might be implicated .
It may be that without the therapy , more women fell into depression , Dr. Leon said , but he cautioned this was just speculation .
Despite the sharp rise in suicide among middle - aged women , the total number who died is still relatively small : 834 in the 50 - to - 54 - year - old category in 2004 .
Over all , four of five people who commit suicide are men .
( For men 45 to 54 , the five - year rate increase was 15.6 percent . )
Veterans are another vulnerable group .
Some surveys show they account for one in five suicides , said Dr. Ira Katz , who oversees mental health programs at the Department of Veterans Affairs .
That is why the agency joined the national toll - free suicide hot line last August .
“ So , let me guess , ahhhhxxxCCxxshheeecczzzahhhhem , ” started Mr. Thompson , Ed B ’s prospective boss , pausing to make the most vile power - snorting , throat - clearing , wet - cough noise ever heard .
“ You ’re Edward – cxxxxshxxx cxxxxcaaaheem – and you ’re here for a job interview ?
A harr harr harr ! ”
Ed forced a smile as Mr. Thompson half - laughed / half - coughed at the apparently funny joke : moments earlier , the receptionist called to say that Ed had arrived for the interview .
Before even sitting down , Ed knew he could never work in that office , for that man .
Thirty minutes before that moment , Ed was having a Fantastic Day : the weather was gorgeous and he was on his way to interview for a systems engineering position in the Parks & Recreation Department .
Ed did n’t hate his job – in fact , he loved working for The State – he just wanted a change of pace .
And the fact that he was allowed to interview for a new position was an honor in and of itself .
You see , when you work for The State , shifting from one department to another is not so easy a task .
First , there ’s form 753 - B , the Intent to Relocate Form , which must be signed by one ’s supervisor and his supervisor ’s supervisor .
After that , it ’s Form 88496.3 ( Job Competency Test Scheduling Form ) , Form 11 - A - 773M ( Authorization to Take Competency Test Form ) , Form 13 - B17 ( Test Cost Allocation Form ) , and finally – if you ’re lucky enough to score in the 90 % Percentile – Form 7973 - C , The Request for Application Form .
And once you have one of those , you can apply to apply for virtually any position listed on Charter 8 - 11N !
And that ’s exactly how Ed wound up standing in one of the most disgustingly dirty offices he ’d ever seen .
“ Go ahead , son , ” Mr. Thompson bellowed in a raspy tone , “ take a seat ! ”
Ed looked down at the chair to find a crumb - filled thirty - year - old cushion covered with a whole variety of stains of unthinkable origins .
He clenched his teeth and slowly sat down , surveying the filth that had taken over the cramped , little room .
A putrid stench emanated from the corner trash can , which was overflowing with Chinese takeout containers , soda cans , and wadded up tissues that must have accumulated over several months .
There was a mountain of cigarette butts and ashes burying a “ small ” ten - inch ash tray on the desk with a thin plume of smoke spiraling upward to the yellowed ceiling .
And the man behind the desk – a large , sweaty fellow who outgrew his shirt three sizes ago – did n’t seem to mind it one bit .
As tempted as Ed was to flee , he decided to give this opportunity the benefit of the doubt .
Fifteen minutes later , and especially after learning about the tedious nature of the day - to - day and the several - hour - long road trips he ’d have to take with the boss , Ed knew it was n’t the right job for him .
“ Whadd ’ya mean , ‘ it ’s not the right move ’ , ” Mr. Thompson shouted after Ed timidly declined , “ why would ’ya waste all my time – The State ’s time – if ya do n’t want a new job ? ”
Try as he might , Ed just could n’t get Mr. Thompson to understand that , while he did want a new job , traveling across the state each week was not a good fit for him and his family .
“ Well , Edward , cxxxxshxxx cxxxxcaaaheem , ” the interviewer balked , “ if you insist on wasting our time , then I expect you to sign Form 772 - L .
Here , take it ! ”
Ah , the dreaded Form 772 - L .
You see , when you work for The State and have a Form 7973 - C approved , you are expected to be willing to accept whatever job you apply to apply for .
It only makes sense : why apply for a job if you do n’t want it ?
Form 772 - L , also known as the Applied Job Declination Form , officially takes you off the Charter 1114S ( the Approved Hire List ) .
It takes a full six months before you ’re allowed to start the hiring process again .
“ Well , I ’d really rather not sign that , ” Ed nervously replied , “ I mean , that ’s only valid if we ’re given a signed offer , form eight - eighteen dash three ? ”
Ed was hoping for a miracle ; that Mr. Thompson would be all out of Form 818 - 3s and have to fill out an FRF ( Form Request Form ) , which could take months to process .
“ Oh so that ’s how you want to play it , Edward , ” Mr. Thompson bellowed , reaching for a pen , “ it takes me two seconds to sign this offer form .
You WILL sign the declination form ! ”
Ed panicked .
He had no idea what else to do and just got up and headed toward the door .
“ Hey , ahhheexxxmm , ” Mr. Thompson shouted , “ where do you think you ’re going ? ”
Ed picked up the pace and started down the hallway .
Mr. Thompson pounded his fists on the desk , overturning the monstrous ashtray .
“ You ca n’t leave ! ” he shouted as he got up to follow , “ the interview is not done ! ”
Ed started rushing towards the elevator with Mr. Thompson not far behind .
He pushed the elevator button and waited for an eternity .
“ You WILL sign the declination , ” Mr. Thompson said , gasping for air as he approached closer and closer , “ I will have you working here on Monday if you do n’t ! ”
The elevator finally opened and Ed rushed in .
He hit the ground floor button and watched Mr. Thompson struggle to make it before the doors closed .
The doors closed just in time allowing Ed to make his escape .
Fortunately , that was the last Ed had ever heard of Mr. Thompson .
It was the first and last time he had ever threatened to be hired against his will .
I ’d love to hear the background story behind this one :

Police freed 10 South Korean women from the brothel
Five people have been arrested and charged with offences including people trafficking and debt bondage .
Police said the women were lured to Australia and forced to work up to 20 hours a day in legal Sydney brothels .
They had agreed to work in the sex industry , but were deceived about conditions , police said .
" My understanding is that they came to Australia to work in the sex industry , but under more reasonable conditions , " Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Tim Morris said .

Once the women were in Australia , the syndicate took their passports , officials said .
" This is probably the largest alleged syndicate that we have smashed , " Immigration Department Assistant Secretary Lyn O'Connell said .
The five people arrested include a South Korean woman and a Korean - Australian woman , who police allege is the head of a syndicate that was making $ 2.8 m ( £ 1.4 m ) annually .
Government prosecutors said the evidence against the five includes six months of intercepted phone calls and Korean - language business documents , Reuters news agency reported .
Prostitution is legal in most of Australia but new slavery laws were introduced in 1999 to prevent vulnerable women being exploited .
A business owner near one of the brothels said it was staffed by Chinese , Japanese and Korean women and was always busy , says the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney .
At the weekends , vanloads of Asian men would descend on the premises , he says .

Rice was asked to respond to reports that her department offered immunity to Blackwater security guards involved in a shooting incident in Iraq last month .
In a statement to the secretary of state , Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman and Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden said that Rice should explain whether Blackwater security guards had been granted immunity from prosecution when the State Department investigated the shooting .
The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Blackwater guards gained the limited - use immunity during an inquiry by the State Department 's investigative arm , the Bureau of Diplomatic Security ( BDS ) .
Limited - use immunity , as officials told the newspaper , means that security guards were promised they would not be prosecuted for anything they said in their interviews with the authorities as long as their statements were true .
" Press reports today indicate that DS ( Department of State ) agents offered grants of immunity to Blackwater employees after the Sept. 16 shooting incident in Baghdad .
Are these reports accurate ? " Biden said .
" If so , who authorized these grants of immunity ?
Was there consultation with the Department of Justice prior to such grants of immunity ? "
Citing unidentified officials close to the BDS investigation , the report said that only prosecutors at the Justice Department have authority to grant such immunity , but they had no advance knowledge of the BDS arrangement .
The Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) took over the case on Oct. 3 and has since then begun to re-interview Blackwater employees without granting any immunity to assemble independent evidence of possible wrongdoing .
Some Blackwater guards refused to be interviewed by FBI investigators citing the BDS immunity promises , according to a report of the Washington Post .
However , Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd clarified in a Tuesday 's statement " any suggestion that the Blackwater employees in question have been given immunity from federal criminal prosecution is inaccurate . "
State Department spokesman Sean McCormack tried to distance Rice from the immunity scandal by saying she has steadfastly supported accountability for anyone involved in the Blackwater shootings found to have broken the law .
He noted that it was Rice who asked the FBI to take over the investigation from the BDS .
Blackwater is a major military contractor providing security services to the U.S. government in Iraq .
Its guards opened fire in a crowded Baghdad square when protecting a State Department convoy , killing as many as 17 Iraqi civilians .
Blackwater employees and other civilian contractors cannot be tried in U.S. military courts or in Iraqi courts and it is unclear what U.S. criminal laws might cover criminal acts committed in a war zone .
According to the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , a law issued by a former U.S. administrator in Iraq Paul Bremer , the " multinational forces , foreign liaison missions , their personnel , property , funds and all international consultants shall be immune from the Iraqi legal process . "
However , the enraged Iraqi government decided on Tuesday to revoke the immunity of foreign security firms from being prosecuted granted by the CPA .

Walt Mossberg has confirmed what AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega already hinted at CTIA : the iPhone will be 3G - capable " in 60 days . "
Mossberg said it 6:53 into this Beet.tv feature .
Knowing that it 's going to be one year after release , what De la Vega said , and the fact that Walt gets his mitts on the goods way before anyone else , it 's only logical to think he is right .
We will discover it around June 4 .

So now he 's insulting the military and their families , not to mention 70 % of Americans ?
Does McCain think that 's going to get him votes come November ?
Think Progress :
Speaking to reporters in Richmond , VA last night , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) attacked “ anyone ” who points out that he is “ fine ” with keeping U.S. troops in Iraq for 100 or more years .
“ Anyone who worries about how long we ’re in Iraq does not understand the military and does not understand war , ” said McCain .
He then added that it is “ really almost insulting to one ’s intelligence ” to question “ how long we ’re in Iraq ” because he believes the current “ strategy ” is “ succeeding . ”
Just once , I 'd like to hear McCain get confronted by this notion of the " surge succeeding " .
Are we to consider the deaths of 75 people and the 83 people reported injured on Sunday alone successful ?
How about the threat to disband Iraqi Parliament -- ostensibly the justification for the surge , to allow the government to establish itself by curtailing violence ?
Where 's the success , McCain ?
Not to put too fine a point on it , but there 's a lot here insulting our intelligence , but it is n't from questioning how long we should be in Iraq .
“ The general sentiment in Silicon Valley is that we ’re not yet there , but the reality is that we are , ” Mr. Swildens said .
“ It ’s already started . ”
The region feels as if it is on the cusp of a mood shift .
On the one hand , its denizens say they feel fortunate to be working in a segment of the economy and living in a region that has been hurt far less than other parts of the country .
They also express stubborn confidence in the inexorable shift to the Internet and the role that Valley technology companies will play in that transition .
And they assert that they are not feeling anything like the pain that followed the collapse of the dot - com bubble , which led to big job losses , an exodus of talent , a plunging commercial real estate market and a significant drop in investment in start - up companies .
But having assiduously clawed its way back from the dot - com bust , the Valley is again facing some tough conditions .
At the area ’s blue chip companies , stock performance has turned grim as growth has slowed .
Google ’s stock has fallen around 31 percent this year ; Apple is down 21 percent .
The Nasdaq composite , an index with a major technology focus , is down 11.4 percent this year .
Among the shares of venture - backed companies that went public in the last year , only 28 percent are above the offering price .
That compares with around 50 percent in a typical year and 70 percent in strong market conditions , according to the National Venture Capital Association .
New companies are hitting roadblocks on their way to the capital markets .
Upek , a company in Emeryville , Calif. , that makes computer chips and software used for fingerprint recognition , registered to go public last May .
It then began trying to drum up investor enthusiasm , and was making progress .
But on March 4 , it withdrew its registration .

On Wall Street “ there was suddenly no more appetite for growth companies , ” said Eric Buatois , a general partner in Sofinnova Ventures , an early - stage investment firm that backed the start - up .
Quietly , while Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama have been inspiring Democrats everywhere with their rolling bitchfest , congressional superduo Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi have completed one of the most awesome political collapses since Neville Chamberlain .
At long last , the Democratic leaders of Congress have publicly surrendered on the Iraq War , just one year after being swept into power with a firm mandate to end it .
Solidifying his reputation as one of the biggest pussies in U.S. political history , Reid explained his decision to refocus his party 's energies on topics other than ending the war by saying he just could n't fit Iraq into his busy schedule .
" We have the presidential election , " Reid said recently .
" Our time is really squeezed . "
There was much public shedding of tears among the Democratic leadership , as Reid , Pelosi and other congressional heavyweights expressed deep sadness that their valiant charge up the hill of change had been thwarted by circumstances beyond their control — that , as much as they would love to continue trying to end the catastrophic Iraq deal , they would now have to wait until , oh , 2009 to try again .
" We 'll have a new president , " said Pelosi .
" And I do think at that time we 'll take a fresh look at it . "
Pelosi seemed especially broken up about having to surrender on Iraq , sounding like an NFL coach in a postgame presser , trying with a straight face to explain why he punted on first - and - goal .
" We just did n't have any plays we liked down there , " said the coach of the 0 - 15 Dems .
" Sometimes you just have to play the field - position game .... "
In reality , though , Pelosi and the Democrats were actually engaged in some serious point - shaving .
Working behind the scenes , the Democrats have systematically taken over the anti-war movement , packing the nation 's leading group with party consultants more interested in attacking the GOP than ending the war .
" Our focus is on the Republicans , " one Democratic apparatchik in charge of the anti-war coalition declared .
" How can we juice up attacks on them ? "
The story of how the Democrats finally betrayed the voters who handed them both houses of Congress a year ago is a depressing preview of what 's to come if they win the White House .
And if we do n't pay attention to this sorry tale now , while there 's still time to change our minds about whom to nominate , we might be stuck with this same bunch of spineless creeps for four more years .
With no one but ourselves to blame .
The controversy over the Democratic " strategy " to end the war basically comes down to whom you believe .
According to the Reid - Pelosi version of history , the Democrats tried hard to force President Bush 's hand by repeatedly attempting to tie funding for the war to a scheduled withdrawal .
Last spring they tried to get him to eat a timeline and failed to get the votes to override a presidential veto .
Then they retreated and gave Bush his money , with the aim of trying again after the summer to convince a sufficient number of Republicans to cross the aisle in support of a timeline .
But in September , Gen. David Petraeus reported that Bush 's " surge " in Iraq was working , giving Republicans who might otherwise have flipped sufficient cover to continue supporting the war .
The Democrats had no choice , the legend goes , but to wait until 2009 , in the hopes that things would be different under a Democratic president .
Democrats insist that the reason they can't cut off the money for the war , despite their majority in both houses , is purely political .
" George Bush would be on TV every five minutes saying that the Democrats betrayed the troops , " says Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont .
Then he glumly adds another reason .
" Also , it just was n't going to happen . "
Why it " just was n't going to happen " is the controversy .
In and around the halls of Congress , the notion that the Democrats made a sincere effort to end the war meets with , at best , derisive laughter .
Though few congressional aides would think of saying so on the record , in private many dismiss their party 's lame anti-war effort as an absurd dog- and - pony show , a calculated attempt to score political points without ever being serious about bringing the troops home .
" Yeah , the amount of expletives that flew in our office alone was unbelievable , " says an aide to one staunchly anti-war House member .
" It was all about the public show .
Reid and Pelosi would say they were taking this tough stand against Bush , but if you actually looked at what they were sending to a vote , it was like Swiss cheese .
Full of holes . "
In the House , some seventy Democrats joined the Out of Iraq caucus and repeatedly butted heads with Reid and Pelosi , arguing passionately for tougher measures to end the war .
The fight left some caucus members bitter about the party 's failure .
Rep. Barbara Lee of California was one of the first to submit an amendment to cut off funding unless it was tied to an immediate withdrawal .
" I could n't even get it through the Rules Committee in the spring , " Lee says .
Rep. Lynn Woolsey , a fellow caucus member , says Democrats should have refused from the beginning to approve any funding that was n't tied to a withdrawal .
" If we 'd been bold the minute we got control of the House — and that 's why we got the majority , because the people of this country wanted us out of Iraq — if we 'd been bold , even if we lost the votes , we would have gained our voice . "
An honest attempt to end the war , say Democrats like Woolsey and Lee , would have involved forcing Bush to execute his veto and allowing the Republicans to filibuster all they wanted .
Force a showdown , in other words , and use any means necessary to get the bloodshed ended .
" Can you imagine Tom DeLay and Denny Hastert taking no for an answer the way Reid and Pelosi did on Iraq ? " asks the House aide in the expletive - filled office .
" They 'd find a way to get the votes .
They 'd get it done somehow . "
But any suggestion that the Democrats had an obligation to fight this good fight infuriates the bund of hedging careerists in charge of the party .
In fact , nothing sums up the current Democratic leadership better than its vitriolic criticisms of those recalcitrant party members who insist on interpreting their 2006 mandate as a command to actually end the war .
Rep. David Obey , chair of the House Appropriations Committee and a key Pelosi - Reid ally , lambasted anti-war Democrats who " did n't want to get specks on those white robes of theirs . "
Obey even berated a soldier 's mother who begged him to cut off funds for the war , accusing her and her friends of " smoking something illegal . "
Rather than use the vast power they had to end the war , Democrats devoted their energy to making sure that " anti-war activism " became synonymous with " electing Democrats . "
Capitalizing on America 's desire to end the war , they hijacked the anti-war movement itself , filling the ranks of peace groups with loyal party hacks .
Anti-war organizations essentially became a political tool for the Democrats — one operated from inside the Beltway and devoted primarily to targeting Republicans .
This supposedly grass - roots " anti-war coalition " met regularly on K Street , the very capital of top - down Beltway politics .
At the forefront of the groups are Thomas Matzzie and Brad Woodhouse of Americans Against the Escalation in Iraq , the leader of the anti-war lobby .
Along with other K Street crusaders , the two have received iconic treatment from The Washington Post and The New York Times , both of which depicted the anti-war warriors as young idealist - progressives in shirtsleeves , riding a mirthful spirit into political combat — changing the world is fun !
But what exactly are these young idealists campaigning for ?
At its most recent meeting , the group eerily echoed the Reid - Pelosi " squeezed for time " mantra : Retreat from any attempt to end the war and focus on electing Democrats .
" There was a lot of agreement that we can draw distinctions between anti-war Democrats and pro-war Republicans , " a spokeswoman for Americans Against the Escalation in Iraq announced .
What the Post and the Times failed to note is that much of the anti-war group 's leadership hails from a consulting firm called Hildebrand Tewes — whose partners , Steve Hildebrand and Paul Tewes , served as staffers for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ( DSCC ) .
In addition , these anti-war leaders continue to consult for many of the same U.S. senators whom they need to pressure in order to end the war .
This is the kind of conflict of interest that would normally be an embarrassment in the activist community .
Worst of all is the case of Woodhouse , who came to Hildebrand Tewes after years of working as the chief mouthpiece for the DSCC , where he campaigned actively to re-elect Democratic senators who supported the Iraq War in the first place .
Anyone bothering to look — and clearly the Post and the Times did not before penning their ardent bios of Woodhouse — would have found the youthful idealist bragging to newspapers before the Iraq invasion about the pro-war credentials of North Carolina candidate Erskine Bowles .
" No one has been stronger in this race in supporting President Bush in the War on Terror and his efforts to effect a regime change in Iraq , " boasted the future " anti-war " activist Woodhouse .
With guys like this in charge of the anti-war movement , much of what has passed for peace activism in the past year was little more than a thinly veiled scheme to use popular discontent over the war to unseat vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2008 .
David Sirota , a former congressional staffer whose new book , The Uprising , excoriates the Democrats for their failure to end the war , expresses disgust at the strategy of targeting only Republicans .
" The whole idea is based on this insane fiction that there is no such thing as a pro-war Democrat , " he says .
" Their strategy allows Democrats to take credit for being against the war without doing anything to stop it .
It 's crazy . "
Justin Raimondo , the uncompromising editorial director of Antiwar.com , regrets contributing twenty dollars to Americans Against the Escalation in Iraq .
" Not only did they use it to target Republicans , " he says , " they went after the ones who were on the fence about Iraq . "
The most notorious case involved Lincoln Chafee , a moderate from Rhode Island who lost his Senate seat in 2006 .
Since then , Chafee has taken shots at Democrats like Reid , Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer , all of whom campaigned against him despite having voted for the war themselves .
" Look , I understand partisan politics , " says Chafee , who now concedes that voters were correct to punish him for his war vote .
" I just find it amusing that those who helped get us into this mess now say we need to change the Senate — because we 're in a mess . "
The really tragic thing about the Democratic surrender on Iraq is that it's now all but guaranteed that the war will be off the table during the presidential campaign .
Once again — it happened in 2002 , 2004 and 2006 — the Democrats have essentially decided to rely on the voters to give them credit for being anti-war , despite the fact that , for all the noise they 've made to the contrary , in the end they 've done nothing but vote for war and cough up every dime they 've been asked to give , every step of the way .
Even beyond the war , the Democrats have repeatedly gone limp - dick every time the Bush administration so much as raises its voice .
Most recently , twelve Democrats crossed the aisle to grant immunity to phone companies who participated in Bush 's notorious wiretapping program .
Before that , Democrats caved in and confirmed Mike Mukasey as attorney general after he kept his middle finger extended and refused to condemn waterboarding as torture .
Democrats fattened by Wall Street also got cold feet about upsetting the country 's gazillionaires , refusing to close a tax loophole that rewarded hedge - fund managers with a tax rate less than half that paid by ordinary citizens .
But the war is where they showed their real mettle .
Before the 2006 elections , Democrats told us we could expect more specifics on their war plans after Election Day .
Nearly two years have passed since then , and now they are once again telling us to wait until after an election to see real action to stop the war .
In the meantime , of course , we 're to remember that they 're the good guys , the Republicans are the real enemy , and , well , go Hillary !
Semper fi !
Yay , team !
How much of this bullshit are we going to take ?
How long are we supposed to give the Reids and Pelosis and Hillarys of the world credit for wanting , deep down in their moldy hearts , to do the right thing ?
Look , fuck your hearts , OK ?
Just get it done .
Because if you do n't , sooner or later this con is going to run dry .
It may not be in ' 08 , but it 'll be soon .
Even Americans can't be fooled forever .

Obama : America ' has to talk to its enemies '

Print This Email This Clinton says Obama supporter could n't name single accomplishment on TV ; Crowd boos comment about plagiarism As the Democratic CNN / Univision debate kicked off Thursday night , Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) and Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) faced off over Cuba , with Obama reiterating his position that America " has to talk with its enemies , " with Clinton holding to an earlier position that no president should meet with Cuba 's new leader unless conditions are met .
" I would not meet with him until change has happened , " Clinton said , with regard to Cuba 's new leader , Raul Castro .
" I believe we should have full diplomatic engagement where appropriate but a presidential visit should ... not be offered unless " conditions are met .
Obama said he'd be willing to meet with the new leader in Cuba , presumably Castro 's brother , Raul Castro .
" I would meet without preconditions , though senator Clinton is right there has to be preparation . "
America " has to talk to its enemies , " Obama said to applause .
Obama continued extolling his message of change : " Washington is the place where good ideas go to die .
I 'm running because I want America to be as good as its promise . "
He also quietly tried to link himself to former President John F. Kennedy , quoting the fallen president : " Let us never negotiate out of fear , but let us never fear to negotiate . "
Both candidates made routine attacks on President George W. Bush .
By thirty minutes into the debate , Clinton had mentioned Bush by name three times and alluded to him in a fourth remark .
" I want to end George Bush 's war on science , " Clinton said to applause .
CNN moderator John King noted Sen. Clinton supported a border fence in the Senate along the Mexican border , and asked her directly if she would support completing the fence .
She declined to answer directly .
" Well , you know , both Senator Obama and I voted for that , " she said .
" There may be places where this is appropriate .
I think when both of us voted for it , there is a [ place ] where it would make sense . "
" I would have a review , " she added .
" I would listen to the people that live along the border . "
" This is an area where Senator Clinton and I completely agree , " Obama replied , when asked for his response .
" There may be some areas where it may be [ suitable ] to have some fencing . "
The moderator did not note that Obama voted for the proposed 700 - mile fence in the Senate .
Crowd boos Clinton quip on plagiarism CNN 's moderator also tried to get Sen.
Clinton to attack Obama , asking her if she thought he was " all hat and no cattle . "
Clinton did n't take the bait .
" There are differences between us , " she said .
" I do offer solutions .
That 's what I believe in and what I have done ...
Working to get kids healthcare , working to expand legal services for the poor , working to register voters . "
" I have to confess I was somewhat amused the other night when on one of the TV shows someone was asked to name an accomplishment of Senator Obama and he could n't , " she continued .
" Actions , " she added , " speak louder than words . "
Obama agreed .
He noted that he'd been endorsed by every major paper in Texas .
CNN moderator Campbell Brown asked Obama about an alleged plagiarism charge , where he used language similar to Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick .
" The notion that I had plagiarized from one of my national co-chairs who gave me the line and suggested that I use it is silly , " he replied .
" This is where we start to get into silly season in politics and I think people start getting discouraged about it . "
The Illinois senator , smiling , went on to praise his own speeches .
" And I gotta admit , some of them are pretty good , " he said .
Brown asked Clinton : ' Senator Clinton , is it the silly season ? "
" If your campaign is going to be about words , then they should be about words , " Clinton said .
" Lifting whole passages is not change you can believe in , its change you can Xerox . "
Obama interrupted , saying , " That 's not what happened . "
The crowd booed .
Soon thereafter , the junior New York senator reiterated her differences with Obama on health care .
Clinton seeks to require every American to have health care coverage .
" I am tired of health care companies deciding who will live and die in America , " she said .
' Experience to be commander in chief '
Questioned about his ability to be commander - in - chief , Obama found a way to turn the tables on Clinton .
" What I believe on the single most important policy decision of this generation ...
I believe I showed the judgment of a commander in chief , " he said , referring to his stated opposition , before being elected to the senate , to give President Bush the authority to send troops into Iraq , " and I think Sen. Clinton was wrong on that .
That has significant consequences because it has diverted attention from Afghanistan . "
In closing , both candidates focused on their similarities , saying whoever the Democratic nominee was , the party would come together strong and win the election .
" I have no doubt that the Democratic party as its best can summon a sense of common purpose , a higher purpose " Obama said .
The American people " want their government back and that 's what I intend to provide them . "
Asked what was his most formative and trying experience , Obama noted his background .
" Learning to take responsibility for my own actions ... working as a community organizer on the streets of Chicago ... then working as a civil rights attorney and rejecting a job on Wall Street to fight for people who'd been discriminated against on the job ...
It 's the reason that I 'm determined to get a government that is worthy of their decency and their generosity . "
In her response , Clinton focused on the challenges of working Americans .
" Well I think everybody here knows I 've lived through some crises and some challenging moments in my life , " Clinton said to laughter from the crowd .
" And I am grateful for the support and the prayers of countless Americans .
But people often ask me , how do you do it , how to do you keep going , and I just have to shake my head in wonderment ... they are nothing [ compared to that ] which have happened in the lives of Americans today . "
Clinton focused on others , saying she 'd been " blessed " and called by " faith . "
" That 's what gets me up in the morning , " she added .
" That 's what motivates me .
No matter what happens in this contest .
And I am honored , I am honored to be here with Barack Obama .
I am absolutely honored .
Whatever happens , we 're gonna be fine .
We have strong support from our families and our friends .
I just hope that we 'll be able to say the same thing about the American people , and that 's what this election should be about . "

( Editor 's note : Article originally erroneously referred to Obama 's voting against the Iraq resolution , which was before his November , 2004 election to the senate )
What a ding - dong I am !
For months - nay , years ! -
I 've been ranting about how screwed up the war in Iraq has been , and how disastrous have been its consequences .
What a fool I 've been !
In reality , it 's actually turned out pretty great .
That 's what I learned when I read William Kristol 's recent New York Times piece , " The Democrats ' Fairy Tale " .
In a stroke of thoughtfulness , generosity and uncanny prescience , the Times was kind enough recently to hire Kristol to write a regular column for their op - ed page .
I guess that 's because Ariel Sharon was unavailable and David Duke was on vacation .
And bless his little heart , Kristol knows a thing or two about a thing or two .
Heck , he 's the one who got us into Iraq in the first place !
He 's been telling us for a long time what a cool thing it would be to knock over that tin-pot Saddam Hussein crank , and damned if he did n't convince the president to do it , despite Bush 's decades of foreign policy experience .
But it 's been a rough couple of years for Ol ' Bill , ' cause the whole damn country went into some sort of narcoleptic , apoplectic , pathogenic tizzy about the war , crying fickle and foul at every turn and seeming like all everyone wanted was to end the darned thing .
Imagine that .
What a bunch of whiney little self - interested twits , squealing like a continent full of Europeans , and utterly failing to see the great wisdom of Young William 's Grand Adventure In Mesopotamia .
It 's really quite nauseating , is n't it ?
In his article , Kristol really rips the Democrats , and do n't they ever deserve it .
Now that Iraq appears to be marginally more peaceful than it was last year at this time , Kristol is angry because , as he puts it : " It 's apparently impermissible for leading Democrats to acknowledge - let alone celebrate - progress in Iraq " .
Bill is angry because the Democrats ( and the public - but , oddly , he does n't mention that part ) still want to end the war - even though it 's been a huge success !
They should " celebrate " it instead !
Fortunately , he is clever enough to suss out the real reason for this childish intransigence .
It 's not , as Hillary put it , because the Iraqis know the Democrats will shut off the supply valve of endless wasted dollars and soon - to - be casualties headed to Baghdad .
As Kristol notes , " That is truly a fairy tale .
And it is driven by a refusal to admit real success because that success has been achieved under the leadership of ... George W. Bush .
The horror ! "
I must admit I 've suffered from some of the same confusion as the Dumb Dems , whom I think we can all agree are simply hopelessly naive pacifists intent on allowing our country to be taken over by Very Bad People ( of less than fully white complexion ) who mean us harm .
You know the type I mean , like George McGovern , who flew all those bombing missions during World War II while Little Bush , Cheney , Ashcroft , Kristol and the rest fought ... valiantly ... in ... Viet ... oh , never mind .
Anyhow , that hopeless and dangerous idealism is why , just one year before the Iraq war , every single Democrat in the Congress opposed the invasion of Afghanistan except for ... well , except for ... every single Democrat in Congress other than one .
Okay , never mind on that one too .
Look , let 's get down to brass tacks here .
Kristol just gets it .
The rest of us do n't .
He realizes that in the grand scheme of things - " World War IV " as his pappy likes to call it - what 's important is not the big picture , but the very narrowest .
You may think , for example , that promulgating egregious lies in order to shove your way into am Iraq war that no one else wants is stupid and counterproductive , damaging the credibility and interests of the United States , and probably accounting for the lack of allied support in a more credible war in Afghanistan .
But Bill Kristol knows better .
You may think that fighting a war that massively drains military , diplomatic and financial resources away from the real enemies of the country in order to pursue a pet project that has nothing to do with those genuine threats would be idiotic and suicidal .
But that 's ' cause you 're not as smart as William Kristol .
You might believe that it was a ludicrous waste of blood and treasure to kill 4,000 Americans and one million Iraqis , while borrowing and spending a trillion bucks ( fast going up to two ) in order to invade a country that had neither attacked us nor threatened us .
And that doing so was an extremely poor choice of resource allocation , especially when we have tens of millions of children doing without healthcare in this country .
But if you were a clever neoconservative like Bill Kristol , you 'd know better .
You might think that wrecking our military and compromising American security over a non-problem - indeed , a problem that people like Bushes and Cheneys and Rumsfelds and Reagans once very much created and encouraged - would be a stupid choice of priorities .
But that 's only because you do n't have the foreign policy insight of someone like Bill Kristol .
And let me guess - I bet you also think that launching a war that brings chaos to a vital and volatile area , and that massively increases the power of an Iran run by radical theocrats was a really , really dumb idea .
But if you were Bill Kristol , you 'd realize that all we need is a third war against an Islamic country , and we can clean up the whole mess all at once !
Or maybe you 're like all those American intelligence agencies , who collectively reported last year that the Iraq war was actually creating anti-American terrorists rather than eradicating them .
But if you were as smart as Mr. Bill and his Kristol Ball , you 'd know that they 're all just a bunch of long - haired and bearded blame - America - first left - wing Berkeley rejects running covert ops for the CIA , NSA and other intelligence agencies .
Of course they 're going to diss the war !
It 's going well , and those unpatriotic spooks can't stand that because they hate America !

Maybe you 're angry because you think the same American soldiers whom people like George W. Bush are always hiding behind should actually have adequate armor to fight the war they 've been thrust into , rather than their families having to hold bake sales to buy it for them .
And maybe you also think they should be treated a wee bit better than they have been at Walter Reed ( and far beyond ) when they come home wounded , or they have to fight harder than in Anbar to get the benefits owed to them out of the military .
But what Bill Kristol knows is that you can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs !
So lighten up on that whole concern - for - the - troops thing already .
( Unless you 're the president doing a photo - op , of course . )
Do n't tell me you 're chagrined at the idea that American forces may be in Iraq for another decade , or even for a full " generation " .
Probably that 's just because you or someone you know might have to go fight there .
People like Kristol never do , of course , so why should he worry ?
Are you angry that well - connected cronies and corporations got rich off this war ?
That eight billion dollars in cash went completely missing in Iraq ?
That multi-billion dollar no - bid contracts got paid out for jobs never done ?
That American soldiers worked and bled and died for peanuts alongside mercenaries making four times as much salary ?
That we will be paying for this war in interest on loans and expensive treatment of the wounded for generations to come ?
Yeah ?
Well Bill Kristol thinks you should get your priorities straight !
Have you somehow come to the conclusion that turning one - fifth of Iraq 's 25 million people into either corpses or refugees has n't exactly been a great liberating service to that country ?
You know , sorta like when we told them to rise up but then stood by and watched Saddam mow them down .
Or when we turned a blind eye to Saddam 's use of chemical weapons against his own people , and even protected him from condemnation for those crimes at the UN ?
Bill Kristol thinks that 's because you just do n't know the true value of freedom and democracy .
Oh , and you put too much emphasis on that whole not - getting - killed thing .
Are you one of those whiney liberals who believe that this war - whether one supported the idea of it originally or not - has been ridiculously mishandled from the beginning ?
That there were never enough troops sent in ?
That allowing rampant looting was stupid ?
That failing to have plans for the occupation of a country of 25 million people constitutes criminal negligence ?
That firing the Iraqi army was just as idiotic as sending thousands of armed and angry men home unemployed sounds like it would be ?
That purging the national government and infrastructure of all Baath Party members was a prescription for chaos ?
That allowing civil war between Sunni and Shiite was disastrous ?
Yeah , well , Bill Kristol knows better .
He understands that what 's really important is that the massive levels of violence and pandemonium of these last FIVE years ( count 'em ) are now possibly slightly lower than the outrageous levels they 've long been at , and could conceivably stay that way .
Ca n't you see the small picture here ?
Kristol can .
I guess that 's why he has a New York Times column and you do n't .
I guess that 's why the president listens to his advice and not yours .
Who could blame him for being angry and vituperative toward dangerously silly Democrats who do n't see the peril facing our civilization ?
Such quibblers !
So what if the war was sold on completely fabricated lies , was supposed to be a cakewalk but has now lasted longer than World War II , has divided the country and made the world hate us , has squandered our ( borrowed ) resources and broken our military , has brought instability to a volatile and crucial region and allowed a real national antagonist to double its power , has diverted our resources from the still - uncaptured guy who supposedly attacked us on 9/11 , has become a factory for producing anti-American terrorists , has wiped out over a million innocent people and turned more than four million into refugees ?
So what if this war has now supposedly been ' saved ' by precisely the same strategy that was vehemently rejected by the same people in the beginning ?
Let 's keep our priorities straight here , people .
All that really matters is that we 've seen a possible slight improvement in levels of violence in Iraq over the last couple of months ( all of which may be due to a host of possible factors , including that there are n't many people left alive to fight there anymore ) .
Get it ?
Some people think that burning down your neighbor 's house and having your own catch fire as a result is a highly stupid and really criminal thing to do .
What neocons like Bill Kristol understand , though - and what naive liberals will never get - is that what really matters is whether you can slightly diminish the rate at which the flames consume those dwellings , five years after starting the fire .
That 's what 's genuinely important - not the ashes where the houses once stood .
If you understood that simple principle , you would n't be complaining about this war so much .
Rather , you 'd be " celebrating " how well it 's going .
If you understood this logic , you 'd have supported the war from the very beginning , as William Kristol did .
( Which of course has nothing to do with his apparent defensiveness about it today , we can all rest assured . )
In fact , if you were as smart as Bill Kristol and the other fine folks who brought you the invasion of Iraq , you 'd quit with all your smug complaints , once and for all .
And you 'd realize what a great freakin ' war this really is !

Vote count under way in Zimbabwe
The counting process is likely to take several days
Counting the votes
Vote counting is under way in Zimbabwe , with the main opposition MDC claiming it is winning the battle to oust President Robert Mugabe .
The MDC said it was ahead in most constituencies but continues to fear the vote will be rigged .
Results may not be finalised for some days and the government warned the MDC not to declare an early victory .
Mr Mugabe is battling the MDC's Morgan Tsvangirai and independent Simba Makoni for president .
The Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) said early results showed it had won the poll .
" We have won this election , " said its secretary general Tendai Biti early on Sunday .
" This trend is irreversible . "
He [ Mugabe ] is going to get the shock of his life because they are not voting for him .
Mugabe will be out by Monday night
Bomba Zimbo , Harare
Zimbabwe votes :
At a glance Election day :
In quotes He said early results posted at polling stations showed Mr Tsvangirai would win 66 % in Harare .
But BBC Southern Africa correspondent Peter Biles says the MDC is working on the basis of partial , unofficial results .
President Mugabe and his ruling Zanu PF have always had majority support in the countryside , our correspondent says , and the rural areas may decide the outcome of the elections .
Mr Biti also claimed the MDC was making inroads in the rural areas , including Mr Mugabe 's home province of Mashonaland West .
Mr Mugabe blames Zimbabwe 's problems on a Western plot
Robert Mugabe Zimbabwean Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu accused Mr Biti and the MDC of " speculation and lies " and " causing unnecessary havoc " .
The state - run Sunday Mail quoted the ministry 's secretary , George Charamba , as saying that if Mr Tsvangirai declared himself president " it is called a coup d'etat and we all know how coups are handled " .
Mr Biti said the MDC was just " protecting its vote " and would not make the " mistake " of the 2002 and 2005 elections when it did not claim victory .
Rigging fears
Before the election , state - run media predicted Mr Mugabe would win 57 % .
A candidate needs 51 % in the presidential vote to avoid a run-off .
Morgan Tsvangirai said he was confident of victory
Morgan Tsvangirai
The MDC has repeatedly expressed fears the election would be rigged .
Across the country on Saturday , there were reports of voters not being allowed to cast ballots - either because their names were not on the voters ' roll or because they were trying to vote in the wrong ward .
A presidential decree ahead of the elections had permitted police to go into polling stations , ostensibly to help illiterate voters .
The opposition feared many voters would be intimidated and stay at home .
Pan -African Parliament observers have also written to the electoral commission , saying that more than 8,450 voters had been registered on a patch of deserted land in Harare .

In pictures : Zimbabwe votes Q&A : Zimbabwe elections Most Western observers were banned from the election .
Some voters told the BBC they had been turned away but others that the system had worked efficiently and the atmosphere was good .
After voting in Harare , Mr Mugabe dismissed concerns of vote - rigging , saying : " We do n't rig elections .
I cannot sleep with my conscience if I have rigged . "
President Mugabe , in power since 1980 and seeking a sixth term , said of his chances : " This time around , like the last time , very good ... we will succeed and we will conquer . "
Of the possibility of a second round , he said : " We are not used to boxing matches where we go from round one to round two .
We just knock each other out . "
Inflation Mr Mugabe 's rivals were also confident .
Mr Tsvangirai said : " Victory is assured in spite of the regime 's attempt to subvert the will of the people . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
The elections will no doubt be free and fair .
The allegations being peddled are unfounded and based on hearsay Sosten Musiniwa , Harare The MDC says it is fighting to save Zimbabwe 's economy .
The country has the world 's highest inflation rate , at more than 100,000 % , and just one adult in five is believed to have a regular job .
The chiefs of Zimbabwe 's police , army prison service and intelligence services warned on Friday that violence after the polls would not be tolerated .

TechDirt
TechDirt is one of the first blogs I read consistently online , and it has come a long way in both design and content .
It is n’t as edgy as TechCrunch , and so I use this site as my “ meat and potatoes ” of online information , with the more sensationalist TechCrunch being the “ dessert ” .

More “ Web 2.0 ” information with Read / WriteWeb , but this one for me fits between TechCrunch and TechDirt .
They do n’t cover the legal stuff that TechDirt does , and they are n’t as sensationalist as TechCrunch , but they still run the gamut .
It is a great site with plenty of amazing reviews , news , and opinions .
They even sometimes publish stories before TechCrunch , and being first , especially in the topics they cover , is important , and impressive .
The other great things about this site , no “ Tech ” in the title , and they have some great opinions on society mixed in with their witty content .

I ’m not sure who will find this interesting .
This is an AI analysis of a ten year old videogame .
This entire endeavor will sound absurd to people familiar with the game in question , and hopelessly esoteric to those that are n’t .
Still , I ’m putting this up in case there is someone else out there who is just as peculiar as I am , in that I find this sort of thing intensely compelling .
About a month ago I wrote a Starcraft scenario which allowed you to observe a game between AI players .
I ’ve been curious about the quirks in the Starcraft AI and I ’ve wanted a chance to see them do their thing in a deterministic environment .
I learned some surprising things about this ten - year - old gem .
While the races themselves are very nearly balanced in the hands of humans , it turns out the AI is a lot better at using some races compared to others .
This is a very pixelated map of The Hunters .
The map has eight starting locations , marked by the colored squares .
Players are randomly placed on the map , with one random spot left empty .
The setup is this : Seven AI players .
Randomized start locations .
Using the Broodwar expansion .
The last “ player ” is the human observer , who controls no units but who can see the entire map .
The script in question runs on the map “ The Hunters ” , although it could easily be exported to other maps .
There are two Protoss players , two Zerg players , and three Terran Players .
The computer players are all set to “ insane ” level difficulty , informed that all other players are their enemy , and told to go at it .
Mayhem ensues .
I ’d usually let the game run overnight and check on the results in the morning .
( Yes !
This was my solution for being too busy to play computer games , I programmed a game to play itself for me ! )
A game normally takes a couple of hours , although rarely one will end in an hour , and several became endless stalemates .
At first I just set the difficulty to “ normal ” , but I found that the computer players were far too likely to consume all the resources on the map , go broke , and then just sit there .
I ’d start a game before going to bed , and when I came back in the morning I ’d find the battle was down to three sides who could n’t make any fighting units .
I changed the difficulty to “ Insane ” , which auto - cheats by giving itself 2,000 minerals and gas anytime it goes broke , meaning the thing is always rolling in resources .
This made sure that most battles came to a proper conclusion .
Although this made battles larger , more spectacular , and a little more chaotic , it did n’t seem to affect who won .
I ran many overnight battles with both AI setups , and while higher difficulty made for inflated scores , over many games the results painted a clear picture .
A note about the AI difficulty settings .
Skip to the end if you just want to read about how it turned out .
I dislike this auto - cheat for a number of reasons , mostly because it negates a lot of the strategy in the game .
None of the players can go broke , but the AI still plays as though resources were important .
The only true way to knock a player out of the game is to annihilate their core base with all the critical buildings in it .
Expansion bases are ( mostly ) worthless in a game like this .
Yet the computer still builds and defends expansions ( because that ’s what it ’s programmed to do ) and still wastes time attacking enemy expansion bases .
This introduces a bit of luck into the game :
Who wins depends a lot on positioning .
The AI tends to attack the nearest base , not the most important one .
Sometimes the nearest base is the core base .
Sometimes the nearest is an expansion which is pointlessly destroyed and rebuilt over and over again .
Like I said , in the long run it did n’t really change the fact that one race continually came out on top .
Without the unpredictable actions of a human involved in the match , the AI fights like clockwork .
Games have a perceptible rhythm to them .
They all build their first couple of buildings within a few seconds of each other .
Even these variations are probably the result of minor changes in the layout of each base .
If the bases were somehow shaped the same , the players would probably all build in perfect unison .
They build an initial attack force .
On insane difficulty this attack force is huge – probably sixteen or so zealots or the given race equivalent .
On normal difficulty the force is smaller , but the behavior is the same .
They all leave the base at about the same time , and ( as far as I can tell ) attack a foe totally at random .
Sometimes this foe will be a neighbor , and sometimes it will be someone all the way across the map .
This is the most chaotic and unpredictable part of the game , and it ’s basically a crapshoot .
Usually one or two players get taken out .
Nobody has any defenses at this point , so when an enemy comes knocking , their survival is a matter of luck :
The defender has an attack force elsewhere on the map .
Is that force still intact , and can it be recalled before the place is destroyed ?
Are there enough of them left to save the place ?
A player can also do really well if they are attacked by two people at exactly the same time – the attackers end up wiping each other out and leaving the buildings alone .
The AI seems to wait until this initial attack force is nearly all dead before entering the next phase :
It builds defenses and another attack force .
Again , this force is sent out .
Once gone , the AI begins trying to build its first expansion base .
The rest of the game is a series of escalating attack waves .
As they add more buildings onto their main base they work their way up to air units , and this is where you start seeing some differences in how well the computer handles the different races .
If you ’ve never played Starcraft , you ’re probably not even bothering to read this , but just in case :
The Zerg are a bug - like race .
Think H. R. Giger Aliens or Starship Trooper aliens .
Their units are usually cheap , plentiful , and weak .
They are made to be mass - produced and sent to their deaths .
The Protoss are highly advanced aliens with lots of fancy technology .
Their units are very expensive but very durable .
Their units are usually less numerous .
Their shield technology encourages you to try and make sure they survive a battle so you can recharge their shields and send them off to fight again .
They are not intended to be disposable units .
The Terrans are the humans and fall somewhere between these two extremes in terms of cost vs. unit lifespan .
It ’s actually far more complex than this , but that ’s the general , high - level , broad , big - picture overview .
Volumes have been written on these three races and we ca n’t begin to cover it all here .
Just remember : Zerg = cheap and weak , Protoss = expensive and tough , Terrans = Somewhere in - between .
I expected the AI to excel at using the Zerg , since their intended usage fits nicely with how the computer behaves :
Churn out masses of units and fling them at the enemy without regard to casualties .
I expected Protoss to be the worst , since the send - them - to - die policy of the AI would end up squandering a lot of very expensive units .
Without a doubt , the AI is far better as using the Protoss .
It ’s not even a contest .
The only time a Protoss would get wiped out would be if they had a stroke of bad luck in the initial first - wave attack , which is always a game of Russian Roulette .
Assuming they survive that , a Protoss AI is probably going to go the distance .
The only foe they have to really worry about is the other Protoss .
In the dozens of games I ran , only once did I see a game where the top spot was n’t occupied by a Protoss .
Most of the time two protoss players occupy the top two slots in terms of scoring .
This is the outcome of a very typical battle .
Protoss kicking butt .
Zerg coming in second .
Terrans going extinct in some kinda hurry .
The Terrans were unquestionably the worst in the hands of the AI .
Despite the fact that there were ( usually ) three Terran players , thus slanting the odds in favor of a Terran - dominated game , they never got above third place , and often the Terran players would occupy three of the bottom four slots .
They were more likely than the other races to get wiped out in the first rush , and if they survived they had a terrible time doing real damage to their foes .
Despite the fearsome power of the Terran Battlecruiser , the AI was very shy about building them .
Even with limitless resources , it never built more than a few and it never used them very well .
Even late in the game it was building Wraiths , and it would not quit making them no matter how absurdly poorly they performed .
The Terrans seemed to maintain a smaller force .
It used Siege Tanks poorly , sent Marines to fight without Medics , and generally fought like a complete tool .
The computer did alright with the Zerg , although it was moronic with its mix of air units .
Guardians were often sent in with too little support , making them easy fodder for enemy defenders .
If it used Defilers , it was likely as not going to hit its own units when using plague .
A familiar battle : Siege Tank vs. Mutalisk .
Also popular is the Valkyrie vs. Dragoon fight .
The Terran AI always seems to have the wrong unit , at the wrong time , in the wrong place , doing the wrong thing , and not nearly enough of them .
When I fight the AI Protoss , it uses the Templar Psi Storm with murderous efficiency .
I ’ll have a tight group of units moving into its base when a Templar will appear in juuuust the right spot , drop a Psi Storm on my guys , and dart away before I can punish him for it .
With a couple of Templar available he ’ll play hit - and - run with me all day , and do tremendous , infuriating damage to my forces .
Against other AI , the Templar are bumbling comic goofs .
They will drop Psi Storm on single enemy units and hit a bunch of their own guys in the process .
They will blunder through fortified territory attempting to reach a unit deep inside , and get cut down before they even get close .
I ’ve come to suspect that the AI cheats a bit and detects clusters of units which have been grouped by hotkey by human players .
This is very naughty if it ’s true .
What ’s worse is that peeking at how my hotkeys are set up seems to be central to its decision making .
Deprived of that bit of cheating info , the Templar is helplessly stupid .
Boo .
I ’m note sure why the thing is so bad at utilizing Terrans .
Aside from the issues I mention above , it just seems less aggressive overall .
It also has a penchant for building base defenses ( bunkers , towers ) in places where a base should go , effectively rendering a viable expansion useless .
It will attempt to lunch nukes without bothering to cloak the Ghost first .
It will risk the painfully expensive Science Vessel in order to irradiate something of very low strategic value .
It makes small numbers of all units instead of focusing on a few and using them well .
Still , this was an amusing experiment .

When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) was created in 1949 , the alliance was based on a system of " collective defense " which meant its member states agreed to mutually defend each other in response to an attack by any external party .
For most of the last half of the 20th century , the most likely external party was the Soviet Union .
Not long after the signing of the treaty which brought NATO into being , the Cold War intensified and pitched NATO members into a standoff with the Warsaw Pact signatories which lasted over 40 years .
Until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 , NATO 's primary goal was to contain the threat that was thought to originate from behind its eastern borders .
Since the removal of the Soviet threat , NATO 's goal in Europe has changed from defending its eastern borders to pushing those boundaries as far east as possible .
In 2004 , the alliance executed the biggest expansion in its history , to include seven new members : Bulgaria , Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia -- all formerly part of the Soviet Union or the Warsaw Pact .
The alliance 's expansion looks unlikely to stop there .
A further five nations have been short - listed for NATO accession this year .
While the membership of Albania , Croatia and Macedonia would mark a concerted effort by NATO to shore up the shaky Balkan region and consolidate its role there , a potential eastward push into Ukraine and , further still , Georgia has raised questions about NATO 's current motives and approach to its former Cold War adversary , Russia .
NATO sells expansion as a means to stability
The leaders of NATO : Bringing stability or asserting regional dominance ?
The official line from NATO is that membership in the alliance brings with it stability and security .
The states being considered for accession have all recently experienced some form of political upheaval and instability .
" The Balkan region has been jolted anew by Kosovo 's recent secession from Serbia , " Charles Kupchan , a senior fellow for Europe Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations , in Washington , told DW - WORLD.DE .
" NATO membership for Albania , Croatia , and Macedonia can help stabilize the region amid this new source of uncertainty .
As in previous rounds of enlargement , preparation for membership encourages states to improve democratic governance and civilian control of the military . "
But Dan Plesch , director of the Center for International Studies and Diplomacy , in London , and an author on global security issues , believes there is more to NATO 's plans than the official explanation implies .
" The public explanation ignores Russia , " Plesch said .
" While NATO itself , and especially its European members , have no agenda to assert regional dominance around Russia , this cannot be said for some in the United States .
For some in the US , NATO is just a vehicle and another opportunity to extend its hard power globally .
Regional dominance is explicitly the agenda in Washington . "
The proposed expansion of NATO 's strategic defense forces further into former Soviet territory has angered Russia .
Despite attempted conciliation during a recent bilateral summit with US President George W. Bush , outgoing Russian Premier Vladimir Putin still believes NATO expansion into Ukraine and Georgia would be a direct threat to Russia .
Putin reiterated his position to expansion in Bucharest
" The appearance of a powerful military bloc on our borders will be taken by Russia as a direct threat to the security of our country , " Putin said at the NATO summit in Bucharest earlier this month .
He also challenged NATO 's argument that Russia would benefit from having stable , Western - backed democracies as neighbors .
" The entry of Latvia into NATO has not changed a thing for those hundreds of thousands of people , " Putin said .
" NATO is not a democratizer . "
Dan Plesch agrees that NATO 's argument crumbles in the harsh light of reality .
" The Latvian case just shows that NATO has a problem when it overextends itself .
Continuing problems in far - flung outposts of NATO expose it as a meaningless alliance when these states go unsupported . "
Russia : Playing the game or under threat ?
Russia has reacted to the growing possibility of NATO expanding into Ukraine and Georgia by issuing bellicose warnings reminiscent of Soviet - era Cold War rhetoric .
In February , Putin warned that Russia could take " retaliatory action " should Ukraine become a member of NATO , suggesting Moscow might aim its missiles at Kiev .
At the beginning of April , a senior Russian general reiterated Putin 's message by saying that Russia would take " military and other " steps , should Ukraine and Georgia join NATO .
Some experts have speculated that President Putin 's reactions are an assertion of Russian strength against a threat he knows to be manufactured .
Others believe that Putin and his successor , Dmitry Medvedev , are genuinely concerned -- and have reason to be .
Ukraine 's President Yushchenko has Bush 's support
" NATO is not seeking to encircle Russia and assert regional dominance , but instead to extend stability , reassurance , and deterrence to new members , " Charles Kupchan said .
" In reality , however , NATO enlargement does bring with it greater Western influence and aligns the governments of new members with the Euro - Atlantic community .
This realignment is one of the reasons that Russia is uncomfortable with enlargement ; it diminishes Moscow 's geopolitical sway .
In that way NATO enlargement is in part a hedge against the potential return of Russian ambition . "
There is growing concern that NATO expansion could spark a new arms race with Russia , leading to the Kremlin taking an even harder stance in the face of new social tensions brought on by spiraling defense costs .
" The worst case scenario would be a return to militarized rivalry between NATO and Russia , but this outcome is remote , " said Kupchan .
" What is more likely is increased Russian meddling in the Caucasus and less Russian cooperation on policies ranging from arms control and Iran , to missile defense and Kosovo . "
NATO considering energy security in future missions
Even if NATO 's expansion plans are not designed to curtail Russian ambitions and influence , the geographical significance of the countries hoping for membership holds other benefits for NATO 's existing members .
No gas today : Russia cut Ukraine off in January 2005
NATO 's increased emphasis on energy security for its members is recognized by some observers as a factor in its eastward expansion .
Having been slower than Russia to seize on the impact of energy supplies on national security , it cannot have been overlooked by NATO that a presence in both Ukraine and Georgia would go some way to catching up .
Should both countries join the alliance , NATO would be in a prime position to exert influence over and protect oil supplies from the Caspian Sea through Georgia and offer support to Ukraine in any future disputes with Russia over gas .
Europeans delay membership
Russian anger over the planned expansion is also beginning to expose potentially damaging rifts within NATO itself .
At the Bucharest summit , despite some last minute arm - twisting from President Bush , European leaders -- wary of alienating an increasingly assertive Russia -- denied coveted pre-membership status to Georgia and Ukraine , at least for the time being .
Merkel and Sarkozy led the opposition to expansion plans
Led by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel , the Europeans claimed that such a move could destabilize an already volatile region on Russia 's southern flank .
There are growing concerns that a split within NATO along European and US lines could lead to a breakdown in relations similar to that experienced over the invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
Others believe that remaining silent could be equally as damaging .
" France and Germany should take a stand , " said Dan Plesch .
" Russia is far more of a traditional European state than Turkey , and yet , it is Turkey not Russia that is now regarded as European .
This goes against history and is a dangerous path .
In this respect , Poland and the other former communist countries of central and eastern Europe are playing a dangerous game aligning with the US against Russia . "
All these issues could be described as moot points seeing as it appears unlikely Ukraine and Georgia will become NATO members anytime soon , even with Ukraine 's " membership action plan " due for reconsideration in December .
However , the tensions between all those with an interest in the expansion -- which will no doubt simmer and possibly increase between now and the resolution of the situation -- may be as defining as the final accession itself .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks rallied Tuesday as investors welcomed news that the Federal Reserve will lend up to $ 200 billion to banks and lenders as a means of loosening up tight credit markets .
According to early tallies , the Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) jumped almost 417 points , its fourth - biggest one - day point gain ever and the biggest one - day point gain since July 2002 .
In percentage terms , the gain of 3.55 % was the best since March 2003 .
The blue - chip index had ended the previous session at a 17 - month low .
The broader Standard & Poor 's 500 ( SPX ) index climbed 3.7 % after ending the previous session at a 19 - month low .
It was the biggest one - day percentage gain since May 2002 .
The Nasdaq composite ( COMP ) jumped almost 4 % after ending the previous session at its lowest level in 18 months .
It was the biggest one - day percentage gain since March 2003 .
The advance had lost a little steam in the late morning before recharging in the afternoon .
The Fed will make up to $ 200 billion available to a group of 20 big investment firms for a term of 28 days , rather than overnight .
The program is being coordinated with central banks worldwide .
( Full story )
While the announcement was a big positive psychologically , it also coincided with a market that was ready to rally after having slumped over the last few sessions .
" This was a very oversold market , and today we 're just seeing a short - covering relief rally , " said Ram Kolluri , president at Global Investment Management .
" We 're not off to the races now . "
He said that the market is in ' full - blown panic mode ' in the financial sector and has been down sharply of late , and the Fed news Tuesday is providing investors with an incentive to cover some short positions .
The actual impact on the banking system will be minimal , said Robert Loest , portfolio manager at Integrity Funds , saying the government 's need to borrow money could absorb half of the $ 200 billion in 30 days .
But the announcement has a psychological impact , and that 's why stocks are responding today , he said .
" It 's not that there is n't enough money out there , it 's not a liquidity issue , " Loest said .
" It 's a confidence issue . "
" I think the market is in a process of a psychological bottoming , " he said .
Investors , cheered by the injection of liquidity into the system , looked beyond oil and gas prices at record highs .
Oil prices surged to a new record trading high of $ 109.72 a barrel before retreating , while gas prices hit $ 3.2272 a gallon at the pump , just above the all - time record from last May .
Stock gains were broad based Tuesday , with 29 of 30 Dow stocks rising .
Financial components JP Morgan ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) , Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) and AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) led the advance .
Stocks tumbled Monday for a third straight session on worries that the financial sector will see more writedowns related to the housing and credit crises .
Those concerns remained Tuesday , but were countered by the Fed 's plan to keep liquidity flowing in financial markets .
Economic news .
The trade gap widened in January , the government reported , but the spread between the nation 's imports and exports was smaller than what Wall Street economists had forecast .
The economy will see slower growth this year , as the fallout from the housing market continues to hit consumer spending and job growth , but a recession is avoidable , according to the quarterly forecast from the University of California at Los Angeles .
Company news .
Bond insurers such as Ambac Financial ( ABK ) and MBIA ( MBI ) rallied on the Fed news .
Lenders Countrywide Financial ( CFC , Fortune 500 ) , Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) all jumped too .
Washington Mutual ( WM , Fortune 500 ) gained on the Fed news and also on rumors that the mortgage lender could receive a cash infusion from Goldman Sachs or Warren Buffett , Reuters reported .
Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) 's $ 3.1 billion bid for online ad tracker DoubleClick got the OK from European Union regulators , who said that the deal wo n't hurt competition for online ads .
Google shares jumped 4 % .
Texas Instruments ( TXN , Fortune 500 ) warned late Monday that first - quarter sales and earnings wo n't meet forecasts .
Shares lost 4.6 % .
WellPoint ( WLP , Fortune 500 ) warned late Monday that 2008 earnings wo n't meet forecasts , due to higher medical costs and a lower - than - expected subscribers .
Shares tumbled 28 % .
McDonald 's ( MCD , Fortune 500 ) and Boeing ( BA , Fortune 500 ) were the Dow 's only losers .
Boeing slipped after it said late Monday that it will formally protest the $ 35 billion refueling tanker deal awarded to rivals EADS and Northrop Grumman .
Market breadth was positive .
On the New York Stock Exchange , winners topped losers more than 4 to 1 as 1.47 billion shares changed hands .
On the Nasdaq , advancers topped decliners nearly 3 to 1 on volume of 2.06 billion shares .
Other markets .
U.S. light crude oil for April delivery rose 85 cents to settle at $ 108.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
The front - month contract ended the previous session at a record closing high of $ 107.90 .
COMEX gold for April delivery soared $ 4.20 to $ 976 an ounce .
In currency trading , the dollar touched a fresh record low against the euro and fell versus the yen .
Treasury prices slumped , raising the yield on the benchmark 10 - year note to 3.59 % from 3.45 % late Monday as investors took profits .
Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions .
Lenore Skenazy , the author of the kick - ass column about letting her kid ride the subway alone , has started a blog called Free Range Kids , with a stirring call to action :
Do you ever …
.. let your kid ride a bike to the library ?
Walk alone to school ?
Take a bus , solo ?
Or are you thinking about it ?
If so , you are raising a Free Range Kid !
At Free Range , we believe in safe kids .
We believe in helmets , car seats and safety belts .
We do NOT believe that every time school age children go outside , they need a security detail .
Most of us grew up Free Range and lived to tell the tale .
Our kids deserve no less .
This site dedicated to sane parenting .
Share your stories , tell your tips and maybe one day I will try to collect them in a book .
Meantime , let 's try to help our kids embrace life !
( And maybe even clear the table . )
A few months ago we showed you how to make beautiful fractals in polymer clay .
Take that idea , run with it , and where do you end up ?
In the kitchen , making Sierpinski cookies !
These cookies , made from contrasting colors of butter cookie dough , are a tasty realization of the Sierpinski carpet , producing lovely , edible fractals .
As with our earlier project involving clay , you can make these by using a simple iterative algorithmic process of stretching out the dough and folding it over onto itself in a specific pattern .
For choice of materials , we found the pixel cookies on Instructables to be inspiring .
( You can , of course , make a representation of a fractal using pixels , like these Sierpinski triangles .
However , there is a big logical difference between generating a fractal algorithmically versus just making a picture of one with pixels ! )
Our method starts with an initial pattern .
Once that is made , it is stretched out to make it small enough to form the basis of the next iteration , which is in turn stretched out and folded to make the next iteration .
Again , we ’ve used this method before with fimo fractals , but the time for cookie fractals has come !
The pixel cookie advice to use the butter cookie recipe from Cook ’s Illustrated is excellent ( they even posted the recipe ) .
You ’ll need dough of contrasting colors .
You can use food coloring if you like , but we suggest chocolate .
To make a batch of chocolate dough , reduce the flour by 1/4 cup and substitute 1/4 cup of cocoa powder .
Also reduce the butter by a tablespoon and mix about a tablespoon of melted bittersweet chocolate into the cream cheese before adding it to the dough .
Chilling the dough is n’t necessary , as you want it to be soft enough to be workable .
For the first block , you ’ll need to roll out eight strips of one color and one of the contrasting color .
After rolling them out , form each one into a square , then stack them to form a larger block with the contrasting color in the center .
You ’ll want to slice off the end of the stack to even it up .
Use a sharp knife and cut carefully so you do n’t squish the pattern .
To draw the block out longer and thinner without disturbing the pattern , turn it over frequently .
You can either squeeze the sides , then rotate , or press the top , then rotate .
It helps to pull it out twice as long as it was , then cut in half , and repeat until you have eight equal pieces , each about as long as the original block .
Parchment paper is a good work surface for this .
Keep an extra sheet handy for when the one you ’re working on gets too sticky .
Roll out another length of the contrasting color , using the same amount of dough you used for the original pieces .
Form it into a square , and stack the pieces up with the contrasting piece in the center again .
As you draw out the block , the edges of the individual sections will merge .
If you want to cut samples of the different iterations , this is the time to do it – just after the edges have merged sufficiently .
Again , lengthen it until it is twice as long , cut , and lengthen those pieces , cut again and repeat .
When you add another piece of contrasting color and stack everything up , the pieces will again be somewhat separate .
You will want to draw it out a little smaller to merge the blocks before slicing .
With three iterations , it ’s now ready to slice .
( If brave , feel free to try more iterations . )
Chilling it would probably be a good idea , but if you ’re impatient , be sure to rotate between slices to keep the pattern from getting too squished in any one direction .
Slice carefully with a very sharp knife or a cheese wire .
One final ( but optional ) step is to gently roll each cookie out to smooth the surface texture out .
Before …
and after baking .
Admire them while you can as they disappear quickly .
Fractal foods are not particularly common , but they are a lot of fun , like this fantastic fractal pizza .
So , what fractal foods can you come up with ?
We ’d love to see pictures of your fractal food in our flickr pool .
Biggest misconception about burlesque :
That it ’s about dancing around in hot pants with feather boas .
Burlesque was about the striptease .
The stars of burlesque took their clothes off , end of story , period .
Hardest thing about stripping :
To make it look effortless and natural .
Her first corset :
It was out of my life for a little while .
It was stolen , by a friend of mine ’s daughter .
One day she returned it and said she was sorry .
I was happy .
I have hundreds of corsets , but that is the most important one .
Worst moment onstage :
My hair caught on fire .
I do an act where I sit on a vanity table that has candelabras on it .
Well , there was a lot of hair spray going on .
I realized what was happening and put my hair out .
The show went on .

Next big purchase : I ’m getting ready to make a new show , and that is always a big expense .
It will involve $ 80,000 worth of costumes and props .
This one is going to be especially rhinestone heavy .
Jamaican Government Considers Legalization of Marijuana , Revered by Rastafarian Population Staff
Jamaica is considering the legalization of marijuana , a drug revered by members of the island ’s large Rastafarian population who say smoking it is part of their religion .
A seven - member government commission has been researching possible changes to the Caribbean nation ’s anti-drug laws , which some police complain are clogging courts and jails with marijuana - related cases , a government official said Friday .
“ We have discussed it , and we are preparing a report to present to the prime minister , ” said Deputy Prime Minister Kenneth Baugh .
In 2003 , a government commission recommended legalizing marijuana in small amounts for personal use .
But lawmakers never acted , saying legalization might entail loss of their country ’s U.S. anti-drug certification .
Countries that lose it face economic sanctions .
A U.S. State Department report Friday said that Jamaica is the largest producer of marijuana in the Caribbean and a major hub for drugs bound for the United States .
Members of the Rastafarian movement , which emerged in Jamaica in the 1930s out of anger over the oppression of blacks , have long lobbied for the legalization of the drug that they say brings them closer to the divine .
There are an estimated 700,000 Rastafarians in the world , most of them among Jamaica ’s 2.6 million people .

Introduction
When US President Bush declared in October 2007 that if Iran acquired the knowledge to produce nuclear weapons , we would be plunged into World War III , he was not joking or even exaggerating : he was making his intentions clear .
In the same month , Vice - President Dick Cheney repeated the threat that the US would not ‘ stand by ’ as Iran allegedly pursued a nuclear weapons programme .
If the present war in Afghanistan , Iraq and Palestine spreads to Iran , we will indeed have World War III .
We have long had circumstantial evidence that the Bush regime was building up to an attack on Iran : the constant allegations ( denied by Mohamed El Baradei , chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency [ IAEA ] ) that it was pursuing a nuclear weapons programme , charges ( denied by the Iraqi government ) that it was sending arms and fighters into Iraq , a US military build - up clearly directed against Iran , the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps of Iran as a terrorist organisation and imposition of sweeping sanctions against Iran .
But it has now been revealed by two former high - ranking policy experts from the US National Security Council that war against Iran was planned all along , and nothing that Iran offered to do — including giving up its uranium enrichment programme — could have made a difference .
If the Bush administration has decided to attack Iran militarily , is there any power on earth that can stop it if the people of the US are unable or unwilling to do so ?
The argument below is that if the USA ’s ability to undertake imperial conquests depends on its obvious military supremacy , this in turn is ultimately based on the use of the US dollar as the world ’s reserve currency .
It is the dominance of the dollar that underpins US financial dominance as a whole as well as the apparently limitless spending power that allows it to keep hundreds of thousands of troops stationed all over the world .
Destroy US dollar hegemony , and the “ Empire ” will collapse .
David Ludden ’s article ‘ America ’s Invisible Empire ’ sums up the problem of the world ’s most recent empire with remarkable clarity .
Constituting itself at a time when decolonisation was well under way and other empires were disintegrating , US imperialism could never openly speak its name .
Initially , it disguised itself as the defender of democracy against communism ; when the Soviet Union ceased to exist , the pretext became the “ war against terror ” .
National security and national interest were invoked as the rationale for global dominance .
Ludden ’s description evokes the image of US citizens ( and a few others ) living in a Truman Show world , a bubble of illusion created by state deception and media complicity that prevents them from being aware of the reality of empire , although everyone outside can see it only too clearly .
It sounds quite credible that ‘ the empire will not be undone until its reality and costs become visible to Americans ’ ( p.4777 ) .
However , Ludden ’s claim that ‘ US taxpayers and voters pay the entire cost of the US empire ’ ( p.4776 ) is less credible .
If that were true , many more Americans would see their empire and oppose it ; the Democrats would have put up a principled opposition to the occupation of Iraq and threatened war against Iran , and the overwhelming majority of the US electorate would have supported them .
But it is the rest of the world that has been paying for the US empire : that is why it is almost invisible within the US .
The history of dollar hegemony
The core advantage of the US economy , the source of its financial dominance , is the peculiar role of the US currency .
It is because the dollar has been for decades the world ’s reserve currency that the US is able to maintain its twin deficits ( fiscal and trade ) and depend on the world ’s generosity .
It needs capital inflows of almost $ 4 billion from the rest of the world every working day to keep up its level of spending .
Its military superiority is one reason why it is unlikely ever to face an embargo , but more importantly , it has been able to live beyond its means because of US dollar hegemony .
The dollar mechanism has been described extensively elsewhere , this is merely a summary .
The strength of the US economy after World War II enabled the US dollar , backed by gold , to become the world ’s reserve currency .
When the US abandoned the gold standard in 1971 , the dollar remained supreme , and its position was further boosted in 1974 when the US came to an agreement with Saudi Arabia that the oil trade would be denominated in dollars .
Most countries in the world import oil , and it made sense for them to accumulate dollars in order to guard against oil shocks .
Third World countries had even more reason to hoard dollars so as to protect their fragile economies and currencies from sudden collapse .
With everyone clamouring for dollars , all the US had to do was print fiat dollars and other countries would accept them in payment for their exports .
These dollars then flowed back into the US to be invested in Treasury Bonds and similar instruments , offsetting the outflow .
The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and World Bank , headquartered in Washington , reinforced dollar hegemony .
As a reserve currency fulfills world needs in addition to the functions of a domestic currency , the favoured country can build up debt for a protracted period on a scale that would wreck any other country ’s currency .
But this advantage is a double - edged sword .
It allowed the US economy to decline unnoticed , its fiscal and trade deficits to climb steeply : by 2006 the US trade deficit had reached $ 763.6 billion , the current account deficit $ 850 billion , the gross national debt around $ 9 trillion .
Globalization destroyed the US as a manufacturing nation ; the outsourcing of services means that even this sector is gradually being shifted out of the US .
Only its pre-eminence in the global financial services industry remains intact .
And this is underpinned by US dollar hegemony .
Dollar hegemony is what concealed the costs of its empire , which were effectively being paid for by the rest of the world , from US citizens .
Other countries were compelled to accept fiat dollars because they had no choice .
It was the world ’s only reserve currency .
A “ currency ” reason for the Iraq war
When the euro came into being , even then the choice was only a potential one , as the euro initially lost value , making it unattractively risky as a reserve currency .
The first non-European countries that made a move in its direction did so for political rather than economic reasons .
When Saddam Hussein switched to the euro in late 2000 and converted Iraq ’s $ 10 billion reserve fund at the UN to euro , some analysts commented that this political gesture would have a heavy economic cost .
But against all expectations , he actually made a profit when the euro staged a recovery .
Iran is another country which in 2002 converted more than half its foreign exchange reserves to euros .
Both Iraq and Iran being oil - producing countries , the impact of their shifting currency allegiances would be significant .
By contrast , North Korea ’s official shift to the euro for trade in December 2002 was negligible from the standpoint of the world economy , yet it signified a trend that US imperialism had to stop at all costs .
Suddenly George Bush ’s diatribe against the ‘ Axis of Evil ’ , which seemed so arbitrary and laughable at the time , does n’t appear quite so funny .
Add to this picture the fact that Hugo Chavez — against whom the US supported a coup in April 2002 , and who continues to be under attack by the Bush regime — has taken a large part of Venezuela ’s oil trade out of the orbit of the US dollar , and the economic compulsions driving US foreign policy become clearer .
Military might alone does not seem to be a sufficient basis for sustaining an empire : economic power is crucial .
And for the declining US economy , US dollar supremacy is essential for maintaining its economic clout .
Thus , there seems to be good reason to believe that the main purpose of the invasion of Iraq was to change the denomination of its oil sales back to dollars , especially given that one of the first actions of the US occupying forces was to do precisely that .
But the action backfired badly .
Anti-war protesters immediately began campaigns to boycott the dollar , and the campaign spread , with the call being taken up by the Boycott Bush campaign after the 2004 World Social Forum .
Former Prime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamed took up the call in 2004 and again in 2006 , arguing that Israel would not be able to oppress the Palestinians and Lebanese without the financial and military support of the US , which would be put under pressure by a dollar boycott .
In December 2006 , Iran announced it was going to shift the rest of its foreign exchange reserves from dollars to euro , using the euro for most of its oil deals , and in July 2007 asked the Japanese to pay for their oil in yen .
Habit and inertia might have prevailed against these political initiatives to undermine the dollar as the world ’s reserve currency , if continuing US belligerence and mismanagement of its economy had not helped to push the value of the dollar lower .
As the dollar steadily lost value due to the massive US debt , George Soros pulled his money out of dollar assets , and other US investors followed suit .
An article in China Daily on 28 September 2004 by Jiang Ruiping , the director of International Economics at the China Foreign Affairs University , pointed out that China was already losing due to the dollar slide and would lose even more if it crashed ; he recommended moving out of dollars into euros and possibly also yen , as well as using its dollar reserves to stock up on oil .
In fact , only about 15 per cent of China ’s additional foreign exchange reserves acquired in the first three quarters of 2004 were in US Treasury holdings , and OPEC countries reduced the dollar assets in their reserves from 75 to 60 per cent .
In July 2005 , the fixed exchange rate of the yuan to the dollar was abandoned , followed closely by the Malaysian ringgit , with both currencies being allowed to float in a tight band against a basket of foreign currencies .
The Japanese government indicated it might diversify its reserves portfolio , and the Reserve Bank of India started buying euro - denominated securities .
In March 2005 , the Bank for International Settlements in Basle announced that Asian central and commercial banks held only 67 per cent of their deposits in dollars in September 2004 , compared with 81 per cent three years earlier ; Indian banks were down from 68 to 43 per cent , while Chinese dollar holdings were down from 83 to 68 per cent , with the euro and yen being the most popular alternatives .
Holdings in more exotic currencies also grew rapidly , albeit from much lower levels : Chinese renminbi ( yuan ) by 530 per cent , Indonesian rupaiah by 283 per cent , Taiwanese dollars , Korean won and Indian rupees by 129,117 and 114 per cent respectively , presumably on the expectation that they would grow in importance .
By the end of 2005 , euro - denominated securities had overtaken dollar - denominated ones as a medium for international investors .
In 2006 , the Swedish central bank cut its dollar holdings from 37 per cent to 20 percent , the Russian central bank from around two - thirds to 40 per cent , while Italy switched a quarter of its foreign currency reserves from dollars to sterling ; Russian President Vladimir Putin also called for a ruble - denominated oil and natural gas exchange in Russia .
The Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) , planning to launch a common currency in 2010 , was thrown off - course when Kuwait abandoned the dollar peg in May 2007 in order not to continue importing inflation via a devaluing dollar ; later , as the subprime mortgage crisis struck in the US , and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 0.5 per cent , Oman , Saudi Arabia and Bahrain did not cut their rates in unison , amidst reports that there was an ongoing debate on a more flexible alternative to the dollar peg in all six GCC countries .
Data released by the US Federal Reserve showed that between late July and early September 2007 , foreign central banks reduced their holdings of US Treasury Bonds by $ 48 billion .
Meanwhile , plans to establish the Banco del Sur by seven Latin American countries ( with others likely to join ) , in order to provide an alternative to US - dominated funds like the IMF , World Bank and Inter - American Development Bank , would be an even greater threat to the dollar if they included the use of a regional currency .
An interesting result of the dollar ’s declining value is that while the rich turn to euro , the less wealthy , from Russia to the Maldives and Mexico to Vietnam , prefer their local currency to the dollar .
It is easy to agree with Xu Jian , a vice - director of China ’s Central Bank , that the dollar is ‘ losing its status as the world currency , ’ especially when the same sentiment is expressed by American analysts .
What this means is that the US dollar is no longer the sole world currency ; this position is now shared with other currencies .
But it is still dominant , for a number of reasons .
So long as the oil sales of most countries continue to be denominated in dollars , the US dollar will still be in demand ; this could change , of course , if Russia were to launch its ruble - denominated oil and gas exchange .
And countries like China and Japan , which between them hold trillions of dollars , would be unwilling to dump them because that would hit the value of their own reserves .
Moreover , like other countries that rely heavily on the US market , they would prefer to keep their currencies low against the dollar , even though by November 2007 the yuan had appreciated by 11.6 per cent against the dollar since the peg was dropped , and the yen by 7.7 per cent since the beginning of the year .
On the other hand , building up dollar reserves would simply increase their losses as it declined .
Other countries with smaller dollar reserves would also face the same dilemma .
The gradual decline in the value of the dollar that is occurring would have been the best option , if not for the urgency of the situation facing us .
Millions have died in Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of the US - led occupations , and the carnage continues ; meanwhile , the apartheid state of Israel , fully supported by the US , has occupied the whole of historical Palestine , herding the original inhabitants into ghettoes in the West Bank and one big ghetto in Gaza , and subjecting them to ethnic cleansing and daily killings .
If Iran is attacked , the conflict would become a nuclear war , at least in the sense that it would involve bombing Iran ’s nuclear facilities ; but it might also involve nuclear weapons .
Apparently ‘ The only thing standing in the way of a preemptive attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities is foot - dragging by the US military , ’ but there is frightening evidence of attempts by the government to get around this resistance from the US military .
Several cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads were secretly flown across the US in violation of all standard procedures on 29/30 August 2007 , and several military personnel who might have known about the incident or been involved in it died under mysterious circumstances shortly before or after it , leading to speculation that the missing nukes incident was connected to US war plans against Iran .
It hardly needs to be pointed out that such a war , in which Russia and China might get involved , would be catastrophic , mainly for Iran and West Asia , but also for the rest of the world .
Among the side effects of US military aggression is the expansion of fundamentalist forces ; the Taliban has not only made a come - back in Afghanistan , but is now spreading in Pakistan , while Al Qaeda , which had no presence in Iraq under Saddam Hussein ’s rule , is now well entrenched there .
Democracy in Iran has yet to recover fully from the US - inspired regime change in 1953 , and it is likely that a US military attack will set it back by another half - century .
But can such an attack be prevented ?
What to do : non-violent economic non-cooperation
This brings us back to the dilemma posed by David Ludden .
The costs of empire will become apparent to the US public only when they have to pay those costs , and this will happen only when ( a ) other nations stop colluding in its imperial adventures , and ( b ) the dollar loses its role as the world ’s reserve currency .
For citizens of the world who are opposed to US imperialism , that suggests several possible courses of action .
The ‘ world ’s second super - power ’ , world public opinion , made a hugely impressive showing prior to the invasion of Iraq , yet it failed to stop the invasion itself ; stronger action is required .
But the armed struggle taking place in Iraq is killing and maiming hundreds of thousands of Iraqis and thousands of Americans , most of them from poor families ; surely this is not desirable .
The alternative proposed here is non-violent non-cooperation with the imperial monster .
For example :
1 ) We should put pressure on all other governments not to participate in the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan , or any attack on Iran or sanctions against it , and / or vote out candidates who are colluding in this aggression and vote in alternatives .
This will leave the burden of running their empire fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the US administration .
2 ) We should refuse to use the US dollar except within the US itself .
Given the current weakness of the dollar , this could undermine its reserve currency role even if it is done on an individual basis .
For example , large numbers of people from developing countries cross international borders every day , for work , business , tourism , pilgrimages or to visit relations ; since their own currencies are not accepted internationally , they have to buy ‘ hard ’ currencies , and if they were to refuse to use the US dollar in this capacity , it would certainly make an impact .
Economic actors like the fair trade movement should also shift to other currencies for their international trade .
Both academics and activists should stop using dollar equivalents to measure incomes and GDP ; for the moment , the euro can be used as a standard .
Mass action of this sort played a major role in ending British rule in India and thus the British empire ; employed on a much wider scale , it can help to end the US empire .
3 ) People in Third World countries should put pressure on their governments to shift foreign currency assets out of dollars , and to create regional currencies to strengthen regional commercial and economic ties .
This would not only be a gesture of solidarity to the beleaguered peoples of Afghanistan , Iraq , Palestine , Iran and others oppressed or threatened by the US empire , but would also make good economic sense .
The dollar is sliding , and developing countries which hold all or most of their foreign exchange reserves in dollars are losing money as it loses value .
If it crashes , their reserves could be wiped out .
4 ) We should appeal to governments in oil - producing countries not to denominate their oil trade in US dollars .
This does not necessarily involve a wholesale shift to the euro .
Venezuela has concluded several barter deals with other Latin American countries including Cuba , giving them oil in exchange for goods and services , and this is a pattern other oil - producing countries could consider ; if a regional currency is established by the Banco del Sur , that too could be used for oil sales .
Russia could denominate its oil sales in rubles , and the GCC countries in their new currency , which would enable the remittances of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from South and Southeast Asia in Gulf countries to be used directly for oil imports .
Barter deals which do not involve oil could also be concluded between developing countries .
5 ) World trading patterns would also need to change .
If the dollar sinks drastically with world trade unchanged , many countries which now rely on exports to the US will be affected adversely by its inability to import their goods with a weakened dollar .
A reorientation of trade away from the US would therefore be necessary .
For example , plans to constitute the South Asia Free Trade Area as a regional bloc free of tariff and immigration barriers should be pursued at greater speed , and trade with other countries promoted at the same time .
MERCOSUR in Latin America has the potential to develop into an institution similar to the European Union .
China and Japan , the biggest creditors of the US , suffer most from the decline of the dollar , and would have to work out alternative trade patterns to safeguard their economies .
6 ) For many Third World countries , including India and China , expanding domestic mass markets would be an important component of any strategy .
This would involve campaigning nationally and internationally for policies of employment creation , protection of workers ’ rights , shorter working hours , and enforced payment of minimum wages that are adequate to support a decent standard of living .
Such a redistribution of resources from militarism and wasteful consumption of the rich and powerful to productive consumption of working people would play a positive economic role , not only in Third World countries but also in Europe and North America .
7 ) In addition to these economic measures , ending US imperialism would require pressing for the development and implementation of international humanitarian law , international law and multilateral treaties ( such as the Geneva Conventions , Rome Treaty of the International Criminal Court , Chemical Weapons Convention , Biological Weapons Convention , Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty , Land Mine Treaty , ILO Core Conventions , CEDAW and the Kyoto Protocol ) , and the strengthening and democratization of multilateral institutions ( like the UN , ILO and WTO ) .
8 ) It must be emphasized that none of these actions are aimed at ordinary US citizens , a large and growing number of whom are opposed to US imperialism , and all of whom are affected adversely by it , whether they realize it or not .
On the contrary , it is an open secret that the US Treasury and Federal Reserve are encouraging the decline of the dollar because it is seen as the best cure for the ailing US economy , since it slashes the foreign debt and makes American products more competitive .
A cheaper dollar would expand employment and increase the bargaining power of workers , enabling them to fight against the current policies of tax cuts for the rich , wage and welfare cuts for workers and the poor .
Taxpayers would also regain power as their contributions to government spending increased in importance ; the war could continue indefinitely so long as foreigners fund it , but once tax - payers are funding it , a tax strike could bring the troops home .
Even if all possible adjustments are made , there is no doubt that the decline and fall of the dollar as the sole world currency will cause pain , both within and outside the US .
But the alternative is incomparably worse .
The world order cannot much longer survive having a heavily armed rogue state on the rampage in violation of all international law and multilateral treaties .
The world economy cannot afford to depend on the currency of a bankrupt nation with a colossal military budget .
And the earth itself is put at risk by a country which devours massive quantities of fossil fuels and spews out greenhouse gases at a catastrophic rate .
US imperialism would not be able to pursue its destructive policies without the unlimited supply of blank cheques extended to it by the rest of the world , so it is the responsibility of the rest of the world to withdraw that source of funding .
The beast has to be killed by attacking it at the point where it is most vulnerable .
Meanwhile , if enough people in the US work to ensure that the next elections install a president and representatives who undertake to abandon the pursuit of Empire and instead seek to reintegrate the US into the international community as a law - abiding , fiscally - responsible , non-polluting member , the result will be a far safer and more stable global order , world economy and environment .
Despite those credentials , he left office last August with a frayed reputation over his role in the dismissal of several federal prosecutors and the truthfulness of his testimony about a secret eavesdropping program .
He has had no full - time job since his resignation , and his principal income has come from giving a handful of talks at colleges and before private business groups .

“ Maybe the passage of time will provide some opportunity for him , ” said one Washington lawyer who was aware of an inquiry to his firm from a Gonzales associate .
“ I would n’t say ‘ rebuffed , ’ ” said the lawyer , who asked his name not be used because the situation being described was uncomfortable for Mr. Gonzales .
“ I would say ‘ not taken up . ’ ”
The greatest impediment to Mr. Gonzales ’s being offered the kind of high - salary job being snagged these days by lesser Justice Department officials , many lawyers agree , is his performance during his last few months in office .
In that period , he was openly criticized by lawmakers for being untruthful in his sworn testimony .
His conduct is being investigated by the Office of the Inspector General of the Justice Department , which could recommend actions from exonerating him to recommending criminal charges .
Friends set up a fund to help pay his legal bills .
Asked about reports that law firms have not taken up feelers from Mr. Gonzales , Robert H. Bork Jr. , a corporate communications specialist and his spokesman , said Mr. Gonzales was talking to many people about the next steps in his career .
“ He is considering his opportunities in law and business , ” Mr. Bork said , “ but after many years in public service he is considering his options carefully . ”
He said Mr. Gonzales “ looks forward to the conclusion of the department ’s inquiries and getting on with his life . ”

The user manual is a list of software design mistakes .
( It may have been from The Design of Everyday Things , I do n’t remember and a cursory web search has n’t been helpful . )
Writing 7,500 lines of anything instead of 50,000 lines of something else is still useful , if for no other reason than with 50,000 lines of something , it is hard to know whether there are 50,000 lines because the business process is unnecessarily gnarly or whether there are 50,000 lines because the programming language is full of accidental complexity .
But if you have another language that could express the same thing in 7,500 lines , gnarliness in the business process is readily apparent .
[ back ]
There could be another entirely different reason why a piece of software that is “ gnarly and contradictory and full of exceptions and holes , and is impossible to understand ” may be a sign that the business has problems : Conway ’s Law .

Some time ago , I learned an amusing but insightful maxim :
Well - designed things may not be perfectly discoverable and consistent and stable , they may not be obvious and familiar , but in general , if something needs a lot of explanation , it may need rethinking .
Note that this does not mean that you ca n’t introduce something new that needs explaining .
But overall , you are seeking economy in the user manual .
So you want to introduce as few things that need explaining as possible .
And you want your explanations to be as simple as possible .
And you want the implications and consequences of those things to be obvious and without lots of caveats .
To borrow a phrase , you do n’t want leaky abstractions .
Leaky abstractions do n’t need much explaining up front , but the caveats and exceptions and trivia you ought to know ( like the maximum depth of call stack in some languages ) will inflate your user manual into a tome .
Well - chosen and well - implemented abstractions , on the other hand , need a little explaining up front , but after that they are ‘ discoverable ’ and need little or no further caveats .
So the point of the maxim is to seek overall economy of explanation .
This is not particularly novel or insightful , of course .
The utility of the maxim is remembering that the complexity of the user manual is an imperfect but helpful proxy for complexity of the software .
I have certainly applied that approach to designing things myself :
If I need to explain it over and over again , if I need to describe how all of the parts interact and why this button changes the colour unless the current mode indicator is set to resize , in which case it zooms … maybe I need more time designing and less time documenting .
So my teeny bit of advice here is to always think about the user manual when designing something .
If it is hard to document , it is hard to use .
That definitely goes for code : if it is hard to explain , it is probably hard to maintain .
That ’s a great argument for writing documentation :
The act of documenting something forces you to see it from the other person ’s perspective .
I imagine all of us can get together on this .
We may disagree on whether Ruby Metaprogramming makes something harder or easier to explain , whether andand helps or hurts , but the basic principle seems robust : if you sit down to explain it , you will get a feel for how it looks to someone who has n’t been thinking about it non -stop for several days or weeks .
Ken Tilton just wrote an excellent post that touched on this subject from a new angle : “ We Can Live With the Way You Handled That ” .
Ken ’s story is entertaining and well worth the full read ( I am only going to talk about one element of the post , but his anecdote really illuminates the business software development process : please give it your full attention . )
The thing that struck me like a gong about Ken ’s story is that software in business is a kind of documentation for business processes !
Business processes are often these gnarly heaps of rules with massive omissions , contradictions , and bits where what people say they do has no relation to what actually happens .
Writing a piece of software to augment or automate the process forces people to think hard about the process .
In my experience , good managers know this .
Quite often , the real motivation in automating a business process is as an indirect way to force this review .
This is why writing business software is called consulting .
This is why it rarely works well when outsourced to a firm in another time zone : the problem is not writing 50,000 lines of Java .
Nor is the problem writing 7,500 lines of Ruby .
The problem is exactly the same problem as writing documentation for a feature :
The problem is realizing that if the software to automate a business process is complicated and contradictory and hard to use , then the real cause is a business process that is complicated and contradictory and probably not serving the company well .
Good software has succinct and easy - to - understand documentation .
You ca n’t bring a genius technical writer in to turn a sow ’s ear into a silk purse .
Likewise , good business processes have succinct and easy - to - understand software automating or augmenting them .
It ’s the same thing : you ca n’t bring in a genius software architect to craft silk software for porcine processes .
So in the end , when you are writing a piece of business software and it is gnarly and contradictory and full of exceptions and holes and it is impossible to understand … that may be a sign that you are not writing a very good piece of software .
But it may also be a sign that the underlying business process is gnarly and contradictory and full of exceptions and holes .
You may need to push back on the requirements and foster change in the business .
Of course , that may not be possible .
Good managers are as rare as good software developers .
But nevertheless , if you have the business ’ best interests at heart , you ought to try to fix the problem and not paper over it with code .
We programmers talk about getting rid of accidental complexity so that our code contains only essential complexity .
And business processes are what we think of as essential complexity .
Fair enough .
But business processes have accidental complexity as well .
Business processes suffer from poor maintenance over time .
Business processes need to be refactored as well , and when you have a project to automate a process , you have a certain amount of freedom to challenge the process , to prod and poke it , to question it .
Do n’t assume that you have to take it as entirely given , a set of requirements cast in stone .
Remember , always , that our job is to add value , not just to cut code .
And like so many other places in software , sometimes our best code is the code we did n’t write .
Identifying a broken process that leads to simpler software could be be best value you can contribute to a project .
George and Dick .
The two traitors .
Two , thoroughly corrupt frauds , will leave office with their legacies intact .
History may not treat them kindly , but it wo n’t condemn them as the criminals they are either .
Not unless they ’re impeached .
These two assholes will leave behind a nation mired in debt with an economy teetering on the edge of collapse .
But that ’s not their problem .
After all , they ’ve looked after themselves quite well while in office .
The children ’s children of the morons who voted for this pair will be paying for generations to come for all the fun and loot that George and Dick will make off with and enjoy for the rest of their shallow , narrow lives .
The poor bastards that have to clean up behind them will be seen as incompetent failures when it ’s recognized that some of the damage is lasting - that it ca n’t all be cleaned up - that the soul of the nation has been stained permanently by a pair of greedy , Benedict Arnolds .
But , hey !
What is holding office all about ?
You did n’t think it was about spreading good will and glad tidings did you ?
About leaving the nation a better place than it was ?
Gimme a break .
All those red state folk who loved the way George talked - “ Why !
He ’s one of us ! ”
They ’d exult .
Maybe Santa and the Tooth Fairy fly with pigs too .
George and Dick ca n’t help it if the hics and sod-busters are so naïve and stupid they did n’t know they ’d get it broke off in their collective assholes as George and Dick walked away grinning .
Ca n’t you hear them ?
The jokes on you , pal .
We got ours .
Vote republican - again .
And pathetically , they will .
I ’m always amazed when I read somewhere that Bush Jr. is concerned with his legacy - that the end of his last term is fast approaching , and he ’s worried about how history will define him .
Jim Lobe , of the International Press Service recently wrote that Bush is “ still hoping that 2008 may yet deliver his presidency from the fate of being judged as one of the very worst — if not the worst — in history . ”
George ca n’t see his legacy in any other context than how much he ’s banked .
Look George .
Do n’t ya wanna be remembered as a good guy ?
A good prez ?
It ’s not hard to imagine George reacting with a blank look .
But his Legacy ?
I ’m damn sure gonna walk away from here with some serious cash !
This is what determines George ’s presidency , just as gravity determines the orbit of a mass around a star .
Hotdamn !
I ’m in the money !
This is the only legacy that George Bush can ever have .
Anything else is fluff for the history books .
The Bush intellect , the self perception of things Bush , ca n’t care about the historical record .
In Bush world , external reality exists only because he exists .
History will fall into place because that ’s histories burden .
Without Bush ’s conscious presence in the world , there would be no world , no history .
Bush is a quintessential narcissist .
He can never be wrong because that would mean a re-examination of his perceptions - all the lame brained , but always self serving moves he ’s made over a lifetime .
A classic narcissist , he does n’t recognize the pain his ruinous presidency has inflicted on the nation , and the world .
George ca n’t see anything wrong with the choices he ’s made because the George Bush he knows and loves must be right .
How else could the planet spin on its axis and orbit the sun ?
It ’s just that others do n’t understand .
After all , he ’s George Bush , and he ’s got the perfect answer for anyone who questions his decisions .
George explains , " I 'm the commander -- see , I do n't need to explain -- I do not need to explain why I say things .
That 's the interesting thing about being president . "
It ’s trite and blasé to use the term “ brainwashed , ” but everywhere on the net there are thoughtful essays and articles that try to account for the millions of Americans who think of themselves as conservative republicans who supported Bush .
Many still support him .
It ’s useful to imagine a man who is slamming his head between two trash can lids .
Someone asks ,
Why are you doing that ?
He replies , Because it feels so good when I stop .
But that begs the question ; when will this nightmarish , national infatuation with things regressive and conservative ever end ?
Just how low do the American people have to sink before they throw themselves a life - ring ?
Many progressively liberal people can’t understand what motivates otherwise decent people to subscribe to a political philosophy that openly admits , even boasts , of its proud , regressive , and counter intuitive character .
Bush , ignorant and unaware of the world around him , only capable of seeing his high office as a leverage for personal gain , is only the logical outcome of that philosophy .
Over 6 million people in 600 cities across the globe protested against the U.S. attack on Iraq .
Bush said the protesters are lucky to live in countries where , “ People are free to say anything . ”
Free to say anything ?
" The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11th . "
Gosh George !
A Freudian slip ?
Today , the clumsy , extravagant lies that Bush used to justify his attack are being applied to Iran .
Incredibly , Bush has found an audience willing to listen to his recycled garbage .
One of his most reliable audiences has been the Christian Right .
The incongruity of balancing God ’s Divine Love with murder escapes them , so bombs away .
Bush says , " You know , one of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on terror . "
How nice that Christians do n’t concern themselves with little nuances .
Unfortunately , the clownish assortment of dangerous bunglers that comprise the Bush Administration have still got a year left to inflict more pain .
Hopefully , enough of the nation ’s soul will survive to keep it recognizable as the nation so many knew and loved .
" Do n't it always seem to go ?

A nation is like an individual human being .
It has its own unique character .
It sees itself as the cause and circumstances that defined it .
It ’s learned from it ’s mistakes and grown from them .
It ’s proud of its maturing identity , and does n’t seek to change its values , its time honored and established institutions , or the way it considers others , whether they be its own citizens , or nations apart .
Bush has hastened changes in the nation that have been demonstratively harmful .
The terrible crimes committed in Florida during election 2000 blackened the character of the United States .
Goon squads were sent to disrupt the vote count , the most vital function of a free people .
The nation ’s highest court disgraced itself , and afterwards , the leaders it appointed to high office behaved as if they ’d won a mandate , and not lost an election by vote of the popular majority .
These things portended worse to come and indeed it has .
War , born of deceit , civil rights and Constitutionally guaranteed freedoms abridged , the torture of human beings , the rules of war discarded , an enormous shift away from comparative wealth , corporate malfeance on a scale never before seen and much , much more .
All of it quite apart from the character of a nation once known the world over .
These imposters - these frauds - do n’t mean well .
“ See the wise and wicked ones who feed upon life ’s sacred fire . ”

The legacy that Bush made for himself should be crowned with his impeachment , but of course Nancy Pelosi does n’t think impeaching Bush or Cheney will serve her interests .
She walks softly and carries no stick .
Pelosi is just another millionaire Congressional member who looks after her interests first .
Her Constitutional obligation as Speaker demands that she initiate impeachment proceedings against the pair of assholes befouling the People ’s House , but as she often says , “ impeachment is off the table . ”
Tim King , of The Salem News writes , “ There is credible evidence that the Vice President abused the power of his office , and not only brought us into an unnecessary war but violated the civil liberties and privacy of American citizens .
It is the constitutional duty of Congress to hold impeachment hearings ” Mr. King continues with this sad , and so oft repeated , observation , “ House leaders and the leading Democratic presidential candidates do n’t support impeachment . ”
Dennis Knucinich is lobbing hand grenades Cheney ’s way , and Mr. Knucinich ’s support is growing .
Hopefully , he will help Bush and Cheney find their proper places in the historical record .
Mr. King , encapsulating what everyone in Congress already knows writes , “ The charges against Vice President Cheney relate to his deceptive actions leading up to the Iraq war , the revelation of the identity of a covert agent for political retaliation , and the illegal wiretapping of American citizens . ”
It ’s not possible to disgrace people like Cheney and Bush .
They know who they are .
But it is possible to keep such people from disgracing others , namely , Americans .
Bush is looking forward to going on the speechifying , or lecture circuit .
He ’s been crowing about “ the ridiculous ” amount of money he can make .
Says Bush , it ‘s time to “ replenish the ol ’ coffers , ” and he adds , " I do n’t know what my dad gets .
But it ’s more than fifty , seventy - five ' thousand dollars a speech . "
Is n’t that nice ?
The son , nonetheless , is going to be rewarded for the horror he ’s visited upon the nation .
What must an audience of Bush devotees , willing to pay large sums of money to hear George ’s wisdom , be like ?
Look like ?
It ’s enough to make ya cringe .
A million dead in Iraq , including over 4,000 U.S. military personnel wo n’t get to hear George ’s take on things presidential .
Turns out being dead has at least one advantage .
But George and Dick will happily count their wealth and high five with all their pals who helped them sack the Treasury and otherwise drag a great nation down into darkness .

Drinking a lot of water is supposed to be healthy , but there is apparently little scientific support for the belief .
A review of clinical studies has found no evidence that drinking eight glasses of water a day , the usual recommendation , is beneficial to a healthy person .
Numerous claims have been made about water  that it prevents headaches , removes dangerous “ poisons , ” improves the function of various organs and is associated with reduced risk for various diseases .
But none of these is supported by scientific evidence .
The authors were not even able to find a study leading to the “ eight glasses a day ” rule , whose origin remains unknown .

The researchers , in the June issue of The Journal of the American Society of Nephrology , say some studies have found evidence that drinking extra water helps the kidneys clear sodium , and long - term sodium retention might increase the risk of hypertension , but no clinical significance for the phenomenon has been established .
Water also helps clear urea , but urea is not a toxin .

A long time passed , but he never returned .
Then Parks - Fox ’s phone beeped .

IN THE EARLY 1990S , Maricopa was a small farming community with a population of about 600 , mostly longtime farmers and Hispanic laborers , along with a few American Indians .
Local businesses included a low - profile Nissan testing site and the state ’s largest beef - cattle feed lots  industries that chose Maricopa because it was out of the way .
But as Phoenix grew , far - thinking developers began buying up tracts of land in and around Maricopa .
By 1996 , one developer , Mike Ingram , had amassed with his business partners 18,000 acres  an area larger than the island of Manhattan  most of it purchased for $ 500 an acre or less .
He had a vision of Maricopa ’s future , and he helped persuade the state to widen the two - lane road to Phoenix , turning it into a four - lane divided highway .
That year , Ingram and his partners announced plans to build a 6,000 - acre community in Maricopa .
They cleared farmland , brought in utilities and designed a maze of cul - de- sacs , drives , circles and courts oriented around a golf course .
They sold building rights to a variety of “ superbuilders ” like KB Homes , Hacienda Builders and Continental Homes , and in the fall of 2001 , the first houses went on sale , while they were still being built .
The first subdivision was completed in 2003 and quickly sold out .
The median price for a new home in the city was $ 147,000 , about $ 80,000 less than a new home in Chandler .
Other builders rushed to get in on Maricopa .
Within a matter of months , a grove of pecan trees would transform into a few thousand new housing units .
The Maricopa post office requested a new ZIP code .
Builders literally could n’t put up houses fast enough , which drove up demand , which drove up prices and buzz .
The median house price rose to $ 160,290 in 2004 , then to $ 212,051 in 2005 and $ 281,798 in 2006 .
Subprime financing supercharged the town ’s growth ; according to First American CoreLogic , a housing - analysis firm based in Santa Ana , Calif. , more than a third of buyers in Maricopa in 2004 and 2005 were subprime , a higher rate than in the rest of Arizona and the United States .
Investors and speculators bought houses in Maricopa before they were built  often having put little or no money down  and resold them for a profit without ever moving in , sometimes on the day construction was completed .
Maricopa ’s mayor calculated that at one point in 2005 , three new people moved to Maricopa each hour .

There were plenty of other cities in Arizona that were experiencing a housing - market boom at the same time .
But most of those cities already had an infrastructure in place to deal with the influx of people .
Nearby Casa Grande had , for instance , a courthouse , a police station , zoning laws , a fire department , a city hall , a local government and a sewer system .
Maricopa had none of the above .
There was one school in town , built in the 1950s , a four - building campus where Maricopa ’s children were educated from kindergarten to 12th grade .
Before the boom , Maricopans had found ways to cope with the occasional weather problems that you find in the desert : when it rained and Honeycutt Road flooded , Maricopans just took another route until it dried out .
This kind of ad hoc strategy worked fine when fewer than 1,000 people lived there .
But the subdivisions brought thousands of commuters , people who worked in Phoenix and Chandler , and they all had to get on the same road to Phoenix every morning and return on it every evening .
There is no overpass where Highway 347 crosses the train tracks , so when a train comes along  and about 60 freight trains pass through town every day  the highway just stops dead .
At rush hour , the roads become a parking lot .
Ideally , a growing city will negotiate with developers to reduce the impact that new residents will have on the area ; it might offer the builder smaller setbacks from the road in exchange for providing space for a school or widening roads .
But at the beginning of Maricopa ’s growth , the city was unincorporated , and all these negotiations were made by a three - person county board of supervisors that was working from rural zoning codes dating back to 1962 .
As a result , in those early years , decisions about Maricopa were driven by the concerns of developers , who left little space in their plans for business or commerce  just lots and lots of houses .
They created blocks of identical homes , because it was more efficient to build with as little variation as possible .
They built sidewalks on only one side of the street to save money .
They happily left space in subdivisions for playgrounds and five new elementary schools , which they thought would help bring in the young families they were targeting , but they did not leave space for parks for older kids or for a high school .
Each builder worked independently , so there were no paths connecting any of the subdivisions .
As Maricopa grew , a coalition of farmers and newcomers decided that they wanted to try to exert some control over the town ’s expansion .
In 2002 , they applied to the state to incorporate Maricopa as a city , and the county appointed an interim city council and a mayor .
Eventually , the city purchased trailers from the highway department and set them down across from the railroad tracks near the old downtown under a sign that said “ Interim City Hall . ”
By the time Maricopa became a city , though , almost half of its land was owned by developers .
In 2005 , the local school district appointed a superintendent , John Flores , who began pleading with the developers for space for a high school ( for a while , Maricopa schools were admitting 300 new students every month ) .
But it was to no avail .
Amy Haberbosch , Maricopa ’s former director of planning , told me that developers believed high schools lowered property values ; she said one developer told her he ’d rather build a jail on his property than a high school .

It was to force Panama to submit the will of the United States after Noriega had exhausted his usefulness .

Mostly , we talk about the Volt here , but relevant and related topics are often worth discussing .
We have previously discussed a secretive Texas company called EEStor , who are reported to be working on a new type of ultracapacitor that can hold 10 x the energy in 1/10th the weight of typical batteries , at a fraction of the cost .
They have an agreement to produce caps for Zenn electric cars but to date have not shown any prototypes .
This has led some to suspect EEStor as not having the technology they report .
Today , however , Lockheed Martin , the major U.S. military equipment manufacturer has announced a partnership agreement with EEStor to develop energy applications .
If these ultracaps can really deliver what they are projected to , they could offer a dramatic advantage for electric vehicles .
To that end , I interviewed Lionel Liebman , manager of Program Development – Applied Research at Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control .
The entire interview can be seen by clicking below .
Lockheed Martin and EEStor are working together to find areas for integrating their technology to a variety of power management platforms we 're working on .
We 're not taking any sort of ownership of EEStor .
It is an exclusive rights agreement to allow us to market these technologies to a very limited number of potential customers including homeland security and the defense markets .
And missiles , rockets , ground equipment , vehicles , and systems sensors .
Obviously everything that requires power to operate .
Power is becoming a sticking point or burden to the warfighter and that 's one of the things were focused on is coming up with solutions that make the warfighter 's job easier and more efficient .
Yes there are opportunities not only to help in the area of relieving some of the dependence on fuel as energy .
Also to increase the value of some of the renewable energy initiatives that are going on right now .
Energy storage increase the value of these types of power generation technologies .
EEStor 's technology can help in that area .
We 've visited their facility .
We were very impressed .
They are taking an approach that lends itself to a very quick ramp - up in production .
We 've seen a lot of their testing and efforts to measure the purity of the powders that they use , and the chemistry .
Well be working with them very closely this year to develop prototypes in certain pursuits .
That 's an effort that 's ongoing .
We 're really just getting started to integrate their technology into some of the efforts that we have going on here .
That 's going to be something that we 're doing this year .
That 's right .
We have n't personally tested their prototypes yet .
Its something that we 'll work on together this year .
Lockheed Martin does n't have a bias .
One way or another its really just a function of what does the customer want .
For certain applications being able to provide pulse power is really really important , in another its not so much really pulse power but continuous power .
If you talk to the Army they are really interested in hybridized solutions .
Suffice it to say that EEStor 's technology is a piece of some of these systems solutions that we come up with .
We are a system integrator so we look at the EEStor technology as a building block or a tool in a toolbox to provide the best solutions for the soldier .
The EEStor chemistry and architecture lends itself to both types of applications .
Its a scalable technology .
In the situation where you are trying to store energy , transport it without discharge obviously thats very attractive in the utility grid load leveling ( situation ) .
If your talking about powering for example a high energy weapon that requires a short burst of energy a capacitor is a great approach to do that .
Capacitors are in hybridized systems today for that reason .
The chemistry is great purely form the view of battery technology but its also very attractive for some of these extremely high pulse power applications .
We have a number of platforms that were working on .
Our applied research group is primarily focused on land forces power management which involves several area including vehicular power .
The needs of a consumer for a hybrid fuel - efficient car versus the need for a soldier in the battlefield are a bit different .
The common theme there is ' what can we do to make them more efficient ' , and battery technology is important for that .
Yes , and at a fraction of the cost .
Yes .
It really depends on the chemistry , the volume , the packaging , the application .
It is really application - specific .
It 's going to be lower price .
Were not just concerned about hardware cost .
Really what were focused on is logistics .
Especially the logistics footprint in theater .
That 's probably more important than material cost .
And that one of the things that we think this technology can bring .
Because it can be used for a variety of applications with a common architecture and chemistry .
Its compact , its scalable and can be applied to a variety of applications .
That obviously very attractive to a logistics community , to have more common components and that type of thing .
Yes for EEStor .
Their approach is when they start manufacturing these batteries , not just the cells , but also the package assembly , they will be in production .
If you can get a visit to EEStor they 'll show you their process and everything they 've got in place to support that .
Assuming that everything comes together in terms of tests and qualifications and that sort of thing , they will be ready to ramp up very quickly , because of the nature if the architecture and scalability of what they are doing .
We are basically working with them exclusively and in the homeland security and defense department 's markets .
The commercial vehicle market , that 's what EEStor will pursue .
If their is a military application then we 're going to help them integrate their technology into those applications , but when it comes to commercial vehicles that 's EEStor 's responsibility .
even when their transponders are turned off
Offroad accident in my JK ... pics included
What was originally planned to be a nice easy New Years Day Run got sideways on me very quickly .
I believe what happened was that my drivers front tire caught the tip of a fallen tree that was laying paralell to the trail and it kicked it up or turned it in such a way as to jump up a bit and i was travelling at just the right speed and and at just the right angle ( i think the tree missed everthing but the brake line before it hit the firewall ) to drive it through the firewall upwards between the clutch and brake pedal grazing my groin and hitting me in the left side of my stomach pinning me to the seat .
It happened really fast and very violently and i think the driver behind me had a better view of what happened but that 's the best i can describe it .
i've driven over logs and branches before and never even considered the idea of one coming up through the floor .
i guess like any time i get hurt i always think that i could have been more careful , but it still seems like a one in a million type thing ( everyone who witnessed the accident seems to agree ) .
Thankfully I was wheeling with a group and they were able to transport me out to get medical attention .
They also took care of my Jeep and have made it so much easier for me to concentrate on healing .
I am forever grateful for there help .
Thanks again Ian , Tom , Blair , Martin and the rest of the guys .
I was n't being careless , but in the future I will certainly be more careful .
I 've heard of other incidents similar to mine since it happened , but never before .
Please be safe on the trails .
As you can see in the pics , i have some damage to my torso ( my " boys " also took a hard shot and are swollen to 3 times normal size and are dark purple ) .
There was internal bleeding that stopped on it's own without surgery , and i have damage to my kidney and bowel that require another visit to the trauma Doctor .
In the meantime i have some time off work to heal , I am very swollen / bruised / stiff and sore but everything seems to be working OK .
here are some pics ...... there is a small peice of tree missing from the pics that i had to break off to exit my Jeep .
All presidents rail against the press .
It goes with the turf .

9 -11 Cover - Up , Treason and The Bomb
MEDIA / TREASON : 9-11 Cover - Up , Treason and The Bomb by Dave Lindorff
There is enough in just this one London Times story to keep an army of investigative reporters busy for years .
So why , one has to ask , is this story appearing in a highly respected British newspaper , but not anywhere in the corporate US media ?
I f a new article just published Saturday in the Times of London based upon information provided by US government whistleblower Sibel Edmonds , a 37 - year - old former Turkish language translator for the FBI , we have not only solid evidence of prior knowledge of 9 - 11 by high up US government officials , but evidence of treasonous activity by many of those same officials involving efforts to provide US nuclear secrets to America ’s enemies , even including Al Qaeda .
The story also casts a chilling light on the so - called “ accidental ” flight of six nuclear - armed cruise missiles aboard an errant B - 52 that flew last Aug. 30 from Minot AFB in North Dakota to Barksdale AFB in Shreveport , Louisiana .
The Sunday Times reports that Edmonds , whose whistleblowing efforts have been studiously ignored by what passes for the news media in American news media , approached the Rupert Murdoch - owned British paper a month ago after reading a report there that an Al - Qaeda leader had been training some of the 9 - 11 hijackers at a base in Turkey , a US NATO alley , under the noses of the Turkish military .
Edmonds , who was recruited by the FBI after 9 - 11 because of her Turkish and Farsi language skills , has long been claiming that in her FBI job of covertly monitoring conversations between Turkish , Israeli , Persian and other foreign agents and US contacts , including a backlog of untranslated tapes dating back to 1997 , she had heard evidence of “ money laundering , drug imports and attempts to acquire nuclear and conventional weapons technology . ”
But the Turkish training for 9 - 11 rang more alarm bells and made her decide that talking behind closed doors to Congress or the FBI was not enough .
She had to go public .
Edmonds claims in the Times that even as she was providing evidence of moles within the US State Department , the Pentagon , and the nuclear weapons establishment , who were providing nuclear secrets for cash , through Turkey , to Pakistan ’s intelligence agency , the Inter - Services Intelligence , or ISI , agencies within the Bush administration were actively working to block investigation and to shield those who were committing the acts of treason .
Pakistan ’s ISI is known to have had , and to still maintain close contacts with Al - Qaeda .
Indeed , the Times notes that Pakistan ’s nuclear god-father , General Mahmoud Ahmad , was accused of sanctioning a $ 100,000 wire payment to Mohammed Atta , one of the 9/11 hijackers , immediately before the attacks .
Edmonds claims , in the Times article , that following the 9 - 11 attacks , FBI investigators took a number of Turkish and Pakistani operatives into custody for questioning about foreknowledge of the attacks , but that a high - ranking US State Department official repeatedly acted to spirit them out of the country .
Edmonds was fired from her FBI translating job in 2002 after she accused a colleague of having illicit contact with Turkish officials .
She has claimed that she was fired for being outspoken , and in 2005 her position was reportedly vindicated by the Office of Inspector General of the FBI , which concluded that she had been sacked for making valid complaints .
One of those whom Edmonds claims in the Times report was being investigated in connection with the nuclear information transfers was Pentagon analyst Lawrence Franklin .
Franklin was convicted and jailed in 2006 for passing US defense information to American Israel Public Affairs Committee lobbyists and sharing classified information with an Israeli diplomat .
Franklin , in 2001 , was part of the Pentagon Office of Special Plans , a kind of shadow intelligence unit set up by the Bush administration inside the Pentagon whose job it was to gin up “ evidence ” to justify a war against Iraq .
In that capacity , he ( along with several other OSP members and arch neocon schemer Michael Ledeen ) was also identified by Italian investigative journalists working for the newspaper La Republican , as having been at a crucial meeting in December 2001 in Rome with the Italian defense and intelligence service ministers .
La Republicca reports that at that meeting a plan was hatched to fob off forged Niger embassy documents as evidence that Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein was trying to buy uranium ore from Niger .
If Edmonds ’ story is correct , and Al - Qaeda , with the aid of Turkish government agents and Pakistani intelligence , with the help of US government officials , has been attempting to obtain nuclear materials and nuclear information from the U.S. , it casts an even darker shadow over the mysterious and still unexplained incident last August 30 , when a B - 52 Stratofortress , based at the Minot strategic air base in Minot , ND , against all rules and regulations of 40 years ’ standing , loaded and flew off with six unrecorded and unaccounted for nuclear - tipped cruise missiles .
That incident only came to public attention because three as yet unidentified Air Force whistleblowers contacted a reporter at the Military Times newspaper , which ran a series of stories about it , some of which were picked up by other US news organizations .
An Air Force investigation into that incident , ordered by Defense Secretary Robert Gates , claimed improbably that the whole thing had been an “ accident , ” but many veterans of the US Air Force and Navy with experience in handling nuclear weapons say that such an explanation is impossible , and argue that there had to have been a chain or orders from above the level of the base commander for such a flight to have occurred .
Incredibly , almost five months after that bizarre incident ( which included several as yet unexplained deaths of B - 52 pilots and base personnel occurring in the weeks shortly before and after the flight ) , in which six 150 - kiloton warheads went missing for 36 hours , there has been no Congressional investigation and no FBI investigation into what happened .
Yet in view of Edmonds ’ story to the London Times , alleging that there has been an ongoing , active effort for some years by both Al Qaeda and by agents of two US allies , Turkey and Pakistan , to get US nuclear weapons secrets and even weapons , and that there are treasonous moles at work within the American government and nuclear bureaucracy aiding and abetting those efforts , surely at a minimum , a major public inquiry is called for .
Meanwhile , there is enough in just this one London Times story to keep an army of investigative reporters busy for years .
So why , one has to ask , is this story appearing in a highly respected British newspaper , but not anywhere in the corporate US media ?

Estamos en plenos finales y la carrera de diseño en casi todas universidades tiene la misma peculiaridad : en finales los profesores creen que su clase es la única clase que llevas .
Dejan proyectos complejos con dos semanas de anticipación , y no te queda de otra más que chambear toda la noche , toda la mañana y luego chambear un poco más .
Basta darse una vuelta por las salas de cómputo a las 5 AM para darse cuenta de que algo no funciona bien : algunos ya están babeando el teclado o ya de plano improvisaron una camita de sillas .
Para todos ellos tengo esta lista de posibilidades que he explorado durante mi veteranísima carrera en diseño .
Coca cola con aspirina
¿ Todavía crees en los reyes magos ?
Que tus compañeros se rían de tu ingenuidad .
No sé quién inventó que un analgésico leve ( aspirina ) mezclado con una bomba de azúcar ( coca cola ) te podría salvar de las garras de morfeo durante tiempos prolongados .
El azúcar te da un empujón muy limitado , luego viene algo a lo que los gringos llaman sugar crash en la que básicamente el cuerpo produce demasiada insulina a fin de balancear el nivel de glucosa en la sangre , produciendo hipoglicemia , que no es más que un factor de la fatiga crónica .
Café .
En cantidades industriales .
ConservadorEsos viajes al baño sí quitan tiempo
El café sigue siendo una buena opción para esas desveladas : es rico , relativamente barato y no está mal visto por nadie .
Hay gente que dice que el café le da sueño , a ellos les digo : tomen en las tazas oficiales de Duopixel .
Para conseguir una de estas codiciadas tazas es muy fácil , sólo tienen que vaciar un bote de 1 Kg de Yogurt , rellenarlo con café y listo .
Ahora , no todos los cafés son iguales .
Los que han jugado
The Sims bien saben que la maquina de expressos hace milagros .
Una taza de café instantáneo contiene aprox .
90 mg de cafeína , un café de grano 120 mg y un express entre 200 y 300 mg .
En lo personal el express doble me parece la mejor opción , pero hay gente más y menos sensible a la cafeína .
Latas y latas de Red Bull
VanguardistaMiles de ravers no pueden estar equivocados .
¿ O sí ?
Estas latitas amigas de los borrachos y de los ravers dan un boost energético a altas horas de la madrugada .
Eso de las vitaminas y la taurina es puro cuento , la principal razón por la que estas latitas resucitan muertos es por la cafeína y el azúcar que viene concentrado como jarabe .
El problema del Red Bull y de las otras miles de bebidas energéticas que le siguieron es el precio .
Para no sufrir el sugar crash mencionado anteriormente habría que estar tomando esta porquería continuamente , yo recomendaría unas ocho latas en un lapso de 12 horas , lo cual sale como a MX$ 200 , con esa cantidad de dinero es mejor pasar a la siguiente opción .
Pastillas de cafeína
Hardcore ¿Quieres saber qué se siente tener Mal de Parkinson ?
Estas las consigues en cualquier tienda GNC , te costarán entre MX$ 200 y MX$ 300 .
Estas producen básicamente el mismo efecto que el café , el malestar estomacal es un poco menor y la cafeína es extraída del guaraná .
Se dice que la cafeína del guaraná es diferente porque no se suelta de golpe sino que se absorbe paulatinamente por el cuerpo .
El efecto de una taza de café te puede durar media hora mientras que el efecto de una pastilla de cafeína de guaraná te durará una hora .
Ahora , aquí todo depende de la cantidad de pastillas ingeridas .
Hay que ser cuidadosos con la dosis porque la cafeína es tóxica en grandes cantidades .
Una cantidad con peligro de muerte sería 100 de estas pastillas en una persona de 70 Kg's , lo cual es muy difícil de lograr .
Aquí una peque ña descripción de los efectos :
2 a 5 pastillas : Animado , alegre .
6 a 10 : pequeños problemas de concentración , movimientos musculares involuntarios .
11 a 15 : Sudoración en frío , problemas de coordinación , temblorina general .
Incapacidad de llevar una conversación coherente .
16 a 20 : Te tiemblan las pupilas de los ojos cuando te los ves en el espejo .
Lo vi yo mismo !
Modafinil ( Provigil en EEUU o Modiodal en México )
XXXEn su sección de información para médicos , se dice que los chimpances utilizados para el experimento se lo auto - administraban .
Saquen sus propias conclusiones chavos .
En español la substancia activa de este medicamento se llama Modafinilo , y en México la consigues bajo la marca de Modiodal .
Y claro , como todo en México la consigues yendo a la farmacia del ahorro y pidiéndola al dependiente .
Vale $ 270 y trae catorce pastillas .
Para los que tengan duda de esto chequen este artículo del Washington Post :
" En pruebas sobre gente sana como los pilotos del ejército [ gringo ] , modafinil ha permitido mantener personas despiertas durante casi dos días mientras que han permanecido enfocados , alertas y tan capaces de lidiar con problemas como los bien descansados .
Luego , después de ocho horas de buen descanso , pueden levantarse y hacerlo por otras cuarenta horas , hasta que finalmente tienen que ponerse al corriente con el sueño " .
Es una cosa realmente impresionante , te tomas una de estas cuatro horas antes de que te vaya a dar muchísimo sueño y siente como si hubieras vencido a morfeo en su propio juego .
El modafinilo fue descubierto como tratamiento para los narcolépticos - gente que se queda dormida repentinamente en circunstancias cotidianas - y recientemente fue aprobado por la FDA como tratamiento para las personas que trabajan en turnos variantes .
Lo curioso es que no te pone como el café , nervioso y/o afectado en tu capacidad de concentración .
Simplemente sientes como si hubieras dormido .
Sin embargo , tu cuerpo sí siente la desvelada : tienes los ojos rojos y te duelen partes del cuerpo simplemente porque a tu cuerpo sí le falta descansar .
El modafinilo no te quita la capacidad para dormir , lo mejor es tomarte una siesta de dos horas justo después de tomarte la pastilla despertarás bastante fresco .
Conclusiones y disclaimer
Lo de siempre , no hay mejor remedio para el sueño que descansar bien .
Empiecen sus trabajos finales con anticipación , si lo dejan todo para el final acabarán como yo , experimentando con cuanto se me atraviese .
No tomen esto como una incitación a desvelarse , sino como un remedio cuando no les quede de otra .
The road coloring problem を読んでました。 問題自体知らなかったのですけど、abstract にオートマトンと書いてあったので、ついふらふらと。
この記事 の説明はちょっと変だな。スタート地点がどこであっても「青赤赤青赤赤青赤赤」のぴったり９歩
動くと必ず黄色の地点にいる、というのがこの色分けのポイント。
今どこにいるのか、どこで止まればいいのかすらわからなくても目的地に到着できるのです。
記事にあるような「目的地をいつかは通りがかるような色の列」なら40マイクロ秒くらいで 解かれてると思う。
論文に乗ってた具体的な構成法は、( 1) " Spanning Subgraph " を適当 に１個作る。 Spanning Subgraph とは 、 " 元のグラフの頂点を全部含む " && " それぞれの頂点について 、 それを始点とする辺を１個だけ含む " グラフ 。Spanning Subgraph は必ず、 「 ループとループにぶら下がったツリー 」 が何個か並んだ形をしていることに注意。 ( 2 ) 作った Spanning Subgraph の「 ぶら下がったツリー」部分の高さに注目。
一番高いツリーが１個だけだったらOK、3に進む。同じ高さのツリーが２個以上あったら、
この問題の前提とするグラフでは、どっちかのツリーを変形して「もっと高く」できるのでそうする。
( 3 ) そうしてできた Spanning Subgraph に属する辺を全て同じ色（例えば 赤）で塗る。 残りの辺は他の色で適当に塗る 。
… という感じ。これが求める色塗りになってることの証明は背理法なので、
具体的にどう色をたどれば一カ所に集合できるのかは、証明からは直接読み切れてないですが、

( CNN ) -- A visibly angry Sen. Hillary Clinton lashed out Saturday at Sen. Barack Obama over campaign literature that she said he knows is " blatantly false , " while Obama called her outburst " tactical . "
Sen . Hillary Clinton waves campaign literature she says is false .
Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland is behind her .
Clinton jabbed the air with her hands as she told a crowd in Cincinnati , Ohio , that two Obama mailings spread lies about her positions on universal health care and the North American Free Trade Agreement .
" Shame on you , Barack Obama , " she said .
Polls show Clinton and Obama are in statistical dead heats in delegate - rich Ohio and Texas , which both hold votes March 4 .
With Ohio Gov.
Ted Strickland nodding in agreement behind her , Clinton accused Obama of emulating the tactics of Karl Rove , President Bush 's former political director who is reviled by Democrats .
Obama " is continuing to send false and discredited mailings with information that is not true to the voters of Ohio , " Clinton said .
Watch Clinton demand a ' real campaign ' »
One mailing says her health care proposal would force everyone to buy health insurance , regardless of ability to pay , a charge Clinton vehemently denied .
" Sen . Obama knows it is not true that my plan forces people to buy insurance even if they can't afford it , " she said .
The NAFTA mailer says Clinton was a " champion " for NAFTA while first lady , but now opposes it .
NAFTA was negotiated by the first President Bush and signed into law by President Bill Clinton .
" I am fighting to change NAFTA , " Hillary Clinton said Saturday .
" Enough with the speeches and the big rallies and then using tactics right out of Karl Rove 's playbook .
This is wrong , and every Democrat should be outraged , " she said .
Obama denied Clinton 's assertions that the literature was false .
" There 's nothing in that mailing that is inaccurate , " he said , adding that he was puzzled by the sudden scrutiny since the mailers had been around for days , if not weeks .
" We have been subject to constant attack from the Clinton campaign , except for when we were down 20 points .
And that was true in Iowa .
It was true in South Carolina .
It was true in Wisconsin , and it is true now , " Obama said .
He described Clinton 's anger as " tactical " and defended his campaign .
" The notion that somehow we 're engaging in nefarious tactics I think is pretty hard to swallow . "
Watch Obama respond »
Clinton challenged Obama to " meet me in Ohio , and let 's have a debate about your tactics and your behavior in this campaign . "
The two are scheduled to meet for a debate next week in Cleveland , Ohio .
Obama spokesman Bill Burton said his campaign looked forward " to having a debate this Tuesday on the facts , and the facts are that Sen.
Clinton was a supporter of NAFTA and the China permanent trade treaties until this campaign began . "
" And she herself has said that under the Clinton health care plan , she would consider ' going after the wages ' of Americans who do n't purchase health insurance , whether they can afford it or not , " he added .
Saturday was not the first time the Clinton campaign has criticized mailings from the Obama campaign .
In late January , leading up to Super Tuesday contests on February 5 , the Clinton camp said Obama mailings distributed in Connecticut took Clinton 's statement about her Iraq war vote out of context .
The Obama flier said the New York senator had admitted voting in favor of the war even though she had not read an intelligence report that cast doubt on claims that Saddam Hussein 's government possessed weapons of mass destruction .
The Clinton campaign called the mailer misleading , saying only " a handful of senators " had read the report itself -- and that most , like Clinton , had instead opted for a briefing by the report 's authors .
Obama has accused both Clinton and her husband of engaging in unfair attacks .
Obama , who has rolled to 11 straight wins since Super Tuesday , leads Clinton by 140 pledged delegates , according to CNN estimates , going into the Texas and Ohio primaries .
Vermont and Rhode Island also hold primaries on that day .

All About Hillary Clinton • Barack Obama
We ’ve all been in this situation , and we ’ve all seen thousands of others in the same predicament .
It ’s a Thursday night , you and your girlfriend decide to run to Blockbuster or something like that to grab a DVD you do n’t currently have at home already because you ’re in the mood for something else .
Not sure what else … just something else .
You get to the video store , naively thinking it ’ll just take you a couple of minutes to grab something , and before you know it you ’ve been there over a half hour and you ’re no closer to picking out something you both want to see than you were when you first walked in .
Just last night I went to a video store to grab a copy of Ben Hur ( just after hearing about the passing of Charlton Heston ) .
When I walked in , I saw a couple looking on the new releases wall and making their way down ( I noticed them because she was HOT ) .
Anyway , I picked up my movie , then just looked a round a little bit and left .
I was there for about 15 minutes .
When I left , the couple was still there .
When I left , I hit a KFC across the street on Sunset Blvd because I was a little hungry and have been wanting to try those new toasted snackers they have .
I was in there for about 20 minutes .
When I was ready to leave I remembered another DVD I wanted to check out , so I walked back across the street to Blockbuster again … and guess what ….
the couple was STILL in there , now walking in front of the same wall again ( probably for about the 3rd time ) .
It took me about 10 minutes to find the DVD I was looking for , stood in line for about another 5 , and by the time I got out of there , the couple was STILL LOOKING .
By the time I left I figure that couple must have already been in there for about an hour .
We ’ve all been there .
Men and women have different tastes in movies , and so picking one up can been a bit of an exercise when you go together .
There are a few bad methods couples try to use thinking it will make things easier .
Some of these bad methods are :
BAD METHODS OF PICKING A DVD WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND
1 ) Take Turns Picking
This is a HORRIBLE idea .
The reason it ’s a horrible idea is you almost guarantee you ’ll never get a movie you ’ll both enjoy watching .
If it ’s his turn , he ’ll pick Transformers ( if he ’s any sort of a real man that is ) , and chances are , she wo n’t be that into it ( unless you ’re one of The Movie Blog Uncut girls that is ) .
When it ’s her turn , she picks up Sense and Sensibility which you probably wo n’t get much out of ( unless you imagine Kate Winslet transforming into giant robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex and kicking the crap out of Hugh Grant ) .
Yes it can work sometimes , but chances are she ’ll hate the one you pick on your own , you ’ll hate the one she picks on her own , and eventually a good DVD night does n’t sound like much fun for either of you .
2 ) Pick One Together
Another horrible idea unless you think spending your whole evening at the DVD store doing repeated laps around the place trying to pick one out sounds like a great night to you .
Then again , if you ’re in one of those relationships where you ’ve never had a fight yet and you wonder how the two of you will handle it once it comes along ….
then this method just might be for you !
Yes friends , these methods have lead to a lot of wasted hours and unhappy couples .
HOWEVER , a few years ago I started using a method that has almost always worked and left both people happy .
I ’m sure I ’m not the first person to come up with it , but I thought I ’d share it with you here .
I call it the 5 - 1 Method
HOW AND WHY THE 5 - 1 METHOD WORKS
Ok , here ’s how the 5 - 1 method works , it ’s really quite simple .
Once you get to the DVD store , 1 person ( on their own ) picks out 5 DVDs they ’d like to see .
When picking out the DVDs it ’s important to pick movies that you ’d like to see , but that you do n’t think the other person would HATE ( notice I did n’t say pick movies you think the other person will LIKE , but ones you do n’t instantly think they ’ll HATE ) .
This process goes pretty fast since picking out 5 you ’d like to see is ironically FASTER than trying to pick out just one .
Once the 5 are picked out , the second person picks 1 movie from the five picked by the other person .
It ’s just that simple .
You see , this way the first person is guaranteed to end up with a movie they ’re interested in seeing that night , and with 5 choices of movies that the first person does n’t think they ’ll hate , the second person has a pretty decent chance of getting a movie they ’re at least modestly interested in seeing .
The final decision on which movie they ’ll see is up to them ( the second person ) .
It ’s important that the first person picks at LEAST 5 dvds .
The more movies the first person picks , the higher the chances are that at least a couple of them will be ones the second person will have some interest in .
Here are some tips for making the 5 - 1 Method work even better :
a ) Scan the DVD store ’s website to see what ’s new in advance .
This will make the trip to the store itself even faster so more time can be spent at home watching the movie ( and hopefully time for breast access following the movie )
b ) Take turns between who picks the 5 and who makes the final choice .
In the 5 - 1 Method , the person who picks the initial 5 has the advantage because they are guaranteed to get a movie they ’re interested in .
Switch it up UNLESS you try it once one way and both parties like it like that .
c ) If possible , try to decide on a basic genre before hitting the store .
Comedy , Horror , Drama , Sci-Fi / Fantasy , Erotic , Period Piece … whatever .
This is n’t necessary , but it might make things go a bit faster and easier if you both happen to be in the mood for the same KIND of movie .
So there you have it .
Follow the 5 - 1 Method and the steps I laid out , and I guarantee you you ’ll be in and out of the DVD store much faster , almost ensure that you ’ll end up with a movie that you ’re both interested in seeing and greatly increase your chances for breast access ( which is what it ’s really all about anyway ) .

If ever there was an indictment of the wanton ways that the Pentagon wastes money , a new report by government auditors is it .
Dozens of the Pentagon ’s most costly weapons programs are billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule .
President Bush and a far - too - compliant Congress have already wasted more than $ 600 billion on the disastrous Iraq war .
Since Mr. Bush took office , the Pentagon ’s weapons acquisition budget has doubled from $ 790 billion in 2000 to $ 1.6 trillion last year .
Now , in stark terms , we see that an unseemly percentage of that money has gone to wasteful cost overruns and delays .
Even when weapons systems are finally delivered , investigators say , far too many fail to deliver the capabilities promised .
One example : the Joint Air - to - Surface Standoff Missile recorded four failures in four flight tests in 2007 .
Figures compiled by the Government Accountability Office showed that 95 major weapons systems  including ballistic missile defense , the Joint Strike Fighter and the Littoral Combat Ship  have exceeded their original budgets by a mind - numbing total of $ 295 billion in the past seven years .
In 2000 , new weapons were running 6 percent over initial cost estimates ; by 2007 , that figure had skyrocketed to 26 percent .
As we previously reported , New York Times columnist and author Thomas Friedman was officially “ pied ” last week , while giving an Earth Day Lecture at Brown University .
Friedman was ambushed just as he began his talk , entitled “ Green is the new Red , White & Blue . ”
The group that claimed responsibility call themselves “ The Greenwash Guerillas . ”
In a statement issued today , they said they targeted Friedman …
“ Because of his support for U.S. military intervention in the Middle East , neo-liberal economic policies that harm the world ’s poor , and especially for promoting bogus solutions to the global climate crisis . “
“ We sought to expose the hypocrisy of allowing Friedman , who is known for his influential support of U.S. wars for oil in the Middle East , to call himself an environmentalist , ” said Margaret Little , the Brown University student responsible for the creamy projectiles .
In the statement , the Greenwash Guerillas object to Friedman ’s support for nuclear power , coal power , industrial biofuels , and carbon trading markets .
“ These false solutions are smokescreens , intended to generate massive corporate profits while creating global humanitarian and environmental disasters . ”
Video of the pie throwing incident was posted on YouTube along with a couple of environmental blogs ( including this one ) .
The video had received close to 70,000 views in 36 hours on YouTube , before it was removed without warning or comment by YouTube .
The Greenwash Guerillas have now reposted the clip at their blog .
Ms. Little was suspicious of the disappearing video on YouTube , as she indicated in the statement :
“ Given the many other pieings on YouTube , the removal of the video can only be understood as an act of political censorship .
One has to wonder whether billionaire Friedman has more influence than “ you ” on YouTube . ”
The statement indicates that Little faces University disciplinary hearings , which could potentially lead to expulsion .
Colonel Custard , Little ’s male accomplice is still “ at - large ” ( although he is listed as the media contact and was probably responsible for emailing us the statement – so he ’s probably not that hard to find ) .

Believe it or not , there are a number of structures taller even than the infamous Burj Dubai .
The tallest structure in the world , however , is an unusual candidate that reaches more than twice as far down into the ocean as said tallest skyscraper reaches into the sky .
The Ursa tension - leg platform is an oil - production facility that is tethered to the ocean floor and is in many ways a surprising reverse of what most people imagine when they think of the world ’s tallest structures .
[ above : Images of and around the world ’s tallest structure via SmugMug ]
Radio towers and mine shafts have in many cases exceeded skyscraper heights , though of course these are supported by other means ( such as secondary cables and surrounding soils ) .
The Ursa platform is directly supported by its 4 primary tethers , though in an inverse way from how we normally understand load : the structure is held down rather than held up .
Not only is the Ursa platform the tallest structure in the world , it is also habitable : workers live day in and day out above the surface in modular attached dwelling spaces .
Despite the enormity and expense of the structure , which weighs over 35 million pounds and cost 1.5 billion dollars to construct , these workers live in anything but luxurious conditions but are well - compensated for their efforts .
On a more somber note : one has to wonder what it says about our world that the tallest structure is dedicated to harvesting a non-renewable resource and can not be repurposed .
Will this become another rogue micronation when it is no longer of use , or simply be left as a monument to times past when it is no longer considered to be of value ?

One of the contested P2P cases we 've been following is Atlantic Records v. Jeffery Howell , which is being heard in a federal court in Phoenix .
Howell and his wife have been representing themselves so far , but are going to get a bit of high - profile help tomorrow .
EFF staff attorney Fred von Lohmann is going to appear at a hearing tomorrow to argue that the mere presence of music in a KaZaA share is not enough to constitute copyright infringement .
The Howells were originally sued in 2006 .
In their original response to the RIAA 's complaint , they argued that KaZaA was " not set up to share " and that the files flagged by MediaSentry were " for private use " and " for transfer to portable devices , that is legal for ' fair use . ' "
In August of last year , Judge Neil V . Wake granted the RIAA 's motion for summary judgment , awarding the labels $ 40,500 in statutory damages and $ 350 in court costs .
The Howells appealed the ruling , saying that they were " unaware " that their " personal files " were being shared over KaZaA , and in late September , Judge Wake vacated the summary judgment .
Von Lohmann 's appearance in court tomorrow will be in support of a brief filed by the EFF in January .
In the filing , the EFF argued that the mere fact that songs were made available for download in a shared folder does not constitute copyright infringement .
The only downloading that anyone can demonstrate was done by MediaSentry with the RIAA 's explicit authorization and permission , which the public interest group argues does not constitute copyright infringement .
The " making available " argument is one that keeps resurfacing in contested cases , and was one of the factors in the Jammie Thomas trial .
The judge presiding over that case told the jury that the labels did not have to prove that anyone downloaded any files from Thomas — the mere fact that they were in a KaZaA share was sufficient to constitute copyright infringement .
Von Lohmann will argue against that reading of US copyright law in his appearance tomorrow .
Since the Copyright
Act specifically authorizes copyright owners to control copies distributed " to the public , " there needs to be evidence that said distribution actually took place .
" Where the only evidence of infringing distribution consists of distributions to authorized agents of the copyright owner , that evidence cannot , by itself , establish that other , unauthorized distributions have taken place , " reads the EFF 's brief .
The EFF has math on its side : with over 2.2 million KaZaA users online when MediaSentry downloaded the files , the group believes it 's highly unlikely that anyone would have grabbed the 11 songs in question , as they were popular songs and available from thousands of other users on KaZaA .
The fact that Judge Wake is hearing arguments on this issue is significant .
If he rules that the record labels have to show that someone aside from MediaSentry downloaded the files in order to prove infringement , it could prove to be a serious setback for the RIAA 's legal campaign .
At the very least , it would move Atlantic v. Howell further in the direction of a trial .

果たして違いは聞き分けられるのか？
そんな面白企画がその昔、オンラインA/Vマガジン『Audioholics』であったようです。使ったのは針金ハンガー4本を捻って半田付けして作ったスピーカーケーブルと、Monster
1000スピーカーケーブル。モンスターケーブルの値ごろ感を昔から追いかけてるギズモとしては、見逃せない拾い物です。
実験ではオーディオマニアの読者5人をひとつの部屋に集めて、Martin Logan SL-3スピーカーを1000KHzの75Dbにセットし、まだ誰も聴いたことのない｢スムーズなトリオのイージーリスニングのジャズ｣を流しました。再生したのは全部で7曲。その間ずっと目隠ししたままケーブルをとっかえひっかえ交換したそうです。
結果は｢テスト5回終了後まで誰もMonster 1000ケーブルがどっちで針金ハンガーがどっちか聞き分けできなかった｣とのこと（そもそも針金ハンガー使ってることは誰にも内緒だったようですけどね）。
しかも、針金ハンガーで音楽再生の際、音が良いか訊かれた時には、聞こえてきた音は素晴らしかったという意見で全員一致したんです。A-Bテストでは、でも、どっちのサウンドがべストか、どっちのワイヤーが使われてるかはほとんどの時間、判別不能でしたね。
まあ、集まったメンバーがたまたま、耳で違いが聞き分けられるほど超ハードコアなオーディオマニアじゃなかったのかもしれませんけど。実際、針金ハンガーでやっちゃうところがすごいですね。FYI。

Herto skull : Dated at between 160,000 and 154,000 years old
They are described as the oldest known fossils of modern humans , or Homo sapiens .
What excites scientists so much is that the specimens fit neatly with the genetic studies that have suggested this time and part of Africa for the emergence of mankind .
" All the genetics have pointed to a geologically recent origin for humans in Africa - and now we have the fossils , " said Professor Tim White , one of the co-leaders on the research team that found the skulls .
" These specimens are critical because they bridge the gap between the earlier more archaic forms in Africa and the fully modern humans that we see 100,000 years ago , " the University of California at Berkeley , US , paleoanthropologist told BBC News Online .
Out of Africa
The skulls are not an exact match to those of people living today ; they are slightly larger , longer and have more pronounced brow ridges .
Herto discovery :
The ancient people would have looked very like us
Enlarge Image
The Herto discoveries were hailed on Wednesday by those researchers who have championed the idea that all humans living today come from a population that emerged from Africa within the last 200,000 years .
The proponents of the so - called Out of Africa hypothesis think this late migration of humans supplanted all other human - like species alive around the world at the time - such as the Neanderthals in Europe .
If modern features already existed in Africa 160,000 years ago , they argued , we could not have descended from species like Neanderthals .
Sophisticated behaviour
" These skulls are fantastic evidence in support of the Out of Africa idea , " Professor Chris Stringer , from London 's Natural History Museum , told BBC News Online .
SEARCH FOR HUMAN ORIGINS ... this is definitively the answer to the question of whether Homo sapiens evolved from Africa
Dr Berhane Asfaw
Key questions about the skulls
The pride of Ethiopia
The skulls were found in fragments , at a fossil - rich site first identified in 1997 , in a dry and dusty valley .
Stone tools and the fossil skull of a butchered hippo were the first artefacts to be picked up .
Buffalo fossils were later recovered indicating the ancient humans had a meat - rich diet .
The most complete of the adult skulls was seen protruding from the ancient sediment ; it had been exposed by heavy rains and partially trampled by herds of cows .
The skull of the child - probably aged six or seven - had been shattered into more than 200 pieces and had to be painstakingly reconstructed .
All the skulls had cut marks indicating they had been de-fleshed in some kind of mortuary practice .
The polishing on the skulls , however , suggests this was not simple cannibalism but more probably some kind of ritualistic behaviour .
This type of practice has been recorded in more modern societies , including some in New Guinea , in which the skulls of ancestors are preserved and worshipped .
The Herto skulls may therefore mark the earliest known example of conceptual thinking - the sophisticated behaviour that sets us apart from all other animals .
" This is very possibly the case , " Professor White said .
The Ethiopian discoveries are reported in the journal Nature .
Let 's begin by taking apart the original 60 GB PS3 and identifying the parts within , shall we ?
The PS3 has an interestingly designed power supply , it 's curved to fit the case .
Pretty cool .
It accepts the AC wall power input and converts it to 12 volts DC for the PS3's main power supply .
This is done via a large copper 2 pronged plug that we 'll see a bit later .
In the front of the PSU are a few small wire connections .
These provide a 5 volt " rail " power ( always on ) that allows the PS3 to sense the front buttons and power itself on , much like a PC or the Xbox 360 .
However unlike the 360 / Wii this does not power the USB when the unit is off .

However unlike the 360 / Wii this does not power the USB when the unit is off .
Below that , we see the WiFi / Bluetooth module .
This connects to the main motherboard via a flat ribbon cable and also has a small antenna attached via a cord , much like the Wii .
This part of the PS3 must remain , not only for the WiFi , but for the controllers to work .

Card reader .
Since we 're already going to take up space keeping the WiFi board the card reader pretty much has to go .
( It 's fairly useless anyway , if you ask us . )
On older machines , things like this can be kept or simply moved by rewiring their connections , but on the PS3 everything is connected by 0.5 mm pitch flat ribbon cables , and thus is practically impossible to rewire by hand .
( More on this when we get to the Blu-ray drive . )

( More on this when we get to the Blu- ray drive . )
E - Z Touch Power Switch .
Well , technically the eject and power buttons work with capacitance , kind of like those metal lamps you can touch to turn on .
We can leave this circuit board where it is , and simply attach wires to the capacitance button tabs to put the touch sensors elsewhere .
( More on this later )
As for the LED 's , they can also be rewired as they are fairly simple .

Blu -ray drive .
This is the baby that allows you to watch " Die Hard 4 " at the bargain price of $ 35 .
This photo is a bit old , well before HD - DVD bought the farm , and I 'd labeled a Blu-ray drive as an albatross , but now it appears Sony probably gambled and won with that idea .
The discs are still too expensive if you ask me .
( I guess they are made from petroleum ... )

Next , break off the 3 mounting tabs from the top surface of the metal frame - note how they are a different color than the frame itself .
This will make the overall motherboard assembly a little thinner and easier to work with .
Be sure not to bend the main metal frame , otherwise it might not fit correctly back onto the motherboard or correctly heatsink the ICs that use it .
It may also be useful to drill out the stamped rivets to remove the brackets .
Try and keep the dust off of the heat sinks pad if at all possible .
A good rule of thumb when taking apart electronics is that if you can't find the last screw to remove a shell - or ANY screws to remove a shell as with the PS3 , it 's probably under a warranty sticker of some kind .
On the hard drive / base end of the PS3 is a sticker of this sort -- poke through it with a Phillips screwdriver to undo the top shell screw .
The shell will then slide off to reveal ...... the inner shell , as shown above .
When first opened the PS3 looks quite similar to Darth Vader in that scene from Empire Strikes Back when the dude sees him with his helmet partially off .
What , you do n't see it ?
Whatever , at this point we 'll find the lion 's share of screws that must be removed to continue disemboweling the PS3 .
When taking apart expensive electronics it 's often a good idea to use masking tape to label each screw hole with the type of screw you find in case you need to put the unit back together at some point , as shown above .
To remove the card reader door , simply lift and snap it out .
Before the inner shell comes off we 'll have to insert a flat - head screwdriver in the hole on the upper right corner .
This will snap off the shell and allow us to continue .
With the inner shell removed the 60 gig PS3 will appear as shown above .
Some notes regarding these parts :
Let 's pull the PS3 apart further , shall we ?
First off is the card reader module .
Use a pair of tweezers to carefully rotate down the clasp on the ZIF ( zero insertion force ) socket holding the ribbon cable .
You can then remove the cable and the module .
Use it to prop up a leg on a wobbly table or something , a card reader is n't of much use in this project .
( Unless you 're madly in love with it for some reason . )
Next is the WiFi antenna , with a connection just like the one on the Wii and Xbox 360 WiFi adapter ( see my other projects ) .
Use tweezers to carefully lift it up and off the board .
Save the antenna assembly for later .
The WiFi will work without it , but it 's good to put back on anyway .
Next , disengage the ribbon cables and remove the WiFi module and touch switch PCB in the same manner as the card reader .
Let 's move onto the power supply .
Start by pulling out the AC power plug from the back .
Then unscrew the ground connection from the motherboard frame .
Fun fact : disconnecting this gets rid of the ground loop hum heard when using the analog audio .
You can now unscrew and lift off the power supply .
Now we see the main 12 volt DC input plug -- quite hefty , is n't it ?
We 'll reduce the height of this later .
Next comes the Blu-ray drive removal .
Notice how it 's not actually bolted in place or anything , just held by good old cheap mechanical retention .
The connections going to the drive are a 90 lead thin ribbon cable and a small connection for power .
Due to complexity of this ribbon cable ( and the fact that it is n't something simple like the SATA interface on the 360 ) we 'll have to use it for the final product .
For now , use tweezers to CAREFULLY lift up the flaps on the ZIF sockets to detach the cable from the PS3 motherboard .
Also note that one of the chips on the drive 's PCB has a pad because it uses the RF shielding as a heat sink .
We 'll need to remember this later on and be careful not to run the drive for more than a minute or two ( during the testing / experimentation process ) without some sort of heat sinking in place .
At this point the PS3 should look like the above .
The large clamps in the center are clearly for the CPU / GPU heat sinks .
At this point we could leave the main unit as is and mod around it , but attaching USB port extensions -- and nagging curiosity -- mandates we have to break it down further .
Lifting the main unit out of the case reveals the simply massive ( yet quiet ) fan inside the PS3 .
( You could probably install this sucker on a Chevy Metro and get away with it . )
But hey , we do n't hear about massive numbers of PS3's overheating either , do we ?
The fan connects to the motherboard via a simple two wire plug .
Let 's continue to take the frame apart by pulling out the built - in 2.5 - inch SATA drive .
This is done by simply removing the lock screw ( do n't lose it ) , lifting the tab and sliding the drive out .
Like the Blu-ray drive , it would be too difficult to desolder the SATA connection from the mother so we 'll just leave the drive in its original position for the final configuration .
Next , use tweezers to unplug the PS3's battery .
Like the Wii's battery , unplugging this does not cause any critical data to be lost , as far we could tell .
Now it 's time to remove the radiator .
Unscrew both of the heat clamps to release it from the motherboard .
The PS3 uses more heat pipes than any electronic device we 've yet seen , although we 're light on supercomputer mods .
The PS3 motherboard with the radiator off .
White thermal grease can be found on the CPU / GPU , much like on the PS2 .
We 'll replace this with Arctic Silver thermal compound , as we did in the Xbox 360 Laptop .
Next , remove the metal frame from around the motherboard .
At this point it 's only held in place by a few final screws , and some " hinge tabs " at one end , requiring you to tilt the frame up and pull it out .
It 's important to note that several ICs on the motherboard have pads which allow them to sink their heat to the frame .
They are usually white , gray or black in color .
When handling the board be sure these pads remain in their original places so they will contact what they are intended to when putting the frame back together .
Some of the pads may stay on the metal frame , so pull the frame off slowly so you can see where all the pads are and / or should be .
If you need to move a pad , grasp it gently with tweezers and peel it off slowly , to avoid crushing or ripping it .
Also take care to keep them clean of dust and debris .
These ICs should look very familiar to anyone who 's ever been inside a PS2 -- it 's the combo Emotion Engine / Graphics Synthesizer and the RAM ( small black squares ) .
If Sony continued including all previous system ICs in new consoles , the PS5 motherboard will be approximately the size of a football field .
Notice how there 's a heat sink pad on this as well -- be sure it stays in place on the shielding for proper cooling .
Before we move on it's best to clean the thermal grease off of the main ICs before it can make a mess / stain your favorite shirt , or whatever .
For best results , remove the grease with some high - grade rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs until they are shiny and clean .
To get the thermal grease off the sides or edges , use toothpicks to scrape it off .
Side note : the GPU is called the " Reality Synthesizer " -- it 's note quitegood , but hey .
The bare PS3 motherboard .
Overall it 's quite thin , except for the USB ports , which unfortunately are n't easy to remove .
Now we 'll add a breakout cable for the USB connections .
Due to the nature of this motherboard it is rather difficult to desolder items such as the USB ports , and thus it 's easier to simply add connections onto them .
For this I 've chosen an old computer ribbon cable with a female header receptacle end .
This one has the proper number of pins -- four per USB port x 4 ports = 16 pins .
Shown above is a blown - up of a USB port as seen on the motherboard .
The pin-outs are fairly simple , +5 , DAT -, DAT + and Ground .
They are always in that order , and ground is always the pin connected to the main surface ( fill plain ) of the motherboard .
You can also check with a multimeter , ground is always -- without fail -- the outer copper edge of the motherboard .
See if that connects to any suspected ground pin -- on the USB or otherwise -- and you 're golden .
In the photo above we can see that the pin-outs on the header have been logged into a notebook .
This is always a good idea , especially when you have a system that will eventually have a lot of re-wired and / or manually created plugs .
It 's also important to " key " the header block , either by knocking out one of the holes ( I usually stick in and break off the tip of a toothpick ) or using a metallic ink pen to label the plastic , as shown above .
We 'll attach the male header ( gold item on right side of photo ) in a later installment .
The general plan here is to have 3 USB ports available at the front of the unit and reserve one for the built - in keyboard .
Now let 's modify and reinstall the metal frame .
Using a Dremel and a cut - off wheel make an opening in the metal frame near the USB port section , large enough for the header to fit through .
Be sure to wear safety goggles when doing this sort of work !
At this point the top half of the metal frame should look like the above .
We wo n't need to make any adjustments to the bottom half of it .
Next we 'll reattach the heat sinks / radiator .
Spread a thin layer of Arctic Silver thermal compound over the CPU and GPU as shown above and described on their packaging .
( See site for details .)
We usually do this while wearing latex glove ( the kind that are n't powdered ) .
This is much cleaner and keeps skin oils off the surface .
Now we 'll reattach the heat sink clamps .
Be sure they are tight and screw down evenly ( to the same depth ) to ensure the clamping is even across the chip surfaces .
Also , remember to plug the big fan back into the motherboard !
At this point the PS3's main board can be used again , as shown in the configuration test above .
Note how the Blu-ray drive is in its original position so the chip on it can be heat sinked to the frame .
In the next installment , we 'll discuss how to arrange the parts of the PS3 to fit them inside of a laptop - style case , the design of the case , and the LCD screen that we 'll use .
See you next time !
That brought UBS ’s total write - downs to nearly $ 40 billion  more than any other bank ’s  and UBS expects to post a first - quarter loss of $ 12 billion .
But its plan to raise new capital quashed fears that the bank , based in Zurich , was facing deeper threats because of the subprime woes .
UBS ’s financial woes caused another casualty , however , in its executive suite .
UBS ’s longtime chairman , Marcel Ospel , abruptly resigned Tuesday after months of criticism from shareholders .
Last summer , Peter Wuffli , the bank ’s chief executive , was among the first of a series of high - profile financiers to be forced out by subprime losses .
Now , with Mr. Ospel ’s departure , UBS has joined American giants like Merrill Lynch and Citigroup in cleaning house at the top .
UBS said its general counsel , Peter Kurer , would succeed Mr. Ospel .
Lehman Brothers , the investment firm hit by worries about its ability to weather the downturn , is already close to raising $ 4 billion in fresh funds from investors .
That is far more than the $ 3 billion it said it would seek , which analysts read as evidence of confidence in its future .
Financial stocks in Europe , including those of UBS , Deutsche Bank and Société Générale , as well as those of their American counterparts  including Lehman , Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Merrill Lynch , Bank of America and Goldman Sachs  surged Tuesday .
While the willingness of investors to put up fresh cash for Lehman and UBS underscores that they are in a stronger position than Bear Stearns , which was forced to sell itself to JPMorgan last month , the mortgage mess remains a threat .
Not only are tens of billions in troubled home loans that remain on the books of banks hard to value , but potential buyers for these assets have evaporated in recent months amid fears that a recession in the United States might threaten swaths of the credit market that were previously thought to be safe .
WASHINGTON  Most pundits describe this presidential election as the first " open " race since 1952 , the last time a president or a vice president was n't a serious contender .
Presidential scholar Charles Jones disagrees , claiming New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton has run as a " self - declared heir apparent . "
Clinton is doing so , Jones says , by stressing her White House experience during her husband 's eight - year presidency .
Jones says Clinton is one of only four such candidates in the nation 's history .
Jones ' analysis , described in a new paper for the Brookings Institution , helps explain why the Democrats ' one - time prohibitive front - runner might not get her party 's nomination .
The woman who is trying to make history may have fundamentally misunderstood the moment in which she ran .
By stressing her experience in her husband 's White House in the 1990s and by portraying rival Barack Obama as an unprepared newcomer , Clinton invited de facto incumbency and a rehash of old fights in an era in which any whiff of status quo politics is toxic .
Clinton fatigue and the anti-dynastic sentiment of two decades of Bushes and Clintons in the Oval Office have been widely debated .
But the value of White House experience has n't , and Jones says it is often overrated when Americans choose their presidents , even in times of national stress .
" Mount Rushmore 's faces include but one president with significant White House experience before serving , " concluded Jones , a professor emeritus at the University of Wisconsin .
He was referring to Thomas Jefferson .
The other three faces on South Dakota 's famous mountain were primarily known as a general ( George Washington ) , a roughrider governor ( Teddy Roosevelt ) , and a country lawyer ( Abraham Lincoln ) before they became presidents .
In Clinton 's favor , two of the other three " self - declared heir apparent " candidates — those citing previous White House experience as a rationale for their election — became president .
Jefferson was elected in 1800 and Richard Nixon in 1968 .
Walter Mondale lost in 1984 .
But to Clinton 's detriment , Jones says , " heir apparentness is no guarantee of victory even for sitting vice presidents . "
Furthermore , he concludes , " Political experience alone is an uncertain predictor of the quality of presidential service .
Other aspects play a significant role , to include character , vision , goals , self - confidence , communication , public regard and , above all , leadership . "
Studying all presidential elections , Jones identified three other " heir apparent " categories : • " Affirmation , " which are presidents seeking re-election .
• " Endorsement , " outsiders , like William Howard Taft in 1908 , backed by presidents .
• " Inheritance , " sitting vice presidents seeking the presidency .
In Clinton 's defense , leadership and experience questions have been very hard to gauge in 2008 .
Roughly two of three Americans say the country is going in the wrong direction and disapprove of Republican George W. Bush 's job performance .
Yet presumptive Republican nominee John McCain runs even with Clinton and Obama in general election mockups .
In a peculiar way , negative views of Bush 's leadership may be feeding this dichotomy .
There are deeply consequential issues driving voters this year , but with so many Americans concluding that Bush is a failed president , the leadership characteristics of his potential successors also are elevated in voter calculations .
Leadership characteristics appear to be bigger problems for Obama and Clinton than they are for McCain .
A Gallup Poll taken March 24 - 27 found that 39 % of voters think Obama is not experienced or qualified enough , and 24 % did not trust Clinton .
While 27 % said McCain 's support of the Iraq War was his biggest fault , the percentages of those questioning his trustworthiness or experience did not break double digits .
Jones said historians might question why Clinton emphasized her first lady experience over " a really quite impressive record as a senator . "
Running as an heir apparent has opened Clinton to unprecedented questions about what Jones called a " two - headed presidency . "
The questions came with considerable Bill Clinton baggage .
For example , Hillary Clinton has had to explain qualms she said she had about the free trade agreements passed during her husband 's presidency .
Once signature accomplishments of Bill Clinton 's presidency , the agreements have become more unpopular in a worsening economic climate , and Clinton is now calling for a " time out " on any new ones .

[ Editor ’s Note :
This article makes characterizations – that Impeach for Peace is a ‘ Primarily Democratic Organization ’ – which are inaccurate since Impeach for Peace is a non-partisan organization and no poll has been taken of it ’s member ’s political affiliations if any . ]
by Michael Cavlan – MN Green Party nominee for Senator
“ Now the gloves are off . ”
Let me explain that statement .
First , on the issue of Impeachment , either you get it or you do n’t .
Sadly , the Democratic Parties leadership are of the latter , they do n’t and apparently wo n’t get it .
Former Federal Prosecutor , Elizabeth de la Vega has done a supreme job on making of the case for Impeachment .
Far more eloquently and concisely than I ever could .
My name is Michael Cavlan , Registered Nurse , active in the group Impeach For Peace impeachforpeace.org and the Green Party candidate for US Senate in Minnesota 2006 .
I was also the second politician in the country to publicly call for Impeachment , two days after the now infamous Downing Street Memo became public .
Chairman of the Judiciary Committee , John Conyers was the first .
He later arrested Cindy Sheehan in his office for staging a sit down protest in his office due to his effectively taking it “ off the table . ”
I can now safely say that I was the first to say it and actually mean it .
More on Representative Conyers later .
Fellow progressives , we need to be honest with ourselves and understand something .
The Democratic Party and it ’s corporate corrupted leadership have not simply been inactive on this issue of Impeachment .
Democratic “ leadership ” have actually been fighting and blocking Impeachment all over the country .
I base this statement of fact on my four years of experience in the Impeachment movement .
I have worked with Impeach For Peace and have made the statement that on this issue , I have been deliberately non-partisan because it is so important .
Now , with what happened to the Dennis Kucinich Bill HR 799 that has changed my entire perspective .
At this time I told my local Minnesota Democratic friends in Impeach For Peace that my ceasefire was over and that the “ gloves were indeed off . ”
There has been no argument from them on this .
As I told them , it was time to look seriously at “ Plan B ” for Impeachment .
More on “ Plan B ” and what it entails in a minute .
Let me explain what the corporate media and the corporatized leadership of the Democratic Party will not tell you .
We need to understand that their actions and lack of actions are actually protecting the Bush Administration and their illegal activity from the wrath of “ We The People . ”
All over the country , while rank and file Democrats and indeed the majority of the American people want to have Bush and Cheney Impeached , the Democratic party leadership have done everything in their power to stop Impeachment .
While at the same time , hyping us all up on how evil those in the Bush Administration are .
Of course this mirrors the blatant lie on the Iraq war , where the Democrats tell us about needing 60 votes in the Senate to stop the Iraq war .
That is a lie as the truth is , they only need 41 votes to block funding for this illegal and immoral war .
Just do n’t expect a Democrat politician or their apologists to tell us that .
So it is with Impeachment .
The lie being perpetrated on a lack of Impeachment and accountability is that “ it will make the Democrats look bad , small and spiteful . ”
Just as the lie on not having enough votes to stop the war , so this lie must be exposed .
The truth is that having the Congress call for Impeachment will do two very important things at the same time .
It will begin the public investigation into the crimes of the Bush Administration and then the corporate media will be unable to ignore the issue further .
They will be forced into investigating and reporting it in a serious and meaningful way .
The second part is , in my book even more important than the first .
With the American people awakened to the crimes being perpetrated in our names , the groundswell of support for Impeachment will take off immediately .
Instead , we have seen the movement for Impeachment squashed all over the country .
From Vermont , to New Mexico and elsewhere all over our country it has been stifled and marginalized .
Not by the “ greater evil ” Republican Party but instead by the “ lesser evil ” Democratic Party .
So very often , going against the wishes of the rank and file Democrats .
As I stated earlier I have been working with a primarily Democratic organization Impeach For Peace and have witnessed this phenomena going on all over the nation , as well as locally .
Our federal government has failed us , all of us .
Instead of standing up and protecting us , they have blocked and stalled the Impeachment Movement all over our nation .
By their actions and equally important , lack of action our elected officials have abandoned their oath to “ defend and protect the Constitution from all enemies , foreign and domestic . ”
Even more damning , they have , as stated earlier actually protected the Bush Administration from being held accountable by us for their criminal and immoral actions .
In Minnesota recently Congressman John Conyers was recently challenged on this very point .
He told us that it was more important to be re-elected and have a Democrat in the White House than this critical issue of accountability for those criminals in the White House .
These are his words here , not mine .
I told him that we have reached a point in our nation that we need to hold those people accountable who refuse to hold this criminal Administration itself accountable .
Remember this term for later .
Then we have the earlier mentioned HR 799 , entered into the political record by Dennis Kucinich .
What happened to that Bill irrefutably makes my case .
When presidential candidate Kucinich used his position and privilege as a Congressman to introduce this bill , calling for the Impeachment of Dick Cheney look at what happened .
It was the Democratic Party which attempted to table it , to effectively kill the Bill and all that it stood for , accountability .
Yet in a stunning turn around , it was the Republicans who actually kept it alive , in an obvious attempt to make the Democrats look bad .
In fact the story goes that an unnamed Republican “ accidently ” dropped his pen where he could not reach it .
Then the Republicans quickly had a meeting and decided to keep it alive , obviously for what they perceived as short term political gain .
At the obvious behest of House leader Nancy Pelosi , the Bill was then sent to the Judiciary Committee , where it currently sits .
We must note that it now sits with it ’s virtual mirror HR 333 which also calls for the Impeachment of Cheney .
HR 333 has been languishing with no movement for over six months now and it appears that HR 799 will suffer the same fate , as was intended .
For all intended purposes “ Mission Accomplished ” or so it would appear .
It was at this point that I told my friends in Impeach For Peace that “ the gloves are off . ”
Now we need to analyze why the Democratic Party leadership would make such a horrific political blunder .
Some have put it down to yet another example of “ the Dems spinelessness and cowardice again . ” I disagree .
I hold , firmly that the reason that Nancy Pelosi , Barck Obama , Hillary Clinton , yes even John Edwards and John Conyers have been guilty of these unbelievable acts of craven cowardice is not just simple lack of political will and spine .
I put it to you all , very directly that the real reason that they are not moving and in fact are attempting to kill Impeachment is much deeper and troubling .
The plain and simple reason that the Democratic Party are willing to go against the will of the majority , not just in their Party but indeed the general public is this simple and chilling .
Their owners wo n’t let them .
Their owners are , of course the wealthy , monied corporate interests who own the entire political system , media and just about everything else in our country .
Those people and interests who fund campaigns , the ones responsible for the slick , glitzy TV adds , the fancy glossy brochures and parades that we often attend .
The very groups and people that the Democratic party claims to fighting against .
They own them , they are not our representatives , they are theirs .
Years of watching good , honest people “ petitioning ” them has made that clear to me .
The sooner we all come to that realization and fight for a true representative , grassroots government , the sooner we can actually achieve it .
Of course that means we have to look honestly and realistically on where we are and just how bad and deep the mess we find ourselves is .
“ They ” are not the solution , they are a manifestation of the problem we face .
I base this on the dual understanding , the undeniable truth that corporate interests own both political parties .
Corporations do not like instability and Impeachment would indeed create some short term instability in the market .
So they are probably threatening to withhold their campaign constibutions if Impeachment is not “ taken off the table . ”
Plan B
This leads us to Plan B and all that entails , given the realities just described .
Here in Minnesota we are starting to organize a plan , a call to action .
Since the federal government have indeed failed us all so dramatically , we need to go local . .
According to the Thomas Jefferson Manuel On Impeachment , there is another way to institute the will of We The People in regards to Impeachment .
Apparently Jefferson foresaw the situation we find ourselves in today .
he gave us the blueprint for Plan B .
It is this simple .
We need to have just One State House and Senate pass , together a Resolution for Impeachment .
That happens and the Congress which has failed us by refusing to even bring it to the House is forced to put all other business aside and deal with Impeachment .
Here in Minnesota we are , even now planning for a Call To Impeachment Rally on the steps of the St Paul Minnesota Capitol .
It is planned for February 15th , the first day of business for the Minnesota House and Senate .
At the end of the rally , we in essence Storm the Bastille .
The message will be clear , crystal clear .
We are not “ lobbying ” or begging for Impeachment , we are demanding it .
We will also be crystal clear in this message .
If the politicians we talk to , do not actively do everything in their power to promote Impeachment , we will hold them accountable .
They will face opposition in the next election and their oppositions message will be simple .
He or she will face another candidate running against him with this message , “ this person violated his oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution from all enemies , foreign and domestic . ”
We will ask them , in very plan language [ if ] they want to face the accusation that “ they actually protected the Bush Administration ? ”
The simple beauty of this plan is that we will be afforded the opportunity of talking to people and potentially affecting them , on the local level where they are much less beholden to the corporate interests which has made our democracy “ the best that money can buy ” on the Federal level , as investigative journalist Greg Palast has pointed out .
Of course it would be beautiful if Minnesota did this , which we will but can we imagine the impact of California , Hawaii , New York , Pennsylvania , West Virginia , Arizona , New Mexico and a host of other states did the same thing ?
This is your call to action .
Make it happen .
As is often the case , if you face a career politician who will use the structure of his political party and it ’s apparatus , then this is your opportunity to use us , the Green Party .
That way you ca n’t be crushed or marginalized in a primary race by those who are better funded than you .
Get involved in your local Green Party and seek the Green endorsement in your run for office .
If you do n’t know how , contact myself at [ email protected ] or ( 612)327-6902 .
We can actually make this thing happen .
We can and should put Impeachment and accountability back on the table .
It is our table to set after all , although those in Washington Dc seem to have forgotten that .
Like I said at the start of this piece , I had very deliberately been non-partisan on the issue of Impeachment because it was so critical .
I am now strictly partisan for the same reason .
Now is the time to get active on Impeachment .
Let us hold the Bush Administration accountable for their crimes .
Not just because it is the right thing to do but to ensure that their are no further abuses of power in the future .
Let us all do this now , acting as though the very future of our democratic Republic depends on it .
It just may .

The United Nations tribunal set up to deal with the worst acts committed during the Balkan wars of the 1990s today acquitted a former prime minister of Kosovo of charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity .
Ramush Haradinaj , 39 , who was also a well - known commander in the Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) during the conflict with Serb forces in 1998 - 99 , had faced charges that included murder , rape , torture , abduction , cruel treatment , imprisonment and the forced deportation of Serbian and Kosovar Roma civilians .
But judges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ( ICTY ) , based in The Hague , found that the evidence presented was sometimes inconclusive as to whether a crime had been committed or , if so , whether the KLA was involved as alleged .
The ICTY also acquitted one of Mr. Haradinaj ’s co-accused , Idriz Balaj , 36 , of all charges .
But a third co-accused , Lahi Brahimaj , 38 , was convicted of the cruel treatment and torture of two people at the KLA headquarters in Jablanica / Jabllanic ë and has been sentenced to six years in jail .
The three men had been accused by prosecutors of being part of a joint criminal enterprise between March and September 1998 that aimed to consolidate the KLA ’s total control over the Dukagjin area in north - western Kosovo by unlawfully removing , mistreating and killing Serbian and Kosovar Roma civilians , as well as Kosovar Albanians perceived to have been collaborating with Serbian forces .
But the judges said the evidence indicated the victims may have been targeted mainly for individual reasons rather than because they were members of a targeted civilian group .
The acts of ill - treatment , forcible transfer and killing were also not of a scale to conclude there was an attack against a civilian population .
Judge Alphonsus Orie ( presiding ) said the ICTY had encountered many difficulties in securing testimony from witnesses during the trials of Mr. Haradinaj , Mr. Balaj and Mr. Brahimaj .
“ The Chamber gained a strong impression that the trial was being held in an atmosphere where witnesses felt unsafe , ” he said .
Classic Umair Haque considering the conundrum :
Why are n't there more Googles ?
( as in revolutionary companies that are developing business around the new economic models possible because of the web ) :
The answer 's very simple .
Because every company that had the potential to be economically revolutionary over the last five years sold out long before it ever had the chance to revolutionize anything economically .
Think about that for a second .
Every single one : Myspace , Skype , Last.fm , del.icio.us , Right Media , the works .
All sold out to behemoths who are destroying , with Kafkaesque precision , every ounce of radical innovation within them .
Let 's replay the Google story .
Google , despite serious interest from Microsoft and Yahoo - what must have seemed like lucrative interest at the time - did n't sell out .
Google might simply have been nothing but Yahoo ’s or MSN ’s search box .
Why is n’t it ?
Because Google had a deeply felt sense of purpose : a conviction to change the world for the better .
Because it did , it held on and revolutionized the advertising value chain – and , in turn , capital markets gave Google an exuberant welcome .
It reminds me of Ross Mayfield 's view of Silicon Valley , a hotbed of aspirant revolutionaries , that its most interesting players are all interested first and foremost in changing the world .
On a human level though , I wonder how hard is it to keep your convictions when someone comes along and offers to really change your world , secure a future for you and your family , end the years of uncertainty etc . ?
: : By the way , if you have n't read Umair Haque , or have tried and felt a bit lost - he 's published a " story so far " primer which might be helpful in getting a handle on his thinking .
Well worth it .
The head of the world 's biggest Muslim body , the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) , has called for Israelis to be tried by an international war crimes court for " heinous " attacks against Palestinians .
Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu , secretary - general of the 57 - nation body told an OIC summit in Senegal that Israel was repeatedly seeking to undermine foreign - brokered peace plans .
" The situation in Palestine remains deplorable due to the successive crises , fabricated by Israel , to stall the peace process and to thwart the many peace plans and initiatives proposed by the international community , " he said .
" It has become indispensable that these aggressions and heinous crimes be officially documented , and their perpetrators be brought before international justice designed for these kind of acts ... such as the International Criminal Court . "
Israel 's five - day offensive in Gaza last week killed more than 125 Palestinians .
An Israeli spokesman dismissed Ihsanoglu 's remarks , saying the source of the problem was rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israeli towns .
" These comments are baseless and we reject them outright , " foreign ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said .
UN secretary - general Ban Ki-moon told the summit that Israel 's " disproportionate and excessive use of force " had killed and injured many civilians including children and called for the violence to stop .
" I condemn these actions and call on Israel to cease such acts .
Israel must fully comply with international humanitarian law and exercise utmost restraint , " he told the summit .
" At the same time I also condemn the rocket attacks directed against Israel and call for the immediate cessation of such acts .
They serve no purpose , endanger Israeli civilians and bring misery to the Palestinian people . "
Renewed violence in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank , following a week of relative calm , have threatened prospects for an Egyptian - brokered truce .
Islamic Jihad fired rockets into Israeli town of Sderot from the Gaza Strip after an Israeli raid in the occupied West Bank but no -one was injured .
Israel , which had not struck in the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip in a week , attacked from the air a rocket launcher in the town of Beit Hanoun after Sderot was hit .
No one was hurt .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas earlier accused Israel of " ethnic cleansing " in Jerusalem by banning the building of Palestinian homes and cutting the city off from the rest of the occupied West Bank .
" Our people in the city are facing an ethnic cleansing campaign through a set of Israeli decisions , such as imposing heavy taxes , banning construction and closing Palestinian institutions , in addition to separating the city from the West Bank by the racist separation wall , " Mr Abbas told the OIC summit .
A spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , Mark Regev , condemned Mr Abbas 's " inflammatory " comments .

Stuff is cheap .
Really .
Yes , a gallon of gasoline is far more expensive than it was last year , but adjusted for inflation it costs about what it did in 1981 .
In fact , lots of things , such as clothing , electronics and restaurant meals , are , by historical standards , cheap .
In December 1978 , ads in this newspaper listed a VCR at Sears for $ 795 -- more than $ 2,500 in today ’s dollars .
A basic five - cycle washing machine ?
Back then , $ 319.95 , which translates to about $ 1,000 .
It ’s cheaper now to enjoy an eight - day vacation in Honolulu .
One local travel agency last week was selling that package for $ 750 , airfare included , but in 1978 an ad in The Times offered it at the equivalent of $ 1,074 .
So why do we feel so squeezed ?
It ’s the paradox of our new world order : Stuff is cheap , but the things that truly sustain us are not .
Globalization and efficiencies in distribution and retailing have cut production costs and consumer prices widely .
Americans now spend about 10 % of their income on food , down from 18 % in 1958 .
But while prices have dropped for consumer items over time , so have real wages .
Average weekly earnings in the private sector in 2007 were 15 % below the 1972 peak in real terms , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Along with falling wages , we ’re paying more for benefits .
Health insurance premiums rose 78 % from 2002 to 2007 , according to the Kaiser Family Foundation .
Retirement costs more as well .
We spent 4 % more on pensions and Social Security in 2005 than in 1990 in real terms , census figures show .
And we ’re spending a lot more on education .
Yearly total costs at some elite private colleges now exceed the U.S. median household income .
Many public universities have steadily increased their prices too , and at UCLA , students shell out more for parking ( $ 225 a quarter ) and textbooks ( more than $ 100 for a single tome in many classes ) than generations of students paid for tuition at University of California campuses in the first half of the 20th century .
There ’s another side to the paradox .
As we earn less , we want more .
In 1970 , 36 % of new homes were less than 1,200 square feet , the National Assn. of Home Builders reports .
Today , 4 % of new homes are that petite .
One in 10 new houses was 2,400 square feet or more in 1970 ; 42 % are that large now .
The want - more scenario is also the case with cars ( which , interestingly , cost more even adjusted for inflation ) .
A 2008 , six - cylinder Honda Accord makes greater horsepower ( 268 ) than a 1990 Porsche 911 Carrera ( 247 ) .
The price of the Accord ’s power is gas mileage ( 19 miles per gallon in the city ) that ’s not much better than that of the Porsche ( 16 mpg ) .
That ’s our world today .
Because it costs less to produce things and often costs less to buy them , many of us can easily afford items once considered luxurious .
But things we once took for granted as affordable -- healthcare , education , a secure retirement -- cost us dearly and for many are out of reach .

Introduction to Django : Helping Perfectionists With Deadlines
In : Articles
By Dan Ellis
Django is an open - source Web framework , written in Python , that allows you to easily and rapidly develop interactive , data - centric web applications .
It came into being when two Web developers — Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison — in Kansas , after moving their newspaper ’s website from PHP to Python , found themselves repeatedly solving similar problems .
They decided to extract the common functionality and released the resulting framework in 2005 .
Python
Python itself is an interpreted programming language that belongs to the same class of languages as Ruby , Perl and , to some extent , PHP .
It was n’t designed specifically for writing web applications like PHP was , but it is a very flexible , easy - to - learn , object - oriented language that can be applied to many tasks .
The one thing you ’ll notice about it right away is that it uses indentation rather than braces for blocks of code .
If you ’re anything like me , that might put you off until you try it and realize that it makes code a lot more readable .
Python ’s motto is batteries included , which refers to the wealth of modules available in the standard library , a large proportion of which is devoted to handling various internet protocols .
The Python website has lots of useful information for beginners .
How Django applications are built
For a typical working application you need to create three things : a data model , at least one view , and a URL mapping .
The data Model describes the kind of objects your application stores and displays — an online store might have customers , products , categories , orders , payment types , shipping options , etc .
Each model has attributes , such as a name and address for a customer , and a title , description , and price for a product .
If you have been exposed to any object - oriented programming these will be familiar concepts , but if you have n’t , do n’t worry , it ’s not a pre-requisite .
Views are bits of Python code that decide how to respond to a request from a browser and create an appropriate response , which is most often a page of HTML .
Finally , it is the URL mappings that determine which view will be used .
For example , you might decide that ` /` is handled by a view called `index` , and ` / products / ` is handled by a view called `all_products` .
It gets really interesting when you start using arguments .
Instead of having a URL like `http://example.com/display_product.php?product=123`
( which , let ’s face it , is just plain ugly ) you can have a URL like `http://example.com/products/123/` and have Django use the `product_detail` view with an argument of “ 123 ” .
You are then free to pull product 123 out of the database and create an HTML page with information about it .
This does n’t just make URLs look prettier ( which is a bonus in itself ) , but has a number of other benefits .
Tim Berners - Lee , the creator of the web , wrote about this in his essay Cool URIs Do n’t Change .
Interacting with your data
Like other frameworks , Django uses a model - view - controller paradigm where your data model , logic , and presentation are separated .
Your logic is written in Python and your presentation is written as templates ( typically HTML , but they can be any textual format ) .
Although your data is stored in a relational database ( Postgres , MySQL , Oracle , and SQLite are all supported ) , Django actually lets you define your data model using Python classes , then lets you manipulate your data using those classes .
For example , here ’s how part of the model for an online store might look :
class Product ( models .
Model ) : name = models .
CharField( max_length=100 ) description = models .
Text Field ( ) price = models .
IntegerField ( ) def __str__( self ) : return self .
name class Customer ( models .
Model ) : first_name = models .CharField( max_length=30 ) last_name = models .CharField(max_length=30 ) email_address = models .
EmailField ( ) cart = models .
ManyToManyField ( Product ) def __str__( self ) : return " %s %s " % ( self.first_name , self.last_name )
The str methods are just there to return a human readable representation of an instance .
With such a definition , Django ’s object - relational mapping will automatically translate between Python objects and the appropriate SQL statements to query and manipulate the database .
You can even do so interactively from the Python interpreter , as in Figure 1 :
As you can see , you barely need to think about databases at all , let alone write any SQL .
That ’s not to say you can’t , because you get the option of using your own SQL queries if you need to , but this will rarely be the case since Django can elegantly construct complex queries for you .
As an example , the following returns all products that contain “ t - shirt ” in their name or are more expensive than $ 10.00 .
>>> Product.objects.filter(name__contains =" t - shirt " ) | Product.objects.filter(price__gt=1000 ) [< Product : Blue t- shirt > , < Product : Red t- shirt > , < Product : A toy for the demo . >]
Displaying your data
So we ’ve seen how to access our data in Python , but how do we get it into a web page ?
Like other frameworks , Django provides a template system that allows you to format your data as HTML .
Let ’s say you wanted a page that , for a given customer , lists all the items in their cart .
To keep the example simple , we ’ll just create a very plain page .
Here ’s what your template might look like :
< html > < head >< title>{{customer}}'s cart</ title ></head > < body > < p >{{customer}} has the following items in their cart : </ p> < table > < tr>< th> Item </th>< th> Price</th></tr> { % for item in customer.cart.all %} < tr><td>{{item.name}}</td><td>${{item.price|floatformat:2}}</td></tr > { % endfor %} </table > </ body > </html >
It ’s mostly just familiar old HTML , but notice the extra bits in braces , called tags .
The ones that look like {{this}} are variables , and the ones that look like { % this %} are blocks .
In this example , customer is a variable that will be given to the template when it is rendered , so {{customer.cart.all}} becomes the contents of the customer ’s cart .
The block tag { % for item in customer.cart.all %} is a for loop .
It repeats the part of the template between it and the { % endfor %} tag with the variable item set to each object in customer.cart.all .
So for a cart containing three products , the template will create a table with one header row and three data rows .
Take a closer look at the price column .
If you ’re familiar with Unix shells , you might think that looks like a pipe , and indeed it is a lot like that .
The variable item.price is filtered through the floatformat filter , which is given an argument of 2 — the number of decimal places .
You can see the result of this in Figure 2 :
Django provides dozens of tags and filters as standard , and if you know your way around Python you can add your own .
The admin site
When you write a web application , one of the first things you need to do is create forms and logic for adding data to work with .
This can be a significant chunk of work at a time when you want to be writing the public - facing pages ( the fun part ! ) .
One of Django ’s most useful and impressive features is that it will dynamically create an entire admin system based on your data model (s ) .
All you need to do is enable it and decide what URL you want to point there — then go ahead and manage your data !
You can see an example of this in Figure 3 :
Other features
Django has a number of other features that aid the creation of real - world web applications .
One is internationalization , which is an important and tricky topic that site developers are becoming more and more aware of .
If you mark your text strings in your code and templates as being translatable , Django ’s make - messages utility will create a translation file for all those strings .
These are simple text files that you can have your translators fill in .
When it comes to displaying a page to the user , the language selection is made automatically .
If the browser states the user ’s preferred language and there is a translation for that language , that one is used , otherwise the configured default is used .
If you have a particularly high volume site , the cache framework can give you a big performance boost by trading off speed for the dynamic nature of your site .
If you have a page that is costly to generate , but does n’t change very often , you can tell Django to cache it .
The first time someone access that page it will be generated in the normal way , but stored in the cache .
Subsequent requests take the page straight from the cache instead of generating it again , and this continues to happen until the page expires , after which the next access causes it to be generated again .
This is useful for things like blogs and news sites , where content is viewed far more often than it is updated .
You can choose from a number of cache storage options , including memcached ( as used by sites like Slashdot and Wikipedia ) , database , and files .
Community and extensibility
The automatic admin site , discussed earlier , is one of Django ’s contrib packages .
These are extra bits of functionality that are n’t part of the Django core .
While Django would work fine without them , they nevertheless make life easier .
Some other contrib packages of note are :
The syndication framework , which makes it ridiculously easy to publish RSS and Atom feeds .
If you had , say , a model called BlogEntries , you could create an RSS feed that people could subscribe to in about ten lines of code .
Another contrib package offers automated protection from a class of security vulnerability called Cross Site Request Forgery .
The `csrf` add - on adds a hidden field , with a value based on the user ’s session ID and a secret key , to any forms you create .
When the form is submitted back to Django , this add - on makes sure it contains the hidden field with the correct value .
This ensures that form submissions come from forms that Django generated .
It can do this because Django provides a middleware facility that allows extensions to manipulate requests and responses .
facility that allows extensions to manipulate requests and responses .
Because of Django ’s clean extensibility and the dynamic nature of Python , creating add - ons is not difficult and the open source community has created many .
There exist packages for tagging , user registration ( with e-mail address confirmation ) , forums , displaying and checking captchas , voting , displaying and managing photos , and interfacing with OpenID .
If you ’re creating a website , you might find that a lot of the work has already been done for you .
One particularly large extension that can be considered a product in its own right is Satchmo , which is an open source software based on Django for creating online stores .
In addition to all the features you already get with Django , Satchmo provides you with all the additional functionality you need to sell online : a flexible data model for products and customers ; payment handling ; shipping options including UPS integration ; searching ; newsletters ; internationalization ; dealing with discounts and tax ; and generation of PDF invoices and shipping labels .
Installation and deployment
To get up and running with Django you ’ll need Python , Django itself , and a database .
To begin with it is definitely worth using SQLite for your database .
It requires no setting up , and keeps its database in one file .
If you ’re using Linux , your distribution probably has packages for these .
If you ’re using Windows , it ’s a little more work , but the Django on Windows page has a handy step - by - step guide .
When you want to create a new Django project , you use the django - admin command to create a skeleton project in which you can create your applications .
New projects and applications start out with placeholder files for you to create models , views , and URL mappings .
During development you can use the built - in web server to serve your files .
When it comes to deploying your application for production use , as well as moving to a more capable database such as Postgres or MySQL , you ’ll want to stop using the built - in web server .
The officially preferred deployment scenario is to use Apache with mod_python .
mod_python is an Apache module that embeds a Python interpreter within the web server .
Depending on the flexibility of your hosting company , this might not be possible .
Other options are using FastCGI , which is available on many Web servers ( including Apache , lighttpd and Microsoft IIS ) , SCGI and AJP .
These last three , particularly FastCGI , are often the only options available when using shared hosting , but they still give good performance .
A list of Django friendly hosts is maintained on the Django project ’s wiki .
Summary
So that ’s the basics of Django .
For more information , see the Django Project website .
If you ’re starting a new web application , you should certainly consider it as your framework , especially if you ’re already familiar with Python .
Even if you ’re new to both Django and Python , the learning curves of both are shallow enough that you can almost discount them and just compare based on features .
One recent development that is likely to increase the usage of Django is Google ’s announcement of their App Engine .
The first language to be supported is Python , and Google has published an article called Running Django on Google App Engine .
It ’s a little different to vanilla Django , so if you ’re interested in this option you ’ll need to check their documentation .

General Betray Us ?
Of course he has .
MoveOn.org can hardly be expected to recycle its slogan from last September , when Gen. David Petraeus testified in support of escalating the U.S. war in Iraq , given the hysterical denunciations that worthy group received at the time .
But it was right then — as it would be to repeat the charge now .
By undercutting the widespread support for getting out of Iraq , Petraeus did indeed betray the American public , siding with an enormously unpopular president who wants to stay the course in Iraq for personal and political reasons that run contrary to genuine national security interests .
Once again , the president is passing the buck to the uniformed military to justify continuing a ludicrous imperial adventure , and the good general has dutifully performed .
So why are we surprised ?
Why do we expect the generals to lead us on the path to peace when that is the professional task of statesmen and not warriors ?
It is an abdication of civilian control of the military , the basic principle of American constitutional governance , to assign a central role to an active - duty general to make the decision to end the war .
It betrays the legacy warnings of our two most famous wartime generals , George Washington and Dwight D. Eisenhower .
American history offers no greater heroes , not because of their considerable success in battle but because they gained the wisdom to sound the alarm against unbridled militarism so passionately and effectively .
The farewell addresses of both those departing generals - turned - presidents still stand as the essential bookends for what has been written about the limits on military adventure required for democracy ’s survival .
Washington ’s plea to the nation “ to moderate the fury of party spirit , to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue , to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism ” sets the standard for enlightened political discourse .
A close second is Eisenhower ’s warning , “ In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex . ”
We have had many other examples of retired military officers asserting the need for informed and rational public decision - making as to matters of war and peace .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain was one of those voices when , as a senator , he led the fight , along with fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry , to normalize relations with the same Communist leadership in Hanoi that had once been our enemy .
Does anyone , McCain included , now think we were wrong to bring the troops home from Vietnam — and just why are the dire consequences that McCain now predicts for a withdrawal from Iraq any more plausible ?
McCain says we have to back the president and his generals , even though he concedes that “ four years of mismanaged war had brought us almost to the point of no return . ”
Who mismanaged that war if not George W. Bush and the generals he picked for the task ?
But do n’t blame the generals , for as long as a president demands victory , they will pretend to deliver it .
If they demur , they will be replaced , as recently occurred with the sudden retirement of Petraeus ’ boss , Adm .
William Fallon , following his suggestion in Esquire magazine that he might favor a more restrained approach in a conflict with Iran .
No such dissension from Petraeus , whose testimony — faithful to the president if not the truth — was a particularly painful performance .
Civilian deaths in March were 50 percent higher than in February , and there was a score of recent American deaths .
There is no evidence of political progress to support Petraeus ’ stab at optimism over the “ fragile ” situation in Iraq .
Most absurd was the suggestion that the problem would all go away if Iran would only behave , when in fact American troops are being sacrificed on the pro-Iranian side of an internal Shiite power dispute .
The Shiites in charge of “ our ” government in Iraq were exiles trained for decades in Iran .
Not so Moqtada al - Sadr , who stayed in Iraq under Saddam Hussein , the killer of his father .
Sadr now opposes what he clearly labels as the U.S. occupation out of an Iraqi nationalism that is also in conflict with Iran .
Now he ’s the bad guy , and the Sunnis , who hate us even more , are being temporarily paid off by the United States to stop killing Americans .
They , too , will turn against us , but it will not stop Petraeus or some other general in charge from telling Congress a few months from now what the president wants lawmakers to hear .
Alligators can stealthily maneuver through the water leaving nary a ripple , despite having neither fins nor flippers like other adept swimmers .
Instead , they use special muscles to shift the position of their lungs , U.S. researchers said Thursday .
They said American alligators use their diaphragm , pelvic , abdominal and rib muscles to change their center of buoyancy , forcing the lungs toward the tail when they dive , toward the head when they surface , and sideways to roll .
“ What this does is it gives the animal a way to change trajectory , ” said T.J. Uriona , a doctoral student at the University of Utah , whose study appears in the Journal of Experimental Biology .
“ It allows them to quietly change how they are positioned in the water so they can strike , ” he said in a telephone interview .

“ This does n’t require any really quick movements that might give their position away . ”
To study the function of these muscles , Uriona and Utah biology professor C.G. Farmer studied 2 - year - old American alligators from Louisiana ’s Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge near Grand Chenier .
The gators were just under 2 feet long , far more manageable than an adult gator , which can reach 15 feet from the tip of the snout to the end of the tail .
They attached electrodes to track the movement of their muscles and a digital device that measured their trajectory in the water .

Then they put the animals in an aquarium the size of a small bathtub and watched them dive and roll .
Uriona likened the process to wearing a life preserver in a swimming pool .
Properly worn , the jacket keeps the head afloat .
“ But , if you put a life jacket around your middle , that would cause your waist to flip up and your head to sink , ” he said .

Is the " Prosperity Gospel " facing a recession ?
With donations dwindling , Mac Hammond , the high - flying pastor of Living Word Christian Center in Brooklyn Park , says his private jet is for sale .
This comes amid an investigation by the U.S. Senate into some of Hammond 's contemporaries -- including one who leads a church where Hammond serves on the board -- and allegations that some ministers may have improperly solicited funds for presidential candidate Mike Huckabee during a conference at which Hammond spoke .
Living
Word has also cut its hourlong TV show on Sunday mornings in half to save money , according to the Rev. Brian Sullivan , spokesman for the church .
Living Word has fallen $ 40,000 to $ 70,000 short of its weekly budget in recent months .
" We publicly acknowledge we are going through some financial challenges , and we 're just adjusting our budget to reflect that and to live within our means , " said Sullivan .
" I think it 's going to be an austere budget year for us .
" Is that a product of recession , or is that a product of maybe some bad publicity in the church in general ?
We speculate it 's a combination of things , " he said .
Sen . Charles Grassley , R- Iowa , asked six churches late last year to submit financial documents because of complaints about the lavish lifestyles of their ministers .
Hammond 's was not among them , but he serves on the board of the Rev. Kenneth Copeland 's Texas church , which was .
Copeland 's son , John , serves on the board of Hammond 's church .
Kenneth Copeland aggressively rejected the Senate Finance Committee request for records .
" It 's not yours , it 's God's , and you 're not going to get it -- and that 's something I 'll go to prison over , " Copeland said at a meeting of prosperity ministers he sponsored in January .
Copeland is coming to town
" Prosperity Gospel " churches are based on the notion that success in business or personal life is evidence of God 's love .
Copeland will be the keynote speaker at Living Word 's stewardship seminars this week .
Sullivan said he does n't believe Copeland 's appearance will further erode support for the church .
" I do n't think we 've been brazen , in your face , to spite what Sen .
Grassley is doing , " said Sullivan , who added : " We had extended an invitation to [ Copeland ] a while ago , and we 're going to honor that invitation .
Mac sees Kenneth Copeland as kind of a spiritual mentor , a spiritual father , someone ahead of him on the path who has been a sounding board and provided guidance . "
At the January conference , Copeland told ministers he had Huckabee 's support in refusing to hand over financial documents to the U.S. Senate .
During a break in that meetings , Copeland raised $ 110,000 for Huckabee , with pledges for $ 1 million more .
Pete Evans of the Trinity Foundation , a religious watchdog group , said the contributions may have violated IRS rules .
While individuals may contribute , nonprofit groups are not allowed to raise money for political purposes .
Sullivan said Hammond did not contribute to Huckabee or attend the session where money and pledges were collected .
Last year , complaints were filed against Hammond for endorsing then - candidate Michele Bachmann , now a U.S.
House member , from the pulpit .
Hammond later acknowledged that he'd made a mistake .
" To be honest with you , with a little bit of the fallout relative to Michele Bachmann , we 're taking a little bit more careful road , " Sullivan said .
" I do n't think we crossed the line , but it raised concerns and suspicions . "
' Disillusionment sets in '
At Copeland 's conference , which was broadcast live on the Internet , Hammond told other ministers that people " gradually become disillusioned " when their prayers are not met promptly or when promised riches do n't come .
" They have needs to be met , and when they do n't get it they leave , " Hammond said .
" They get their hands put on them , they do n't get cured , then the disillusionment sets in . "
My niece and I have a favorite pastime .
We buy a stack of the trashiest celebrity gossip magazines , sprawl out on the floor with some chocolate close at hand and discuss each photograph , headline and story .
We have very strong opinions about these stars , people we do n’t even know , and never will .
Why is this such a satisfying way to spend a Friday night ?
Because we might just be evolutionarily designed to judge and talk about others .
There are a million ways to categorize conversation among people .
We greet each other and say goodbye , explain , inform , lie , tell secrets , comfort with words and tattle tale .
But mostly , we like to talk about other people .
Stand around the office and listen to any two people who happen to be within shouting distance of each other .
Even if they start out talking about the weather , they 'll end up talking about someone else .
Better than grooming Such casual chat is just that until it turns malicious , unkind and secretive , a special packet of information to be passed from one person to the next with the intent to harm .
And often with no basis in fact .
But primatologist Robin Dunbar of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology , University of Oxford , claims that gossip is not always bad .
Dunbar says , instead , that gossip has been selected by evolution as a way to hold large human groups together .
Many other primates , such as baboons , live in big groups and they use grooming as a social tool to make , keep or break social connections .
But during our evolutionary history , Dunbar explains , human groups became way too large and no one had the time to groom everyone they needed .
Gossip , or talk about each other , then replaced grooming as a social glue among humans .
Teach your kids !
Gossiping might be part of human nature , but we are not born gossiping .
Children learn the art of conversation through a lens of socialization — speak respectfully to adults , do n't swear in public , use correct grammar , be careful what you say .
Children also quickly understand that language is there for the using , and that it 's pretty easy , natural really , to manipulate others with words .
" I did n’t do it , she did , " says the 4 - year - old fingering someone outside the room as the culprit .
" Hey Mom , you are so beautiful , can I have a new bike ? " works at least once .
And as any parent knows , even tiny children with only a few words are masters at getting what they want by verbal begging .
It 's no wonder that these kids turn into gossiping adults able to manipulate conversation , and people , to their own advantage .
At its most innocent , talking of others is simply sharing information — " See that guy over there ?
He 's my friend 's brother .
He 's nice . "
But that information takes on another tone when it is spun by the speaker into a social poison arrow —
" See that guy over there ?
I heard he 's my friend 's mean brother . "
And then the statement rolls along , gathering negative social moss as it goes , sometimes flattening the subject of the gossip in its path .
No baboon 's grooming ever did that .

Today on our green books series , we ’re talking radical .
“ Something has gone terribly wrong in the relations between humanity and nature . ”
Joel Kovel believes he knows what ’s the reason for that .
Hint ? it starts with a Capital C .
Our book for today is :
The Enemy of Nature : The End of Capitalism or the End of the World ? , Second Edition .
Author : Joel Kovel
Joel Kovel is Distinguished Professor of Social Studies at Bard College .
He has written ten books , including the first edition of The Enemy of Nature which appeared in 2002 , and Overcoming Zionism ( 2007 ) .
He has edited the journal of radical ecology , Capitalism Nature Socialism , since 2003 and has been active in Green politics , running for the US Senate in 1998 , and seeking the party ’s presidential nomination in 2000 .
Publisher : Zed Books
Published in : December 2007 ( second edition )
What it is about ( from the publisher ’s website ) :
We live in and from nature , but the way we have evolved of doing this is about to destroy us .
Capitalism and its by - products – imperialism , war , neoliberal globalization , racism , poverty and the destruction of community – are all playing a part in the destruction of our ecosystem .
Only now are we beginning to realise the depth of the crisis and the kind of transformation which will have to occur to ensure our survival .
This second , thoroughly updated , edition of The Enemy of Nature speaks to this new environmental awareness .
Joel Kovel argues against claims that we can achieve a better environment through the current Western ‘ way of being ’ .
By suggesting a radical new way forward , a new kind of ‘ ecosocialism ’ , Joel Kovel offers real hope and vision for a more sustainable future .
The Enemy of Nature : The End of Capitalism or the End of the World ? was originally published in 2002 .
This is an updated and expanded edition , which bring Kovel ’s arguments up to
date .
Why you should get it :
Even if you do n’t agree with Kovel ’s radical ideas and thoughts , I think it ’s always interesting to get to know better another way of thinking , especially when it challenges the capitalistic system which most of humanity had embraced in this stage or another .
The connection between economy and environment is always intriguing and Kovel ’s thoughts , such as “ however capital may restructure and reform itself to secure accumulation , it is incapable of mending the ecological crisis it provokes , ” definitely contribute to the debate on what the right way to reach sustainability is .
What others say about it :
“ Joel Kovel has brought us a persuasive , passionate and hopeful ecosocialist manifesto .
He shows how problems from toxic pollution to globalized poverty reflect the inner logic of capitalism , and extends the lessons of Marxism and other radical traditions to illuminate a path toward an ethical and ecological revolution .
This book offers much food for thought to all who seek a systemic understanding of today ’s social and ecological crises . ”
( Brian Tokar , activist and author of Redesigning Life ? and Earth for Sale )
“ Among the many benefits that have resulted from cessation of the Cold War is our freedom to criticize capitalism , openly and forcefully , without being labeled “ communists , ” or worse .
Joel Kovel takes strategic advantage of this development by indicting capital ’s dismal ecological record in a book that is sure to spawn lively and sensible debate . ”

Alex F. commented here about problems with our Starbucks and Walmart data .
Elizabeth Kaplan , who collected the data for me , replied :
Yeah Walmart was a bit of a pain to find the locations for as you can not search just by state on their website , like for Starbucks .
In order to find the locations I relied on the yellow page results .
Even though I looked through to eliminate double postings for walmarts with the same address , after I looked into it again tonight , it appears the yellow pages dramatically over represented the number of walmarts per state .
I have attached the correct data .
All of these numbers come from this website ( http://www.walmartfacts.com/StateByState/) which I was unable to locate before .
As far as the data for starbucks that should be correct as I got it straight from their website .
The one thing is that they do n’t list all affiliate stores ( that is stores not own and operated by the company ) .
There is no reliable source of data on affiliate stores by state , and obviously the yellow pages are not a good source .
So the data I sent to you just includes Starbucks owned and operated stores .
Also for population I used the 2006 Census Bureau estimates .
New York Times : Did McCain have intimate relationship with lobbyist ?
RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday February 20 , 2008

Print This Email This AP BREAKING WIRE : ::: TOLEDO , Ohio - John McCain says a report by The New York Times suggesting an inappropriate relationship with a female lobbyist is " not true " and he denied a romantic relationship with her .
" It 's not true , " McCain said as his wife , Cindy , stood alongside him during a news conference .
The Arizona senator described the woman in question , lobbyist Vicki Iseman , as a friend .
Previously , his campaign characterized the New York Times story as a ' smear . '
Could this be the unreported political sex scandal that had the blogosphere buzzing late last year ?
The New York Times is detailing explosive charges that Republican presidential front - runner Sen. John McCain had what could be construed as an inappropriate relationship with a Washington lobbyist .
In an article entitled " For McCain , Self - Confidence on Ethics Poses Its Own Risk , " Times reporters write that the lobbyist , named as Vicki Iseman , " had been turning up with [ McCain ] at fund - raisers , in his offices and aboard a client 's corporate jet .
Convinced the relationship had become romantic , some of his top advisers intervened to protect the candidate from himself ï¿½ instructing staff members to block the woman 's access , privately warning her away and repeatedly confronting him , several people involved in the campaign said on the condition of anonymity . "
The article continues that when news organizations reported McCain " had written letters to government regulators on behalf of the lobbyist 's clients , the former campaign associates said , some aides feared for a time that attention would fall on her involvement . "
McCain and Iseman , according to the Times , both say they never had a romantic relationship .
In a press release at his official campaign website , the McCain campaign issued the following statement : " It is a shame that the New York Times has lowered its standards to engage in a hit and run smear campaign .
John McCain has a 24 - year record of serving our country with honor and integrity .
He has never violated the public trust , never done favors for special interests or lobbyists , and he will not allow a smear campaign to distract from the issues at stake in this election .
" Americans are sick and tired of this kind of gutter politics , and there is nothing in this story to suggest that John McCain has ever violated the principles that have guided his career . "
Not long after the NY Times article was published , Iseman 's bio was apparently removed from the website of Alcalde & Faye , the firm that employs her .
Huffington Post captured a screenshot of the bio .
Blogger Will Bunch has an undated photo of Iseman posing with George W. Bush .
Journalist and author Ron Rosenbaum wrote in a blog post from October of last year that he had " run into a well - connected media person , who told me flatly , unequivocally that ' everyone knows '
The LA Times was sitting on a story , all wrapped up and ready to go about what is a potentially devastating sexual scandal involving a leading Presidential candidate . "
The LA Times apparently never did publish the piece , if it is indeed the same story as reported by the NY Times .
Excerpts from the NY Times article , available in full at this link , follow the MSNBC video below ...
# Mr. McCain , 71 , and the lobbyist , Vicki Iseman , 40 , both say they never had a romantic relationship .
But to his advisers , even the appearance of a close bond with a lobbyist whose clients often had business before the Senate committee Mr. McCain led threatened the story of redemption and rectitude that defined his political identity .
It had been just a decade since an official favor for a friend with regulatory problems had nearly ended Mr. McCain 's political career by ensnaring him in the Keating Five scandal .
In the years that followed , he reinvented himself as the scourge of special interests , a crusader for stricter ethics and campaign finance rules , a man of honor chastened by a brush with shame .
But the concerns about Mr. McCain 's relationship with Ms. Iseman underscored an enduring paradox of his post - Keating career .
Even as he has vowed to hold himself to the highest ethical standards , his confidence in his own integrity has sometimes seemed to blind him to potentially embarrassing conflicts of interest .
Mr. McCain promised , for example , never to fly directly from Washington to Phoenix , his hometown , to avoid the impression of self - interest because he sponsored a law that opened the route nearly a decade ago .
But like other lawmakers , he often flew on the corporate jets of business executives seeking his support , including the media moguls Rupert Murdoch , Michael R. Bloomberg and Lowell W. Paxson , Ms. Iseman 's client .
( Last year he voted to end the practice . ) " #

The Bivings Group is a PR firm whose clients include Monsanto , a company with a long history of harmful practices impacting the environment and human health . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] .
They seem to specialize in the creation of fake grassroots Astroturf supporters for their clients .
An article on the Bivings web site , titled " Viral Marketing : How to Infect the World , " originally recommended covert and deceptive Internet activity , " there are some campaigns where it would be undesirable or even disastrous to let the audience know that your organisation is directly involved ... it simply is not an intelligent PR move .
In cases such as this , it is important to first ' listen ' to what is being said online ...
Once you are plugged into this world , it is possible to make postings to these outlets that present your position as an uninvolved third party ...
Perhaps the greatest advantage of viral marketing is that your message is placed into a context where it is more likely to be considered seriously ....
Sometimes , we win awards .
Sometimes only the client knows the precise role we played . "
After this message was criticized publicly , Bivings removed the offending passages , placing a note at the bottom of the article that states , " Recently edited for clarification . "

Bivings and Monsanto
In May 14 , 2002 , Guardian journalist George Monbiot reported on " invisible persuasion " techniques used by Bivings that included the creation of fictional individuals on the Internet .
" Corporations are inventing people to rubbish their opponents on the Internet , " he wrote .
...
Detective work by the campaigner Jonathan Matthews and the freelance journalist Andy Rowell shows how a PR firm contracted to the biotech company Monsanto appears to have played a crucial but invisible role in shaping scientific discourse . "
Bivings apparently played a behind - the - scenes role in persuading Nature magazine to retract a scientific paper which it had published , claiming that native maize in Mexico had been contaminated by genetically modified pollen .
" On the day the paper was published , messages started to appear on a biotechnology listserver used by more than 3,000 scientists , called AgBioWorld , " Monbiot wrote .
The first came from a correspondent named ' Mary Murphy . '
Chapela is on the board of directors of the Pesticide Action Network , and therefore , she claimed , ' not exactly what you 'd call an unbiased writer . '
Her posting was followed by a message from an ' Andura Smetacek , ' claiming , falsely , that Chapela 's paper had not been peer - reviewed , that he was ' first and foremost an activist ' and that the research had been published in collusion with environmentalists .
...
The messages from Murphy and Smetacek stimulated hundreds of others , some of which repeated or embellished the accusations they had made .
Senior biotechnologists called for Chapela to be sacked from Berkeley .
AgBioWorld launched a petition pointing to the paper 's ' fundamental flaws . ' ...
The pressure on Nature was so severe that its editor did something unparalleled in its 133 - year history : last month he published , alongside two papers challenging Quist and Chapela's , a retraction in which he wrote that their research should never have been published . "
However , sleuthing by Monbiot and others shows that " Mary Murphy " and " Andura Smetacek " are apparently pseudonyms used by Bivings employees ( Update : " Mary Murphy has subsequently been shown to be an e-mail front for Monsanto 's PR company , Bivings , while the postings of Andura Smetacek have been traced back directly to Monsanto in St Louis " [ 5 ] ) .

Bivings and the Republican Party
Bivings has received $ 79,811 in 2004 [ 7 ] from the Republican National Committee , and designed their GOP Teamleader website . [ 8 ]
Bivings defends their role in creating fake letters to the editor via GOP Team Leader .
Regarding the consternation one letter writing campaign caused they gloat " The editors of these papers , which include The Boston Globe , The Cincinnati Post , and The Fort Worth Star - Telegram , are crying foul - they feel that they were duped .
All major publications have policies against publishing form letters , but these managed to slip through , as they had the look and feel of genuine grassroots responses . " [ 9 ]
" Republicans spent up to $ 60,000 to create www.gopteamleader.com, which launched in late March .
The site was designed to give more than 90,000 Republican activists information on contacting local radio stations and newspapers to disseminate President Bush 's and Republicans ' views on issues ranging from energy to terrorism " . [ 10 ]
Things may have gotten nasty on Wednesday night in Philadelphia , but Barack Obama saw the “ gotcha ” tenor of the Democratic presidential debate as a preview of what is in store for the general election campaign .
And thousands of viewers , for their part , considered it an outrage .
For nearly an hour , the 10.7 million viewers of the most watched debate in this election cycle did not hear a single question about the economy , Iraq or healthcare .
Instead , they heard ABC newsmen Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos , the moderators , revisit controversies about Obama ’s former pastor , Obama ’s failure to wear flag lapel pins , and his casual association with a ‘ 60s radical .
In a town hall meeting in Raleigh , N.C. , on Thursday , Obama sounded a cautionary note to supporters : “ That was the rollout of the Republican campaign in November , ” he said .
“ They will try to focus on these issues that do n’t have anything to do with how you ’re paying your bills at the end of the month . ”
New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton , too , was grilled -- albeit less intensely -- about her discredited tale of landing under sniper fire in Bosnia in 1996 and whether she is trustworthy and honest .

Many who watched were livid .
“ Great job , ABC , ” wrote one indignant viewer , in a posting on the network ’s website .
“ You managed to bury any signs of intelligent life under a mountain of pointless goo .
What does any of last night ’s debate have to do with the price of bread ( or gas ) , Iraq , Bin Laden , judicial appointments , public education , the mortgage crisis . . . oh , never mind .
Let ’s all focus on lapel pins . ”
Democratic strategist Bob Shrum , who ran John F. Kerry ’s presidential campaign in 2004 , said Obama should have shot back , “ Where ’s your flag pin ? ” ( Neither of the moderators or candidates wore one . )
Thursday morning , Stephanopoulos said that he and Gibson had decided to focus on what he called “ electability questions ” in the first half of the debate .
“ I think the questions we asked were tough and fair and appropriate and relevant , ” said Stephanopoulos , a senior advisor to former President Bill Clinton in his first term .
Advertisement
“ The questions we asked are what the campaigns are debating every single day and are being debated in the political world every day .
The question of who is the most electable Democrat is at the core of it . ”
By 8 p.m. Thursday , the ABC News website had received nearly 19,000 comments , most of them attacking the tenor of the debate and the moderators .
One called Stephanopolous “ George Stupidopolous . ”
“ I will never , in my life , ever watch anything on ABC ever again .
Goodbye , ” wrote one .
“ The debate last night was pathetic ! ”
Although vastly outnumbered , a few praised the debate for forcing Obama , in particular , to answer tough questions .
“ We really need to know more about Mr. Obama , ” wrote one viewer .
“ The questions about Rev. Wright and William Ayers ” -- the former Weather Underground activist who was on the board of a charity with Obama -- “ were right on target . ”

The debate was panned by some television critics .
Tom Shales of the Washington Post accused the moderators of turning in
They dwelt , he added , “ entirely on specious and gossipy trivia that already had been hashed and rehashed , in the hope of getting the candidates to claw at one another over disputes that are no longer news . ”
Some pundits approved .
New York Times political columnist David Brooks wrote on his blog : “ I understand the complaints , but I thought the questions were excellent .
The journalist ’s job is to make politicians uncomfortable , to explore evasions , contradictions and vulnerabilities .
Almost every question tonight did that . ”
Bruce Gronbeck , a professor of communications studies at the University of Iowa , said that these kinds of questions , coming before the Democrats have settled on a nominee , might prove helpful to the party ’s candidate in the long run .
“ If you handle them well , the media may not cover them as enthusiastically and the public becomes inured as well , ” he said .
“ JFK got the religion issue out of the way , in essence , early and then could shine in the debates and in September and October when it counted . ”

Obama on Thursday pledged to counterattack , if necessary , in the general election .
“ If the Republicans come at me , ” he said , “ I will come right back at them . ”
In a conference call with reporters Thursday , Clinton spokesman Phil Singer said the campaign was comfortable with the way the debate had gone .
“ There is something good about candidates being asked to answer tough questions , ” he said .
“ It provides the public more information and insight .
Certainly in the case of Sen. Obama , there has not been as much information being made available to the public .
Last night was important and instructive . ”
But a strong Clinton supporter , Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell , suggested that the moderators had gone too far .
“ I think Sen. Clinton did a marvelous job , a much better job on the substantive issues , ” he told a Philadelphia reporter .
“ But the first 45 minutes was ‘ gotcha ’ issues , and it was Sen .
Obama ’s misfortune that most of them except for Bosnia were asked of him . ”
An outtake from the end of the debate , which appeared on the Huffington Post website , showed Gibson being heckled by audience members as the program went to a final commercial break .
“ The crowd is turning on me , ” he said with a thin smile .

But ABC
News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider , who was in the hall , said he believed some in the audience were angry that they had to sit through yet more commercials before being allowed to leave the venue .
Thursday evening , Gibson , without mentioning his connection to the contentious debate , introduced a segment on the ABC evening news about it .
“ Both candidates were back campaigning today , ” he said .
“ Both showed last night they could take a political punch .
But many of the blows today were being aimed at the debate itself and the questions asked . ”
In the report that followed , ABC correspondent David Wright said that Sen. Clinton “ steered clear of the debate . ”
Advertisement
Her husband , he added , did not .
“ They ’ve been beating up on her for 15 months , ” the former president said in a clip from the campaign trail .
“ I did n’t hear her whining when he said she was untruthful in Iowa , or called her the senator from Punjab .
And you know they said some pretty rough things about me too .
But you know , this is a contact sport .
If you do n’t want to play , keep your uniform off . ”

Influence by Robert Cialdini is an excellent , excellent , book .
Not only does it present voluminous evidence on the social psychology of persuasion and compliance , but it does succinctly and engagingly , mixing academic references with historical vignettes and personal anecdotes .
The book discuss how techniques of persuasion work , grouping them under six major headings , and for each heading the book provides a ‘ defence against ’ section detailing how to stop yourself being unduly influenced .
The final , glorious , touch is that in order to write the book Cialdini – who is a professor of social psychology – engaged in a three - year project of going undercover to explore first - hand how techniques of persuasion are used in the real world : applying for a waiter ’s job to study how to increase customers ’ tipping , attending tupperware parties , going on training programmes with door - to - door salesmen … it makes the book a wonderful blend of thorough research and astutely observed practice .
The book has been extensively and excellently summarised here , at happening - here .blogspot.com , so I ’m just going to pull out some particularly fun examples of persuasion techniques , particularly as the relate to advertising and marketing .

A key idea is that we all use various cognitive ‘ shortcuts ’ ( heuristics ) we use to decide on what to buy .
Advertisers can take advantage of these short - cuts to skew our behaviour .
For example , there is a price - as - an - indicator - of - quality heurstic which means , if we ’re not thinking carefully about a purchase decision , we might just use the assumption that ‚ Äúbetter things are more expensive ‚
Äù , so if we want a ‘ better ’ thing we will just look at the prices to work out which product is better .
[ Chivas Regal Scotch Whiskey ] “ had been a struggling brand until its managers decided to raise its price to a level far above its competitors .
Sales skyrocketed , even though nothing was changed in the product itself ( Aaker , 1991 ) ” [ 1 ]
Or the coupons - give - you - a - bargain heuristic :
“ A tire company found that mailed - out coupons which , because of a printing error , offered no savings top recipients produced just as much customers response as did error - free coupons that offered substantial savings ” [ 2 ]
It ’s easy enough to think of other common examples – supermarkets which use three for the price of two offers , or put up signs saying things like “ Two for ¬ £ 1 ” .
Next time you see one of these check the price for how much just one costs – it might stem your enthusiasm for the seeming bargain you thought you were being offered
Here ’s another trick , which takes advantage of another natural inclination – that of sticking by our word .
Cialdini accuses toy producers of undersupplying stores with ‘ craze ’ toys just before Christmas – after a barrage of advertising parents promise their kids the toy but then ca n’t get hold of one .
They buy them a substitute at Christmas and then also have to buy the craze toy in January .
He cites the example of the Cabbage Patch Kids , dolls which were heavily advertised one year in the mid-1980s , and undersupplied during the holiday season .
$ 25 toys were selling at auction for $ 700 .
( A charge was later brought against company for advertising something that was unavailable ) .
In 1988 , a spokesperson for Hasbo , which made the Furby toy ( which also sold out at Christmas ) , advised parents to say I ’ll try , but if I ca n’t get it for you now , I ’ll get it for you later [ 3 ]
The same consistency principle lies behind the advice an encyclopaedia company gives during its sales - program : make the customs fill out the sales agreements themselves .
Once they ’ve ‘ owned ’ the action by doing it themselves they are far more likely to stick by it .
( “ There is something magical about writing things down ” says Amway Corporation literature ) .
Cialdini explains the popularity ( with companies ) of testimonial contests ‚ Äì those where you think of 50 words why the product is good and stand a chance of winning something .
The contest is not for the company to get a single winning entry , but for them to induce all the entrants of the competition to enhance their commitment to the product by writing a testimonial .
Influence has an extended discussion of this , and how the power of small , initial , public voluntary actions can be used to produce later compliance to much larger requests for action
“ Commitment decisions , even erroneous ones , have a tendency to be self - perpetuating because they can ‘ grow their own legs ' ”
( page 97 ) “ You can use small commitments to manipulate a person ’s self - image ; you can use them to turn citizens into “ public servants ” , prospects into “ customers ” , prisoners into “ collaborators . ”
And once you ’ve got a man ’s self - image where you want it , he should comply naturally with a whole range of your requests that are consistent with this view of himself ” .
( page 74 ) “ … compliance professionals love commitments that produce inner change .
First , that change is not just specific to the situation where it first occurred ; it covers a whole range of related situations , too .
Second , the effects of the change are lasting .
So , once a man has been induced to take action that shifts his self - image to that of , let ’s say , a public spirited citizen [ or a guru ’s disciple ] , he is likely to be public - spirited in a variety of other circumstances where his compliance may also be desired , and he is likely to continue his public - spirited behavior for as long as his new self - image holds . ”
( page 84 )
Social proof ( social influence ) is another extremely strong heuristic : ‚ Äúif everyone else is doing it , I should do it to‚Ä ù
This too can be used unfairly – for example Evangelist Billy Graham has been known to ‘ seed ’ visits to towns in advance so that his arrival is met an outpouring of thousands of the faithful – apparently spontaneous , but actually highly organised .
( p 101 )
Positive association is also a powerful , and potentially automatic ( see also ) decision - shortcut
In one study , men who saw a new - car ad that included a seductive young woman model rated the car as faster , more appealing , more expensive - looking , and better designed than did men who viewed the same ad without the model .
Yet when asked later , the men refused to believe that the presence of the young woman had influenced their judgments . [ 4 ]
The same kind of , automatic associations , lie behind findings that people leave larger tips if paying by credit card ( credit cards associated with big spending , not always with paying back ) and that “ that when asked to contribute to charity ( the United Way ) , college students were markedly more likely to give money if the room they were in contained MasterCard insignias than if it did not ( 87 percent verses 33 percent ) . ” ( p164 ) .
Funnily enough this did n’t hold for people with troubled credit histories !
Cialdini is quite clear that we can’t avoid using these short - cuts – after all they work most of the time – but we must come down hard on those who exploit them
‚ Äú The pace of modern life demands that we frequently use shortcuts ‚Äù ( p. 234 ) “ We are likely to use these lone cues when we do n’t have the inclination , time , energy , or cognitive resources to undertake a complete analysis of the situation .
When we are rushed , stressed , uncertain , indifferent , distracted or fatigue , we tend to focus less on the information available to us .
When making decisions under these circumstances , we often revert to the rather primitive but necessary single - piece - of - good - evidence approach . ” ( p235 ) ‚ Äú The real treachery , and what we cannot tolerate , is any attempt to make a profit in a way that threatens the reliability of our shortcuts ‚
Äù ( p. 239 )
I do n’t know how realistic this kind of individual / consumer vigilance is as a strategy , but Cialdini seems to believe that the only alternative is to change the whole pace of modern life
The evidence suggests that the ever - accelerating pace and informational crush of modern life will make this particular form of unthinking compliance [ shortcuts ] more and more prevalent in the future ( introduction , p. x. )
My default assumption used to be that the careless use of decision heuristics probably only applies to unimportant decisions .
This took quite a severe knock from Cialdini ’s discussion on the social - contagion of suicide [ 5 ] .
If people can be influenced by publicity about a suicide to kill themselves ( and all the evidence is that they are – and social proof is one of Cialdini ’s six discussed shortcuts ) , then all of the decisions we make in life are open to be exploited by irrational factors under the control of others .

" You suck . " " No , YOU suck . "
" Your mom sucks . "
OK so far : 2177 chars , 435 words .
I had an exciting morning of not getting fired today .
Get this : I'm on a trip to Google 's Mountain View headquarters , and was glancing at Reddit between meetings , and lo and behold , I was inexplicably in the Reddit Tabloids again , this time for being fired , or so people were speculating ( far too hopefully , I might add .
Geez . )
Needless to say , I immediately put all my other work - related plans on " pause " while I tried to figure out whether I was , in fact , being fired .
Ca n't accuse me of not having my priorities straight !
It turns out it was a minor mixup by an automated system , a system that decided to jump - start its own evolution by going directly from brownian motion to VP - level decision - making ( 2 evolutionary hops total .
Hee . ) .
This automated system had apparently just watched the movie Brazil , and thought it would be fun to send me off to Information Retrieval .
So my account was disabled , from which lonely data point the Reddit crowd concluded that I must be getting fired right now , in real time , like OJ in his white SUV .
And seeing as I was too surprised to think of a counter - hypothesis , I spent about 20 minutes in an undignified , trouser - soiling panic .
Thanks , Reddit !
Anyhoo , after some friends inside Google had undone the mistake for me , I pondered the overall thrust of the Reddit comment thread ( " You suck " .
" No , YOU suck . "
" Your mom sucks . " ) and decided I really ought to write something .
Otherwise I 'm likely to fall off the wagon and disappear for a year .
Time is just whooshing away .
I wish I could get back to High School Time , where even a single hour - long class can seem like eternity , and 4 years is effectively infinite .
Sigh .
I do have a bunch of half - finished blog posts lying around , but nothing has really gelled yet .
So I guess I 'll ramble about stuff I 've been up to .
You know .
A status update .
Blech .
Incidentally , I 've decided to try to limit myself to roughly 1000 - word posts , which is about the length of a newspaper column , near as I can tell .
I 'll prolly just call it 5000 non-whitespace characters , and write an Emacs function to tell me when I 've gone over .
Off the top of my head , maybe something like : which , when I run , faithfully reports : Oops , sorry .
Wrong macro .
My new function actually tells me : Halfway there , baby !
So ...
In 500 - ish remaining words , here are the first things that come to mind as I sit in this comfy modern - looking couch in Building 43 of Google 's Mountain View headquarters .
I 've been doing a lot of JavaScript - related stuff lately .
I do n't know if JavaScript 2 ( aka ECMAScript Edition 4 ) is going to be the Next Big Language , but it 's certainly going to be a Next Big Language .
( There 's room for more than one , obviously . )
And in the meantime , well , JavaScript 1.7 is working plenty well for me .
Let 's see ...
I 'm working on a book on Mozilla Rhino with Norris Boyd ( the primary author of Rhino , now a Googler in Boston ) .
It 's coming along in bursts , and is probably about 10 % complete after 3 months of dorking around with it on weekends between football games ( that goes for both me and Norris , as it turns out , although his team is 12 - 0 , dammit ) .
But it should be a pretty cool book , assuming football season ever ends .
The book is pretty much where all my Joke Output has been focused lately , which hopefully helps explain my recent blog drought .
I 've been watching the EcmaScript Edition 4 fireworks with keen interest .
While I would n't want to name any specific parties , for fear of offending someone , it seems to me that one party , whom I 'll refer to as " Uncle Mike " , is up to his perverted old tricks again .
If , like many others , you feel that " Uncle Mike " is being a " complete dickwad " ( to put it as euphemistically as I can ) then you can help by getting all your friends and sales people and random family members to switch to Firefox .
Really .
It 'll help .
You might also write a polite letter to your favorite Ecma General Assembly Voting Member Company , telling them how much you and your ten thousand closest friends are really looking forward to the imminent ratification of EcmaScript Edition 4 .
Or hell , spam all of them .
That 's what Uncle Mike does .
Continuing in the spirit of freeing all my cats from bag - imprisonment , I should also mention I 've been working on an Ecma - 262 compliant JavaScript interpreter in Emacs - Lisp .
I used to have actual details here , but it ate up 1000 + words , so I 'll just summarize for ya .
The short synopsis is that I 'm building a complete JavaScript environment in Emacs - Lisp , with two goals : ( 1 ) create a world - class JavaScript IDE for Emacs , and ( 2 ) permit writing Emacs extensions in JavaScript , since ( 2a ) people are n't exactly flocking to elisp , and ( 2 b ) JavaScript turns out to be a better language , now that I know them both in excruciating detail .
Emacs is a great environment that needs a better extension language , and JavaScript seems well suited to navigate the popularity - vs. - elegance tightrope I 'm faced with .
That 's the elevator pitch : puts people to sleep in 20 seconds , guaranteed .
The status - in - brief is that I now have a fully functional , Ecma -262 compliant JavaScript interpreter and runtime in elisp , which began as a port of Narcissus .
I 'm currently reworking the parser and parse tree to be faster and more IDE - friendly .
Next I 'll need to turn the interpreter into a byte - compiler that emits Emacs - Lisp bytecode , which should enable it to run as fast as ( or faster than ) Emacs - Lisp .
Then I 'll need to actually write the IDE and the emacs host objects .
The whole thing looks to be at least a year out , at least on my current budget of 3 hours a week , so do n't hold your breath .
I 'm giving priority to the IDE functionality , since I kinda need it for other projects , so that could potentially happen by summer .
If you happen to think of a clever name for this project , please let me know .
Well , this 1000 - word limit is ... a toughie .
I 've already blown through it , although hopefully I get some slack for counting HTML tags .
But I have to wrap up , so I 'll close with some Unsubstantiated Random Thoughts that maybe I can clarify in upcoming crudely - truncated entries : Google continues to be an astoundingly awesome place to work .
Like my friend Dominic says , " it feels like I 've won the lottery every day .
" Our Rhino on Rails framework is still working great for us , and has finally begun to gain serious internal momentum at Google .
Hopefully next year we can open - source it .
Interviewing for tech jobs at Google continues to be really hard ( for both interviewer and interviewee ) , and I 've accumulated enough truly useful interviewee - prep tips to merit a full blog post .
Look for that one soon .
I still use Emacs to an extent that could justifiably be described as " unhealthy " .
I 'd love to do another Effective Emacs post someday .
I still watch a lot of Anime .
Currently watching Le Chevalier D'Eon , which is pretty awesome so far .
I taught my dog Cino to play guitar , a feat which so astounds people that they all say I should put it on YouTube , so there 's Yet Another Side Project for me .
I 'd love to write more about all this .
The 1000 - word limit seems to have made it feasible for me to create posts in a single sitting , with no bathroom breaks , provided I can actually go to 1500 " words " .
So hopefully in addition to all my side projects , I can blog more often .
And with that , I 'm going to get back to my " day job " project (s ) , which are sadly confidential .
But they 're so cool that if I did tell you about them , you'd be so overwhelmed that you 'd have to go sit in one of our $ 5000 - ish massage chairs , like the dude sitting next to me right now .
Man this place rocks .
MILWAUKEE — Weekday mornings , three of Tracie Weldie ’s children eat breakfast , make beds and trudge off to public school — in their case , downstairs to their basement in a suburb here , where their mother leads them through math and other lessons outlined by an Internet - based charter school .
Half a million American children take classes online , with a significant group , like the Weldies , getting all their schooling from virtual public schools .
The rapid growth of these schools has provoked debates in courtrooms and legislatures over money , as the schools compete with local districts for millions in public dollars , and over issues like whether online learning is appropriate for young children .
One of the sharpest debates has concerned the Weldies ’ school in Wisconsin , where last week the backers of online education persuaded state lawmakers to keep it and 11 other virtual schools open despite a court ruling against them and the opposition of the teachers union .
John Watson , a consultant in Colorado who does an annual survey of education that is based on the Internet , said events in Wisconsin followed the pattern in other states where online schools have proliferated fast .
“ Somebody says , ‘ What ’s going on , does this make sense ? ’ ” Mr. Watson said .
“ And after some inquiry most states have said , ‘ Yes , we like online learning , but these are such new ways of teaching children that we ’ll need to change some regulations and get some more oversight . ’ ”
Welcome back to MangoBot , a biweekly column about Asian futurism .
If you 've noticed an unusually large number of utilitarian humanoids hailing from Japan in the last few years , then you probably wo n't be surprised to hear about the country 's official robot initiative .
Right now , Japan is in the midst of executing a grand plan to make robots an integrated part of everyday life .
To compensate for the shortage of young workers willing to do menial tasks , the Japan Robot Association , the government , and several technology institutions drafted a formal plan to create a society in which robots live side by side with humans by the year 2010 .
Since 2010 is just a couple years away , I called up a roboticist at the forefront of this movement to find out how it 's going .
Advertisement
But first , some background :
In January , roboticists unleashed a five - foot tall humanoid robot named Robovie in a trendy mall in downtown Osaka .
Robovie 's mission was to help lost shoppers find their way to their destinations .
Using 16 cameras , six laser range finders , and nine RFID readers , Robovie judged the behavior of all shoppers , 20 at a time , approached those that looked disoriented , and pointed them in the right direction .
Then , as they hastily thanked him and walked off , he rattled off a list of nearby restaurants in case they were hungry .

You already see humanoid robots in Japan attending religious ceremonies , making sushi , planting rice , answering phones in corporate offices , subbing in as dance partners , and feeding old people whose motor skills are starting to fail .
Animal bots have been making a big breakthrough too — from the digital Tamagochi to Paro the furry therapeutic seal , Japanese people are experts at satiating their need for companionship or assistance via low - maintenance mechanical friends .
Monikers like Robot Kingdom and Robot Nation , which have been used to describe Japan since the 80s , are relevant now more than ever — with a shrinking labor force , declining birth rate , and an aging population , the demand for robotic help in hospitals , nursing homes , offices , and retail spaces is sky high .
Researchers in Japan are confident that , in a few years time , humans and robots will coexist happily in a fully integrated man-machine society .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
So how exactly are these ambitious roboticists planning to do this ?
And is it really going to happen the way they say it will ?
Takayuki Furuta , the director of the Future of Robotics Technology Center in Chiba , tells me that they 're right on track .
He states that a primary goal of the collaboration is to establish international standards for humanoid robot software and hardware — in a similar manner to how techies determined what nuts and bolts and basic programs would comprise a standard computer so many years ago .
Phase 1 ( planning ) and phase 2 ( hardware ) are complete as of March 2008 ; phase 3 ( software ) starts this month .
" We 're going to be the first country in the world with an official robotics ministry , " he says .
In the US , he explains , there 's a strong emphasis on developing software , like artificial intelligence and programs for military tools and weapons .
But Japan does n't have a military , so robotics research ends up going into applications for everyday life .
And since Japan is a densely populated country with small living quarters , developing compact hardware for utilitarian humanoids becomes infinitely more important .
Advertisement
Perhaps the most important reason why Japan is fit to become the first country in the world with an official robot ministry is because the Japanese are n't afraid of robots .
Since the 1950s , the idea of robots as friends has been engrained in the national psyche through animated characters like Astro Boy .
" In America , you do n't have a very positive image of humanoid robots , " he says .
" Look at the Terminator !
In Japan , robots are our friends .
It 's part of our cultural background . "

A survey conducted last year showed that 40 % of Japanese women in their 20s and 30s talk to their computers , while 10 % give them names .
I 'll be the first to admit that the Japanese have a penchant for giving life to otherwise inanimate objects .
But most importantly , it 's not considered weird at all .
Several years ago , it was pretty much expected that single women who lived alone would share their homes with a Furby .
More recently , families who could n't own dogs sought canine companionship from their Aibos .
When you look at it this way , it 's almost natural that the next step would be full integration of robotics in daily life on a mass scale .
The initiative does n't end in 2010 , but that 's the benchmark year by which they plan on having robots doing janitorial work , security , child care , client liaison work and intelligent wheelchairs nationwide .
Roboduties will expand to everything else — driving cars , cooking dinner , producing TV shows , marrying humans — by 2020 .
Bruce Schneier is one of the foremost experts on cryptography and is a well - known security author and commentator .
He is the founder of the managed security services company Counterpane , which was acquired in October 2006 by BT .
Schneier sat down with IDG News Service at the Infosec security show in London to talk about the effectiveness of security products and the psychology of security .
IDG News Service :
Are antivirus products just making money by giving people a " feeling " of security rather than true security ?
Schneier : Antivirus is easy .
Antivirus products actually work .
They have for years .
A lot of the software on this show floor is just snake oil , but antivirus does work .
You should have an antivirus program .
You should have it updated regularly .
It does n't make you secure , but it gets that bottom layer of the trivial stuff .
That 's why .
It 's not sufficient but it 's certainly necessary .
IDG News Service : People are tricked into downloading malicious software through social engineering .
Have people become too conditioned -- mainly through watching television -- to also believe whatever appears on their monitor ?
Schneier : Yes , but it 's not television .
People know the Internet is not television .
People believe what they see on the Net not because of television but because of the trappings of reality .
So when you got to BT.com , you see the BT logo , the BT font , the PR material , and you 'll think , yeah , it 's BT , like when you go to your bank , you see the logo , the tellers .
That 's real , that 's expensive stuff .
On the Web , it could be a fake BT.com site and you do n't notice because it 's trivially easy to copy .
So people do believe what they see on the Internet , not because of television , but because the Internet has the trappings of the real world .
So all of those social cues you get to know to trust something -- it looks professional , nothing 's misspelled , you see those things and you believe it 's real .
So yes , people are conditioned to accept it but it's from a whole variety of social conditioning .
IDG News Service :
Do you think people will ever gain a greater suspicion of the Internet ?
Schneier : Younger people have better bullshit detectors and they 'll pick it up .
But certainly you can always fool people unless there is some external validation of [ Web sites ] .
Microsoft tried to do that .
Unless you can do that , there 's no guarantee you 're not going to be fooled .
IDG News Service :
How do we train our brains to be more perceptive ?
Schneier : Experience .
Understanding the threats .
IDG News Service :
So what do you think is the biggest threat right now ?
Schneier : Crime .
IDG News Service :
So how do you fix it ?
It 's expensive to investigate , it 's cross-jurisdictional .
Schneier :
It might not be fixable .
A lot of [ the solution ] is going to be making the things that criminals are going after harder to get .
You 're not going to stop the criminals .
But in the United States , it 's really easy to get a credit card in someone else 's name .
The credit card companies like it that way .
So a lot of it is looking at how the criminals are attacking things and making it harder to attack them .
The brokerage companies want it to be easy for you to log on and make trades .
Make it harder , and the businesses do n't like that .
IDG News Service :
They 're afraid they 're going to drive away customers .
Schneier : Of course .
If I strip search you before you go into the bank , you might change branches .
In the U.S. , the government does n't have the balls to require stuff like [ stronger authentication ] .
You 've got to make the banks responsible for losses .
The brokerage company has to [ reimburse ] me if I did n't make the trade .
Period .
End of sentence .
That 's how you fix it .
Because then , my brokerage is going to start buying security , otherwise they wo n't .
The basic rule of security :
You make the entity in the best position to mitigate the risk , responsible for the risk .
Make them responsible .
They 'll figure it out .
That 's how capitalism works .
Ground crews prepare B - 1 bombers in a file photo .
REUTERS / Ian Hodgson
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - A U.S. B - 1 bomber exploded while landing in a Qatari air base due to a technical fault on Friday , Qatar - based Al Jazeera television reported .
The television station did not say if anyone was hurt in the incident at the Al Udeid air base south of the Qatari capital Doha .
It said earlier a B - 52 plane had exploded .
A U.S. air force spokesman said he had no immediate report of such an incident and would check .
Al Udeid is used by U.S. forces in the Gulf Arab country , which hosted the advance headquarters of the U.S. - led forces in the 2003 invasion of Iraq .

The solar wind comes in two modes : fast and slow .
Solar astronomers have a good idea as to where the fast solar wind comes from : polar coronal holes of open magnetic field lines , blasting solar particles at speeds of over 3 million km / hr .
But what about the slow solar wind which fires particles into space at a pedestrian 1.5 million km /hr ?
We know it comes from the streamer belt above equatorial regions of the Sun , but we have never been able to look lower .
But now , with the help of the Hinode observatory , stunning high - resolution images and video have been captured showing solar dynamics previously overlooked .
The point at which the Sun ejects slow wind particles into space can now be studied in unparalleled detail to help us understand the dynamics of space weather and solar storms .
The Sun is a complex , magnetic body .
Its magnetic field is highly dynamic , varying in activity throughout the 11 - year solar cycle .
We have just witnessed the Sun entering “ Solar Cycle 24 ” ( although some old sunspots from the previous cycle have just been seen ) and it will gradually build in energy before reaching “ solar maximum ” in a few years time ( looks like the solar storms will be bigger than 2003 ’s flare excitement ) .
This time of relative calm ( known as “ solar minimum ” ) allows solar physicists to study the less explosive dynamics in the lower corona ( the Sun ’s atmosphere ) , chromosphere and photosphere .
It is in this region that magnetic field lines ( or magnetic flux ) are pushed through the photosphere and the plasma from the solar interior is guided by the magnetic flux high into the corona .
These hot and bright arcs of magnetism and superheated plasma are known as coronal loops , the scene of rapid reconnection events , sometimes sparking flares and coronal mass ejections ( CMEs ) .
But this time the Hinode science team have observed a steady release of solar plasma , venting from the solar interior around a cluster of bright coronal loop footpoints .
The location of this steady release of plasma forms the origin of the slow solar wind .
“ It is fantastic to finally be able to pinpoint the source of the solar wind – it has been debated for many years and now we have the final piece of the jigsaw .
In the future we want to be able to work out how the wind is transported through the solar system . ” – Prof. Louise Harra , University College London , Mullard Space Science Laboratory .
See the Hinode video of the region generating solar wind particles …
These dazzling images were captured by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer ( EIS ) on board the Japanese Hinode solar observatory .
The observatory , which orbits the Earth , constantly looking at the Sun , has given us unrivaled observations of the Sun in X -ray and EUV wavelengths .
Launched by Japan , the project also has collaborators in the UK and US .
These new discoveries are of vast importance to us .
The solar wind carries a stream of highly energetic particles from the Sun and into space .
The solar wind bathes the Earth in a radioactive stream , carrying the remnants of the solar magnetic field with it .
The magnetic field can interact with the Earth ’s magnetic field , allowing solar particles to rain down on our Polar Regions , creating vast light displays : the Aurora .
However , these particles are also highly dangerous to any unprotected astronaut or sensitive satellite orbiting our planet .
It is of paramount importance that as we venture further and further into space that we forecast the characteristics of the solar wind before it hits us .
These new observations will aid our understanding of the conditions at the solar wind source and greatly improve our space weather - predicting ability .

Trooper guarding SC governor reassigned after video shows him punching suspect David Edwards and Muriel Kane

Over the last month , the South Carolina State Highway Patrol has been embroiled in controversy after videos taken from police dashboard cameras showed two different state troopers using their patrol cars to chase and even hit fleeing suspects .
Now three new dashboard videos have been released , and one of them has already proven embarrassing to the governor .
One video shows a trooper kicking a suspect repeatedly in the head , while a second shows a trooper hitting a man with the barrel of a shotgun while he is pinned on the ground .
In the third , recorded in January 2006 , Lance Cpl. E.J. Burton punches suspect Aaron Goodman several times in the face after a high - speed chase .
" Because of our position the only thing I could do was use my hands to gain compliance , " Burton wrote in a report .
Officer Burton was ordered to undergo counseling and was later assigned to the security detail of Gov. Mark Sanford , a conservative Republican who has taken a tough stand on the violence revealed by the videos .
Burton has now been reassigned at the governor 's request .
The governor 's spokesman , Joel Sawyer , said that Sanford does not choose his security detail , to which officers are assigned based on recommendations .
" We do n't know if [ Burton 's ] punishment was adequate , and it's not our role to decide that , " Sawyer said in an e-mail to The Associated Press .
" No one in the administration , including the governor , is an expert in police policies and procedures . " ( with wire services )

Spot gold was quoted at $ 1,006.80/1,007.00 an ounce after falling to a low of $ 998.90 .
Earlier , it hit a record high of $ 1,030.80 , against its close of $ 996.90/997.70 in New York late on Friday .
Other key precious metals fell , with platinum declining more than 4 percent to a 1 - week low and palladium slipping over 6 percent in a broad - based sell off , analysts said .
" It looks as though there is just profit - taking after a great run .
There could be selling to meet margin calls as equities tank , '' said David Thurtell , analyst at BNP Paribas .
European shares fell 4.1 percent to their day 's lows in afternoon trade , led lower by banks as investors worried about contagion from a fire sale of Bear Stearns .
JPMorgan Chase said late on Sunday it would buy Bear Stearns for just $ 2 a share -- more than 90 percent below its price at Friday 's close .
The deal underlined the risks banks are facing as the U.S. mortgage crisis deepens and the rock - bottom price raised questions over valuations across the industry .

" Oil clearly led the way down , '' said David Holmes , director of metals sales at Dresdner Kleinwort Investment Bank .
" The market is incredibly jittery because of the financial situation , '' he added .
Oil plunged from a record high as a part of wider commodity sell - off sparked by growing concern over the health of the world 's largest economy .
Gold is seen as a hedge against oil - led inflation , while the metal often moves in the opposite direction of the dollar .
The dollar pared losses after tumbling to record lows against the euro earlier in the day , when liquidity - boosting measures launched by the Federal Reserve over the weekend failed to quell worry about the health of the U.S. financial sector .
Market Gets Support
But some analysts said gold was likely to get support from the financial market concerns and a weaker dollar .
The dollar earlier reacted to the Fed taking emergency measures to stem the fast - spreading financial crisis , cutting its discount rate by 25 basis points to 3.25 percent on Sunday and opening up discount window lending to major investment banks , a tool not used since the Great Depression .
Investors expect the Fed could slash overnight rates by up to 125 basis points by the end of its meeting on Tuesday .
An interest rate cut tends to weaken the dollar , which in turn helps bullion prices .
" What is really important for this week is to see what the Fed is doing , '' said Michael Widmer , analyst at Lehman Brothers , saying financial jitters would underpin the market .
" The current macro-economic backdrop , particularly in the United States , is bringing new buyers into the gold market . ''
Gold hit $ 850 an ounce in 1980 , lifted by a combination of high inflation linked to strong oil prices , the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the impact of the Iranian revolution .
After adjusting for inflation , the 1980 high is equivalent to $ 2,119.30 an ounce at 2007 prices .
The average for the whole of 1980 has been calculated at $ 1,532.14 , according to precious metals consultancy GFMS Ltd .
" As long as financial markets are driven by angst and panic , gold is likely to remain firm , '' said James Moore , precious metals analyst at TheBullionDesk.com .
In other metals , silver set a new 27 - year high at $ 21.24 before slipping as low as $ 19.92 .
It was last quoted at $ 20.28/20.33 an ounce , against $ 20.63/20.68 in New York .
Platinum fell over 4 percent to $ 1,975 an ounce before rising to $ 1,990 /2,000 , against $ 2,070/2,080 on Friday .
Palladium declined to $ 487/482 an ounce from $ 509/514 .
Sen .
Hillary Rodham Clinton ’s family has amassed enormous wealth this decade , pulling in more than $ 109 million through books , speaking fees and investments , according to tax returns released Friday by the Clinton campaign .
The returns show that the family ’s annual income shot up after her husband left the White House , rising from $ 358,000 in 2000 to $ 16 million a year later , when Bill Clinton listed his occupation as “ speaking and writing . ”
In the years since 2001 , the family ’s income has never dipped below $ 7.9 million , and reached as high as $ 20.4 million last year .
The New York senator had resisted releasing her tax records , initially promising to do so only if she won the Democratic presidential nomination .
She relented amid protests that she was withholding details about the family finances that voters needed to make their choice .
Her Democratic rival , Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois , had already made public returns covering 2000 through 2006 .

“ The Clintons have now made public 30 years of tax returns , a record matched by few people in public service , ” Jay Carson , a campaign spokesman , said in a prepared statement .
“ None of Hillary Clinton ’s presidential opponents have revealed anything close to this amount of personal financial information . ”
For Clinton , there were few appealing options .
In revealing that she and her husband are millionaires many times over , she may trigger a backlash from her political base -- households earning less than $ 75,000 a year .
In about two weeks she faces a must - win primary in Pennsylvania , where recent census data list the median income as about $ 44,000 .
That sum is less than what the Clintons claimed in expenses for “ cleaning and maintenance ” on their homes .
“ We ’re heading toward the economic doldrums , ” said Democratic strategist Bill Carrick .
“ It ’s a pretty inconvenient time for this to come out . ”

Obama ’s tax records show a large disparity in wealth between the rivals .
The Obamas had a lucrative 2005 , for example , making more than $ 1.6 million .
That year the Clintons hauled in more than $ 18 million .
In 2006 , the Clintons earned $ 16 million to the Obamas ’ $ 991,296 .
Presumptive Republican nominee John McCain has said he will release his tax returns later this month .
Both Clinton and Obama have called for rolling back the Bush administration ’s tax cuts for the wealthy , including themselves .

For the Clintons , the post - presidential years have seen a change in financial fortune on an epic scale .
When the couple exited the White House in January 2001 , they had amassed more than $ 11 million in legal debts , incurred during investigations into the Whitewater controversy and the former president ’s affair with Monica S. Lewinsky .
Through a book deal , paid speeches , business partnerships and investments , Bill Clinton catapulted his family into a rarefied level of personal wealth .
He collected nearly $ 52 million in income from speeches , and a total of $ 29.6 million from two books -- “ Giving ” and his autobiography , “ My Life . ”
Advertisement
For her part , Hillary Clinton earned more than $ 10 million from her memoir , “ Living History ” -- a sum that included an $ 8 - million advance .
Overall , the Clintons paid $ 33,783,507 in federal taxes from 2000 - 2007 -- 31 % of their adjusted gross income , according to the campaign .
They made charitable contributions of more than $ 10 million .
The pace of their charitable giving picked up last year , when Hillary Clinton began her presidential run .
In a summary of income and contributions expected for 2007 , the Clintons are listed as making more than $ 3 million in charitable donations .
This is double the charitable donations the couple made in 2006 .
The actual 2007 return was not available because the Clintons are asking for an extension to file .

The returns offer the first public peek at how much Bill Clinton has made so far from his partnership with Los Angeles - based billionaire Ron Burkle , a close friend and political backer .
The former president became a senior advisor to Burkle ’s investment firm , Yucaipa Cos. , in early 2002 .
Thereafter , federal ethics forms filed annually by Hillary Clinton described his Yucaipa - related income only as “ over $ 1,000 . ”
Neither Burkle nor Bill Clinton has specified exactly what Clinton ’s advisory duties entailed .
The tax returns show Clinton has received about $ 12.6 million for his work for Yucaipa between 2003 and 2006 .
The Clintons said they will report another $ 2.75 million in Yucaipa partnership income for 2007 , bringing the total to more than $ 15.3 million .
The newly released tax information also shows that Bill Clinton received $ 800,000 in consulting fees from InfoUSA Inc. , a consumer data marketing company headed by another friend and political supporter , Vinod Gupta .
In lawsuits , dissident shareholders have criticized InfoUSA ’s payments to Clinton , as well as $ 900,000 in travel provided to the former first couple , as wasting company assets .

Asked what the former president has done for InfoUSA , a campaign spokesman said he shares “ his thoughts on the domestic and global economy , and world affairs . ”
The Clinton family investments include one in Quellos Alpha Engine , part of the hedge fund Quellos Capital Management of Seattle .
The New York investment house BlackRock bought Quellos last year .
Before the sale , a Senate subcommittee accused Quellos of trading in abusive tax shelters .
The firm reportedly also was the subject of an Internal Revenue Service investigation .
Quellos denied wrongdoing .
A Clinton spokesman said the Quellos investment had been purchased by a blind trust operated on behalf of the Clintons .
The Clintons had no knowledge of how the funds in their blind trust were being invested , the spokesman said .

As of 2006 , the Clintons switched from an accountant to a lawyer for tax preparation .
This resulted in changes for returns filed in 2004 and 2005 .
The amended returns show that , in 2004 , because of a “ clerical error ” on the tax preparer ’s part , the Clintons originally had failed to report income of $ 106,000 .
And in 2005 , an extra deduction was found that reduced their income by $ 144,000 .
The returns also show the Clintons have made several loans to family members .
A campaign spokesman said the couple charged no interest .
Asked if the loans went to Hillary Clinton ’s two brothers , Hugh and Tony Rodham , or to Bill Clinton ’s half - brother , Roger Clinton , the spokesman said the loans were “ personal ” and the Clintons wanted to “ respect their family members ’ privacy . ”

DIGG THIS
Nothing could be better for the country than cancelling the 2008 election .
Leave the office of the presidency empty .
I can see only one possible justification for having a president of the United States : to preside over the dismantling of the federal government .
If you think this is a radical idea , think again .
This is , in part , what people have long voted for , even if they never actually get it .
I can hardly remember a time when a president has been elected who did n’t promise to get the government off our backs .
In one way , this agenda makes no sense , of course .
You do n’t hire a CEO to drive a company into bankruptcy .
You do n’t appoint a pastor to shrink a congregation .
Why should we expect a president to dismantle the thing that gives him power and fame , and his allies huge wealth ?
Well , realistically , you can’t .
But it ’s the best hope we have within the framework of conventional politics .
The irony is that most presidents get elected on the prospect that they will curb power .
It ’s true of George Bush , who promised domestic cuts and a humble foreign policy .
Clinton was also elected on the promise of middle - class tax cuts .
We can go back and back and see it was true for the first Bush , for Reagan , for Carter , for Nixon , and so on .
For that matter , FDR himself denounced government spending during this first campaign .
“ I accuse the present administration [ Hoover ’s ] of being the greatest spending administration in peace times in all our history , ” and added , “ On my part , I ask you very simply to assign to me the task of reducing the annual operating expenses of your national government . ”
He further denounced the government for “ fostering regimentation without stint or limit . ”
It was even true with George Washington , who had made innumerable speeches on the evil of tyranny only to take power and use it to the benefit of the powerful .
Even Jefferson succumbed with his mistaken Louisiana Purchase , though he later entertained the possibility of a salutary breakup of the United States .
And so on it goes .
And it will happen again , despite all promises .
Folks , there is something wrong with this model of governance , not just current policy but the whole structure .
We might even argue that the error goes back to the Constitution , a document that created new government powers unprecedented in Colonial history , and put the government in charge of restraining itself .
It set up competitive divisions within government under the presumption that they would keep each other in check .
Instead , they cooperated toward mutual expansion , especially after the federal power seizure called the Civil War .
Part of the problem dates to a core error within liberal theory : the belief that it was possible to create a government that was an extension of society , thanks to the relentless input of the people via democratic institutions .
What this model did instead is enlist the public as part of their own destruction .
And it created confusion about who precisely is to blame when things do n’t work out .
Under democracy , are n’t we the government ?
Are n’t we doing this to ourselves ?
Let ’s draw on another aspect of old - time liberal theory as a means of finding a way out of this mess .
There are two additional contributions that liberalism made .
It taught that society is capable of self - management , and that government is not the reason for order in society .
Summing up the old liberal position , Thomas Paine said :
A great part of that order which reigns among mankind is not the effect of government .
It had its origin in the principles of society , and the natural constitution of man .
It existed prior to government , and would exist if the formality of government was abolished .
The mutual dependence and reciprocal interest which man has in man and all the parts of a civilized community upon each other create that great chain of connection which holds it together .
The landholder , the farmer , the manufacturer , the merchant , the tradesman , and every occupation prospers by the aid which each receives from the other , and from the whole .
Common interest regulates their concerns , and forms their laws ; and the laws which common usage ordains , have a greater influence than the laws of government .
In fine , society performs for itself almost everything that is ascribed to government .
If we would be true to this line of thought , we should propose the unthinkable : cancel the election .
This has never before been so urgent .
Neither party will cut government in a way that is desperately needed .
Instead , they offer a left - or right - tinged Americanized socialism or fascism .
One promises domestic expansion and foreign reduction ; the other promises foreign expansion and domestic reduction .
The inevitable compromise : expand both domestically and internationally .
In addition , whatever the new president does will make our growing economic problems worse .
The economic interventions they propose will add to our troubles , whether that means expanding inflation , taxes , controls , or debt .
Another war is unthinkable , but probably inevitable .
You can already detect it in the aggressive trajectory towards Iran .
More business regulation can only dampen the fires of free enterprise , which are our saving grace today .
The best solution would be a government that would destroy itself .
The second best solution would be a government that does nothing at all — then , at least , matters will not get worse .
This is what canceling the election would do .
It would introduce enough confusion and chaos to keep government from acting either domestically or internationally , which would be a wonderful thing .
There is also the matter of public will .
We pretend as if the person who is elected enjoys the support of a majority .
Nonsense .
Most people who can vote do not vote , and who can blame them ?
Those who do vote are most likely voting against the other guy and not for a positive program .
The person elected will enjoy a mandate of perhaps 5 — 10 % of the population that actively supports the agenda .
I say : make the new president their president but not our president .
It ’s true that what I ’m proposing constitutes a purely negative agenda .
So let ’s look to a positive goal .
This country is too large to be governed from the center .
It is long past time that it be broken into ever smaller pieces , even to the size of the world ’s smallest nations .
In that way , the US government will cease to be a menace to its citizens and to the world .
Prosperity will be assured in the same way it always has : through peace and free trade with all .
But what about the Constitution ?
Let Jefferson speak : “ We have not yet so far perfected our constitutions as to venture to make them unchangeable … .
But can they be made unchangeable ?…
I think not .
The Creator has made the earth for the living , not the dead .
Rights and powers can only belong to persons , not to things . ”

Short - term exposure to current levels of ozone in many areas is likely to contribute to premature deaths , says a new National Research Council report , which adds that the evidence is strong enough that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency should include ozone - related mortality in health - benefit analyses related to future ozone standards .
The committee that wrote the report was not asked to consider how evidence has been used by EPA to set ozone standards , including the new public health standard set by the agency last month .
Ozone , a key component of smog , can cause respiratory problems and other health effects .
In addition , evidence of a relationship between short - term -- less than 24 hours -- exposure to ozone and mortality has been mounting , but interpretations of the evidence have differed , prompting EPA to request the Research Council report .
In particular , the agency asked the committee to analyze the ozone - mortality link and assess methods for assigning a monetary value to lives saved for the health - benefits assessments .
Based on a review of recent research , the committee found that deaths related to ozone exposure are more likely among individuals with pre-existing diseases and other factors that could increase their susceptibility .
However , premature deaths are not limited to people who are already within a few days of dying .
In addition , the committee examined research based on large population groups to find how changes in ozone air concentration could affect mortality , specifically to determine the existence of a threshold -- a concentration of ozone below which exposure poses no risk of death .
The committee concluded that if a threshold exists , it is probably at a concentration below the current public health standard .
As people have individual susceptibilities to ozone exposure , not everyone may experience an altered risk of death if ozone air concentration also changes .
Further research should explore how personal thresholds may vary and the extent to which they depend on a person 's frailty , the committee said .
The research on short - term exposure does not account for all ozone - related mortality , and the estimated risk of death may be greater than if based solely on these studies , the committee noted .
To better understand all the possible connections between ozone and mortality , future research should address whether exposure for more than 24 hours and long - term exposure -- weeks to years -- are associated with mortality , including how ozone exposure could impact life expectancy .
For example , deaths related to short - term exposure may not occur until several days afterward or may be associated with multiple short - term exposures .
Additionally , EPA should monitor ozone during the winter months when it is low and in communities with warmer and cooler winters to better understand seasonal and regional differences in risk .
More research could also look at how other pollutants , such as airborne particulate matter , may affect ozone and mortality risk .
EPA , like other federal agencies , is required to carry out a cost - benefit analysis on mitigation actions that cost more than $ 100 million per year .
EPA recently used the results of population studies to estimate the number of premature deaths that would be avoided by expected ozone reductions for different policy choices , and then assigned a monetary value to the avoided deaths by using the value of a statistical life ( VSL ) .
The VSL is derived from studies of adults who indicate the " price " that they would be willing to pay -- i.e. what benefits or conveniences someone would be willing to forgo -- to change their risk of death in a given period by a small amount .
The monetary value of the improved health outcome is based on the value the group places on receiving the health benefit ; it is not the value selected by policymakers or experts .
EPA applies the VSL to all lives saved regardless of the age or health status .
For instance , a person who is 80 years old in poor health is estimated to have the same VSL as a healthy 2 - year - old .
To determine if an approach that accounts for differences in remaining life expectancy could be supported scientifically , EPA asked the committee to examine the value of extending life .
For example , EPA could calculate VSL to estimate the value of remaining life , so a 2 - year - old would have a higher VSL than an 80 - year - old .
It is plausible that people with shorter remaining life expectancy would be willing to devote fewer resources to reducing their risk of premature death than those with longer remaining life expectancy .
In contrast , if the condition causing the shortened life expectancy could be improved and an acceptable quality of life can be preserved or restored , people may put a high value on extending life , even if they have other health impairments or are quite elderly .
The committee concluded that EPA should not adjust the VSL because current evidence is not sufficient to determine how the value might change according to differences in remaining life expectancy and health status .
However , the committee did not reject the idea that such adjustments may be appropriate in the future .
To move toward determining a value of remaining life , alternative approaches should be explored in sensitivity analyses , and further research should be conducted to answer the questions raised about the validity of EPA 's current approach .

Last week Apple announced the new , more powerful , Mac Mini .
Just as I was putting the finishing touches on my own tricked out Mini .
Advertisement
I 'd been planning on writing this feature for weeks now and last week 's announcement made me a bit nervous .
What if all the work I 'd done to trick out my Mini was now obsolete ?
Turns out that while some of it would be a bit easier , for the most part all the pimpin '
I 'd done could be done to the make the newer machines the best they could be too .
What you 'll find beyond the jump will show you , regardless of what flavor of Mini you have , a bunch of cool ways to upgrade , hack and modify your little machine into the coolest computer in your home .

Mini for media storage and playback
The Mini is great for media storage , and with a little bit of work , media playback .
I first got my Mini to be used as a glorified stereo and media storage unit .
I did n't even have a real monitor for it , I just hooked it up to my old TV .
The display was pretty weak , most of the time I used my VPN and iTunes to control it remotely .
I dumped all my mp3s , my photos and miscellaneous files onto it and let it sit , using it only to pull files from occasionally .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
I 've learned recently that it can do so much more .
A Really Big Monitor : Your TV .
To truly trick your Mini out you 'll want it hooked up to your TV .
There are quite a few newer televisions that can handle the Mini's DVI out , either directly — as mine does — or via a VGA adapter .
I 've got it hooked up to a 50 " Samsung DLP with HD and it looks great .
Advertisement
If your TV does n't have a DVI or VGA input you can buy a Video adapter and use that , although the picture wo n't be all that great .
I 've tried this on an older Sony Wega we 've got and it looks pretty blurry .
You 'll need to spend a bit of time tinkering with your display settings and the TV's On Screen Display to get it right .
Pay particular attention to the resolution , the positioning and the zoom .
From Apple :
Picture zoom : Picture Zoom will typically allow you to adjust the size of the picture displayed on the TV .
Use this in conjunction with the Overscan option under Display Preferences on the Mac mini to get an optimal picture size

More speed and Power !
This is n't as much of a concern with the newest Minis .
However , if you 're like me and you 're working with an older model you 'll need to upgrade the RAM .
This can be a bit tricky , as the Mini is a pain in the you - know - what to open .
I used the two putty - knife technique detailed in this Macworld article and was able to do it without any damage .
However , it was a bit freaky and took a steady hand .
Advertisement
Since you 'll be working with lots of large files , video and a variety of media , you 'll want to max the RAM out .
More storage !
While you 're at it , be sure and up the storage as well .
I went with this great LaCie firewire hard drive that fits in perfectly with the mini .
Sure you could go with something a bit less ... fancy ... but this is about tricking the Mini out .
It needs to look good .
Advertisement
More Ports
( If you need 'em )
The newer Minis have quite a few more USB ports .
I needed to add a hub to make sure I could easily connect to my iPod and Cameras for easy media transfer .
I went with style again and got the Belkin hub with Mini form factor .
Advertisement
Audio
Getting good audio from your Mini can be as simple as as using an AirPort Express or Monster cable .
Or you can kick it up a notch and try something like the M - Audio Transit that 'll give you more options and higher quality sound .
Advertisement
I went with a knock - off Monster cable that connects right into my receiver and it works great .
To be honest though , I 'm no audiophile and I 'm still working some things out to get the best possible output .
iTunes and iPhoto on an external drive
Now that you 've got the storage , memory and ports you need , it 's time to configure iTunes and iPhoto to store files on your external drive .
You do n't have to do this , but I like to keep all my permanent files in one place ( if possible ) and the Mini 's hard drive just is n't big enough .
Advertisement
This is n't all that hard to do , but it does take some tweaking .
iTunes is actually pretty simple .
You just go into your " Preferences " and under " Advanced " you can simply browse to a location on your external drive .
If you 've already got a library , just copy it over first and delete it off the Mini when you 're done .
i Photo is a bit more challenging , but not all that hard .
I followed the instructions from this Mac OSX Hints posting and that worked just fine .
Advertisement
Soon you 'll have all your media organized and stored in a shared location that will take a long while to fill up .
Front Row and Media Center
On the new Mac minis you 'll have Front Row ( a really neat media center UI ) natively installed .
This is great !
For those who do n't have a Mac Mini , you 'll need to do some hackery to get it working .
We 've covered this before and it 's fairly straight forward .
Another option is using a Front Row knock - off like Media Central .
The new Front Row ( with Bonjour support ) is pretty nifty though and I 'd recommend that .
Advertisement
Remote Control
The new Minis come with a killer remote that 'll work with Front Row , but you may want more control than that .
I 've gone with the new Logitech s530 a wireless keyboard and mouse set made especially for the Mac .
It looks great and gives you a bit more control than the remote .

More resources
There are many options you can explore for your Mini .
Here are some links to some great resources .

Seen here is an example of a purported rat king , a giant rat beast created when many rats get their tails tangled together .
Legend has it that the rats then grow together into a single creepy entity .
This mummified " rat king " was discovered in 1828 in Buchheim , Germany and is currently on display at the museum Mauritianum in Altenburg , Germany .
From Wikipedia :
The earliest report of rat kings comes from 1564 .
If real , the phenomenon may have diminished when the brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ) displaced the black rat ( R. Rattus ) in the 18th century .
Sightings have been sporadic in the modern era ; most recently comes an Estonian farmer 's discovery in the Võrumaa region on January 16 , 2005 .
Most extant examples are formed from black rats ( R. rattus ) .
The only find involving sawah rats ( Rattus rattus brevicaudatus ) occurred on March 23 , 1918 , in Bogor on Java , where a rat king of ten young field rats was found .
Similar attachments have been reported in other species : in April 1929 , a group of young forest mice ( Apodemus sylvaticus ) was reported in Holstein ; and there have been reports of squirrel kings .
The Zoological Institute of the University of Hamburg allegedly owns a specimen .
Rat kings are not to be confused with conjoined twins , which arise in many species .
Rat kings would grow together only after birth .
Recent reports have all stated that more Americans are playing video games than ever before , but exactly how many people are picking up a controller in America ?
A new " Online Gaming 2008 " report from the NPD Group finds that 72 percent of the US plays video games , a dramatic increase from the 63 percent who said they played in the previous year .
The amount of people playing games online , however , is much lower than expected , with 42 percent of people saying they play games online , up only two percent from last year .
Unsurprisingly , the PC plays a large part in online gaming .
90 percent of those who said they play online play through their PCs , versus only 19 percent playing on a game console or portable and three percent using a cell phone .
Not only do people play online games on their PCs , they are becoming increasingly comfortable purchasing games online as well .
Steam has just received Ubisoft 's blessing to sell its games online , including the yet - to - be - released PC version of Assassin 's Creed , and the platform was instrumental in building buzz for the hit rhythm game Audiosurf .
This is of course not even counting the runaway success of online games like World of WarCraft , a game that has almost become its own industry .
The money spent on digital downloads and online subscription - based gaming is often absent from market research on the strength of the PC gaming industry , something that NPD is trying to correct ; the group is now tracking online subscription sales for a quarterly report .
" We would n't be initiating coverage of online subscriptions if we did n't believe it was a big and growing market , " Martin Zagorsek , vice president of games and software at NPD , told Video Business .
The report will include information on any business with a subscription - based revenue source , which should include game arcade services like GameTap .
Still , NPD does n't have any illusions about these numbers .
" Despite the buzz in the industry regarding online gaming , it is still relatively small compared to offline gaming , " said Anita Frazier , an industry analyst for the NPD Group .
" There is still a large , untapped market for gaming in general and online gaming in particular . "
Younger gamers are growing up to be more comfortable gaming online .
Gamers aged 2 to 12 hold over 25 percent of the online gaming market , while gamers aged 18 to 24 have only 10 percent .
Among consoles , Xbox Live is proving to be a powerful force for Microsoft ; the Xbox 360 is the most popular console for online play .
NPD does point out that households with multiple consoles are rare , with only three percent claiming to own two of the three " next - gen " systems , and only two percent claiming to own an Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , and a Nintendo Wii .
While the " PC gaming is dying ! " cry is still often heard around the Internet , it seems that much of the computer gaming market is merely heading online , as evidenced by certain aspects of this report and NPD 's new dedication to tracking online subscriptions .
Overall , however , the gaming market is showing strong growth , but online gaming is n't nearly as large as the conversations about it would have you believe .
Young gamers may bring the numbers up as they grow into an increasingly connected world , demanding the same social aspects from their games , but with online gaming there is currently more flash than fire .
Mark Penn , Hillary Clinton and the corporate domination of the Democratic Party
By Patrick Martin
12 April 2008
The resignation of Mark Penn , the top campaign strategist for Hillary Clinton , sheds light on a feature of the Democratic Party that is not merely an aspect , but rather the essence , of this political institution : it , like the Republican Party , is a wholly owned subsidiary of corporate interests .
Penn stepped down after the Wall Street Journal revealed that he had met March 31 with the Colombian ambassador to the United States to discuss a campaign to lobby Congress for approval of the US - Colombia free - trade pact .
While Senator Clinton is a public opponent of the pact and has vowed to vote against it , Penn , in his capacity as CEO of the giant lobbying firm Burson Marsteller , signed a $ 300,000 contract with the Colombian government to push for passage .
There were probably internal reasons for Penn ’s departure as well as the flagrant conflict between his corporate and political roles .
The Clinton campaign is in dire straits , with polls showing a shrinking or even nonexistent lead in Pennsylvania , where defeat in the April 22 primary would effectively end Clinton ’s candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination .
Penn played a major role in the transformation of Clinton from near - certain nominee six months ago to an increasingly desperate and visibly demoralized candidate , hoping for a miraculous implosion of the new frontrunner , Senator Barack Obama .
He was reportedly a strong advocate of Clinton ’s positioning herself on the right of the Democratic field , particularly on the issue of the war in Iraq , and adopting the pose of presumptive nominee .
Forced by the dynamic of the campaign — her two main rivals , Obama and John Edwards , initially made a more overt appeal to social and economic discontent — as well as by the eruption of the US financial crisis , Clinton has been compelled to strike a more populist pose in the course of the primaries .
As a result , on one occasion after another , she has demagogically attacked US corporations and industries that are well - paying clients of her top campaign strategist .
The list of companies that have consulted with or hired Penn and Burson Marsteller is a rogues ’ gallery of corporate America :
* Blackwater Worldwide , the mercenary contractor that has killed hundreds of Iraqis in the course of its work supplying bodyguards for State Department and other US officials .
* Countrywide Financial , the largest US mortgage lender , which became notorious for awarding eight - figure pay packages to CEO Angelo Mozilo while pushing tens of thousands of subprime borrowers into foreclosure .
* TXU Corp. , a giant Texas firm seeking to build power plants burning pulverized coal , while Clinton publicly advocates reduction of greenhouse gases .
* Cintas Corp. , a uniform rental company that Penn advised on how to smash a union - organizing drive , while Clinton was collecting the lion ’s share of union endorsements .
* The giant drug companies Merck and Pfizer .
* The biggest US tobacco firm , Altria Group ( formerly Philip Morris ) .
* The US Tuna Foundation , which has sought to combat warnings about mercury levels in fish .
* Royal Dutch
Shell , the world ’s second largest oil company , whose US chief , John Hofmeister , met with Penn in Houston .
Penn is not some corporate gunslinger who was hired by the Clintons for his advertising and polling expertise .
He is a longtime political operative who has parlayed his close ties with leading figures in the Democratic Party into a lucrative corporate career .
Penn and his partner Douglas Schoen founded their polling firm in 1977 while working for the election of Edward Koch as mayor of New York .
They plunged into Israeli politics as well , working for the reelection campaign of Likud Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1981 , where they utilized the Israeli air strike on the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq as political propaganda .
Closely associated with the right - wing Democratic Leadership Council , Penn worked on several campaigns for Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut .
Penn managed his disastrous 2004 presidential campaign as well as his Senate reelection campaign in 2006 , when Lieberman lost the Democratic nomination to an antiwar candidate but retained his seat by running as an “ Independent Democrat ” with tacit Republican support .
Penn ’s ties to the Clintons go back to the 1996 reelection campaign , when he worked with political adviser Dick Morris to carry out the strategy known as “ triangulation , ” adopting positions that would conciliate with the Republican right wing , then in control of Congress .
He later worked for Hillary Clinton ’s US Senate campaign in 2000 .
Throughout this period , his polling and marketing business attracted corporate customers as well .
In 2001 , the world ’s second - largest advertising company , WPP Group PLC , bought the Penn Schoen firm .
Penn became CEO of Burson - Marsteller , a US subsidiary of WPP Group , in December 2005 .
He insisted on keeping this corporate role when he signed on as principal strategist of Clinton ’s 2008 presidential campaign .
Penn ’s contract with the Colombian government is not an aberration .
A whole slew of prominent Democrats have endorsed the US - Colombia trade pact and in some cases signed on as lobbyists .
One of the two men who replaces Penn at the top of the Clinton campaign , campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson , has a direct financial interest in the Glover Park Group , another lobbying firm hired to represent Colombia .
Though Wolfson left Glover Park last year to join the campaign full - time , he still has a million - dollar equity stake in the firm , jointly owned with his wife Terri McCullough , who is herself the chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi .
Former Clinton
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart remains a partner at Glover Park .
The firm ’s CEO , Carl Smith , was chief of staff to the 2000 presidential campaign of Al Gore .
Hillary Clinton was at pains to disavow any connection to the Colombia trade pact , particularly in the run-up to the April 22 Pennsylvania vote .
She appeared before a meeting of the Communication Workers of America Tuesday to reiterate , “ As I have said for months , I oppose the deal , I have spoken out against the deal , I will vote against the deal and I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia free trade agreement . ”
The trade union bureaucracy is opposed to every US trade deal from the standpoint of economic protectionism , since it is allied with the more backward and uncompetitive US industries that fear an influx of foreign goods .
In the case of Colombia , the argument is even more heated , since the regime is notorious for its links to right - wing death squads that have made Colombia the world ’s leader in murdering trade unionists .
In one statement last week , Clinton demanded “ no trade deal with Colombia while violence against trade unionists continues in that country . ”
Adding to the candidate ’s political problems , however , is that the murder of trade unionists apparently cuts no ice with her own husband , the former president , a long - time supporter of the US - Colombia trade agreement .
According to press reports , Colombia was one of the many lucrative clients Bill Clinton has used to amass his post - White House personal fortune .
A Colombian business group , Gold Service International , paid him $ 800,000 in 2005 for four days of speech - making .
Campaign spokesman Jay Carson sought to dismiss the conflict between Hillary Clinton ’s public posture and Bill Clinton ’s rainmaking as though it was a dispute over the color of the carpeting in their living room .
“ Like other married couples who disagree on issues from time to time , she disagrees with her husband on this issue , ” he said .

2010 Ectomobile !
Sunday morning I got up early , tossed a bunch of common junk ( frisbees and cd cases ) into the bed of my car and
pulled back the bed cover to hide it all .
Washed the car briefly and then met up with about a dozen WRX STIs that were completely decked - out for racing .
We traded names and had some donuts , Shauna moved her stuff into my car and then we were on our way .
Somehow I managed to keep up with these subie beasts on the interstate , at times pushing my car over 105 mph .
Let 's just say I had to reposition the dish when we got there ...
My Ecto was one of the first 30 cars to show up ...
Running the lights and siren , and blasting out our GB mix cd , we attracted quite a crowd .
After about a half our we blew our main power switch , melted the bugger .
I shut everything down then Shauna and I walked around talking to people and enjoying the beautiful warm day .
Over 220 Subarus and other street racers showed up to this meet .
I was one of four wagons there , the other three were a brand new 2006 Outback ( white ... grrrr ! ) , an older green legacy from Fort Collins , and a black Volvo !

A few weeks ago I started getting emails on my myspace inviting the FC GBs to bring our car to the Red Rocks Subaru Meet , which is sort of an unofficial car show up in the mountains just barely west of Denver .

WASHINGTON , DC - Bart Gordon , the Tennessee Democrat who chairs the House Committee on Science and Technology , does not want the United States to receive low - level radioactive waste from Italy , process it in Tennessee and dispose of it in a Utah waste site .
He says acceptance of the waste would put the U.S. on a path to becoming " the world 's nuclear garbage waste dump . "
On Friday , Gordon asked the Northwest Interstate Compact for Low - Level Radioactive Waste Management to withhold its support for a license application to accept the Italian waste filed by EnergySolutions , the company that operates the only private Class A low - level radioactive waste disposal in the United States .
This application marks the first time in the history of the NRC that a company has asked to dispose of large amounts of foreign - generated low - level radioactive waste in the United States .
" The U.S. already faces capacity issues and other challenges in treating and disposing of radioactive waste produced domestically , " said Gordon .
" We should be working on solving this problem at home before taking dangerous waste from around the world . "
Low - level radioactive waste consists of contaminated protective shoe covers and clothing , wiping rags , mops , filters , reactor water treatment residues , equipments and tools , luminous dials , medical tubes , swabs , injection needles , syringes , and laboratory animal carcasses and tissues , according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission .
The radioactivity can range from just above background levels found in nature to very highly radioactive in certain cases such as parts from inside the reactor vessel in a nuclear power plant , the NRC says .
Gordon has long said that the application did not appear to represent a " one- time " event because EnergySolutions , which became a publicly traded company in November , has made clear its intent to pursue decommissioning work in both the United States and Europe .

" It is highly likely that this is the first application with a string to follow , " Gordon said .
On November 16 , 2007 , EnergySolutions ' CEO and Chairman of the Board Steve Creamer rang the bell to open trading at the New York Stock Exchange where EnergySolutions ' stock ( NYSE : ES ) began trading publicly .
EnergySolutions operates waste processing and disposition facilities in Tennessee , South Carolina , and Utah .
The company also operates low - level radioactive waste disposal facilities , vaults , and landfills on the Department of Energy 's Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee and Savannah River Site in South Carolina .
U.S. low - level waste is typically stored on - site by licensees , according to the NRC , either until it has decayed away and can be disposed of as ordinary trash , or until amounts are large enough for shipment to a low - level waste disposal site in containers approved by the Department of Transportation .
To obtain a permit to send waste to a law - level radioactive waste depository , federal regulations require the approval of the state and the Compact in which the disposal site is located .
EnergySolutions disposes of more than 90 percent of the low - level radioactive waste generated in the U.S. through a license granted by the State of Utah and with the permission of the Northwest Compact .
The Compact allows EnergySolutions to take low - level radioactive waste from outside the Compact because it serves " an important national purpose " and has reserved the right to " modify or rescind " its authorization at any time .

The end could be near .
Or the endgame , at least , of a surprisingly drawn - out Democratic presidential contest .
Four months and 42 states after the opening Iowa caucuses , the primary in North Carolina on May 6 now looms as a pivotal final showdown between Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Obama starts with a double - digit lead in polls here , a state where 2,400 free tickets to his rally at the War Memorial Auditorium in Greensboro last week were gone within three hours of the announcement he would appear .
But Clinton has appeal in the Tar Heel State , too , and is competing hard .
The day after Obama 's rally , she drew 1,000 supporters to the gym at Terry Sanford High School in Fayetteville for a town hall meeting .
" I really believe May 6 has the potential to be everything , " says Joe Trippi , a strategist for the presidential bids of former North Carolina senator John Edwards this year and Howard Dean in 2004 .
" Every day you see increased pressure on Hillary Clinton about why she 's staying in , and if she could win in North Carolina it would shut down that kind of talk and open up the possibility she could get there " to the nomination .
" But if he wins in North Carolina , " Trippi says of Obama , " I think you 're going to see things close up very quickly .
You 'll see a lot of superdelegates line up behind him . "
The Pennsylvania primary comes first , on April 22 , with 158 convention delegates at stake .
Clinton is favored there , though a Quinnipiac University Poll released Wednesday showed her lead narrowing to single digits , 50 % - 41 % .
An unexpected victory by Obama would dash her hopes for a comeback , but a win by Clinton would n't be the sort of surprise that could reshape the race .
Indiana , which also votes May 6 , is considered a tossup .
In North Carolina , however , an upset by Clinton could change the dynamic of a contest now heading in Obama 's favor .
He leads narrowly among pledged delegates and the overall popular vote .
She leads narrowly among superdelegates — a group of about 800 Democratic officeholders and officials who are automatic and uncommitted delegates — but he has been closing that gap since the Super Tuesday contests Feb .
5 . Minnesota Sen .
Amy Klobuchar announced her support for Obama on Monday , following high - profile endorsements by Pennsylvania Sen. Robert Casey and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson .
Former Indiana congressman Lee Hamilton , the top Democrat on the 9/11 Commission , also endorsed him Wednesday .
The Associated Press count gives Clinton 250 superdelegates , Obama 218 .
Overall , Obama has 1,634 delegates to Clinton 's 1,500 .
Clinton campaign officials dispute the idea that a loss in North Carolina would be devastating , and Clinton has vowed to campaign until the last vote is counted , even if that means a credentials fight at the August convention in Denver .
" It 's certainly not in the category of a must - win type state , " says Averell " Ace " Smith , director of her campaign in North Carolina .
" It 's more in a category of , if we happen to pull an upset , would that change the way the whole race is looked at ?
Yes , absolutely . "
Still , Obama partisans and some unaffiliated Democrats , including Trippi , see North Carolina as Clinton 's last chance to turn around her fading prospects — or face intense pressure from party leaders to suspend her campaign and avoid a summer of trench warfare that could hurt Democratic prospects in the general election this fall .
" She 's running out of real estate , " says Craig Schirmer , Obama 's state director .
" There are only so many contests left , only so many more delegates , only so many more votes to get . "
An unexpected ' pivotal ' role
The key audience for the North Carolina returns are the superdelegates crucial to boosting either rival 's convention count to 2,024 , the number needed for nomination .
" Hillary Clinton needs a win in North Carolina to be able to convince superdelegates to join her cause , and Barack Obama needs to win in North Carolina to put to rest any speculation that he could lose the nomination , " says state party Chairman Jerry Meek , a Fayetteville lawyer neutral in the contest .
" So I think that we 're going to play a pivotal role , " he says .
That 's as much a surprise to Meek as anyone else .
Never before has North Carolina 's primary been important in the Democratic nominating contest .
It last played a notable role in the GOP contest more than three decades ago , in 1976 , when challenger Ronald Reagan defeated President Gerald Ford .
Last year , a bill in the state Legislature to move up the primary in hopes of giving the state more clout failed .
Neither Democratic campaign had opened an office or scheduled an appearance here until two weeks ago .
Meek had been pleased mostly that the state had gotten two " bonus " superdelegates for resisting the temptation to hold an earlier contest .
Now North Carolina and the other states at the end of the Democratic primary calendar — Indiana , West Virginia , Kentucky , Oregon , Montana and South Dakota , plus Puerto Rico and Guam — are getting unusual attention .
In recent days , the Obama campaign opened 13 offices across North Carolina and sent in Schirmer , an architect of the senator 's win in South Carolina and the campaign 's state director in Wisconsin , which Obama carried .
The Clinton camp dispatched Smith , who ran her winning campaigns in California and Texas .
Each is trying to set high expectations in a state where Obama has a 12 percentage - point lead , according to the four most recent state polls , averaged by RealClearPolitics.com .
Schirmer calls the contest " very competitive " and " very , very close . "
Smith , on the other hand , says a win by Clinton " would be , like , one of the greatest upsets of the last quarter - century . "
The Clinton campaign is pouring in resources , including separate visits during the past week by Hillary , Chelsea and Bill Clinton .
On Friday , he stumped in seven cities , from Kannapolis to Gastonia .
The former president acknowledges the stakes are high .
" This whole thing could come down to what you all decide to do in North Carolina , " the former president told voters in Cary .
" This is a state which is very much involved in all the promise and all the peril that 's going on in the American economy . "
Meanwhile , the Obama camp has begun airing a TV ad decrying plant closures and job losses .
" Enough is enough , " Obama declares in the 30 - second spot .
Navigating a narrow path Hillary Clinton 's path to the nomination is a narrow one : Win big in Pennsylvania , prevail in North Carolina and force a favorable resolution of disputes over the Florida and Michigan delegations .
The two states ' delegates currently do n't have seats at the convention because they were chosen in primaries held earlier than party rules allowed .
Clinton 's efforts to schedule new votes there have failed .
Strong showings in the final states could reduce Obama 's lead in pledged delegates — though it is virtually impossible for her to overtake him , given the way the party distributes delegates proportionately in each state — and even gain her an edge in the popular vote .
That would reinforce her argument to superdelegates that she wins the big states that would be crucial in a general - election campaign against presumptive Republican nominee John McCain .
A misstep or controversy that ensnared Obama would help Clinton , too , though he 's apparently survived a furor in recent weeks over controversial remarks by his former pastor , Jeremiah Wright .
Clinton is spotlighting economic angst among working - class voters — the same issue her husband used when he promised to focus " like a laser beam " on the economy in the 1992 primaries .
" The Bush economy is like a trapdoor " that has left too many Americans at risk of " falling through and losing everything , " she tells an audience at Wake Technical Community College in Raleigh .
" It 's time for a president who is ready on Day One to be commander in chief of our economy . "
Heads nod around the meeting room , where about 500 supporters and students are gathered .
She ticks off in detail her proposals for a job retraining program and a program to create " green - collar " jobs that are environmentally friendly , for one program to help families afford college tuition and another to boost those struggling to keep their mortgages current .
" She has specific plans on getting us out of the war , on health care and the economy , " Barbara Carson , 60 , a former FBI agent and employer - relations consultant who is in the audience , says approvingly .
" While Barack is a good candidate , he does n't have the specifics .
He has blue - sky visions .
We need concrete , ready - to - go plans . "
Melissa Dunston , 30 , a teacher 's assistant with a " Hillary " sticker on her blouse , has brought her two daughters and a niece to hear Clinton speak .
" They need to see the next president , " she says .
Despite Obama 's lead in North Carolina , Clinton has a better shot in this state than she did in South Carolina , where Obama swamped her by 2 - 1 in the Jan. 26 primary .
In South Carolina , African - Americans made up 55 % of the Democratic primary electorate , according to surveys of voters as they left polling places , and eight of 10 supported Obama .
Clinton and former North Carolina senator John Edwards split the white vote .
Now Edwards is out of the race and the proportion of black voters in North Carolina is lower — 38 % of registered Democrats , according to the State Board of Elections .
Public Policy Polling and other survey firms predict that African - American turnout will surge in North Carolina , as it has elsewhere , which means Clinton likely will need the support of as many as three in four white voters to win .
The racial divide is apparent at campaign events .
Clinton 's rally in Fayetteville included black supporters but was predominantly white .
Obama 's rally in Greensboro included white supporters but was predominantly black .
Steady as he goes Obama 's path to the nomination is an easier one : Stay the course .
Avoiding a blowout in Pennsylvania — or better — then winning in North Carolina would maintain his lead in the overall popular vote as well as his edge in pledged delegates .
That would minimize any opening for Clinton to persuade superdelegates , who will hold the balance of power at the convention , to endorse her .
" When we started off , nobody thought we could win — let 's face it , " Obama says in Greensboro , responding to a question shouted from the balcony .
" First of all , you 've got a black guy named Barack Obama — you 're starting in a hole , " he says .
" Then , I 'm 46 years old , and I 've got these big ears , so they make me look younger . "
He 's used the line before , but it's new to this audience , which laughs appreciatively .
A desire for change has propelled his presidential bid , he says .
" Keep in mind what has been so powerful and positive about this campaign is that the grass roots has stood up and said , ' We 're going to give Barack a chance . ' " Mary Winstead , 54 , the director of a trade school that retrains the unemployed , applauds from a seat near the back of the auditorium .
" I think Hillary Clinton is a very nice person , but I do think we need a change , and Barack will be the man for the job , " she says .
She is confident that at the end of the day Democrats will " come together " behind one contender or the other , and she does n't fault Clinton for rejecting calls for her to withdraw from the race — yet .
" But if she does n't do well in North Carolina , " Winstead says of Clinton , " I think she should start considering that . "

A spate of pavement improvements in this part of The Greatest Borough encompasses the spur of Lower Clapton Road that loops around the pond .
It looks on course to enhance the pedestrian experience all the way round to where it meets the main road again , opposite Palm 2 .
See above the bit that is completed - basically a bicycle - parking apron , I suppose .
See below for a long shot of the men from Volker Highways getting stuck into the next phase .
These highway works are n't only about walking and cycling , though .
They are also about traffic - calming .
The tighter bends and reduced road space should have the effect of slowing motorised vehicles down , which will be no bad thing given that crossing over to Palm 2 can be a bit of challenge at that rather complicated junction .
I 'm reliably informed - by a Hackney councillor , since you ask - that once Moore House is finished , a new , improved stretch of pavement will appear there too .
Happy footsteps .

After a long , painful , nearly anonymous ride on the wrists of a select few uber - geeks , Microsoft 's finally throwing in the towel on one of its longstanding pet projects : the SPOT watch .
Those who 've followed the technology recently ( you know who you are ) already know that the writing 's been on the wall for some time ; the applications and content available to the watches have n't been updated in ages , and indeed , the entire line of Abacus Smart Watch 2006 models -- the only type being recently offered -- has been discontinued and out of stock for a few months .
For what it 's worth , MSN Direct 's program manager is quick to note that the underlying technology most certainly is n't going away ; quite the contrary , in fact , with compatible Garmin and Windows Mobile products still going strong .
Though your impetus may have been misguided and your fate sealed from the moment you hit the market , dearest wristwatches , your overwhelming nerdiness will be sorely missed .
Oh , and for those of you who plan on sporting your piece of Microsoft history to the very bitter end , take some comfort in knowing that existing content types will continue to be delivered , at least .
What is a recommendation letter ?
A letter of recommendation is an admission document in which the writer assesses the qualifications , attainments , and peculiar talents of the person who is being recommended .
As mentioned above , they are usually required for higher education or employment .
Employers can make decisions judging by this document because it is another person ’s objective opinion .
Why it ’s important to write a good letter of recommendation ?
Different people from your previous work or school can prepare a recommendation letter .
Therefore , you have to reasonably decide on the person for writing a letter of recommendation .
Opting for the person who can assist you can be a bit complicated .
Why ?
Simply because not everyone has exceptional writing aptitude .
You can be really proficient at your job or studies , and maybe everyone loved you in your school or at the company that you worked at , but the person who will be composing this letter for you should take it thoughtfully .
It is no good writing such a document in five minutes of free time while eating a sandwich .
So , you need to make sure that you rely on a conscientious and deliberate professional .
We exist to provide people with high - quality documents , and we treat every task with great care !

OVER the past few years the questions have been asked ever more forcefully whether global climate changes occur in natural cycles or not , to what degree we humans contribute to them , what threats stem from them and what can be done to prevent them .
Scientific studies demonstrate that any changes in temperature and energy cycles on a planetary scale could mean danger for all people on all continents .
It is also obvious from published research that human activity is a cause of change ; we just do n’t know how big its contribution is .
Is it necessary to know that to the last percentage point , though ?
By waiting for incontrovertible precision , are n’t we simply wasting time when we could be taking measures that are relatively painless compared to those we would have to adopt after further delays ?
Maybe we should start considering our sojourn on earth as a loan .
There can be no doubt that for the past hundred years at least , Europe and the United States have been running up a debt , and now other parts of the world are following their example .
Nature is issuing warnings that we must not only stop the debt from growing but start to pay it back .
There is little point in asking whether we have borrowed too much or what would happen if we postponed the repayments .
Anyone with a mortgage or a bank loan can easily imagine the answer .
The effects of possible climate changes are hard to estimate .
Our planet has never been in a state of balance from which it could deviate through human or other influence and then , in time , return to its original state .
The climate is not like a pendulum that will return to its original position after a certain period .
It has evolved turbulently over billions of years into a gigantic complex of networks , and of networks within networks , where everything is interlinked in diverse ways .

If you 've seen a particularly eye - popping , out - of - this - world night photograph of a city skyline , or a particularly apocalyptic cloudscape with cartoonish color saturation making the rounds on blogs lately , there 's a good chance it was made using high - dynamic - range imaging , or HDR software .
And while these images may look like the work of a pro photographer , or at least a seasoned digital - imaging or special - effects expert , the tools to easily make your own amazing HDR images are widely ( and in some cases freely ) available .
If you 've seen a particularly eye - popping , out - of - this - world night photograph of a city skyline , or a particularly apocalyptic cloudscape with cartoonish color saturation making the rounds on blogs lately , there 's a good chance it was made using high - dynamic - range imaging , or HDR software .
And while these images may look like the work of a pro photographer , or at least a seasoned digital - imaging or special - effects expert , the tools to easily make your own amazing HDR images are widely ( and in some cases freely ) available .
So what exactly comprises an HDR image ?
Basically , more information per pixel .
When you take a photo with your digital camera , the colors are converted to accommodate the limited palette of your display or a piece of photo paper .
The human eye , however , is capable of taking in far more color and light information at any given time .
This is why it 's necessary to take a photo with the correct exposure settings — what your eye sees as a uniform scene with a balanced brightness and color range needs to be regulated to fit within the more limited range of your camera 's sensor , or else the image will appear under - or overexposed ( too dark or too light ) .
HDR provides a way to combine a range of exposures of the same scene into one image , adding significantly to the amount of data held per pixel ( most digital images hold 8 bits of color information per pixel ; an HDR image has 32 ) .
The result is an image with more " dynamic range " — in other words , the brights are brighter , the darks darker , and there 's much more variance in between .
For a step - by - step guide to creating your own HDR images , continue reading below :
To get started , you 'll need to shoot the same scene with a range of different exposures [ above , my subject is the Williamsburg Bridge in New York City ] .
Scenes with uneven lighting really bring out the best of HDR ( in my case , the bright lights of the bridges in the distance and the dark shadows of the cargo crane at left and the sky above ) .
You can use the bracketing function of your digital camera ( better point - and - shoots and almost all digital SLRs have it ) to fire off three frames every time you squeeze the button — one with the correct exposure , one overexposed , and one underexposed .
You want the difference to be as dramatic as possible , so if the three images look too similar , you can use the manual - exposure setting of your camera to take a series of exposures with a tripod ( like I did here ) .
The more exposures the better .
And if your camera can shoot RAW images ( an unprocessed format like a “ digital negative ” with greater flexibility ) , use that , as your images will have more detail .
Now , the magic .
To combine them , you 'll need software capable of doing the job .
If you 're using Photoshop CS2 , you 're in luck — HDR capabilities are built in .
If not , there are alternatives .
A cross-platform application called Photomatix Pro is a specialized HDR processor that costs $ 100 ( $ 83 if you use the coupon code found here ; there 's a free bare - bones version just for Windows that I have n’t tested ) and does an amazing job ; since it only does one thing , it does it very well , offering specialized controls and batch - processing options that Photoshop lacks .
There is also a rapidly improving , free , open - source alternative called qtpfsgui ( great name , right ? ) — it does n't have as many options yet for tweaking your HDR output , but you can't beat the price , and it 's great to get started with .
Venerable open - source Photoshop - alternative the GIMP has yet to incorporate HDR support .
Using whatever software you settle on , you 'll need to combine your batch of variable exposures into a master HDR image .
If you used a wobbly tripod ( or worse , handheld your shots ) , you can have the software attempt to align them automatically — if they 're not too far off , this usually works fairly well .
The resulting image might take a while to generate and look a little weird when it does ; this is because your screen is n't capable of displaying HDR images .
To get the eye - popping HDR color effect , you 'll need to downsample the image back to 8 or 16 bits per pixel , but in a way that blends the high dynamic range of your HDR composite image into one that still retains the increased detail and color range of HDR but fits comfortably in the viewable range of your monitor or paper .
This process is called tone mapping .
Tone mapping is where the serious bit - crunching comes in , and each of the software tools detailed here has a different way of doing it .
Photomatix provides a fairly straightforward dialogue of sliders that regulate the brightness , white and black points , and numerous other aspects of the resulting image — you can get some wild effects just by tweaking them and seeing what happens in the live preview .
Photoshop gives you four tone - mapping choices .
But the hands - down best is " Local Adaptation , " which gives you control of the image via the " curves " control .
I recently learned how to use curves , which are the basis of almost all digital - image processing , and I 'm still not good enough to really explain them .
I learned from here , though , and if you use Photoshop , your life will be better for learning as well .
Anyway , this gives you great control of the image 's color and exposure , and again , simply playing around and observing the live preview can yield some fun results .
Qtpfsgui has all kinds of crazy - sounding tone - mapping functions to choose from ( Drago logarithmic mapping !
Durand fast bilateral filtering ! ) ; since no one but the mathematicians who invented them have any idea what they mean , trial - and - error is again your friend .
After you 've found some settings that work ( it 's amazing the range of output you can get ) , voila , you 've got your first HDR image .
As you can see below , the difference between the correctly exposed normal image and the tone - mapped HDR output is marked : richer darks in the water , less blown - out whites in the lights , and more vibrant colors .
So now what ?
As you might expect , there are countless groups on Flickr dedicated to HDR where you can show off your work , seek feedback , and learn more in the discussion forums .
My favorite is the largest ( simply called HDR ) , but there are many others dedicated to users of specific software , people who go for a more realistic look with their HDR imagery , and so on .
As you 'll soon see , some people really love HDR and some people really hate it , but as with most things dealing with the visual arts , a lot of it comes down to personal aesthetic .
No matter what your feelings on the HDR look , though , it 's still pretty amazing to see how the process works , and more amazing still that anyone with a camera and a computer can try it out for themselves .
Viva la digital revolution !

John McCain Skipped Every Crucial Vote in 2007 , Ranked Dead Last Among all 535 Members of Congress
( click image to see McCain 's dismal 2007 record )
The Daily Green :
McCain skipped every one of the 15 votes that the League of Conservation Voters deemed critical measures for the environment , including votes where the Arizona Senator 's yea would have meant passage by a single - vote margin .
McCain has won support from many environmentalists ... but his absenteeism on important votes this session calls into question his reputation as a maverick who might buck the party line on some energy and environmental issues .
" Out of 535 Members of Congress , John McCain is the only one who chose to miss every single key environmental vote scored by the League of Conservation Voters last year .
When it came time to stand up and vote for the environment , John McCain was nowhere to be found , " said Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club .
" Every other Member who received a zero from LCV last year at least had the temerity to show up and vote against the environment and clean energy time after time .
And unlike John McCain , I doubt any of them would claim to be environmental leaders or champions on global warming . "
Although McCain likes to play up his environmental record in a positive light , and the media often plays along , the facts do n't always back it up , and since he began his run for the White House he has ignored environmental issues entirely .
" McCain ’s LCV score exposes the real record behind the rhetoric : a lifetime pattern of voting with polluters and special interests instead of consumers and the planet when it comes time to stand up and be counted .
Or perhaps worse yet : a consistent refusal to stand up and be counted at all . "
The Sierra Club is sponsoring a letter to the editor campaign to help point out the hypocrisy .

In the last few weeks , London Times has run a series of articles about the so - called ‘ Sibel Edmonds case ’ : ( For sale : West ’s deadly nuclear secrets , ’ FBI denies file exposing nuclear secrets theft ‘ and ‘ Tip - off thwarted nuclear spy ring probe ‘ )
Former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds stumbled into a world of espionage , nuclear black market , narcotics trafficking , money laundering , and corruption at the highest levels of the US government .
I interviewed Sibel on Sunday regarding the current investigation and reporting by the Times , the failures of the US media , and last week ’s decision by the Bush administration to legalize the sale of nuclear technology to Turkey , in an apparent effort to exonerate prior criminal activity by officials in his administration .
Sibel also has some urgent ‘ action items ’ so that we can stop these dangerous nuclear proliferation activities .
I urge you to act on her suggestions .
* * * * * * * * * * * * *
Luke Ryland :
What do you have to say about the recent work by the Insight journalists — Chris Gourlay , Jonathan Calvert , Joe Lauria — at the London Times ?
Sibel Edmonds :
They ’ve done good , solid reporting so far by doing what reporters are supposed to .
They have been chasing sources and getting their hands on documents .
It ’s pretty simple .
As you know , this story has been available to any journalist for six years now .
There ’s been a lot of speculation in the last few weeks that American reporters have n’t touched this story because they are “ corporate owned ” but it is wrong to exonerate these reporters so quickly .
Many of them are too close to their official sources , and some are simply lazy .
This Times team chases sources , and if they ca n’t reach them one way , they ’ll try and try again , or they ’ll seek out alternate sources , or find other ways to ensure that they get the story .
When I hear from US reporters , they say “ Sibel , give us all the documents we ’ll need , and you line up all the sources for us , and then maybe we ’ll do a story ” and if one source does n’t return their phone call , they simply give up .
That ’s not journalism !
Luke Ryland :
Why has the US failed on this story so dramatically for six years ?
Sibel Edmonds :
It ’s a combination of things , obviously .
You need to consider that the entire US press corps has failed on this story ; not only the regular print and TV media , but the alternative media has failed on this too .
Part of the reason is that journalists are simply too close to their official sources .
Those sources might tell the journalist that there ’s nothing to the story , and so the journalist gives up on it , or the official sources might ‘ request ’ that the journalist stay away from the story , and the journalist is then concerned about losing access to the source in the future .
Another reason is the partisanship .
With the foreign press , there is no partisanship , and that ’s one reason why they have been more effective at covering this case , and I ’m not just talking about the recent Times articles here .
With the US media , it appears as though if there is no clear partisan angle , then there ’s no story .
As you know , this case is spread over two administrations , and that appears to make it difficult for the reporters to cover the story .
Even within one news organization you might have one journalist who wants to use the story to indict Clinton , and another who wants to use the story to bash Bush , and in the end neither of them write about the story because it does n’t fit their partisanship , their ‘ narrative ’ , so they just drop it altogether .
I had such high hopes for the alternative press , and they do a lot of good work , but partisanship repeatedly gets in the way there too , on both sides .
The US media also suffers from a pack mentality .
I was told by one executive that they were n’t doing the story because it was ‘ old news ’ because 60 Minutes did a single segment in October 2002 , even though they only covered a tiny part of the case .
This executive literally told me that he ’d only cover the story if it was ‘ hot and sexy . ’
I often think that I ’d need to be able to hire Britney Spears to be a spokesperson — and this is not just for my case , but for any of the many other solid , important cases at the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition .
Apparently this is what it would take to get any coverage .
Of course , given the pack mentality , if any of these stories does become ‘ hot and sexy ’ then all the journalists focus on the same issues and there ’s no differentiation in their reporting .
The other major problem in the US is the focus on symptoms , rather than root causes .
My case is a good example , but there are lots of others too .
Look at the early reporting on my case in 2002 , the Washington Post broke the story in July 2002 about the espionage in the translation bureau and then they dropped the story after two weeks .
They stopped reporting on it when more important information came out and the State Secrets Privilege was invoked .
To this day not a single US reporter has asked , ‘ Why was the State Secrets Privilege been invoked here ?
What is going on ? ’
Just this week I was approached by a major US outlet who wanted to do a story on Kevin Taskesen !
[ Ed note : Taskesen was an incompetent FBI translator who got his job because his wife worked in the administrative office ]
This is absolutely the most trivial element of the case , and it has already been reported at length .
I told them that they could learn everything they needed to know by watching 60 Minutes , 2002 .
Again , the US media needs to start looking at the root causes of these problems , not the symptoms .
Luke Ryland :
Will the US media start reporting on this now that it is ‘ hot and sexy ’ again ?
Sibel Edmonds :
It ’s hard to know .
After being told for years that they wo n’t cover it because it is ‘ old news , ’ now there are certain officials in the agencies quietly telling journalists to stay away from the story because I came across a highly sensitive covert national security operation .
Also , Turkey ’s army of lobbyists in DC are very effective .
The US press tends to stay away from any stories critical of Turkey , I would say even more than Israel .
There ’s also the possible problem of ‘ eating crow ’ but I hope this is n’t an issue , this story is way too important for any of that .
The information that has been published in the Times recently could have easily come out four years ago in the US press .
We now need everyone to focus on the important issues .
I have one message for the US media :
If they think this is over , it ’s not over .
Much more will come out .
They wo n’t be able to ignore it any longer , and so I hope they get over any reluctance they might have .
Look at the positive press that the Times series has received since their first article ran .
Do you think their editors have n’t noticed ?
The Times is adding more and more resources to the story , more journalists , bigger budgets , and more importantly , they are getting more and more sources coming forward to shed light on these illegal activities .
As I have said from the beginning , this story is not about me , there are many sources who have been waiting for the right time to come forward , I ’ve probably never even heard of most of them , and now they are coming forward .
This will play out like Watergate played out , with the drip , drip , drip .
So I say to everyone ‘ Buckle up , there ’s much more coming . ’
So , hopefully American reporters will start to cover the story .
I ’m not particularly confident , but to a certain degree it does n’t matter that much because the internet and the blogs can spread the reporting from the UK as soon as it hits the wires .
Luke Ryland :
Two weeks after the first article in the Times about the involvement of high - level US officials being involved with Turkish and Israeli interests in supplying the nuclear black market , President Bush quietly announced that the US will start supplying nuclear technology to Turkey .
Do you think that is a coincidence ?
Sibel Edmonds :
The timing is certainly very , very suspicious .
The proposals that are being floated are very suspicious too .
There are reports that Turkey will build an enrichment facility , and that Turkey will become the key supplier of nuclear fuel to other Muslim countries who want nuclear power plants .
None of this makes any sense .
And again , the US media is nowhere to be seen on this issue .
Where are the journalists ?
Do you remember the noise made a couple of years ago when the US announced that it would supply India with nuclear technology ?
So far , nearly a week after the announcement and not a single major US media outlet has even reported on the deal !
Think of the hypocrisy , with all the saber - rattling at Iran over enrichment .
If it ’s such a good idea to sell nuclear technology to Turkey , why is n’t the White House out there selling the idea ?
Where are the arguments in the press saying that this will be good for regional stability , or that it will help reduce demand for oil , or even that it is simply good business because US firms will be able to sell their hardware and knowledge ?
There ’s nothing !
Silence .
What does that tell you ?
Luke Ryland :
What needs to be done ?
Sibel Edmonds :
The way they ’ve structured this deal is that Congress has 90 days from the announcement , now 84 days , to block the ‘ agreement ’ otherwise it basically becomes law .
The first thing that we need to do is to make sure that this does n’t ‘ automatically ’ become law .
We need the journalists , the experts , and the bloggers to raise hell over this issue , and we need to make sure that Congress investigates this properly before rubber - stamping it .
The clock is ticking and we need to act now .
As you know , and this was even published in the White House press release on this issue , certain “ Turkish private entities ’ have been involved ‘ in certain activities directly relating to nuclear proliferation . ”
This includes supplying the A.Q. Khan network — which built Pakistan ’s nuclear bomb , and also supplied North Korea , Iran and other countries — but as the recent Times stories indicate , so much more as well .
The White House press release states that all these issues have been resolved ; that the Turkish government has addressed these issues , that the US government has evaluated these actions and that the US government is satisfied , and that all of this is secret , classified !
Given the track record of this administration in abusing classification and distorting intelligence , why on earth would we trust them with this ?
What is in the report ?
Is it truthful ?
Why is it classified ?
We saw these exact same people do the same thing in the late ’ 80s when they enabled Pakistan to get nuclear weapons .
Richard Barlow did his best to stop them then , but if Congress does n’t hold hearings this time around the same thing will happen again .
We should have stopped Pakistan then , but unless this ‘ classified ’ report is made public and the contents publicly debated , then the Barlow of today wo n’t even get the chance to debunk whatever is in that ‘ classified ’ report .
What conceivable logic is there in classifying the details of how Turkey has cleaned up its act regarding nuclear proliferation ?
If they have , they should be proud of it !
There are many great anti-proliferation organizations out there , we need to rally all of them , and all of the ‘ pro- transparency ’ organizations , to this cause .
We need journalists to contact these experts for their opinion and expertise , and we need these experts to contact journalists to ensure that the story , and the issues , is covered , and covered thoroughly .
We also need to recruit bloggers and alternative media to keep the pressure on .
Perhaps a ‘ countdown clock ’ as we count down the 90 days might help .
Luke Ryland :
What are the next steps in the process ?
Sibel Edmonds : I ’m not exactly sure of the process at the moment , but it has been reported that this ‘ automatically ’ becomes law after the 90 days , somehow , unless Congress blocks or amends the legislation .
Apparently the approval process somehow includes convincing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee not to object , so those committees appear to be our first firewall .
( Ed note : Senate Foreign Relations Committee includes Joe Biden ( Chair ) , Chris Dodd , John Kerry , Russ Feingold , Barbara Boxer , Barack Obama and Jim Webb for the Democrats , and Richard Lugar , Chuck Hagel and George Voinovich for the minority .
Hopefully one of them will stand up on this important issue .
The House side looks more difficult , the Chairman is Tom Lantos who was listed in Sibel ’s Rogue ’s Gallery , which apparently identifies 18 of the guilty parties in her case , so that might be a problem .
Ron Paul is also on that committee , he might be a prime target for this campaign . )
Luke Ryland :
Is there anything else we can do ?
Sibel Edmonds :
There is one other hope .
As last week ’s White House press release states , Bill Clinton tried to pass this legislation in 2000 but “ immediately after ” Clinton tried to send it to Congress it was blocked because some people apparently highlighted Turkish involvement in the nuclear black market and , who knows , maybe threatened to blow the whistle .
Those same individuals , and others like them , can stop this again , and they should do everything they can to make sure that this does n’t happen .
They should try to do it internally , and if they ca n’t do it internally , then they need reach out to journalists , either on or off the record .
Hopefully some honest , dedicated people will try to block it again , but we ca n’t rely on that .
We need to pressure congress to ensure that this does n’t go through .
Time is running out , the countdown clock is ticking down , and we need to stop this now .
We need the help of journalists , congress , nuclear proliferation experts , bloggers and those active citizens in the blogosphere and elsewhere .
* * * * * * * * * * *
Many thanks to Sibel , as always .
Please do what you can to help block this proposed legislation .
If you can create a ‘ countdown clock ’ please contact me , and we ’ll offer it so that everyone can place it on their blogs and use it in their sigs etc .

Regarding alternative media , Sibel is particularly grateful to American Conservative and Antiwar.com for their objectivity and non-partisanship in covering this case .

Scofield won the Oscar for best actor in 1967 for A Man for All Seasons , and was also nominated in 1995 for best supporting actor for Quiz Show .
" He was a great friend and a great man , " actress Dame Judi Dench said .
The actor died peacefully on Wednesday in a hospital near his Sussex home , his agent Rosalind Chatto said .
" He had leukaemia and had not been well for some time , " she added .
He had a kind of extraordinary physical warmth , almost literally like being near a fire
Simon Callow
In quotes : Tributes to Paul Scofield
The British - born actor started his stage career in 1940 .
In 2004 , Scofield 's portrayal of King Lear in 1962 was voted the greatest performance in a Shakespeare play by a panel of Royal Shakespeare Company actors , including Sir Ian McKellen , Ian Richardson and Sir Antony Sher .
" Of the 10 greatest moments in the theatre , eight are Scofield's , " the actor Richard Burton once said .
Simon Callow , who starred opposite Scofield in the play Amadeus in 1979 , paid tribute to " one of the greatest actors in the world " .
" He had a kind of extraordinary physical warmth , almost literally like being near a fire , in a way that I have almost never experienced with another actor .
It was a sort of blaze , " he told BBC Radio 4's The World At One .
No actor summoned with such authority the mysterious depths of human experience
Nicholas Hytner
National Theatre
" He had a charisma , a hypnotism , a kind of spell that he cast on an audience , which was an extraordinary thing to negotiate as a young actor .
" He was an absolutely towering actor . "
National
Theatre artistic director Nicholas Hytner , who directed Scofield in his 1996 film adaptation of The Crucible , said : " No actor summoned with such authority the mysterious depths of human experience .
" He was a man of wit , charm and grace ; and quite extraordinarily modest . "
The Royal Shakespeare Company 's chief associate director Gregory Doran said : " Scofield was simply one of the greats , creating landmark performances of all the great Shakespeare roles at Stratford , from Hamlet to Macbeth to Lear . "
Scofield won his Oscar in 1967 for playing Sir Thomas More in the film of the life of the 16th Century Lord Chancellor .
He was also nominated for five Baftas , winning three times , including one for A Man for All Seasons .
Scofield played Sir Thomas More in A Man for All Seasons
His other Bafta wins came for his film debut in That Lady in 1956 and for The Crucible , which co-starred Daniel Day - Lewis and Winona Ryder , 40 years later .
Scofield used his Shakespearean skills on screen as King Lear in the 1972 film and alongside Dame Judi in Kenneth Branagh 's Henry V in 1989 .
His TV work included the BBC's £ 4 m adaptation of Dickens ' Martin Chuzzlewit in 1994 and he was also a familiar voice in radio dramas .
HAVE YOUR SAY Paul Scofield was a towering genius of a performer who had everything a theatrical elder statesman should have Paddy , Aberystwyth
Scofield was appointed a CBE in 1956 but he was thought to have rejected attempts to give him a knighthood .
" If you want a title , what 's wrong with Mr ? " he once said .
" If you have always been that , then why lose your title ?
But it 's not political .
I have a CBE , which I accepted very gratefully . "
But in the New Year 's Honours for 2001 , he was made a Companion of Honour .
People are made a Companion of Honour for work of national importance and there are only 65 members at any one time .
Scofield leaves his widow , the actress Joy Parker , a son and a daughter .
That is not much of a surprise to Michael Harrison , the founder and publisher of Talkers .
“ Michael Savage is one of the few high - profile conservative hosts who is politically independent and does not hesitate to criticize the superstars of the Republican movement , ” he said .
“ As a result he is not the most popular host among his conservative peers . ”
Mr. Savage agreed last week to allow a reporter to sit in on his program , but only on the condition that the reporter not reveal the location of the waterside house where he was broadcasting that day , or of two other homes where he has studios and which he treats as virtual safe houses .
Mr. Savage , who is licensed to carry a pistol and does so , said the secrecy was warranted by his fears for his life , based on the sheaf of death threats he says he has received over the years .
Mr. Savage can be surprisingly unintimidating in person , standing 5 - foot - 7 and looking , on this day , like he had sprung from an L. L. Bean catalog in a bright orange corduroy shirt , black fleece vest and tan chinos , with a miniature poodle at his feet .
He can also project charm , insisting that a visitor just off a cross-country flight pause to have a turkey sandwich with potato salad .
“ Drew , did you get pastry ? ” he later asked his assistant , Drew Bader , sounding more like a grandmother than a firebrand .
“ Yes , ” Mr. Bader assured him wearily , “ I got a hamantaschen and a piece of kugel . ”
At one point Mr. Savage  who was born Michael Weiner , and who still is , legally , Michael Weiner  led a visitor to a glass case that included a photo of him as a boy wearing a tallit , or Jewish prayer shawl .
Asked if it was his bar mitzvah photo , he said it was , adding , “ Tell that to my Muslim friends . ”
( Mr. Savage said later that when he became a talk show host 14 years ago , he took a “ nom de voix , ” as he referred to his pseudonym , to blunt any potshots at him as “ a Jew from the Bronx , ” which he happens to be . )
THE unemployment rate is low .
The jobless rate is high .
Those two seemingly contradictory statements are especially true for American men in what should be the prime of their working lives .
Those facts may help to explain the stark pessimism of Americans about the economy , and shed some light on the rise of illegal immigration as a political issue .
Men in the prime of their working lives are now less likely to have jobs than they were during all but one recession of the last 60 years .
Most of them do not qualify as unemployed , but they are nonetheless without jobs .
The unemployment rate paints a less gloomy picture .
Among men ages 25 to 54  a range that starts after most people finish their education and ends well before most people retire  the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent .
That is not especially low , but it is well below the peak rate in all but one post - World War II recession .
Only people without jobs who are actively looking for work qualify as unemployed in the computation of that rate .
It does not count people who are not looking for work , whether or not they would like to have a job .
On April 1 , I announced the Second Annual Movie - Plot Threat Contest :
Your entry will be judged on the common item that the TSA has no choice but to ban , as well as the cleverness of the plot .
It has to be realistic ; no science fiction , please .
And the write - up is critical ; last year the best entries were the most entertaining to read .
Make the TSA ban wristwatches .
Or laptop computers .
Or polyester .
Or zippers over three inches long .
You get the idea .
Your goal : invent a terrorist plot to hijack or blow up an airplane with a commonly carried item as a key component .
The component should be so critical to the plot that the TSA will have no choice but to ban the item once the plot is uncovered .
I want to see a plot horrific and ridiculous , but just plausible enough to take seriously .
On June 5 , I posted three semi-finalists out of the 334 comments :
Well , we have a winner .
I ca n’t divulge the exact formula — because you ’ll all hack the system next year — but it was a combination of my opinion , popular acclaim in blog comments , and the opinion of Tom Grant ( the previous year ’s winner ) .
I present to you : Butterflies and Beverages , posted by Ron :
It must have been a pretty meadow , Wilkes thought , just a day before .
He tried to picture how it looked then : without the long , wide wound in the earth , without the charred and broken fuselage of the jet that gouged it out , before the rolling ground was strewn with papers and cushions and random bits of plastic and fabric and all the things inside the plane that lay like the confetti from a brief , fiery parade .
Yes , a nice little spot , just far enough from the airport ’s runways to be not too noisy , but close enough to watch the planes going in and out , fortunately just a bit too close to have been developed .
When the plane rolled over and angled downward , not even a mile past the end of the runway , at least the only people at risk were the ones on the plane .
For them , it was mercifully quick , the impact breaking their necks before the breaking wing tanks ignited in sheets of flame , the charred bodies still in their seats .
He spotted the NTSB guy , standing by the forward half of the fuselage , easy to spot among the FAA and local airport people — they were always the only suits in the crowd .
Heading over , Wilkes saw this one was n’t going to be too hard : when planes came down intact like this , breaking in to just a few pieces on impact , the cause was always easier to find .
This one looked to be no exception .
He muttered to the suit , “ Wilkes , ” gesturing at the badge clipped to his shirt .
No need to get too friendly , they ’d file separate reports anyway .
As long as they were remotely on the same page , there was n’t much need to actually talk to the guy .
“ What ’s this little gem ? ” he wondered aloud , looking at the hole in the side of the downed jet .
“ Explosion , ” drawled the NTSB guy ; he had that Chuck Yeager slow - play sound , Wilkes thought , like someone who could sound calm describing Armageddon .
“ Looks like it was from the inside , something just big enough to rip a few square feet out of the side .
Enough to throw it on its side ”
“ And if the plane is low enough , still taking off , with the engines near full thrust , it rolls over and down too fast … ” he trailed off , picturing the result .
“ Yep , all in a couple of seconds .
Too quick for the flight crew to have time to get it back . ”
The NTSB guy shook his head , the id clipped to his suit jacket swaying back and forth with the motion .
“ Always the best time if you ’re going to take a bird down : takeoff or landing , guess whoever did this one wanted to get it over with sooner rather than later . ”
He snorted in derision , “ Somebody snuck in an explosive , must have been a screener havin ’ an off day . ”
“ Maybe , ” said Wilkes , not ready to write it off as just a screener ’s error .
The NTSB guys were always quick to find a bad decision , one human error , and explain the whole thing away .
But Wilkes ’ job was to find the flaws in the systems , the procedures , the way to come up with prophylactic precautions .
Maybe there was nothing more than a screener who did n’t spot a grenade or a stick of dynamite , something so obvious that there was nothing to do but chalk up a hundred and eighty three dead lives to one madman and one very bad TSA employee .
But maybe not .
That ’s when Wilkes spotted the first two of the butterflies .
Bright yellow against the charred black of the burned wreckage , they seemed like the most incongruous things — and as he thought this , another appeared .
As they took photos and made measurements , more showed up — by ones and twos , a few flying away , but gradually building up to dozens over the course of the morning .
Odd , the NTSB rep agreed , but nothing that tells us anything about the terrorist who brought down that plane .
Wilkes was n’t so sure .
Nature was handing out a big fat clue here , he was sure of that .
What he was n’t sure of was what in the hell it could possibly mean .
He leaned in close with the camera on his phone , getting some good close images of the colorful insects , emailing back to the office with a request to reach out to an expert .
He needed a phone consult , someone who knew the behavior of this particular butterfly , someone who could put him on the right track .
Within minutes , his phone was buzzing , with a conference call already set up with a professor of entymology , and even better one local to the area ; a local might know this bug better than an academic from a more prestigious , but distant university .
He was half - listening during the introductions , Wilkes was n’t interested in this guy ’s particulars , the regional team would have that all available if he needed it later .
He just wanted answers .
“ Pieridae , ” the professor offered , “ and all males , I ’d bet . ”
“ Okay , ” Wilkes answered , wondering if he this really would tell him anything .
“ Why are they all over my bomb hole ? ”
“ I ca n’t be sure , but it must be something attracting them .
These are commonly called ‘ sulfur butterflies ’ , could there be sulfur on your wreckage ? ”
Yeah , Wilkes thought , this is looking like a wild goose chase .
“ No sulfur , we already did a quick chem test for it .
Anything else these little fellas like ? ”
“ Sure , but not something you ’d be likely to find in a bomb — just sodium .
They package it up with their sperm and deliver it to the female as an extra little bonus — sort of the flowers and candy of the butterfly world . ”
“ Okay , that ’s…wow , the things I learn in this job .
Sorry to bother you , sir , I guess it ’s just … yeah , thanks . ”
Butterfly sperm — now this might set a new record for useless trivia learned in a crash investigation .
Unbelievable .
The NTSB guy wandered over , seeing Wilkes was off the phone .
“ Get anything from your expert ? ” he queried , trying and failing to suppress a grin .
Wilkes suspected there would soon be a story going around the NTSB office about the FAA “ butterfly guy ” ; ah well , better to be infamous than anonymous .
“ Nah , not much .
The little guys like sulfur , ” Wilkes offered , seeing his counterpart give a cynical chuckle at that , “ and sodium .
Unless there was a whole lot of salt packed around the perp ’s explosive , our little yellow friends are just a mystery . ”
The NTSB rep got a funny look on his face , a faraway look .
“ Sodium .
An explosive that leaves behind sodium .
Well , that could be … ”
They looked at each other , both heading to the same conclusion , both reluctant to get there .
Wilkes said it first : “ Sodium metal .
Cheap , easy to get , it would have to be : sodium metal . ”
“ And easy , ” the NTSB rep drawled , “ to sneak on the plane .
The stuff is soft , but you could fashion it in to any simple things : eyeglass frames , belt buckles , buttons , simple things the screeners would never be lookin’ at . ”
“ Would n’t take much , ” Wilkes offered , an old college chemistry - class prank coming to mind .
“ An couple of ounces , that would be enough to blow out the side of a plane , enough for what we ’re seeing here . ”
“ With the easiest trigger in the world , ” the NTSB man added , putting words to the picture forming in Wilkes mind .
A cup of water would be enough , just drop the sodium metal in to it and the chemical reaction would quickly release hydrogen gas , with enough heat generated as a byproduct of the reaction to ignite the gas .
In just a second or two , you ’d have an explosion strong enough to knock the side out of a plane .
“ Sounds like a problem for you FAA boys , ” his counterpart teased .
“ What ya gonna do , ban passengers from carrying more than a few grams of anything made of metal ? ”
“ No , ” Wilkes shot back , “ we ca n’t ban everything that could be made of sodium metal .
Or all the other water - reactives , ” he mused aloud , thinking of all the carbides , anhydrides , and alkali metals that would cover .
“ Too many ways to hide them , too many types to test for them all .
No , it is n’t the metals we ’ll have to ban . ”
“ Naw , you do n’t mean , ” the NTSB man stared in disbelief , his eyes growing wide .
“ You could n’t , I mean , it ’s the only other way but it ’s ridiculous . ”
“ No , it ’s not so ridiculous , it ’s really the only way .
We ’re going to have to ban water , and anything containing a significant amount of water , from all passenger flights .
It ’s the only way , otherwise we could have planes dropping out of the sky every time someone is served a beverage . ”

Production forecasts for Russia ( Crude oil + condensate ) .
Since 2005 , the Russian oil industry has been in constant turmoil .
Production growth has also slow down significantly maybe as a result .
The Exxon Sakhalin - I project has now reached its peak and production is experiencing a steep decline since .
On the upside , many projects are expected to come online and the IEA forecasts that oil production in Russia will increase by 90,000 bbl/d in 2008 and 300,000 bbl/d in 2009 , following growth of 200,000 bbl/d in 2007 .
The dramatic drop down in production growth observed by Stuart is still going on and is now close to 0 ( i.e. flat production ) .
Several trend lines can be drawn , in particular the trend for 2007 in purple would imply an immediate decline in 2008 .
However , several decline acceleration periods have occurred in the past ( similar lines could have been drawn in 2001 and 2004 ) so it is unlikely that the rapid decline observed in 2007 will continue in 2008 .
From the above linear trends , we can derive different oil production scenarios as shown on Figure 3 where peak production is seen between 2010 and 2015 with a peak production between 9.5 and 10 mbpd .
In terms of corresponding oil reserves , these scenarios are consistent with published reserve numbers .
Using various reserve estimates gathered by Dave Cohen , I derived an empirical reserve cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) .
We can see that the dotted green line ( Middle case ) around 105 Gb is close to the median estimate at 116 Gb ( F50 ) .
There are quite a few projects for Russia listed on the wikipedia Oil Megaproject list .
I assumed an ultra-simple triangular shape for each project with a linear ramp - up until the peak year and an immediate exponential decline ( decline rate at 5 % on the figure below ) .
When the peak year is not available , the year following the starting year is taken as the peak year .
The most important project in terms of flow rate is the Vankorskoye that could reach between 0.4 and 0.6 mbpd in 2015 - 2017 and therefore will probably offset production decline in existing fields and not really contribute to maintain production growth in the near future .
The gross new supply addition is shown as a blue bar on Figure 6 , the above field model ( therefore including depletion ) gives an equivalent net annual supply addition shown as the the green bars .
In addition , a Monte - Carlo procedure is applied on the field models shown on Figure 5 .
Parameters for each field model ( time of the peak , post - peak decline rate and duration of the production plateau ) are chosen randomly based on empirical probability density functions derived from the UK / Norway dataset ( the Monte - Carlo runs are shown in gray on Figure 6 ) .
Below , I assumed an ultimate decline rate for the existing production post -2005 at 4 % / year and 3 % / year ( EIA estimate ) .
In addition , because fields online prior to 2005 wo n't go into decline immediately ( see this post for an detailed analysis ) , the decline rate is set to increase linearly from 0 to 4 % between 2004 and 2011 .
Current production seems to be well within the Monte - Carlo uncertainty interval and at best , a production plateau is seen in the near future .

Part 1 : Procedures
The operating room at Alcor ’s Scottsdale , Arizona , facility .
The operating room becomes very busy during a cryonics case .
As many as a dozen technicians and support staff can be required .
Procedures are performed by physician or veterinary surgeons with extensive cryonics experience , and technicians with knowledge of the process of cryoprotectant perfusion .
Contract surgeons work to gain access to major blood vessels .
At this point , the patient is typically at a temperature of 60 °F or lower .
This permits blood circulation to be stopped for a limited time without harming the brain .
Sterile technique is utilized .
Once vascular access is established , the patient will be connected to a perfusion machine that replaces blood with a chemical solution that prevents ice formation .
A technician prepares the cryoprotectant solution perfusion circuit .
The wires behind the plastic tubing are used for electronic monitoring and data collection .
A bank of heart - lung machine roller pumps ( below ) circulate cryoprotectant solution into the patient in gradually increasing concentration .
A computer system ( above ) monitors and collects temperature , pressure , and cryoprotectant concentration data during this four hour procedure .
A technician checks lines connected to electronic devices that measure cryoprotectant concentration ( refractometers ) .
A final manual check of the refractive index of the cryoprotectant solution verifies that the concentration is sufficient for vitrification ( deep cooling without freezing ) .
The patient is now transferred from the operating room to the cooldown facility , where cooling to - 130 °C takes place under computer control .
The result of this process is “ vitrification ” ( solidification without freezing ) .
Following vitrification , neuropatients are placed in individual aluminum containers .
Containers are finally immersed in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of - 196 °C for long - term care .
Part 2 : Field Equipment
THOMAS PACK : Alcor ’s standby / transport teams are equipped with medications for immediate use on patients after cardiac arrest .
These meds serve several purposes , including prevention of blood clots and inhibition of ischemic injury ( the cellular damage which occurs during absent or inadequate blood circulation ) .
Team members transport a full range of medications in a padded backpack of a type that is standard issue for paramedics nationwide .
PACK MODULES :
The backpack opens to reveal padded , color - coded modules which can be removed rapidly in an emergency .
ANCILLARY SUPPLIES :
The backpack also has side compartments for medical equipment such as nitrile gloves and face masks .
A separate insulated meds pack ( the yellow module in the background ) fits in the center of the backpack .
INJECTABLE MEDICATIONS :
The yellow insulated meds module opens to reveal injectable medications which are kept refrigerated prior to deployment .
HEPARIN : While some of Alcor ’s transport medications were specially formulated to inhibit ischemic injury , other meds are standard pharmaceutical items .
First and most important is heparin , a powerful anticoagulant .
Preventing blood clots is a vital first step , since the circulatory system must remain unobstructed for additional medications and subsequent cryoprotective perfusion .
LUCAS : In 2002 Alcor acquired this state - of - the - art LUCAS cardiopulmonary support device direct from its manufacturer in Sweden .
It is shown here with a resuscitation - practice manikin in a portable ice bath .
The LUCAS can be powered by compressed air , oxygen , nitrogen , or carbon dioxide gas .
It applies chest compressions to circulate the blood and maintain respiration .
CARDIOPUMP : If circumstances prevent us from using the LUCAS , an Ambu CardioPump is a handheld backup device .
The CardioPump is widely used in Europe but has not received FDA certification in the United States , even though its suction cup greatly increases the effectiveness of traditional CPR by enabling the user to pull up as well as push down .
Fortunately , regulations permit Alcor to apply the imported CardioPump to patients after legal death has been pronounced .
PULSE OXIMETER : A pulse oximeter of this type fits over the patient ’s finger and indicates pulse rate and oxygen saturation of the blood .
While Alcor cannot and does not intervene medically with living patients , in situations such as a home hospice we may offer patients the option of using a pulse oximeter themselves , since it does not pierce or break the skin and requires virtually no training .
A steady decline in oxygen saturation often provides advance warning of cardiac arrest .
After cardiac arrest , a pulse oximeter measures the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary support by continuing to measure blood oxygen levels .
During good mechanical CPR , a pulse oximeter will actually acquire a pulse ( concurrent with mechanical strokes ) even though the heart remains stopped .
AIR - TRANSPORTABLE PERFUSION KIT ( ATP ) : The Air - Transportable Perfusion kit ( ATP ) contains a pump and heat exchanger which can be deployed in the field to wash out the patient ’s circulatory system , substituting blood with a transport solution which cools the patient internally and provides metabolic support during transport to Alcor ’s facility .
The transport solution , developed in the 1980s , was tested and proven in groundbreaking research involving the resuscitation of animals after more than four hours of bloodless hypothermia .
Alcor helped to sponsor this research effort , which was led by Jerry Leaf and Michael Darwin of Cryovita Laboratories .
The ATP case opens to reveal the pump ( cylindrical object at right ) and its electronic speed controller ( gray box at left ) .
In the lid of the case is a blue sterile pack containing tubing , heat exchanger , filter , and other components .
ATP : When the sterile pack is opened , it reveals a metal baseplate on which the components are mounted .
A second sterile pack ( blue paper package at right ) contains the manifold - the tubing which is connected to the patient after a femoral cutdown and cannulation .
The baseplate fits back into the lid of the ATP case .
The controller is deployed wherever convenient .
A separate plastic reservoir ( not shown here ) is used to contain ice and a submersible pump .
This pump circulates icewater through the heat exchanger , which extracts heat from the perfusate before it passes through the patient .
ATP : The transport solution is air - shipped in a smaller , separate case ( shown at left of photo ) which contains a 20 - liter plastic bladder .
Using sterile technique , this is attached to the ATP immediately prior to use .
TUBING : When the manifold is unwrapped it reveals color - coded tubing to which manometers ( pressure gauges ) and temperature sensors can be connected .
A battery - powered , handheld “ DuaLogR ” records temperatures automatically at preprogrammed intervals , and travels with the patient to Alcor ’s operating room .
TRANSPORT CASES :
The complete remote standby and transport kit is packed into six large , rugged cases which can be checked as baggage on regular scheduled airlines .
Part 3 : Facility Equipment
MOBILE ADVANCED RESCUE CART ( MARC ) : Alcor ’s Mobile Advanced Rescue Cart ( MARC ) is deployed via our ambulance for use in local cases .
The cart was custom - fabricated from welded steel .
A cardiopulmonary support device , such as the LUCAS , is placed over the patient in an ice bath and driven by two compressed - gas cylinders in the base of the cart .
The cart also incorporates a blood pump / oxygenator system for heart - lung bypass ( when surgically possible ) .
The MARC enables uninterrupted blood circulation and rapid surface cooling while the patient is being transported to our facility .
MARC : The ice bath on the MARC contains a submersible pump which is powered by batteries below .
The two flexible blue tubes are placed over a patient lying in the bath , and are perforated to distribute icewater as effectively as possible across the skin .
PERFUSION EQUIPMENT : In Alcor ’s operating room , this array of equipment controls and monitors the process of cryoprotective perfusion .
Four medical - grade roller pumps in the base of the array allow precise control of pressure and flow .
Four refractometers ( small , square units in the center ) monitor changes in cryoprotectant concentration .
A computer displays and records temperature , pressure , and concentration data .
Tubing , filters , a heat exchanger , and liquid reservoirs would be added during an actual case .
PERFORATOR : Numerous medical instruments are used during surgical preparation of cryonics patients .
One of the instruments is a standard neurosurgical tool called a perforator .
It is specially designed to penetrate the skull without harming the brain .
The perforator is used during cryonics surgery to make two small holes ( one over each brain hemisphere ) so that the surface of the brain can be observed during cryoprotective perfusion .
If the wall of small brain blood vessels ( blood brain barrier ) becomes damaged by long intervals of stopped blood circulation ( ischemia ) , brain swelling ( edema ) can occur during perfusion .
Since edema is potentially destructive , it must be carefully monitored .
SUPERCOOL X-1000 ICE BLOCKER : Alcor ’s cryoprotectant solutions incorporate state - of - the - art “ ice blockers ” to prevent ice formation during vitrification .
These ice blockers have been shown in published studies to permit vitrification of larger volumes at slower cooling rates than previously possible .
COOLDOWN AREA :
In the foreground at right , the whole body cooling bath is a large rectangular box whose thick walls contain three layers of Dow Trymer foam insulation .
The purpose of this equipment is to reduce the temperature of a wholebody patient after cryoprotective perfusion , by immersing the patient in silicone oil cooled with dry ice .
Two drums of oil are visible at the bottom of this photo .
After the bath has been partially filled , a patient is wrapped in protective plastic and strapped to the wire - mesh stretcher , which is lowered into the oil .
An insulated lid is placed over the bath , and a pump circulates the oil through a trough containing large pieces of dry ice ( frozen carbon dioxide ) whose temperature is - 79° Celsius .
A newer system ( not shown ) is able to cool wholebody patients using cold nitrogen vapor to even lower temperatures for purposes of achieving vitrification .
Wholebody vitrification technology is still under development .
Behind the whole - body bath is the neuro cooldown area , where nitrogen vapor is injected through a computer - controlled valve into a small Dewar containing a neuropatient .
In the background stands a tall Dewar which is used to slowly cool a wholebody patient from - 79° to - 196° ( the temperature of liquid nitrogen ) .
NEURO COOLDOWN EQUIPMENT : A Dewar of liquid nitrogen ( foreground ) is connected to a small neuropatient cooldown Dewar ( background ) .
A computer control system maintains a pre-programmed temperature descent by periodically injecting liquid nitrogen into the Dewar while a fan continuous stirs the nitrogen gas .
The computer also receives data from temperature sensors in the patient .
BIGFOOT DEWAR : Bigfoot Dewars are Alcor ’s primary patient care system .
Dewars are stainless steel vacuum - insulated containers that hold liquid nitrogen ( named after their inventor , Sir James Dewar , in 1885 ) .
Alcor ’s Dewars are called “ Bigfoot ” because of the large casters at the bottom .
Each Bigfoot can hold four wholebody patients , or 10 neuropatients in each space that would otherwise be occuppied by a whole body patient .
Patients are maintained at a steady temperature of - 196° Celsius , immersed under liquid nitrogen , with no need for electricity .
Approximately 15 liters of liquid nitrogen per day evaporates from a Bigfoot Dewar , which must be periodically replenished .
In the days after John Edwards ’s withdrawal from the Democratic race , the political world expected his endorsement of Barack Obama would be forthcoming tout de suite .
The neo-populist and the hopemonger had spent months tag - teaming Hillary Clinton , pillorying her as a creature of the status quo , not a champion of the kind of “ big change ” they both deem essential .
So appalled was Edwards at Clinton ’s gaudy corporatism — her defense of the role of lobbyists , her suckling at the teats of the pharmaceutical and defense industries — that he ’d essentially called her corrupt .
And then , not least , there were the sentiments of his wife .
“ Elizabeth has n’t always been crazy about Mrs. Clinton ” is how an Edwards insider puts it ; a less delicate member of HRC ’s circle says , “ Elizabeth hates her guts . ”
But now two months have passed since Edwards dropped out — tempus fugit !— and still no endorsement .
Why ?
According to a Democratic strategist unaligned with any campaign but with knowledge of the situation gleaned from all three camps , the answer is simple : Obama blew it .
Speaking to Edwards on the day he exited the race , Obama came across as glib and aloof .
His response to Edwards ’s imprecations that he make poverty a central part of his agenda was shallow , perfunctory , pat .
Clinton , by contrast , engaged Edwards in a lengthy policy discussion .
Her affect was solicitous and respectful .
When Clinton met Edwards face - to - face in North Carolina ten days later , her approach continued to impress ; she even made headway with Elizabeth .
Whereas in his Edwards sit - down , Obama dug himself in deeper , getting into a fight with Elizabeth about health care , insisting that his plan is universal ( a position she considers a crock ) , high - handedly criticizing Clinton ’s plan ( and by extension Edwards ’s ) for its insurance mandate .
The implications of this story are several and not insignificant .
Most obviously , it suggests that the front - runner ’s diplomatic skills could use some refinement .
It also raises the issue , which has cropped up in a different form after New Hampshire , Super - Duper Tuesday , and the Ohio and Texas primaries , of Obama ’s capacity to close the deal .
But equally important is how it bears on the questions du jour among Democrats who see their once - uplifting primary campaign descending into self - destructive mayhem :
How can we put this thing to bed ?
How can Clinton be stopped from putting the party through three more months of hell ?
Where are those vaunted “ party elders ” who can convince her that it ’s sayonara time ?
The urgency of these questions began to mount this week , as the level of nastiness reached new heights — or , rather , depths .
For all its rhetoric about practicing a new , more virtuous brand of politics , the Obama campaign has been going after Clinton hammer and tongs .
Rarely a day passes without his people dubbing her a liar and a fraud .
( Although when it comes to Snipergate , it ’s hard to blame them . )
They have accused Bill Clinton of McCarthyism and invoked the infamous blue dress on which he left his , er , DNA — the latter coming on a blog post arguing that he actually makes McCarthy look benign .
Indeed , it sometimes seems as if the Obamans are actively trying to cede the moral high ground .
The sight and sounds of Clinton ’s lieutenants scrambling to claim that ground — which , after all , is about as foreign to many of them as the beaches of Bora Bora — has been amusing , as each denunciation of their rival ’s negativity is juxtaposed immediately with some fresh depredation from their side .
James Carville ’s likening of Bill Richardson to Judas Iscariot .
( With the beard , I guess , you can kinda see it , but was n’t Judas a skinny dude ? )
The clear suggestion by WJC , which provoked the charges of McCarthyism , that Obama is less patriotic than Hillary .
Her attempt to reignite the Parson Wright conflagration by asserting that “ he would not have been my pastor . ”
This would all be good sport , to be sure , were it not for the gathering impression that the two - way battering is taking a serious toll on the Democrats ’ prospects in the fall .
Poll after poll indicates that Obama ’s and Clinton ’s negatives are rising — and so are John McCain ’s approval ratings , along with his lead among independents over either of them .
Then there ’s the data indicating that pronounced bitterness is setting in among both Obama and Clinton supporters toward other side : Roughly 20 percent in each category now say they would support McCain if their preferred candidate fails to win the nomination .
Ugh .
Which brings us back to those party elders and the calls for them to step in .
Now , let ’s be clear , those calls are coming exclusively from Obama ’s adherents .
And they have some logic on their side :
If it ’s all but mathematically impossible for Clinton to wind up ahead in pledged delegates or the popular vote — and it is — then what conceivable purpose is being served by further bloodshed ?
But the desire for a deus ex machina intervening to usher Clinton from the race runs into a number of problems , beginning with the fact that there simply are n’t many Democratic deities around — and the few that might plausibly qualify seem inclined to remain neutral , at least until the conclusion of the primaries .
Despite the long history of mutual animus between Al Gore and Hillary , Gore has resisted the temptation to throw his weight behind Obama ; and because of that history , even if he did , it would likely have little effect on her determination to carry on , as Gore is well aware .
Edwards , who I ’m told at one juncture discussed with Gore the possibility of a joint endorsement , now appears to prefer staying mum for the time being , or , if anything , backing Clinton .
And Jimmy Carter has stated unequivocally his intention to refrain from choosing sides .
Arguably the two next most influential Democrats are the Speaker of the House , Nancy Pelosi , and the Senate Majority Leader , Harry Reid .
But Pelosi ’s loud advocacy of the view that the superdelegates should vote in line with the pledged delegates belies her pro forma neutrality in the race — thus undercutting any influence she might have with Clinton .
“ She ’s totally in the tank for Obama , ” says one Clintonite .
“ Why would we listen to her ? ”
And while Reid is trying to play the role of honest broker , his mojo in Clintonland is negligible .
No , according to Hillary ’s adjutants , the people most likely to have sway with her on this topic are not party elders at all but instead her fiercest loyalists , those who ’ve won her trust over the years by dint of their unwavering support .
Familiar names from the annals of Clintondom are mentioned : Terry McAuliffe , Vernon Jordan , Rahm Emanuel ( likely the only person in this club who is also close to Obama ) .
So , too , are prominent endorsers such as Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell .
“ If one of her major African - American endorsers , like Stephanie Tubbs - Jones , told her it was time to quit , that would be very powerful , ” adds a senior Clinton adviser .
Oh , and let us not forget her husband .
For the moment , none of these people , as far as I know , is advising Hillary to fold .
They are not idiots and they are not blind — they can read the writing on the wall and do the math as well .
But they also believe that , though Clinton ’s path to the nomination has narrowed to a cliff walk , it has n’t been barricaded .
If she beats Obama in Pennsylvania , North Carolina , and Indiana , it may widen again , should the superdelegates start questioning his durability and the potency of his electoral coalition .
Or Obama ’s candidacy could suddenly blow up in a more spectacular fashion — over further revelations about Wright or some other political IED planted on the roadside ahead .
The question is whether any of those that Clinton trusts are willing to intercede with Hillary if the rancor of the campaign continues to escalate .
Despite all the wailing of the party ’s Henny Pennys , my own view is that , in the long run , Clinton ’s scuffing up of Obama has so far done him more good than harm ; it has toughened him , steeled him , and given him a taste , if only a taste , of what he can expect this fall .
But Democrats are right to fear that Clinton may find it irresistible to turn her campaign into an exercise in nothing less ( and little more ) than political manslaughter against Obama .
They ’re especially right to be worried that she may want to fight on all summer , all the way to the Denver convention — especially with Clinton now talking openly about a floor fight over seating the disputed Florida and Michigan delegations .
Some senior members of Clinton ’s campaign have no intention of sticking around if Obama is substantially ahead come June ; as much as they ’re devoted to their boss , they want nothing to do with a black - bag operation designed to destroy her rival , no matter what the cost .
But these same people are also deeply convinced — beyond spin , beyond talking points , to their core — that Obama would be doomed against McCain .
And Clinton believes this , too , which is one important reason why she persists despite odds that grow longer each passing day .
Yet , by an irony , Clinton ’s grim assessment of Obama ’s chances may also be the best cause for hope that she will , sometime between now and the middle of June , find it in herself to leave the stage with a modicum of grace .
It may even be a reason , as Walter Mondale ’s campaign manager , Bob Beckel , suggested in a column this week , that she winds up filling , against her instincts , the slot as Obama ’s veep .
For if HRC believes that Obama will lose in November , there can be no doubt that she ’s already calculating , in the back of her head , the best way to position herself for 2012 .
A scorched - earth campaign against Obama is plainly not the way to do that .
A classy exit , a show of unity , an act that apparently places party before self :
That ’s the ticket .
All of which is why party elders are n’t the last best hope for a peaceful resolution of the Obama - Clinton race .
The last best hope is that Hillary will eventually come to see yielding as not merely the path to self - preservation , but also as her only route to long - range self - aggrandizement .

This is the final story the series of eight stories in our feature on self - experimenters .
Alexander Shulgin is the world 's foremost " psychonaut . "
The 82 - year - old chemist has not only created more of the 300 known consciousness - altering ( or psychoactive ) compounds than anyone living or dead , he has , by his own account , sampled somewhere between 200 and 250 of them himself — most of them cooked up in the musty lab behind his home in the hills east of Berkeley , Calif. , where he has shared many a chemical voyage with his wife of 26 years , Ann .
" I take them myself because I am interested in their activity in the human mind .
How would you test that in a rat or mouse ? " says Shulgin , known to friends as Sasha .
He has paid the price for his avocation .
Some of his creations have induced uncontrollable vomiting , paralysis and the feeling that his bones were melting , among other terrors .
And though some believe Shulgin has opened the doors of perception to a new class of potentially therapeutic mind - altering compounds , others argue that he bears responsibility for the damage that ongoing abuse of such now - illicit substances can cause .
As a student at the University of California , Berkeley , in the 1950s , Shulgin 's gateway drug was mescaline , a naturally occurring psychedelic found in peyote and other groovy cacti .
" It introduced me to new colors which I had never seen before , " Shulgin says .
" It allowed me to interpret whatever I was looking at with an entirely new vocabulary … .
And yet , what a simple structure ! "
In the 1960s , while working as a biochemist at The Dow Chemical Co. in San Francisco , he could n't resist tinkering with the potent mescaline molecule .
He synthesized entirely new compounds that retained similar , trippy qualities .
Some variations were less potent , but others were even more powerful or imparted their own unique twist .
Shulgin , who left Dow in 1965 to consult for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ) among other pursuits , offered the best of his new chemical darlings to Ann , his second wife ; the most promising of these were passed along to a close circle of 10 friends until the mid-1990s , when the DEA , no longer paying for his services , raided his lab and revoked his license to work with illegal drugs .
His personal favorite , which he describes as " extraordinarily comfortable and quite erotic , " is known simply as 2C - B for its chemical makeup .
One by one , Shulgin has seen many of the compounds he invented or experimented with become illegal in the U.S. , including some that have never been synthesized by anyone and some that he thought might prove therapeutic , such as MDMA ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ) , better known as ecstasy .
" I was very sad to see MDMA achieve the status of a Schedule 1 drug , " a designation that prohibits its manufacture or use in the U.S. , he says .
" I felt that it would inhibit research into its medical value and that 's the way it 's turned out . "
Some researchers agree that the government 's response to psychoactive drugs has deprived them of a unique window into human consciousness .
After all , rodents will happily ingest most intoxicants and narcotics — from marijuana to heroin — but not the headier psychedelics .
" Peculiarly , not only did we make them illegal , but we backed away from them scientifically , " says neuroscientist Roland Griffiths of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine , one of the researchers who is restarting basic research into psychedelics .
His lab has shown that psilocybin , the active ingredient in the variety of fungi known as magic mushrooms , can bring on lasting feelings of well - being .
This may indicate that it could be harnessed to help clinically depressed or addicted patients .
Shulgin , who continues to study cacti for new chemical routes to altered states , predicts that by the year 2060 , the number of different known psychedelics will have grown from 300 to 2,000 .
He intends to discover — and perhaps sample — as many of them as he can .
" It is like opening a door to a hallway , " he says , " that has unopened doors for its entire length , and behind every door is a world with which you are totally unfamiliar . "
House Republicans face tough sell on FISA petition
House Republicans introduced a discharge petition on controversial electronic surveillance legislation Wednesday , hoping to lure enough Democrats to the petition to force the House to take up a Senate - passed version of the bill .
Republican Rep. Vito Fossella of New York and others began circulating the petition , hoping to get the 218 signatures necessary to force the House to take up the bill .
Fossella ’s bill is virtually identical to the Senate version of an update to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
With the overwhelming majority of the 191 House Republicans expected to sign on to the discharge petition , GOP leaders have been targeting conservative “ Blue Dog ” Democrats , after 21 of them sent House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) a letter in January urging her to pass a FISA update , even if it meant voting on the Senate bill .
However , an informal survey of Blue Dogs indicated the discharge petition would be a tough sell .
“ I am not going to sign it , ” said Rep. Tim Mahoney ( D - Fla . ) a member of the Blue Dogs .
“ I just do n’t think it is necessary . ”
Fellow Blue Dog Rep. Michael Arcuri ( D - N.Y. ) agreed with Mahoney , saying he would not subvert the rules process by signing the petition .
“ I like the House version of FISA better than the Senate bill anyway , ” added Arcuri .
The Senate bill contains retroactive immunity for telecom firms , a key sticking point in the ongoing negotiations .
The House passed its own FISA update last month which did not include immunity .
Republicans , however , think the months - long stalemate between Congress and the White House over the issue could force some conservative Democrats to change their minds and sign the petition .
“ If they were smart , all of the Blue Dogs would sign it , ” said one House Republican leadership aide .
“ This petition shows separation from Speaker [ Pelosi ] who ’s toxic in their districts and would be the right thing for our national security . ”
" I urge the 21 Blue Dog Democrats who have called on Speaker Pelosi to schedule the Senate - passed bill to sign the discharge petition so we can give our intelligence officials every tool they need to protect us , " said House Minority Leader John A. Boehner ( R - Ohio . ) .
Several Democratic aides said that they did n’t expect the petition would sway very many members of their caucus .
“ Everyone recognizes that this is a political move , ” said one House Democratic leadership aide .
“ Discussions on FISA are continuing , and we hope to reach a deal soon . ”
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer said Wednesday he hopes to produce a final version of the FISA update before the Memorial Day recess .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Internal Revenue Service has left sensitive taxpayer information vulnerable to disgruntled IRS employees , contractors or hackers , according to independent auditors .
The IRS has left taxpayer information vulnerable to hackers , according to Treasury Department auditors .
The IRS has not done enough to safeguard some of its computer systems , and unscrupulous people could " reconfigure routers and switches " and " steal taxpayer information in a number of ways , " according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration office , which serves a watchdog function over the IRS .
The IRS says it has addressed the concerns raised in the report .
At issue is the security of routers and switches , devices that determine the proper path for data to travel between computer networks , TIGTA said .
Because the IRS sends sensitive taxpayer and government information across its networks , it must have security controls to deter and detect unauthorized users .
The report did not indicate whether any taxpayer information has ever been misdirected or stolen from IRS computers .
But it said that on more than 84 percent of the 5.2 million occasions that employees accessed a system to administer and configure routers , they used " accounts " that were not properly authorized .
To ensure security , the IRS had authorized 374 accounts for employees and contractors to use when they performed system administration duties , TIGTA said .
Of those , authorization for 86 had expired at the time of TIGTA 's review in 2007 , and there was no record that 55 employee and contractor accounts had ever been authorized .
" We are particularly concerned that 27 of the 55 employees and contractors had accessed the routers and switches to change security configurations , " wrote Michael R. Phillips , the deputy inspector general who wrote the report .
In addition , nine accounts were still active , even though the employees and contractors had not accessed the system for more than 90 days , the report says .
The IRS should have automatically prevented users from accessing routers and switches after 90 days , it says .
The report does not say whether taxpayer information was misused , but says it is continuing to review security to see whether changes made to the computer system were appropriate or warranted .
In a written response accompanying the report , the IRS said it has made some changes and is continuing to improve the control and monitoring of controls and switches .
All 369 users now have current and valid authorizations on file , the IRS said .

One of the most important videos you will ever see is The Corporation , a documentary by Zeitgeist Video .
The film includes interviews with people like Milton Friedman and Noam Chomsky -- two individuals you would n't normally see in the same film -- and there are also interviews with many other CEOs , whistleblowers , business brokers and even a corporate spy .
This video will open your eyes -- even if you think your eyes are already open -- to the evils that are being caused by corporations around the world .
It 's important for me to note that I , personally , am not anti-corporation .
Yet , this film has really helped me understand some big issues that I have been struggling with for a long time .
Most notably , it addresses the issue of how a corporation can conduct so much evil and cause so much pain , suffering and even death in the world -- not just at the individual level but at the global level -- and yet be staffed by normal , nice people who have ethics ; everyday men and women .
How can a corporation be so evil when its people are not so evil ?
How does that work ?
This film has really helped answer that question for me , which is one of the main reasons why I recommend watching this , because it gives a new education on where a corporation comes from , and how it gets out of control .
What we find is that corporations become monstrosities .
They become self - feeding entities with one purpose in life , and that is to grow and survive .
It 's sort of like that alien plant in the Little Shop of Horrors -- it just wants to grow , and it says , " Feed me , feed me . "
Every corporation has one purpose , and that is to provide value and profits to its shareholders while continuing to grow .
In fact , as you 'll see in The Corporation , that is by law the growth strategy that every corporation must follow .
By law , corporations must put the profits of shareholders first and , in doing so , will necessarily export its problems to the public at large .
In the video , these are called " externalities , " and corporations are machines that will externalize the costs of their endeavors to society and to the planet .
For example , junk food companies externalize the costs of health care associated with the long - term consumption of their products .
They sell products to consumers , then consumers eat the products , get diseased , have long - term healthcare costs , loss of quality of life and possibly require huge surgical procedures and so on , but these costs are not borne by the corporation , they are borne by the consumers ; the people .
So , this video really helps answer some of these questions as to how these corporations get wildly out of control and become these self - perpetuating , evil machines that really have no purpose in the world other than to make sure they survive and grow .
One of the interesting things about this documentary -- and perhaps one of the criticisms , if I may offer one -- is that the same is true of really any organization .
It does n't have to be a corporation .
Remember , a corporation is a legal entity , but much the same goes on with federal regulatory agencies like the FDA and USDA .
These organizations created by the federal government -- which is supposed to be created by the people -- really have no purpose other than to survive and grow and accumulate more power .
We see the same thing in various nonprofit organizations , as well .
Many nonprofit disease organizations have no other purpose but to survive , grow , make more money and have more influence .
Oftentimes , the way they do that is by selling out to the very companies that cause the same diseases the nonprofit organizations claim to fight .
For example , the American Diabetes Association takes money from the world 's third - largest manufacturer of soft drinks and candy .
Here 's an organization that 's supposed to be fighting diabetes , and it 's taking money from a company that sells products that any nutritionist would agree contain ingredients strongly correlated with the promotion of diabetes and obesity .
It does that because it needs to thrive and survive .
It needs to grow and extend its influence .
It 's not that the people in that organization are evil ; it's that the organization itself has no other purpose than to survive and extend its influence in the world .
These concepts are covered in quite a bit of detail in The Corporation , which is why I strongly recommend you go out and rent or buy this video and see it for yourself .
It 's very well done , and it has a lot of intelligent people talking about the subject and really explaining how corporations get out of control .
You 'll also see some rather shocking images in this documentary of some of the effects of corporations getting out of control -- environmental effects and cruelty to animals in the dairy industry , for example .
You will see how they treat pigs , and you 'll see how they treat other human beings in developing nations or underdeveloped nations .
You will see how these corporations treat their customers and how they treat the planet .
Some of these images are quite shocking and disturbing .
Yet they demonstrate one thing -- that corporations are capable of these great acts of evil , even when human beings that run these corporations are not .
And that 's fascinating because it's a form of mental illness , and this is explored in The Corporation , as well .
Corporations are people , too ; specifically , they 're psychopaths
The corporation itself is called a person in society .
From a legal perspective and a regulatory perspective , a corporation is considered a person .
So , this film asks , " If a corporation is a person , what kind of a person is it ? "
As it turns out , it 's the type of person who has no regard for the safety of others -- the type of person who is unpredictable and who harms society , the environment and the people around him or her .
Basically , if you go down through the checklist , it 's the kind of person who is classified as a psychopath .
And this is the mental characteristic of the corporation .
It is psychopathic in a technically defined mental disorders kind of way .
If you look at how corporations act , they are psychopathic .
This helps explain why companies like the big pharmaceutical firms can continue to market and sell products that they know , literally , kill people , and yet can manage to keep them on the market year after year because they 're generating profits .
This is how a food company can manufacture food products that cause birth defects ; that destroy the nervous systems of fetuses ; that have helped create a nation of children with so - called learning disabilities , or attention deficit hyperactivity disorders ; and children with nervous systems that have been compromised due to the nutritionally depleted foods that are sold in every grocery store in America and around the world .
This is how it happens .
These corporations are in charge , not their people , and these corporations must survive and thrive and generate profits .
That is how these atrocities are taking place today .
Watching this documentary , you might say it has a sort of an anti-trade slant to it .
Some people might say this is a very economically leftist kind of documentary that is against world trade or , perhaps , free trade .
I do n't view it that way ; I think it tells a side of the story that needs to be told and that it raises some very valid points .
But I have to ask myself :
What good are corporations accomplishing , if any ?
Is there a useful purpose behind some corporations ?
What 's going on with free trade and the World Trade Organization ?
Real free trade can prevent wars ; protectionist attitudes can cause them
I 've received a lot of e-mails asking my opinion on these matters and , to some degree , my opinion might stray from most of the opinions of the readership of this site , but here 's my view on it :
If you want to make war impossible between any two countries , one way to do it is to make sure those countries have so much cross-investment in each other that war would be unprofitable .
You see this in China and Taiwan ; this is a region of the world that I watch very closely , and we see that China is always threatening Taiwan with war .
China continues to see Taiwan as a renegade province , and Taiwan , of course , is an independent country by any definition ; it has just failed so far to declare its independence , even though it operates completely independently from China .
There 's been military and political tension between these two countries for a long time , since the late 1940s when Chiang Kai - shek and his allies left the mainland China and came to Taiwan .
Over the last decade , though , we 've seen huge cross-investment between the two countries .
We 've seen businesspeople from Taiwan going into China and setting up factories .
There 's a huge outsourcing of labor from Taiwan into China , where they 're using cheap , mainland Chinese labor to build physical goods , computer components , electronics and so on , and as a result , this trade is opening up new avenues of potential peace between these two countries .
It 's opening up the possibility that perhaps someday these two countries will merge and become one , and they will become stronger from doing so .
Now , of course that wo n't happen in the current political climate , but things could evolve in that direction .
In the meantime , this trade is preventing war .
Why ?
Think about who makes the decisions about war in any country -- it 's the top leaders of that country .
It 's the people who are also at the top of the chain in the business system .
The same is true here in the United States .
The people declaring war in this country are the exact same people who own , run and sit on the boards of the top businesses in this country , and those individuals only decide to go to war when it is profitable to do so .
It was profitable for these individuals to declare war on Iraq because we did n't have any trade with Iraq , and Iraq had a very valuable resource -- oil .
Now , anybody who imagines the war on Iraq is not about oil is a complete fool ; of course it 's about oil .
You did n't see the U.S. jumping into Rwanda to save a bunch of lives and restore democracy .
Why ?
No oil in Rwanda , right ?
There 's oil in Iraq .
But back to China and Taiwan , war is prevented by cross-investment because everybody 's making so much money out of these factories .
Taiwan businesspeople are making money , Chinese businesspeople are making money , Chinese politicians are making money , and Chinese police are making lots of bribery money because you 've got to bribe the right people to do business in China .
So , there 's no profit in war .
If you go to war , you spoil the economic profit that 's there .
Now , back in the United States , let 's say Donald Rumsfeld , for example , owned a chain of factories in Iraq before 2001 .
Let 's say he owned a chain of factories where people were making all kinds of products that were being exported , and let 's say these factories were generating a couple of billion dollars in profit every year .
Would we have gone to war with Iraq ?
I very much doubt it , because when there 's trade and business happening between two countries , war messes with the profits .
Whenever you see two countries trading a lot , you do n't see wars between them .
The only time there is war is when there is a lot of protectionism and countries isolating each other .
Right now , the United States is in a scary , protectionist kind of phase .
We want to protect our borders from any free trade .
The FDA wants to protect us from lower - priced prescription drugs from other countries .
U.S. automobile companies are in the dumps and GM , the U.S. flagship automobile company , is about to declare bankruptcy , in my estimation .
This company is going to be screaming for protectionism because they can't compete with companies like Toyota , so they 're going to want to be protected .
The U.S. is erecting a whole lot of barriers right now .
It does n't want to compete in the global marketplace .
It does n't want to compete with smart people in India who will do accounting or computer programming for a fraction of the price of U.S. programmers .
It does n't want to compete with telephone conference people and call center people in countries around the world .
It does n't want to compete with car manufacturers from Japan .
It does n't want to compete with textile manufacturers in other parts of the world .
The U.S. is in a very protectionist kind of phase , and wherever you have protectionism , you end up with war .
We 're seeing this in the United States right now .
There is lot of trade constriction , protectionism and war going on at the same time , and with all that comes a loss of personal privacy and a shift toward a police state .
We 're seeing all of that happen right here in the United States under the Bush regime -- lots of war , military action , protectionism and a loss of privacy and basic human rights .
So , I am actually a huge proponent of free trade without all the profit mongers involved .
I'm a proponent of fair trade , which is free trade between two countries where the people doing the work can make an honest living .
I believe any time you have two populations trading goods and services , even if there 's a disparity between the labor costs of one country and another , you can still serve the common interests of both countries by specializing in labor in one case and specializing in consumption in the case of U.S. consumers .
You can still serve the common good .
So , I 'm a huge proponent of free trade or fair trade practices , such as fair trade coffee , for example .
Fair trade is a big part of the organic food movement .
Now , I know a lot of you are saying that I 'm confusing free trade and fair trade , but actually , I 'm not .
I 'm sort of using them interchangeably for a specific reason .
When the people in charge of the world say free trade , they do n't really mean free trade .
But when I say it , I really do mean free trade .
I mean free and open borders with economic prosperity between two trading partners and without influence of the people who always have their fingers in everything -- the people who make the big decisions about who goes to war , which corporations are going to come in and invade a country and so on .
You know who I 'm talking about -- the top people who run the top banks , top corporations and top governments around this world .
When they get involved , everything gets messed up .
What I 'm talking about is free trade without those disaster creators .
I 'm talking about free trade between everyday people .
I 'm talking about the kind of free trade where you go to a farmer 's market on the weekend and you trade some dollars for some potatoes or some green beans or something .
I 'm talking about person - to - person trade between two countries , where everybody benefits .
This system of trade enhances the quality of life for everyone , until you get all these people involved who run the corporations and run the governments of the world , and they want a piece of the pie .
A lot of times , I see the term free trade being used just as a front to allow U.S. corporations to come in and invade a society and say , " Well , we 've got to have a McDonald 's here and we 've got to have U.S. banks here , so that we can financially exploit this country . "
Politicians call that free trade , but I call that exploitive trade .
So , when I say free trade , I 'm talking about legitimate free trade that is free of the criminal influence or the political influence of these corrupt individuals who seem to be running everything in the country and around the world .
And of course , I 'm a big proponent of fair trade as it is known in the organic industry .
Here 's a wacky idea :
When corporations serve their purpose , they should dissolve
What does all this have to do with The Corporation ?
Well , I 'm just trying to point out that I 'm not against the idea of a corporation , although this documentary has certainly given me a fantastic education in how these corporations get out of control .
I think the solution here is having corporations with specific missions and time limits , so that , in a sense , every organization should self - destruct when it accomplishes its mission .
It should dissolve itself .
There 's a crazy idea , right ?
What do you say we have a non-profit and then when the non-profit accomplishes its mission , it 's complete ?
It 's done .
The non -profit is over with .
Now , let 's say you have a disease organization like the American Cancer Society -- would n't it be great if the American Cancer Society had as its mission the curing of cancer , and then it would self - destruct ?
That 's what it should be , but I do n't think that 's part of the articles of the non-profit incorporation for the American Cancer Society .
I think this organization and all the other disease organizations out there are really just perpetuating their own existence , and if you are a disease organization , you do that by perpetuating the disease .
If you 're a cancer association or a diabetes association or an Alzheimer 's association and you cure the disease , you 're out of work .
I 've talked about this before .
This is why I do n't believe any of these organizations really have curing these diseases as their top priorities .
I think they have disease management as their top priorities .
I think they have diagnosis and treatment of these diseases as their top priorities , and this is why they get so much funding from pharmaceutical companies , because treatment involves drugs .
Cures do n't .
If you found the cure for cancer , you would destroy the cancer industry in this country , and it is a multi-billion dollar industry .
So , I think that every organization should have a roadmap to its own completion of its important goals .
It 's sort of like term limits on corporations , non-profits or government institutions .
For example , let 's say that every four years , everybody who worked at the FDA was fired , and you had to get a whole new FDA .
Well , then you would n't get a whole lot of corrupt officials because every four years , you 'd have new people coming into office .
That way drug companies could n't manipulate one individual and count on that individual staying in charge for a decade or more .
Now , certainly you could still have corruption ; it would just be harder to accomplish .
You 'd have to re-corrupt everybody every four years .
That 's not impossible to do , and we certainly see it in Congress , but it 's a little more difficult than just corrupting one guy and hoping he stays in power .
The corporation , as a legal entity , definitely has a place in society and perhaps even a constructive place .
There are a lot of economic benefits that we would not experience today if it were not for corporations -- if it were not for a group of people working together toward one common goal .
However , we need to rethink what 's happening to these corporations .
Corporations are running the world today .
Corporate influence is running our governments .
Do you think people who are just looking to protect public health run the FDA ?
Give me a break .
Those corporations that influence the FDA 's regulatory decisions run it .
Do you think people who represent the public run our government ?
Give me a break .
Our government is run by corporate interests , and it is these corporate interests that make all the decisions about environmental law , war and all kinds of legal reforms that benefit the business community , like making it more difficult for consumers to file bankruptcy or making it illegal for consumers to sue food companies for health concerns related to long - term consumption of their products .
It is the corporations that really run this country .
This is something that is fairly new to us as a society .
For hundreds of years it 's been individuals in charge , and now it 's corporations in charge .
We do n't even really know who these corporations are , other than the fact that they are psychopathic .
It is the psychopathology of the business world that is now running our world .
So , if you 've ever wondered why everything around you seems so incredibly insane , the answer is because an insane individual is running it all -- an individual known as a corporation -- and it is a frightening collection of corporations that now rule our society .
That 's the truth that you will discover from watching this documentary .
So again , I strongly recommend The Corporation , by Zeitgeist Video .
You can find it at www.thecorporation.com.
You 'll learn a lot in this documentary .
It has certainly taught me a lot .
It has opened my eyes , and it will open yours .
Give this a good watching , and if you buy the two - CD set , you can watch an additional five hours of interviews with people like Milton Friedman , Noam Chomsky and even Michael Moore .
You can watch some interesting footage and learn a lot more .
This is an eye - opener .
It is a must - see documentary if you really want to know what 's going on in the world around you .
I recommend it strongly and definitely give it a thumbs - up .
I hope you enjoyed this review .

Intel 's Silverthorne and Diamondville chips will be called Atom and the company 's Menlow platform for ultramobile computers will be renamed Centrino Atom when these products hit the market , according to a company spokesman .
The creation of the new processor brand sets the stage for the tiny , low - power chips ' upcoming release , and marks the opening salvo in a concerted push by Intel to make ultramobile computers a mainstream product segment .
Several versions of the Atom processor are on track to be delivered to during the first half of this year , according to Danny Cheung , an Intel spokesman in Singapore .
The processors are made using Intel 's 45 - nanometer process , and will run at clock speeds up to 1.8GHz .
Slower versions will also be available , but Intel is n't saying what the slowest clock speed will be .
Pricing for the chips has yet to be announced .
The chips , which measure less than 25 square millimeters , have a thermal design power ( TDP ) of between 0.6 watts to 2.5 watts .
That number refers to the maximum sustained power that users are likely to see with the chips , not the maximum amount of power the chips can consume .
The small size of the Atom means 2,500 of them can be produced on a single 300 - millimeter silicon wafer , allowing Intel to sell them at a low price while maintaining high margins .
While Intel has n't announced a specific date for Atom 's release , Mobile Internet devices based on Centrino Atom will hit the market in the beginning of the second quarter , Cheung said .
Mobile Internet device , or MID , is the term Intel uses to describe some , but not all , devices that are generally referred to as ultramobile PCs .
Prototype MIDs shown by Intel typically include touchscreens or slide - out keypads and the company envisions these devices running Linux instead of Windows .
Centrino Atom will include a single - core Atom processor , formerly called Silverthorne , as well as the Poulsbo chipset and a wireless chipset .
Intel has yet to announce the formal name of Poulsbo , which packs a Northbridge and Southbridge chipset into a single package to reduce size and lower power consumption .
Not all Atom processors will ship with Poulsbo .
Some versions of the chip , known by the code name Diamondville , will ship with two - chip chipsets .
These processors , which will be available in single - core and dual - core versions , are intended for low - cost notebooks , like Asustek Computers ' Eee PC , and inexpensive desktops , respectively .
Intel refers to these devices as netbooks and nettops to differentiate them from mainstream desktops and notebooks .
To further separate these product segments , Intel has set guidelines for device makers that limit the features of Atom - based devices , preventing the chips from being used in notebooks with a 15 - inch screen instead of a Core 2 Duo processor , for example .
Low - cost notebooks and desktops based on Atom will hit the market sometime during the third quarter , Cheung said , adding Intel also expects to see demand for Atom processors in consumer electronics and embedded applications .
Intel expects low - cost computers will appeal to first - time computer buyers in emerging markets as well as users in more mature markets looking for a second computer .

PRETORIA , South Africa 
The top American envoy to Africa declared Thursday that Zimbabwe ’s main opposition leader , Morgan Tsvangirai , was the “ clear victor ” over President Robert Mugabe in the nation ’s disputed election and called on other countries  including the United States  to help solve the deepening political and humanitarian crisis there .
The diplomat , Jendayi Frazer , the assistant secretary of state for African affairs , said the election results , based on projections by independent monitors , removed the rationale for any negotiated settlement that left Mr. Mugabe in charge , as was proposed Wednesday in an editorial in The Herald , the state - run newspaper .
“ This is a government rejecting the will of the people , ” Ms. Frazer said , referring to the Zimbabwe electoral commission ’s refusal to announce who won the March 29 presidential election .
“ If they had voted for Mugabe , the results would already have been announced .
Everyone knows what time it is . ”
The United States has deferred in recent years to South Africa , the region ’s most powerful nation , to mediate between ZANU - PF , Zimbabwe ’s governing party , and its political rivals .
But at a news briefing on Thursday in Pretoria , South Africa ’s capital , Ms. Frazer said the severity of the human rights violations by state - sponsored groups against opposition supporters now required the involvement of more players : the African Union , the United Nations and other nations , including the United States .
Thousands of Navajos to be left without Internet
ALBUQUERQUE - A
Utah - based company that provides public Internet access to the Navajo Nation plans to shut off the tribe 's service Monday , leaving thousands of Navajos without online access to do school work , post community announcements or communicate with others across the 27,000 square - mile reservation .
" It 's going to be a sad day , " said Ernest Franklin , director of the tribe 's Telecommunications Regulatory Commission .
The shutdown stems from a decision by Universal Service Administration Company - which administers the E-rate program under the Federal Communications Commission - to withhold $ 2.1 million in reimbursement funds to OnSat Network Communications Inc. over concerns about a federal audit of the Utah - based company .
The E-rate program reimburses between 85 percent and 90 percent of the costs for Internet services to the tribe 's chapter houses , which operate like city governments .
The Navajo Nation covers the rest .
Because of the delay in payment , an attorney for OnSat said it can't pay a subcontractor - SES Americom - for satellite time .
" With USAC taking this particular position , it does n't look like we 're going to get paid in the foreseeable future , " said Jim Fitting .
" We 're already $ 4 million in the hole , so why should we continue doing it . "
In a letter dated March 28 to Navajo President Joe Shirley Jr. , USAC said it is withholding money for OnSat from funding year 2006 - 07 because of concerns over a tribal audit that found OnSat has overbilled for services and that the tribe did n't comply with procurement rules or a competitive bidding process in selecting OnSat .
FCC rules require applicants to select the most cost - effective service or equipment and a fair and open competitive bidding process .
The USAC is asking the tribe to prove that OnSat has provided the services for which payment is sought and that it has taken steps to ensure that USAC is billed only for the services provided at each eligible site .
It also is asking the tribe to document any processes it in place to make sure Internet service is uninterrupted .
The audit also is at the center of a lawsuit OnSat filed against the tribe last July in Window Rock District Court - which the USAC also raised concern over .
A preliminary injunction issued July 20 essentially freezes the report from further use , Fitting said .
OnSat President Dave Stephens and Fitting have maintained the audit findings were based on faulty assumptions and a lack of understanding of the contract .
" We do n't believe this audit is valid , " Fitting said .
The Navajo Nation has 45 days from March 28 to respond to the USAC 's letter .
Based on the tribe 's answers , USAC can either release full funding , partial funding or deny the funding , said USAC spokeswoman Laura Betancourt .
" They 're just in a holding bin until we get satisfactory answers , " she said .
Franklin said he has provided documents to the USAC detailing how OnSat was selected as the service provider and justified the services at each of the eligible sites .
He said USAC sent personnel to the Navajo Nation last year to see the actual connections at randomly selected chapters .
" We proved that we are delivering the bandwidth and that we went through the proper procurement system , " he said . " ...
We had to dig up all these documents . "
Franklin said the tribe eventually would have stopped using OnSat , but that it needed to sustain the satellite connections for at least two years until a wireless grid is completed on the reservation .
" It 's not like it 's not being used and it 's just going to go away , " he said .
" It 's used tremendously by the public .
It 's just sad that this has to happen . "
OnSat will continue to provide Internet services for the tribe 's Division of Public Safety and the Office of the President and Vice President , which are n't tied to E- rate funding , Fitting said .
But whether OnSat and the tribe will continue their relationship should USAC release the funding is unclear .
" The nation may not want OnSat to continue .
OnSat may not want to continue with the nation , " Fitting said .
" The relationship has been strained .
If you can achieve the property settlement on the divorce , do you still want to stay married ? "
Each Navajo chapter received a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation 's Native American Access to Technology Program in 2000 , which provided for computer and Internet access .
But the foundation found that dial - up and wireless connections were n't possible because of the lack of telephone service on the reservation and a wireless grid .
The tribe 's Division of Community Development entered into a contract with OnSat in 2001 to provide the services via satellite dishes to the chapter houses , but the Gates Foundation cautioned that the use of satellite for Internet technology should be temporary because of its high cost , speed limitations and unreliable connections .
Navajo President Joe Shirley Jr. said Navajo people have come to rely on Internet access provided through E-rate to improve their educational standards and professional lives .
" It would be a very sad day for the children and people of the Navajo Nation if the dark clouds descend , the lights go out , and access is denied to the chapter houses ( libraries ) on the reservation , in large part , because USAC has failed to timely fund our application , " Shirley said in a Dec. 10 , 2007 letter to Mel Blackwell , vice president of USAC's Schools and Libraries Division .
Franklin said about 70 of the tribe 's 110 chapter houses will be affected by the shutdown .
He said notices were sent to the chapter houses last week , informing them they would not have Internet service as of Monday .
Inscription Chapter House community services coordinator Victoria Bydone said she never received a notice .
Nevertheless , she is bracing for the slew of people upset that they can't use the Internet .
The two public computers at the Arizona chapter are constantly being used by community members and students who are enrolled in online courses , doing research for school projects or surfing .
Users are limited to one hour to accommodate the wait , she said .
When the chapter 's administration closes down at 5 p.m. , nearby residents park their vehicles outside the chapter house to access the wireless signal .
" It 's going to be unfortunate , " she said .
" It 's not going to be very good . "
Without a doubt , this was a poorly - worded statement on the part of Barack Obama :
You go into these small towns in Pennsylvania and , like a lot of small towns in the Midwest , the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothing ’s replaced them .
And they fell through the Clinton administration , and the Bush administration , and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not .
And it ’s not surprising then they get bitter , they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who are n’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations .
As a former resident of Pennsylvania ( though not a small town ) , it ’s true that there is bitterness there .
And it ’s true that much of that bitterness is due to economics– the massive closing of steel plants in Pittsburgh , for example .
But it ’s not true that that economic bitterness completely explains people ’s faith or their feelings on the second amendment ( though it does largely cover the anti-immigrant and anti-trade sentiments ) .
It was a poorly - worded statement , as Obama has acknowledged , but to call it offensive is a reach .
The irony about all the “ outrage ” that ’s being manufactured over this statement is that it ’s coming exclusively from out - of - touch rich people who are making the assumption that this is something small - town Pennsylvanians should be offended by .
I have yet to see a single quote from an actual small - town Pennsylvanian who has taken offense to Obama ’s statement .
Yesterday , Hillary Clinton called the comments “ elitist ” and “ out of touch , ” and claimed that Pennsylvanians who face hard times are n’t bitter ( which in itself is a wildly out of touch sentiment ) .
John McCain ’s campaign said Obama ’s statement “ shows an elitism and condescension towards hardworking Americans that is nothing short of breathtaking . ”
But let ’s take a step back here for a moment .
Hillary Clinton ’s tax returns show that she and Bill have amassed $ 109 million in the last eight years – mostly from speaking fees , book royalties , and overseas investments .
But long before that , at the age of 31 , she moved into the Arkansas governor ’s mansion with Bill , and has lived there or in the White House or in their million - dollar Chappaqua estate ever since .
John McCain is married to the heiress of a $ 100 + million fortune , a woman whose family trust fund has helped finance his congressional and senate campaigns for decades .
He owns $ 4 million in real estate and $ 25 million in various trust funds .
Five years ago , before his speech at the 2004 national convention and his subsequent bestselling book , Barack Obama was a state senator and constitutional law lecturer earning $ 92,000 a year .
He and his wife Michelle were raising two young daughters and still paying off their student loan debt .
A quick glance at the estimated net worth of each candidate pretty much tells you all you need to know about who is closest to the average American .
I ’ll go out on a limb and guess that neither Hillary Clinton nor John McCain have driven a vehicle for themselves , folded their own laundry , or gone into a grocery store and purchased a carton of milk in decades .
Yet over the next week or so , and certainly again in the fall , we can expect to hear many lectures from two super - rich , Washington lifers about what they think small - town America should take offense to .
UPDATE : Surprisingly , CNN gets it .
People in small - town PA are bitter over job loss , and they have every right to be .
To suggest that they ’re not is ridiculous .
It ’s rose - colored , revisionist , political spin .
It ’s like saying Americans were optimistic but not angry after 9/11 .

Fox : McCain gets heated when reporter asks about Kerry Veep offer David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Friday March 7 , 2008

Print This Email This John McCain is known for his willingness to engage reporters on all matter of issues , so some scribes on his campaign plane were taken aback Friday when the Republican presidential candidate appeared to lose his cool when talking to a New York Times correspondent .
Elisabeth Bumiller asked McCain about a meeting he had with then - presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004 about becoming the Democrat 's running mate .
McCain had just mentioned to a town hall meeting in Atlanta that he and Kerry " had that conversation , " but he turned down the offer to share the ticket .
Bumiller noted that McCain denied speaking to Kerry at the time , citing a May 2004 Times article .
The candidate appeared to grow agitated , although he never raised his voice .
Fox News broadcast video of the exchange .
" Everybody knows that I had a private conversation .
... Theres no living American in Washington " who does n't know , McCain said .
Although there were widespread reports about Kerry 's campaign reaching out to McCain to join his ticket in 2004 , some reporters thought his acknowledgment of a direct conversation between the two was news , a Fox producer who was on the plane said .
It appears Bumiller was asking about this Times article from May 15 , 2004 : Asked if Senator Kerry had made such an offer , Mr. McCain said no without hesitation .
But asked if the two men had ever discussed it , even casually , he paused for a moment .
" No , " he said finally .
" We really have n't . "
This video is from Fox 's America 's Pulse , broadcast March 7 , 2008 .
ABC News produced this transcript of McCain and Bumiller 's exchange : New York Times correspondent Elisabeth Bumiller : Senator can I ask you about Senator Kerry .
I just went back and looked at our story , the Times story , and you told Sheryl Stolberg that you had never had a conversation with Kerry about being , about Vice President 
John McCain : Everybody knows that I had a private conversation .
Everybody knows that .
That I had a conversation .
Theres no living American in Washington -
EB : Okay .
McCain : - that knows that , theres no one .
EB : Okay
McCain :
And you know it too .
You know it .
You know it .
So I dont even know why you ask .
EB : Well I ask because I just read -
McCain :
You do know it .
You do know it .
EB : Because I just read in the Times in May of 04 you said .
McCain : I dont know what you may have read or heard of , I dont know the circumstances .
Maybe in May of 04 I hadnt had the conversation --
EB : But do you recall the conversation ?
McCain : I dont know , but its well known that I had the conversation .
It is absolutely well known by everyone .
So do you have a question on another issue ?
EB : Well can I ask you when the conversation was ?
McCain : No . Nope , because the issue is closed as far as I m concerned .
Everybody knows it .
Everybody knows it in America .
EB : Can you describe the conversation ?
McCain : Pardon me .
EB : Can you describe the conversation ?
McCain : No , of course not .
I dont describe private conversations .
EB : Okay .
Can I ask you 
McCain : Why should I ?
Then theres no such thing as a private conversation .
Is there ( inaudible ) if you have a private conversation with someone , and then they come and tell you .
I dont know that that s a private conversation .
I think that s a public conversation .
EB .
Okay .
Can I ask you about your ( pause )
Why you re so angry ?
McCain : Pardon me ?
EB : Nevermind , nevermind .
McCain : I mean its well known .
Everybody knows .
It s been well chronicled a thousand times .
John Kerry asked if I would consider being his running mate .

Games are exploiting the increasing power of games consoles
Gerhard Florin said incompatible consoles made life harder for developers and consumers .
" We want an open , standard platform which is much easier than having five which are not compatible , " said EA 's head of international publishing .
He said the web and set - top boxes would grow in importance to the industry .
" We 're platform agnostic and we definitely do n't want to have one platform which is a walled garden , " said Mr Florin .
EA currently produces games for more than 14 different gaming systems , including consoles , portable devices and PCs .
" I am not sure how long we will have dedicated consoles - but we could be talking up to 15 years , " Mr Florin added .
Gaming will just require potentially a £ 49.99 box from Tesco made in China with a hard drive , a wi-fi connection and a games engine inside
Nick Parker , analyst
He predicted that server - based games streamed to PCs or set - top boxes , would become increasingly important .
" You do n't need an Xbox 360 , PS3 or Wii - the consumer wo n't even realise the platform it is being played on . "
Set - top boxes are becoming increasingly more powerful as they include technology to deal with High Definition TV streams and access to the internet .
Basic games
Both Sky and BT offer personal video recorders that play basic games .
In the 1980s Microsoft led an initiative to create a common home computer platform , called MSX , and supported by Sony and Philips among others .
It became a popular games platform in Japan but died out due to the growth of consoles and the rise of PCs .
Games consultant Nick Parker said the long term future of gaming would most likely not lie with dedicated consoles .
But he said competition among manufacturers had driven innovation .
" Competition was required to ensure the pace of technology was maintained . "
He added : " Going forward that is irrelevant .
Gaming will just require potentially a £ 49.99 box from Tesco made in China with a hard drive , a wi-fi connection and a games engine inside .
" It 's basically a boiled - down PC . "
But he predicted that walled gardens would still surround platforms and that an open system would not emerge .
Microsoft and Sony have positioned their consoles as all - in - one entertainment devices in recent years but both firms have struggled with non-gaming content .
Outside of the US , Microsoft has yet to strike deals with firms for meaningful video content while Sony has turned to companies like Sky after being unable to agree licensing terms with its own in - house content providers , such as Sony Pictures and MGM .
Absorb consoles
Mr Parker said he believed they were in danger of being overtaken by other companies , such as Apple , and PC technology .
" There are a lot of companies coming into the market . "
With space in the living room limited , set - top boxes could yet absorb console functionality .
Mr Parker said : " Games will be provided over the net .
There might not be a need for a PS4 or dedicated consoles . "
With Microsoft 's track record in licensing its technology to other hardware manufacturers and Sony hoping to recoup the cost of developing the Cell processor , both firms could move toward a business plan of offering their services and hardware to other manufacturers .
Microsoft , Sony and Nintendo could instead be walled garden content providers and licensors , said Mr Parker .
" There could be a Nintendo channel , a PlayStation channel and an Xbox channel on your set - top box , " he added .

If you thought the twilight zone insanity of the propaganda being desperately spewed forth in order to prolong the " war on terror " was n’t ludicrous enough , this week it got worse , after Ayman al - Zawahiri , or whoever is using him as their personal sock puppet , directly lifted a spoof news satire piece and incorporated it into his diatribe .
A few weeks ago popular news satire website The Onion ran a spoof video interview skit wherein an Al - Qaeda operative appears with a 9/11 conspiracy researcher to express his frustration about other parties being given credit for carrying out the terrorist attack on the WTC and the Pentagon .
" How would you like it if you spent two months in a mountain cave , sleeping on rocks , planning something really special , only to have someone take the credit away from you , " laments " Omar Al - Farouq " .
Many in the 9/11 Truth Movement took this as a sneering send - up of researchers who question the official story while others just found it funny .
Either way you look at it , the significance of this video has now taken on a new perspective after what we ’re assured is the real " Al - Qaeda " number two – Ayman al - Zawahri – followed suit and threw a hissy fit aimed at 9/11 conspiracy theorists this week , who he claimed were based in Iran .
Perhaps people should be worried that CENTCOM is spending more time surfing around satirical news websites than worrying about America ’s supposed enemies .
The fact that they would lift a skit from a comedy video and incorporate it within an " Al - Zawahiri " speech just shows how dumb they think the American people are and the extremities of what they think they can get away with .
As blogger Darryl Mason points out , al - Zawahiri ’s virtual defense of Israel , the supposed sworn enemy of Al - Qaeda along with their close ally the " great Satan " America and his condemnation of Neo - Con prime target Iran , is a transparent indication that the much - vaunted audiotape , whose authenticity was not established as it never is before the media goes big with it anyway , is just more cartoonish propaganda .
" So just to recap : We ’re supposed to now believe that the CIA - branded entity known as Al Qaeda is annoyed that Israel is being credited by conspiracy theorists for the horrors inflicted on infidels on 9/11 .
Al Qaeda does n’t think it gets enough credit for the attacks , and that annoys them .
Al Qaeda also has a conspiracy - within - a - conspiracy theory .
They blame Iran for helping to spread conspiracy theories that Bush , Cheney and Mossad were in cahoots on 9/11 .
Oh , and by the way , Iran helped the United States invade and occupy Iraq , so get a bit more bloody busy with your personal jihading and add Iran to your shitlist , okay ? , " writes Mason .
" Former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld did promise the ‘ WoT ’ would be fought with a heavy emphasis on propaganda , online , as well in the front lines .
How much of what we see supposedly flowing from the Al Qaeda publicity bunker is information warfare ?
You do n’t need much footage to work with .
Osama Bin Laden has already proven how effective and how far only a couple of hours of repeatedly recycled footage and audio speeches can go . "
The fact that the Pentagon - affiliated IntelCenter , who have been caught branding old material as new and purporting to obtain tapes from " Al - Qaeda " that were in fact U.S. government recorded surveillance footage , is releasing the tapes only adds more weight to the evidence .
The reality is staring us in the face – the Neo - Cons are manufacturing or doctoring so - called " Al - Qaeda " tapes and using the phony terrorists ’ rhetoric to demonize their political enemies – and 9/11 truthers are their latest target .
People who have personally met with people like Osama bin Laden and Ayman al - Zawahiri , such as London Independent journalist Robert Fisk , are shocked by how uninformed they are about world issues .
Bin Laden reportedly consumed newspaper stories
Fisk had brought with him like a kid in a candy shop , because he is ( or was ) completely closed off from society .
" As I sat there watching the man who had declared a " holy war " against the United States a year earlier –the man who was supposedly the " mastermind of world terrorism " – I reflected that he did n’t seem to know much about the world he was supposedly terrorizing , " wrote Fisk .
All the more ridiculous it is therefore that Bin Laden , in his October 2004 pre-election videotape that both Bush and Kerry admit swung the presidency for Bush , was supposedly quoting Michael Moore and going off on a myriad of other tangents in a guilt - by - association set - up that appeared as if it was lifted from Republican talking points – even prompting Walter Cronkite to allege that the whole thing was a Karl Rove orchestrated hoax .
Fast - forward to this week and Ayman al - Zawahiri is ranting about global warming !
How much more of this fairy - tale are Americans going to swallow before they become a little more sophisticated and realize how monumentally conned they have been ?

As Auma said to me : “ He was trying to figure out who he was .
He needed to be whole to be able to do what he ’s doing now .
He went about it the right way .
A big chunk of his life was missing .
It ’s very healthy that he now knows he has these roots here . ”

Those roots were discovered during Obama ’s first visit to Kenya two decades ago .
During that trip , as recounted in his memoir , he encountered Ruth in Nairobi .
She is described as “ a white woman with a long jaw and graying hair . ”
But who is Ruth , a woman who divorced Obama ’s father , remarried , and gave the family name of her second husband to her two sons by Obama Sr . ?
In the book she says , with less than exquisite tact , to Barack Obama : “ But your mother remarried .
I wonder why she had you keep your name ? ”
As for Ruth ’s son , and Obama ’s half brother , Mark , the one in China , he ’s described as studying physics at Stanford in the 1980s .
“ The things Mark studies are so complicated only a handful of people really understand it at all , ” Ruth enthuses .
But Mark , “ a black man of my height and complexion , ” tells Obama his work ’s a breeze .
He expresses limited interest in their shared father who died in 1982 at 46 : “ Life ’s hard enough without all the excess baggage , ” he muses .
If nominated , Obama ’s family baggage will get pored over .
Four years ago , Bush ’s people cast Kerry as un-American for speaking French .
A Republican camp campaigning at the sorry nadir of Bush ’s handiwork will try to portray the war hero John McCain as more American and patriotic than his opponent .
But things are different .
Less fearful , Americans are less willing to be manipulated .
They ’ve backed Obama this far in part because they ’re sick of the narrow American exceptionalism of Bush ’s divisive rule .
Deval Patrick : I asked Obama to use my words Michael Roston and David Edwards

Two days after the Clinton campaign first published videos on YouTube that sparked allegations of plagiarism on the part of Barack Obama , the press was still on the case .
And in an appearance on ABC News ' Good Morning America on Tuesday , Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick , an Obama friend and supporter , addressed the issue .
Clinton campaign official Kiki McClean told GMA , " The focus of the speech is how important words are , then you find out the words were n't his .
That 's the irony of the whole issue here . "
Patrick was the source of Obama 's allegedly lifted words , and he laughed off the accusation of plagiarism , calling it " elaborate " and " extravagant . "
" I think it 's a sad comment on the state of the race and the state of our politics that the Clinton campaign is taking this particular tack , " he told Diane Sawyer .
The Democratic governor also said it was not necessary for Obama to credit Patrick for drawing from his words .
" It 's not like he 's writing a law review article or a book or something like that , " he argued .
" He should have credited me with the use of two words , meaning those words , ' just words . ' "
Some voters interviewed by ABC News appeared to agree with Patrick .
" I do n't care what he says about someone else 's words , " one voter at a Clinton campaign event said .
A video clip from Patrick 's appearance on Good Morning America is presented below .
This video is from ABC's Good Morning America , broadcast February 19 , 2008 .
Transcript via closed captions :: now let 's turn back to the political news here at home .
voters heading t the polls in three states this morning .
republican primary in washington state , caucus of democrats in hawaii and primary of both parties in wisconsin .
polls show that the race there is tight which made the last 72 hours as heated as anything we 've seen in the race so far .
and abc's kate snow has a ring - side seat from milwaukee , wisconsin .
kate . :: good morning .
they 'll be filling out ballots in wisconsin but hillary clinton and barack obama heading to the next big battle .
she in texas , him in ohio .
where things do n't look so good for clinton .
a new poll shows a virtual tie in texas . :: i'm asking you to hire me for the hoardest job in the world . :: reporter : her campaign seized on an obama mess - up .
he admitted he borrowed language from his friend , massachusetts deval patrick for a speech last summer . :: do n't tell me words do n't matter .
i have a dream , just words . :: the focus of the speech is how important words are , then you find out the words were n't his .
that 's the irony of the whole issue here . :: reporter : obama said it was no big deal . :: deval and i do trade ideas all of the time .
he occasionally used lines of mine .
i notice senator clinton used words of mine as well .
i do n't think that 's the kind of stuff the workers here are concerned about . :: reporter : our reporter asked by obama did n't simply give patrick credit . :: i thought they were good lines .
i'm sure i should have . :: reporter : voters we asked at a clinton rally did n't seem to care much . :: i do n't care what he said about news of somebody else 's words . :: look what they say , they do .
not what they 're saying . :: reporter : both candidates are desperate for anything tt might help them stand out from wisconsin to hawaii .
obama is native sun but look who spent the weekend island hopping .
chelsea clinton got the royal treatment even tried a bit of hula .
hillary clinton trying to pick up a couple delegates but here in wisconsin she 's hoping that the whole battle over language will stick . :: all right .
let 's turn now to the man whose words that were originally his words .
governor deval patrick .
he 's another harvard lawyer who ran against a female opponent in his campaign .
he joins us in a " gma " exclusive . :: governor patrick , good morning to you . :: good morning , diane . :: the clinton campaign accused barack obama of plagiarizing the words you used in the 2006 campaign .
you 're laughing .
that 's a serious charge . :: i am laughing .
it 's an elaborate charge , an extravagant one .
i've known barack for almost 15 years now .
we talked a good deal during my own campaign and his .
we fully expected .
i fully expected he would sus sustain a charge at some point trying to belittle his ability to motivate people with language .
i got the same kind of attack when i was running f governor of massachusetts .
i told him about i had responded because i think word dos matter . :: so you told him this .
but he , himself , said he should have credited you . :: well , look , i hear that .
it 's a little -- it 's not like he 's writing a law review article or a book or something like that .
he should have credited me with the use of two words .
meaning those words , just words .
i suppose he should have credited the declaration of independence , and john f. kennedy and franklin roosevelt whom i quod as well .
these are iconic phrases .
the point is , we have a candidate here , barack obama with terrific ideas , with more law making experience than hillary clinton as fine a candidate she is but pe has added vision to motivate people to reach for it .
that 's a terrific asset to bring to bear . :: would you see the same about all this if hillary clinton used your words ? :: sure .
they 're good words .
it 's a great argument .
and a logical one , frankly .
i think it 's a sad comment on the state of the race and state of our politics that the clinton campaign is taking this particular tact . :: let me tackle this one more time , though .
they say very specifically that if you 're going to talk about the value of words , this is a quote , the words ought to be your own .
in fact we have some video .
senator clinton came back on the press plane , you can see her there in a casual gathering .
she , her self - this said .
if your whole candidacy is about words , they should be your own words .
is that fair ?
is n't that fair ? :: no , i do n't think that 's fair .
first of all , barack obama 's candidacy is not only about words , it 's about really great ideas .
it 's about a record of legislative and community activism .
about bringing change and being an agent of change .
and the dimension of being able to articulate what that vision is and motivate people to reach for it is an added dimension .
so , sure , the competitor candidate is going to try to trivialize that .
i do n't and i don think most voters do .
nobody 's great policies by the way end up on the sides of monuments or buildings in washington .
it is those words , ability to inspire .
i think that is a tremendous power of barack obama .
i'm neither surprised nor troubled that he used the words that i asked him to use of my own . :: governor patrick , thanks for being with us . :: thank you , diane .
You ’ve probably heard about Ruby on Rails by now .
Your developer friends are raving about it , talking about how they wrote an application in less than half the time it would have taken using some other technology , how they really enjoyed themselves instead of stressing out , and then spent their extra time on the beach .
Rails sure does sound like a pretty compelling technology .
But what is it , and how does it fit into the big picture of web development ?
Article Continues Below
If you ’re a designer , user interface architect , writer , or a software developer not yet acquainted with Rails , you might be wondering what this technology is all about .
Can it really cut through the headaches so often associated with web application development ?
Can it turn you , the mild - mannered non-developer , into a web application programmer overnight ?
Is Rails really the be-all and end - all development platform ?
What the heck are Subversion and Git ?
Do I need to learn all of this just to do design for Rails ?
In this article , I ’ll help prepare you for your first foray into Rails by explaining what it is , how it works , and where it fits into the spectrum of web development and design .
I ’ll address the issues above and more , with answers geared toward non-Rails developers , designers , and other creative professionals .
This article is n’t a Rails programming tutorial .
We wo n’t be writing code here , but I will introduce you to some of the important concepts critical to understanding how the Rails framework functions .
I ’ll also explain what you ’ll need to know to work with Rails developers and integrate your XHTML and CSS into Rails projects .
I ’ll focus on the topics and issues that I ’ve learned are most important for creative people instead of boring you with gruesome technical details .
Yes , you ’ll have to learn what terms like “ MVC ” mean , for example , but only in the context of getting stuff done .
What is Rails , and why use it ?
#section2
David Heinemeier Hansson , a partner at 37signals , created Ruby on Rails .
As he built Basecamp , their flagship application , David extracted the application ’s underpinnings and created code that he could use and re-use for software he wanted to build down the road .
The framework he created proved to be extensible , expandable , and multi-purpose .
He decided to share it as open source software .
A small group of developers , now known as the Rails Core Team , formed and improved and expanded the framework .
After a good deal of effort , Ruby on Rails matured into a robust , solid software development platform .
Today , Rails has a strong community and great documentation , and is used by thousands of developers to power hundreds of websites , such as Twitter , Blinksale , and the very site you ’re reading now .
There ’s an even bigger list of sites over at Working with Rails .
Rails is designed to make building web applications simpler and easier .
Rails provides developers with a large , easily expandable set of building blocks they can use ( and re-use ) to create web applications .
Developers can use , integrate , and customize these components of code in any manner they choose to , to create the unique functionality they need for their application .
Building software this way really helps reduce the time it takes for developers to create and later maintain their applications .
It also helps to standardize the way applications get built , making it easier for many developers to collaborate and write more uniform code .
Web designers have time - tested CSS tricks to use as a starting point , web standards to adhere to , and Photoshop workflows they can rely on .
Like these tools , Rails provides standards , conventions , tools , and a foundation upon which developers can construct applications by writing customized code using pre-built Rails libraries .
Rails vs. PHP#section3
One of the questions people often ask about Rails is how it differs from PHP .
PHP is a general - purpose scripting language that can be embedded right into HTML pages , making it easy for developers to create dynamically generated web pages quickly and easily .
Many web designers and most web developers have used PHP in some capacity .
Because of its proliferation ( it ’s usually installed by default on most webhosts ) , PHP is often the go - to language for handling simple tasks like keeping your website ’s navigation current , randomizing images on a website , and even creating a simple content management system .
PHP is also useful for creating full - blown open source and commercial web applications such as WordPress , and HelpSpot , both PHP applications .
Technically speaking , we should n’t compare PHP , a programming language , to Rails , a web application framework .
Instead , we should compare PHP to the Ruby programming language upon which Rails was built .
Ruby was created in 1995 by Yukihiro “ Matz ” Matsumoto , and has slowly built a following , exploding in popularity and getting more mainstream attention in 2006 , in no small part because of the popularity of Rails .
At the time of this writing , Ruby ranks as the 9th most popular programming language in the world .
To quote the Ruby website , “ Ruby is a dynamic , open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity .
It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write . ”
This elegance and focus on simplicity makes Ruby a very approachable language for people new to programming , and offers a refreshing change of pace for seasoned developers .
Let ’s run through a quick example , just to get a “ feel ” for what we ’re talking about .
Let ’s say we want to count from 1 to 10 .
In PHP , the code might look like this :
for ( $i = 1 ; $ i <= 10 ; $ i++ ) { echo $ i ; }
If you ’re familiar with C , Java , or other C - like control structures , this is straightforward for you .
But if you ’re new to this , that might seem pretty intimidating .
Here ’s the same code in Ruby :
10. times do |i| puts i end
Ruby also has its own tricks and shortcuts that would make even a serious Perl hacker happy .
The following line does the very same thing as the examples above :
puts *( 1..10 )
This kind of flexibility and simplicity makes Ruby an approachable language for software developers and web designers of all levels .
While PHP is a web - friendly programming language , Rails is a web application framework written in Ruby ( and with access to all of Ruby ’s functionality to boot ) .
And because of the way Rails works , each application you build lives in the form of a project , with specific files and folders .
Unlike many PHP apps which often “ just work ” when uploaded to a webserver , Rails apps rely on their framework and a customized hosting infrastructure ( often called a “ stack ” ) .
As a result , Rails applications can be a bit more challenging to deploy .
Fortunately , a number of web hosting companies specialize in deploying , hosting , and managing Rails applications .
So how would you know when to use Rails and when to use PHP ?
There is n’t anything that one could do in Rails that they could n’t do in PHP ( or vice versa ) , so in the end it boils down to a matter of choice .
For me personally , I have a simple rule : if I ’m adding simple functionality ( such as rotating header images ) to an otherwise straightforward website , I ’ll often use PHP .
If I ’m building a web application , especially one with a database , I ’ll use Rails .
Again , both could do either , but I find the Rails framework is wonderful for the kind of web application development I like to do .
It should be noted that there are frameworks with goals similar to those of Ruby on Rails that are written in PHP , such as CakePHP and CodeIgniter .
Mythbusting Rails#section4
Before we delve a bit deeper into what Rails actually is , what it does , and how you ’ll probably use it , I want to dispel a few myths that non-developers often have about the framework .
This list actually comes from real questions that real , live people have asked me about Rails over the last few years .
Myth # 1 : Rails is a content management system#section5
I ’ve mentioned that Rails makes it super easy to build web applications quickly , that it has a ton of built - in functionality and pre-built components .
But what Rails actually gives you , the framework we ’re talking about , is code .
Rails is n’t a plug - and - play piece of software that you custom - tailor for specific applications , while just integrating some design along the way .
You can think of Rails as being an elaborate menu of code that developers can select from , modify , and extend to create a completely customized application .
Myth # 2 : Rails lets you build applications a billion times faster #section6
In a way , the excellent “ Rails makes it easy ” marketing campaign has actually hurt some independent Rails development shops .
Customers expect Rails applications to be rolled out in days regardless of their feature set .
In reality , Rails applications are n’t written for you automatically .
Rails saves developers time by letting them focus on specific application functionality instead of things like database interconnectivity .
It handles the heavy lifting required to build user interaction .
Developers can use this pre-built code , and spend more time making applications that are more reliable and easier to use .
Rails projects can still get quite complicated .
Rails developers must still write real ( and often complex ) code , interactions , and tests .
Rails makes development more fun and it eliminates much of the tedium involved in building web applications , but it does n’t build them for you .
Myth # 3 : You do n’t need to be a programmer to build Rails applications # section7
I hear that a lot , and of course it ’s false .
In reality , Rails developers do much more than assemble components .
Sure , they use Rails conventions and build atop a comprehensive platform , but they still write brand new , unique code .
It is true , however , that you might not need to be as experienced a developer to create a Rails application as you might need to be to build , for example , a PHP , Java , or Objective - C application .
This is due both to the simplicity of the Rails framework as well as the elegance and readability of the Ruby programming language , upon which Rails sits .
You still need to learn to write code .
Getting started #section8
Getting Rails up and running on your computer falls outside of the scope of this article .
Fortunately , the latest version of Mac OS X 10.5 ( Leopard ) comes with Rails pre-installed ( or you can build your own ) .
I ’ve written a tutorial for installing Rails on older versions of Mac OS X .
There ’s a One - Click Installer for Windows .
You can also download the source code or find additional resources on the Ruby on Rails website to help you get things going .
Rather than expect you to go through the paces of getting Rails installed for the first time , for now , I ’ve created a default Rails project that you can download and look at on any computer , regardless of whether you have Rails installed or not .
Grab the file and unzip it somewhere you can find it .
Note :
The folders and files you ’ll find in the archive are identical to those that Rails would have created for you if you ’d have run rails demo on the command line , followed by script / generate scaffold article body : string .
Again , these are commands you may never have to run , but Rails developers use them to help create the code they use in their projects .
Speaking of creating code , there are a few software development concepts you should know about , even as a designer , before you dive into Rails .
Understanding these concepts will help you understand the Rails layout , and make it easier for you to work within the framework itself .
Rails implements a software engineering technique called model - view - controller , commonly abbreviated as MVC .
This technique ( or pattern ) separates business
logic ( things like database interaction ) from the user interface , which we call the presentation logic .
This separation actually makes the life of the designer much easier , because unlike other web frameworks , the amount of Rails code a designer actually has to see and shuffle around is significantly reduced .
In Rails , each of these different pieces of the application are kept in different folders .
The business logic ( the models and the controllers ) are stored separately from the views .
What ’s important to understand here is that MVC means the XHTML and CSS you create is kept as separate as possible from the deeper levels of code .
Pure developers see less design , while designers wade through less code .
How to edit Rails files # section10
Rails stores its files as plain text , so you can choose any text editor to edit files in a Rails project .
I prefer a Mac OS X application called TextMate , which is ideally suited for working with Rails .
BBEdit , another Mac OS X application , also works well , as do most text editors on Windows .
Linux , too , has its share of capable text editors .
Some editors do a better job of displaying Rails code using syntax editing and color - coded highlighting , making the code pretty to look at .
Other editors do n’t recognize Ruby on Rails code at all .
Below is an example of code being edited in TextMate :
Example of Ruby on Rails Syntax
Pretty , eh ?
Textmate ( and BBEdit ) have the added advantage of being able to open and display entire project folders in their drawer , allowing you to quickly locate and edit a file .
Everything in the right place # section11
Rails projects are made up of lots and lots of folders and files , most of which Rails generates during the initial creation of the application .
If you ’re used to dealing with smaller projects , this may at first seem like a somewhat daunting amount of content .
Using folders in this fashion makes it easier to separate the models , controllers , and views .
And just about all of the files that non-developers will need to be concerned with will live in the same place in every Rails project , far from the deeper code that belongs to the business logic layer .
Let ’s take a look at the files and folders Rails created .
Example of default Ruby on Rails folder structure .
These files and folders will be pretty much the same no matter which Rails application you ’re working with .
Even very large , feature - rich , complicated Rails applications will have this identical layout .
And even better , your files and presentation logic will always go in the very same place .
It ’s actually safe for you to ignore most of what you see here for now .
The folders that are important for you to pay attention to are the app / views , app / layouts , public / images , and public / stylesheets folders , highlighted below .
Example of folder structure .
Embedding Rails code in HTML#section12
Typically , when you work with Rails developers , you ’ll comp a design and they ’ll insert the Rails code into it .
But on occasion , it ’ll work the other way around , the Rails developers will already have a basic set of files and you ’ll need to “ design around ” their code .
If you ’re familiar with the way that templates work in blogging software such as Movable Type or WordPress , you ’re already somewhat familiar with the way that layouts and views work within Rails .
Rails allows developers to separate an application ’s functionality into groups of related view pages .
If we ’re developing different ways to create , edit , and display an article for a web magazine , Rails will want us to put those views into a folder named articles in the app / views folder .
The template files that contain the HTML that users will actually see do n’t end in .html like regular HTML files .
Instead , they have special file extensions : .html.erb .
The addition of the .erb tells Rails that these files contain embedded Ruby code , and will use Ruby ’s template technology .
This technology allows Rails developers to embed Ruby on Rails code right into any template file very easily .
Take a look at the apps / views / articles/edit.html.erb file :
Example of Ruby code embedded into an HTML template .
You may notice a few tags that you would n’t normally see in an HTML file .
These special tags tell Rails where to look for embedded code .
When Rails sees them , it executes the code inside of those tags and outputs the result right into the user ’s web browser as it renders the page .
The <%= and < % tags indicate the beginning of the Rails or Ruby code , while the %> tag indicates the closure of both tags .
As a non-programmer , it ’s safe for you to put your HTML around and inside of these tags , but be careful to keep what ’s inside of the tags intact .
You can , however , move this block of code wherever you might like within your HTML , or edit the HTML inside and around this block as needed .
For example , you could change the snippet above to look like the example below without affecting any of the Rails code :
Ruby is versatile : it can be moved in and out of existing HTML with little effort .
While you may have completely changed how the page displays , the functionality remains intact .
In Rails , there is a primary template , a file usually found in app / views / layouts/application.html.erb .
This file contains the “ wrapper ” of XHTML that surrounds the content the application displays to users .
If you open that file now , you ’ll see exactly what I ’m talking about .
In many blogging systems , designers are used to “ cutting up ” their designs , separating things like the header , footer , and sidebar into different files .
While Rails supports this , the usual pattern is to put those elements right into the application .
html.erb file and use Rails to stream the content into place .
If you wanted to customize the design of a Rails website , this is the place you ’d start .
And you ’re free to customize as much as you like , just keep your eye on the special line that looks like this :
< %= yield %>
That ’s the special bit of Rails code that says “ put the content for this page here . ”
The location of this single line determines where the main content for each page appears .
Rails developers have techniques to vary the content that appears in different areas of the main template , such as a page ’s title , different stylesheets to include , or variable sidebar content .
If you recall the discussion on Model / View / Controller above , you ’ll remember that our primary focus will be on working with views .
Each general area of functionality within a Rails application will have its own folder within the views folder .
For example , if we were working on the designs for a web magazine like the one you ’re reading now , there would be special views dedicated to displaying articles , and those views would always live in the app / views / articles folder .
While it ’s true that not every Rails application will have articles , Rails specifies that each area of the website , articles , comments , issues , invoices , etc. , will each get its own folder within the views folder .
It ’s part of the Rails pattern .
The public folder # section13
Unlike the rest of the files in a Rails application , everything within the public folder is visible to the outside world .
Within the public folder are two folders you ’ll want to pay special attention to : images and stylesheets .
While there ’s no hard rule that says your images and stylesheets must live in these locations , putting them there is a boon to Rails developers , who can then easily call them from within their code as needed .
Source control#section14
Anybody who creates files that change over time will , at some point , probably need help to keep track of how the files change , and will naturally want to keep a backup of those changes .
This is even more important when you ’re sharing project and code files with other people who will also make changes to them .
Fortunately there ’s special software , usually referred to as source control or revision management software , to help us manage this process .
The system used most commonly with Rails projects is called Subversion ( also known as SVN ) .
Subversion is a free , open - source solution available for most platforms .
It remembers every change ever made to the files and directories in your projects .
This allows you to recover older versions of your data , or examine the history of how your data changed .
Source control systems replace the “ change a file and FTP it to the server ” method of updating files , creating instead a consistent way to make your changes available to everybody on your team simultaneously , and keep everything up to date and integrated in one step .
Git , an alternative source control system , has gained in popularity recently , so much so that the Rails Core Team is actually using it to manage the code for Rails itself .
Although the process and commands you ’ll use to manage the changes you make vary somewhat between different source control systems , the concept is similar regardless of the technology being used .
And although it may seem somewhat cryptic once you actually start using it , the benefits of using a source control system to manage a Rails project easily outweigh the learning curve .
Instructions for managing projects using Subversion and Git fall outside the scope of this article and often vary based on the system used as well as by the team using it .
But it ’s important to know that you will probably be expected to use this kind of system , and that it will likely involve either typing commands at the command line or using a new source control management application to do the kinds of things you used to do without any additional complications .
Next steps#section15
If you ’re interested in learning more about Ruby on Rails , there are lots of places to start .
An excellent way to learn Rails is to watch some of the excellent Rails screencasts .
There ’s lots of great Rails documentation available as well , with some good starting points on the Ruby on Rails documentation page .
You can learn everything you ever wanted to know about Subversion and source control management by reading the ( free ) online version of Version Control with Subversion .
There are also many , many wonderful blogs , podcasts , articles , tutorials , and screencasts with a focus on learning Rails available online .
Just check out this list on Google if you want a good place to start .
I hope that this gentle introduction to Rails answers a few questions and perhaps dispels a few of the myths surrounding Rails .
And while Rails is a great platform , it still needs more people like you , designers , interface architects , and writers , to help guide and direct its future .
It ’s a young enough platform that people with your experience can really help determine what it evolves into both now and in years to come .
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russians visiting a health resort received a rude shock when a nurse used hydrogen peroxide instead of water to give them enemas .
Itar - Tass news agency reported Thursday that 17 tourists in the Caucasus spa town of Yessentuki had to be treated in hospital after the mix -up .
Sources at the sanatorium said the mistake was explained by water and hydrogen peroxide looking the same .
Hydrogen peroxide , which can be used to bleach hair , is used as a disinfectant but should not be ingested .
How does blogging make you money ?
It was asked time and time again how anyone can earn money from blogging .
In this post , I will discuss how you can start earning money from your blog .
First step is to determine the topics that you want to discuss in your blog .
Many have advised that you conduct keyword research and competition before you decide the topic(s ) of your blog .
My recommendation , especially for beginners , is do n't over analyze .
Go for topics that interest you regardless of the earning potential and competition .
For bloggers starting out , the critical thing at this point is you keep the momentum of filling your blog with quality contents .
You have to blog regularly and consistently .
If you can't do this , no matter what market you are in , no matter what earning potential you may have for this market , you will fail eventually .
Once you gain some experience in blogging , you may want to explore blogging about other topics outside your comfort zone .
Of course , you need to create another blog for this .
When you are ready , you can research for profitable niches and competition .
The niche research is another topic in itself and it will be contained in one of my future posts .
I will just tell you the one single most important factor in researching niches .
The niche that you should go into is something that has good - to - high demand but few - to - medium number of competition .
You do n't want to get into a niche that is fiercely competitive .
Be realistic and give yourself achievable targets .
An example of a niche blog is Website Design - CRM Blog .
I regularly contribute to this blog .
2nd step is to decide where you want to blog .
Contrary to what others believe , blogging can be done freely .
The only investment you have to make is your time .
There are many blogging platforms that allow you to create your blog .
Some of these are blogger.com , wordpress.com , flaney.com ( another real estate blogging site ) and of course , activerain.com .
If you are in the real estate niche , the best bet for you is to blog in flaney.com and activerain.com .
Not only you have a niche topic to blog but also your blog will be read by the people you are targeting .
3rd step is to create your actual blog posts .
Do your posting over time .
You do n't want to have a 1000 - article blog in one week .
The key here is to gradually post so the Search Engines will not think that you are spamming them .
During the first month , you could blog every other day .
After the first month , once a week is fine .
As long as you continuously churn out relevant and original contents , you will be fine .
Do n't also be too conscious about your writing styles .
Many have advised about keyword density , frequency and relevancy .
I tell you to keep your blog as reader - friendly as possible .
Keep it natural and conversational and your natural rankings in the search engines will improve and as a result you will get high quality traffic .
4th step is for you to get traffic .
To get your targeted traffic or visitors , you need to promote your site .
Go to forums and in your forum signature , include the URL of your blog .
Participate in other like - minded blogs by commenting on relevant posts .
Submit your blog to blog directories , RSS directories .
Submit articles to article directories referencing back your blog URL .
You may also would like to try social media marketing like posting to Digg or bookmarking your site to Onlywire.com .
If you have the budget , you may also explore PPC advertising .
Make your presence in a wide variety of sites like squidoo , hubpages , friendster , facebook , etc .
Getting traffic and promoting your blog is an activity that will last the lifetime of your blog .
You can never stop doing this .
It is going to be the lifeblood where your blog will depend on .
The last step is monetize your blog .
You will observe that there is no point in monetizing your blog if you have n't done the first 4 steps .
That is why , I was advising that your blog should be something that interests you .
Otherwise , you may not reach this step at all if you can't give yourself enough motivation to write consistently about a topic you are not interested in .
There are various ways to monetize a blog .
You can do adsense , amazon.com or affiliate marketing .
If you have a product or service that is related to your topic of interest , you could sell that on your blog .
To answer the title of this article , if blogging can make you money , the simple answer is yes , it does .
It is making many people money in the long term .
Do n't expect to be rich in a month 's time blogging .
It will take months and months of religiously following a blogging routine before you realize its profit potential .
When you decide to travel the long road to blogging , make sure that you enjoy the side trips and the scenery along the way .
Do n't focus too much on its earning potential .
As long as you write informative blog posts that your readers will enjoy , you will soon realize money will come in the end .

Bill Moyers interviews former Rep. Mickey Edwards , author of Reclaiming Conservatism : How A Great American Political Movement Got Lost - And How It Can Find Its Way Back , and Matt Welch , author of McCain : The Myth Of A Maverick on what is essentially the bastardization of what the Republican Party has stood for historically .
MICKEY EDWARDS : ...( W ) hile I was in the House , Newt Gingrich sort of rose in power .
And Newt decided that the purpose of the Republican in Congress was not to carry out the fundamental principles that they had originally believed in , but to defeat Democrats .
That was all that mattered .
And it became how do — it 's always war Democrats versus Republicans , all the time .
And when you look at it from that mindset , you have a Republican president — you know , he is not any more the head of a different branch of government .
He 's your team captain .
He 's your quarterback .
And so , Gingrich really created a system of nonstop warfare that went well beyond , you know , what the situation was with Nixon .
And institutionalized it to an extent that today , when the Congress properly issues — tries to vote a contempt citation against two people on the White House staff , Harriet Myers and Josh Bolton , you know , who defy a Congressional subpoena , and Republicans in Congress walk out in protest , rather than engage in defending the branch of government that they 're a part of .
So , I put a lot of the blame right on Newt Gingrich .
I think he led to a lot of this .
And as Matt Welch points out , despite McCain 's Maverick image , he 's marching right along in lockstep with Gingrich :
Ever since then , restoring the power of the executive has been a fundamental part of modern Republicanism , which went totally against their traditions .
And as part of that , John McCain actually one of the only philosophies that he elucidates in his book , his five books that he 's written , is to restore executive power at the expense of Congress , especially when it comes to foreign policy and the making of war .
It is basically the only interest that he shows in political philosophy in his books .
But the country has seen the incredible damage done by these kind of philosophies over the last seven years .
I think author Sarah Vowell once said that the only thing that surprised her was that her own deep pessimism turned out to be too rosy for reality .
EDWARDS : But I think that he 's making a serious mistake in terms of how he frames his persona for the general election .
I do n't think this country is ready for a continuation of Bush .
And I do n't think it 's ready for a Hagee approved , Hagee - endorsed presidency .
And why he 's doing that , I do n't know .
Well , if this is a losing strategy , by all means , let 's hope McCain keeps it up .

Israel wants Palestinian attacks on Israelis also to be investigated Israel has said it will not allow a UN official appointed to investigate Israeli human rights abuses to enter the country or Palestinian territories .
It said it made the decision after Richard Falk told the BBC he stood by comments he made comparing Israel 's actions in Gaza to those of the Nazis .
Mr Falk is due to take up his post with the UN Human Rights Council in May .
The foreign ministry said it would deny Mr Falk a visa at least until a council meeting in September .
Collective punishment Foreign ministry spokesman Arye Mekel told the BBC that people in Israel were dismayed by Mr Falk 's comments .
Mr Falk has been employed by the UN to investigate Israeli conduct in the occupied territories , but Israel wants his mandate changed to include Palestinian actions as well .
Mr Mekel said Israel would request the change of mandate at the September meeting , and " only then will we consider whether to let the rapporteur come here or not " .
Speaking to the BBC on Tuesday , Mr Falk said he stood by his comments , made last summer .
He said he drew the comparison between the treatment of Palestinians with the Nazi record of collective atrocity because of what he described as the massive Israeli punishment directed at the entire population of Gaza .
He understood that it was a provocative thing to say but he had made the comments , he said , to shake the American public from its torpor .

What are these ?

I sat through about four hours of today ’s legislative district caucus in Seattle ’s 43rd District .
I wish I could bring you pictures of the yawns , the shouts , and the American Idol style campaigning for those coveted spots as a state convention delegate but the Stranger camera that I grabbed turned out to be suffering from some sort of paralysis .
Sorry .
However , now that I ’m home I can at least bring you an i-sight image of a small flier that was getting wide circulation at the caucus .
Watch out , Ron and Maria .
The Obama campaign may be telling its supporters not to do things like this , but it does n’t look like its supporters are listening .
But let ’s begin at the beginning of this event , with the invocation by a well - regarded north end Buddhist ; the laughs that drowned out any cheers when the few die - hard Kucinich supporters in attendance were recognized ; and Rep. Frank Chopp ’s observation ( intended as a rallying cry ? ) that the crowd of well over 1,000 people was about ten times as large as Gov. Christine Gregoire ’s margin of victory in 2004 .
This legislative district caucus meeting was held at Lincoln High School in Wallingford , and when I showed up the gymnasium was overflowing with precinct delegates who had been elected at their precinct caucuses on Feb .
9 and with what seemed to be an even larger number of wannabe alternate delegates .
So much for the idea that all those young , energized , newly - involved Democrats would n’t show up for the next step in this process .
After registration was done , the actual , non-alternate delegates listened to speeches delivered from a half - darkened stage in a nearby auditorium .
( How many Democrats does it take to turn on a spotlight ?
Apparently more than the 1,000 + in the auditorium , because the spotlight never came on . )
There was a portion of the program devoted to surrogate speeches , and Obama ’s surrogate , Sen .
Ed Murray , stood at the rear of the stage ( where the lights were actually on ) and pronounced : “ I have been coming to these meetings since the mid-1980s and I have never seen anything like today . ”
The numbers were a very good sign , he said .
Hillary Clinton ’s surrogate ?
He was very , very late , causing a lot of grumbling from the crowd , which was overwhelmingly pro-Obama .
While everyone waited for the Clinton surrogate to appear and give his speech , Congressman Jim McDermott showed up and lumbered toward the stage .
Before mounting the steps he turned back to take in the crowd and snap a digital picture for himself .
In his remarks he too praised the turnout , saying : “ It makes me think we ’re going to win in November . ”
But then he added , ominously , that Republicans are determined to play the fear card .
“ They ’re looking for ways to have bomber strikes on Iran , ” he said .
“ They ’re looking for some little excuse . ”
The audience loved every word of it , giving McDermott the lefty hero treatment even though he remained neutral on the issue of the day , the question of who the Democratic nominee should be .
“ Both of them are good candidates , ” he said .
When Clinton ’s surrogate finally showed up he was …
Sean Astin ???
Yes , the man who played Samwise Gangee in Lord of the Rings had flown up to rally the Hillary Clinton troops .
Which made very little sense , given that the type of people who show up for legislative district caucuses on a Saturday do n’t really need a celebrity ( or semi- celebrity ) to motivate them to take political action .
Astin ’s speech was most memorable for this line : “ Should Obama get the nomination I will become a massive Barack Hussein Obama supporter . ”
Hussein ?
Eyebrows shot up .
Brows furrowed .
Heads turned .
A friend in the audience texted me : “ Hussein ! ? ” I ’m not sure what Astin was up to with that line , but someone probably should have told him that Seattle ’s 43rd District is the last place in the U.S. where subliminal messaging around Obama ’s middle name is likely to move Democrats toward Clinton .
Further proof of this :
There was some time to kill as multiple tallies of the delegates and alternates were done , and when the time - killer of taking audience questions had run its course and the idea of teling jokes had been nixed , someone suggested doing the Pledge of Allegiance to pass the time .
( Are you listening , right - wing bloggers ?
This is going to get good . )
At the mere mention of doing the pledge there were groans and boos .
Then , when the district chair put the idea of doing the Pledge of Allegiance up to a vote , it was overwhelmingly voted down .
One might more accurately say the idea of pledging allegiance to the flag ( of which there was only one in the room , by the way , on some delegate ’s hat ) was shouted down .
There were to be 67 delegates to the state convention apportioned at this legislative district caucus : 14 for Clinton and 53 for Obama .
I did n’t stay until the bitter end to find out who among each of the candidates ’ precinct delegates was voted on to the next level , but I will tell you that The Stranger ’s Annie Wagner seemed to be a strong contender , based on the cheers of recognition she got from the ( apparently Slog- reading ) Obama crowd as she was giving her 30 - second speech .
I think I might have been sleeping when screencasts became so popular , because it seems that every site is now pushing their screencasts on you …
More recently , I ’m seeing pieces of software where the ONLY documentation is a screencast .
So why ca n’t you use screencasts as documentation ?
It ’s not actually faster for you : A good screencast requires you to read from a pre-written script so that you do n’t mumble and use “ um ” a lot .
So you have to write it out , THEN make the screencast .
You are not James Earl Jones .
You ca n’t afford James Earl Jones .
I had to do voice overs for a class in college and I realized that voice talent costs lots of money for a reason …
Text can be read on any arbitrary device ( iPhone , Motorola Q , laptop with no headphones in a crowded room ) whereas a screencast requires a fully functional browser and either headphones or a quiet room .
I can read your documentation faster than a 60 second screencast .
A deaf person is n’t going to be able to get any benefit out of your screencast .
Until web - based screencasts have easily accessible “ chapters ” , it ’s going to be faster for me to find a specific piece of information a second time if it ’s text .
Audio data has no “ search ” command .
I know I ’m not alone in this … if for no other reason than the audiobook section in every bookstore I ’ve ever been in is smaller than the book section .
So , please .
Do n’t rely on a screencast .
It ’s like trying to rely on balloon help or a “ tip of the day ” .
Remember balloon help and tips of the day ?
What would you do if you learned that Bush Administration officials wanted to round up thousands of Americans and throw them into concentration camps ?
For all we know , there is no slippery slope .
It 's entirely possible that extraordinary rendition , eliminating habeas corpus , and the torture camps at Guantánamo and elsewhere are exactly what the government says they are -- tools for fighting terrorists , not domestic political opponents .
But how likely is it ?
History is clear : Over and over again , the U.S. government places fascists in powerful positions .
Once in office , they exploit wars and national tragedies to roll back hard - won freedoms .
They 're Democrats as well as Republicans .
As has happened with increasing frequency in recent years , another blockbuster story revealing the anti-democratic impulse within the top echelon of the U.S. government has appeared and vanished overnight .
According to Cold War -era files declassified last week , FBI director J. Edgar Hoover repeatedly advised President Harry Truman to arrest " all individuals potentially dangerous " to national security , jail them in military prisons and try them before kangaroo tribunals that " will not be bound by the rules of evidence . "
" For a long period of time the FBI has been accumulating the names , identities and activities of individuals found to be potentially dangerous to the internal security through investigation , " Hoover wrote in a 1950 memo .
" These names have been compiled in an index , which index has been kept up to date . "
Capitalizing on anti-communist hysteria at the start of the Korean War , Hoover asked Truman to preemptively detain 12,000 people , 97 percent of them American citizens , in order to " protect the country against treason , espionage and sabotage . "
Hoover was a lunatic .
Truman ought to have fired him on the spot .
Instead , in September 1950 Congress took his advice and passed a law authorizing the detention of " dangerous radicals " if the president declared a national emergency .
Truman signed it .
In fact , he declared such an emergency three months later .
No one knows why , but the president never actually followed through with mass arrests .
Hoover 's " subversives " -- people suspected of left - wing political sympathies -- remained free .
He was wrong .
There were no acts of sabotage .
It was n't the first time the government went " crazy . "
Between 1919 and 1921 the Bureau of Investigation ( predecessor of the FBI ) carried out the Palmer Raids , named for Alexander Palmer , Woodrow Wilson 's attorney general .
The BOI rounded up 10,000 lefties , anarchists and foreigners on a list compiled by a young J. Edgar Hoover , then in charge of the Justice Department 's General Intelligence Division .
Many were tortured .
Five hundred fifty were deported .
Palmer 's clampdown accomplished nothing .
On September 16 , 1920 , a bomb attributed to anarchists went off on Wall Street , killing 38 people and wounding over 400 .
Crazy ... like a fox .
During the 1960s and 1970s the CIA - - in violation of its charter , which limits the agency to acting overseas -- cooperated with local police departments across the country to compile a list of 300,000 Americans and organizations suspected of opposing the Vietnam War .
On April 6 , 1984 , President Ronald Reagan signed National Security Decision Directive No. 52 .
Reagan targeted 400,000 people for arrest and confinement at concentration camps in mothballed Army bases .
The National Security Council 's " secret government within a government , " as Congressional investigators later described it , planned to cancel the 1984 presidential election so Reagan could remain in office indefinitely .
" Lt. Col .
Oliver North , for example , helped draw up a controversial plan to suspend the Constitution in the event of a national crisis , such as nuclear war , violent and widespread internal dissent or national opposition to a U.S. military invasion abroad , " The Miami Herald reported on July 5 , 1987 .
People who hate The People never sleep .
In 2006 Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act , which overturns the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which prohibited the use of combat troops on the soil of the United States .
For the first time in 128 years , the president can declare martial law in case of a hurricane , riot or terrorist attack .
In May 2007 Bush attached a National Security Presidential and Homeland Directive to the National Defense Authorization Act .
In case of a " national emergency " -- the president could declare it without consulting anyone -- he could suspend the Constitution and appoint an unelected provisional government under a " national continuity coordinator . "
To an optimist , America 's brushes with fascism seem like comforting evidence that the system works .
Despite it all , even taking into account grotesqueries such as the concentration camps for Japanese - Americans during World War II , the First Amendment remains in force .
Few Americans feel threatened by government tyranny .
Few worry about getting shot by trigger - happy soldiers or being detained in concentration camps ( unless they 're flood victims in New Orleans ) .
So why does a democracy need fascist schemes like Reagan 's Rex - 84 Alpha Explan ( a FEMA plan to put American protesters against a planned war against Nicaragua into camps ) ?
Because American democracy is an iron fist in a velvet glove , a glove that 's becoming increasingly transparent .
Threats of repression are rarely carried out .
They do n't need to be .
If potential opponents are afraid , there 's little need for concentration camps .
The threat of repression ( and actual crackdowns , explained away as exceptional excesses and brushed off with a token apology ) creates a chilling effect on people who might pick up a rock instead of a sign .
A dog does n't have to bite everyone every day to earn a fearsome reputation .
Mount cameras all over the place , and you do n't need to have anyone actually watching on the other side .
In a country whose legal framework authorizes the government to kidnap , torture and murder them , opponents of U.S. policy must decide whether getting out of line -- anything from a letter to the editor to direct action -- is worth the risk of getting kidnapped , tortured and murdered .

Most discussions about the rising cost of health care emphasize the need to get more people insured .
The assumption seems to be that insurance – rather than the service delivered by doctor to patient – is the important commodity .
But perhaps the solution to much of what currently plagues us in health care – rising costs and bureaucracy , diminishing levels of service – rests on a radically different approach : fewer people insured .

On Friday , at a United Nations meeting in Geneva , the United States broke a series of legal promises .
Keeping those promises would have proved extremely embarrassing to the United States government by pointing out that human rights abuses are being committed here at home and at US military installations abroad .
In 1994 , the United States Senate ratified the International Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination Against Women , promising to provide reports every two years on racial discrimination in the United States .
The reports were to include anywhere in the world where the US military is in charge .
In other words , the United States military , no matter where it was on the globe , agreed to report discrimination .
That now includes Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib .
The treaty is the “ supreme law of the land ” under the US Constitution , article 6 , clause 2 .
Every nation that signed the treaty ( one hundred seventy - seven ) was charged with giving a national report on such basic areas of discrimination as health care , education and prison terms .
According to the Meiklejohn Civil Liberties Institute and the National Lawyer ’s Guild , the United States on Friday presented a “ Shadow ” report to the United Nations Committee , never mentioning Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo or the behavior of US corporations working under US military contracts .
Instead , US officials presented facts on the federal level explaining ( for instance ) how much money was given to education , how much money was supplied to prisons , etc .
Only four states : Oregon , Illinois , New Mexico and South Carolina , were mentioned , and officials in those states who were contacted by local activists say they never received any phone calls of inquiry by government officials .

As Boston police prepare to go into some of the city 's most dangerous neighborhoods , knock on doors of private houses , and ask if they can search for illegal guns without a warrant , officials are trying to pitch the idea of the plan as friendly cooperation to residents who still see it as a threatening intrusion .
A friendly looking logo - a drawing of a house surrounded by the sun - adorns the brochure police have drafted to explain and promote the initiative , " Safe Homes . "
Photos of officers playing baseball with children and chatting with teenagers dot the pamphlet .
Twice , police have taken calls from listeners on a black radio station in Roxbury .
By the time they start going door to door next month , police hope they will have reassured clergy , neighborhood leaders , and parents who still see the program as a way to violate the privacy of residents in neighborhoods with a large population of minority - group members and and immigrants .
" There is a big trust issue , " said Deputy Superintendent Gary French , who will oversee the Safe Homes program .
" I think a lot of people think there 's going to be some kind of behind - the - scenes hook to this , and there really is n't .
The reality of it is it 's strictly a program aimed at getting guns out of the hands of juveniles . "
Police plan to search for weapons in four Dorchester and Roxbury neighborhoods by late February or early March .
Relying on the tips from schools , community organizations , and parents , they will look in the rooms of any children whose parents or guardians give consent to the search , French said .
( The program does not apply to anyone over 18 , because they are legally adults and parents can no longer give consent to a search of their rooms . )
Ten officers and a sergeant assigned to the city 's schools have been trained to conduct the searches .
Most of them speak a second tongue , Spanish or Cape Verdean Creole .
To further put residents at ease , officers will wear civilian clothes and try to look like office workers on casual Friday rather than FBI agents , French said .
" They wo n't go in there in a three - piece suit . "
Since announcing the initiative in November , police have held several community meetings about the program and developed an advisory council of religious and community leaders .
They suggested that the brochures make clear that residents do not have to consent to the search , and they urged that ministers or social workers accompany police during searches , French said .
Some clergy members have apparently volunteered to accompany police on the searches because they are suspicious of their intent .
" My belief is there are ministers that will do it as part of their ministry because they want to make sure police do n't overstep their boundaries , " said the Rev. David Wright , executive director of the Black Ministerial Alliance , whose board has not decided whether to endorse the program .
" And I think that 's a valid point . "
The earthquake caused damage to many homes
People in Newcastle , Yorkshire , London , Cumbria , the Midlands , Norfolk and also parts of Wales , felt the tremor just before 0100 GMT .
A man suffered a broken pelvis when a chimney collapsed in South Yorkshire .
The British Geological Survey ( BGS ) said the epicentre of the 5.2 magnitude quake was near Market Rasen in Lincolnshire .
Davie Galloway , seismologist for the BGS , said people had reported feeling the tremor from as far as Bangor in Northern Ireland to the west , Haarlem in Holland to the east , Plymouth to the south and Edinburgh to the north .
Student David Bates , 19 , suffered a broken pelvis when he was pinned under masonry in his attic bedroom in Barnsley Road , Wombwell , South Yorks .

His son was taken to hospital and was due to undergo surgery later .
Bev Finnegan , who lives in Market Rasen , Lincolnshire , said : " I was terrified to be honest .
The noise was really , really terrifying ... it was so deep and rumbling .
" It felt like the roof was going to fall in .
There were people coming out in their dressing gowns wondering what it was .
It was quite an experience . "
A Lincolnshire police spokeswoman said the force had received dozens of calls from residents but there were no reports of anyone in the county being injured .
" There is slight structural damage , cracks and a couple of chimneys damaged .
There 's nothing serious at present , " she said .
" Mostly people were distressed by it so there were a large quantity of calls coming in . "
Speaking from Gainsborough , Mike Thomas , chief fire officer for Lincolnshire , said crews had been called out to 50 incidents and one fire as a result of the quake .
And Justin Cowell , in Gainsborough , told BBC News that it " started as a massive shake " .
" People had come out into the street .
It seemed the whole town had woken up . "
Tom Edwards , from Heckington , Lincolnshire , said he heard a noise like " an underground train and an enormous roar " .
" I thought I was probably going to get killed . "

Dr Brian Baptie , of the BGS , said : " An earthquake of this size , of magnitude five or thereabouts , will occur roughly every 10 to 20 years in the UK .
" So we can get these kind of moderate to significant earthquakes of this size but they 're relatively rare . "
The BGS recorded an aftershock with a magnitude of 1.8 at about 0400 GMT .
The main 10 - second quake , which struck at 0056 GMT at a depth of 15.4 km ( 9.6 miles ) , was the biggest recorded example since one with a magnitude of 5.4 struck north Wales in 1984 .
Thousands of people from across England contacted the BBC to describe how their homes shook during the tremor .
Jemma Harrison , 22 , in Bury , Greater Manchester , said : " It was really bad .
I was fast asleep and woke up and the room was shaking and there was a loud bang and alarms were going off . "
Natasha Cavey , in Tipton in the West Midlands , said : " All my cupboard doors flew open and the whole house shook , it was unreal .
I can't believe it . "
David in Alrewas in Staffordshire said : " The birds were flying around like it was daylight .
" It was quite severe .
I experienced the Dudley one and this was more severe .
" I went outside to see if the roof had collapsed .
I could see the furniture in the room moving , it was like it was on a jelly mould . "
Dr Baptie said : " The largest earthquake that we know about that has struck the UK was about 100 km off the east coast of England on the Dogger Bank and it had a magnitude of 6.1 .
David Somerset , 41 , from Driffield near Beverley in East Yorkshire , said : " I have never felt one as strong as that one before .
I was in my sitting room and the grandfather clock was rattling rather violently .
Philip Norton , a BBC reporter for Look North in Hull , said : " Everything started wobbling .
" The windows were rattling and the blinds were visibly moving .
It sounded like the roof was coming in . "
BBC reporter Lynn Crombie in Norwich said she was " absolutely terrified " and thought somebody " had driven into the side of the house " .
" Then I thought somebody must have kicked the door in and everything continued to rattle inside the house , " she said .
Jamil Ali in Sheffield said : " I woke up and the first thing I thought was that there were a load of burglars in the house .
" The kids were screaming and so was my wife .
It was that violent you actually moved yourself . "
The West Midlands was hit by an earthquake in 2002 in the Dudley area that reached a magnitude of 5.0 and one measuring 4.3 hit Folkestone in Kent last year .

In Washington , Mr. Bush strongly defended Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki on Friday at what he called a “ defining moment ” for the Baghdad government , saying the United States supported the Iraqi offensive and would provide any military assistance that was sought .
“ It ’s still a dangerous , fragile situation in Iraq , ” Mr. Bush said when asked whether the renewed fighting might draw Americans in more deeply and disrupt plans to withdraw more American combat troops in the next few months .
He said his top military commanders and national security advisers , who briefed him on Iraq earlier in the week , are “ all aiming to make sure that we have enough of a presence to make sure that we ’re successful in Iraq . ”
In Basra , the conflict has put the city into a state of virtual siege , with electricity and drinkable water cut off in most neighborhoods .
Militiamen sabotaged a major oil pipeline in the city , according to a Western official .
And fighters in the Mahdi Army militia tried to raid the Central Bank , but were repulsed .
F - 18 fighter jets dropped cannon rounds on a militia stronghold and on a mortar team that was attacking Iraqi forces in Basra .
The airstrikes , one at 9 p.m. Thursday and a second after midnight , were made at the request of the Iraqi Army , said Maj .
Tom Holloway , a spokesman for the British Army .
Major Holloway said that British and American planes had been conducting surveillance runs over Basra since the fighting began to support the Iraqi military , but that this was the first time they had entered active fighting .
“ I think the point here is actually that the Iraqis are capable , they are strong and they have been engaging successfully , ” Major Holloway said .
A Western official said negotiations between Iraqi government leaders and militia leaders in Basra had begun even as gunmen clashed .
The official said that British and American aircraft were providing aerial support and that a small number of American ground troops had also entered Basra for the first time in years , mainly to monitor the performance of Iraqi forces .
The need to call in the American - led forces raised questions about the Iraqi Army ’s ability to wage a successful campaign on its own .
Witnesses have said that large parts of Basra  perhaps as much as 50 to 70 percent  are still controlled by Shiite militias .

National Security Study Memorandum 200 : World Population Growth And U.S. Security delineates the development and major findings of this important study .
Author Stephen D. Mumford reveals : “ In March , 1970 , the U.S. Congress created The Commission on Population Growth and the American Future , which completed its work in March 1972 .
Its final report offered more than 70 recommendations .
Collectively , they constituted a detailed blueprint for a superb national population policy . ”
And uncovers why this commission 's final report was ignored .
“ In the words of a Commission member , Congressman James Scheuer ( D.-NY ) : " The reasons were obvious -- the fear of attacks from the far right and from the Roman Catholic Church because of our positions on family planning and abortion .
With the benefit of hindsight , it is now clear that this obstruction was the first of many similar actions to come from high places . "
Then he goes on to describe the commissioning of the NSSM 200 study , its major findings and the Vatican ’s responsibility in the failure to implement the study ’s recommendations .
National Security Study Memorandum 200 : World Population Growth And U.S. Security by Stephen D. Mumford Stephen D. Mumford has his doctorate in Public Health .
He has decades of international experience in fertility research and has recently returned from Vietnam where he spent a month studying a new technique of female sterilization .
In 1981 he received the Margaret Mead Leadership Prize in Population and Ecology .
We must help break the link between spiraling population growth and poverty ....
Where they have been tried , family planning programs have largely worked .
.
Many pro-life advocates .. . contend that to condone abortion even implicitly is morally unconscionable .
Their view is morally shortsighted .
. .. if we provide funds for birth control . . . we will prevent the conception of millions of babies who would be doomed to the devastation of poverty in the underdeveloped world .
Richard M. Nixon Seize the Moment ( Simon & Schuster , 1992 ) President Nixon has recently reasserted his belief that overpopulation gravely threatens world peace and stability .
He ranks assistance in population growth as the most important effort the United States can undertake to promote peace and stability .
During his presidency he authorized the study that came to be known as NSSM 200 -- National Security Study Memorandum 200 .
In order to effectively examine the content and fate of NSSM 200 , we need to backtrack a bit to the Rockefeller Commission which was discussed in the Summer 1992 issue of this journal .
From his first days in office , President Nixon understood the grave dangers of high rates of population growth -- more than any other president .
He responded appropriately when he perceived that his people and their way of life were gravely threatened .
Seven months into his first term , in a rare move for a president , he delivered his Special Message to the Congress .
1
The message set forth a far - reaching commitment to limiting population growth .
It set in motion a broad range of government activities , both domestic and international .
It called for the creation of the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future to collect and analyze data that would make possible the formulation of a comprehensive United States population policy .
In March , 1970 , the U.S. Congress created The Commission on Population Growth and the American Future , which completed its work in March 1972 .
Its final report offered more than 70 recommendations .
Collectively , they constituted a detailed blueprint for a superb national population policy .
WHY WAS THE COMMISSION ’ S FINAL REPORT IGNORED ?
1972 was a presidential election year and President Nixon was facing a difficult reelection bid , so when a delegation of the Commission presented the Final Report to him on May 5 , 1972 , six months before election day , he sharply condemned the most important recommendations .
2
Why was he attempting to distance himself from the report ?
In the words of a Commission member , Congressman James Scheuer ( D.-NY ) : “ The reasons were obvious -- the fear of attacks from the far right and from the Roman Catholic Church because of our positions on family planning and abortion .
With the benefit of hindsight , it is now clear that this obstruction was the first of many similar actions to come from high places . ” 3
During the following two - year period , it became increasingly clear that there would be no response to the Commission ’s recommendations .
In May 1974 , a group of pioneer population activists acknowledged this inaction and asked Ambassador Adolph Schmidt to speak with his friend , Commission Chairman , John D. Rockefeller III .
They met in June , 1974 in New York City .
Schmidt noted his own disappointment and that of his colleagues because no program had been mounted as a result of the recommendations .
What had gone wrong ?
Rockefeller responded : “ The greatest difficulty has been the very active opposition by the Roman Catholic Church through its various agencies in the United States . ” 4 “ ... a definitive interagency study of the threat of overpopulation to U.S. security ... NSSM 200 details how and why world population growth threatens U.S. and global security .
” None of the Commission ’s 70 recommendations were ever implemented .
It is tragic that the American people have been kept in the dark about this bold opposition by the Vatican and other pronatalist groups .
Lay Catholic
Americans desire the same number of children as non-Catholic Americans , 5 use contraceptives6 and obtain abortions7 in the same proportions , support school - based population information and sex education8 for their children , and advocate a halt to illegal immigration9 into the U.S. in the same proportions .
No doubt , both Catholic and non-Catholic Americans would have strongly counter - balanced this bold obstruction of American policy had they been aware of it .
The quality of life for all of us has been significantly diminished by this change in policy , in substantial measure at the behest of pronatalist pressures from the Vatican .
PRESIDENT NIXON MAKES A BOLD MOVE Despite the intense opposition of the Catholic hierarchy he encountered in the wake of the Rockefeller Commission , President Nixon ’s assessment of the gravity of the overpopulation problem and his desire to deal with it remained unchanged .
On April 24 , 1974 , in an effort to contend with this crisis , in National Security Study Memorandum 200 ( NSSM 200 ) , Nixon directed that a study be undertaken to determine the “ Implications of World Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests .
" 10 Its findings would be momentous indeed .
I can only speculate , but the President must surely have been aware that this new document would meet with the same intense opposition from the Vatican and others as the earlier one .
However , perhaps he felt that a definitive study of the national and global security implications of overpopulation , revealing that the very security of the United States was seriously threatened , would generate public demand for action to curb growth .
That might serve to overcome the pressures being exerted by the opponents .
Why else would he have undertaken this study , given his painful experience after the Rockefeller Commission ?
NSSM 200
To implement NSSM 200 , National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger , acting for the President , directed the Secretaries of Defense and Agriculture , the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency , the Deputy Secretary of State and the Administrator of the Agency for International Development ( AID ) , to jointly undertake “ a study of the impact of world population growth on U.S. security and overseas interests . ”
This work was completed on December 10 , 1974 and circulated to the designated Secretaries and Agency heads for their review and comments .
Meanwhile , on August 9 , 1974 , Gerald Ford had succeeded to the presidency .
Revisions to the study continued until July , 1975 .
On November 26 , 1975 , the 227 - page report and its recommendations were endorsed by President Ford in National Security Decision Memorandum 314 : “ The President has reviewed the interagency response to NSSM 200 ... , ” wrote the new National Security Advisor , Brent Scowcroft .
“ He believes that United States leadership is essential to combat population growth , to implement the World Population Plan of Action and to advance United States security and overseas interests .
The President endorses the policy recommendations contained in the Executive Summary of the NSSM 200 response ... ”
President Ford , recognizing the gravity of the situation , assigned responsibility for further action to the National Security Council ( NSC ) : “ The President , therefore , assigns to the Chairman , NSC Undersecretaries Committee , the responsibility to define and develop policy in the population field and to coordinate its implementation beyond the NSSM 200 response . ”
NSSM 200 was intended to be and is a definitive interagency study of the threat of overpopulation to U.S. security .
NSSM 200 details how and why world population growth gravely threatens U.S. and global security .
It also provides a blueprint for the U.S. response to this burgeoning problem , reflecting the deep concern of those who produced the report .
Because of the bold nature of the suggested initiatives , the authors recommended that the report remain classified for 5 years in order to provide time to educate the American public as to the necessity of these initiatives .
The NSSM 200 report actually remained classified for 14 years .
Both the findings and the recommendations are as relevant in 1992 as they were in 1975 , but too numerous to list here in their entirety .
To mention a selected few : NSSM 200 reports :
There is a major risk of severe damage [ caused by continued rapid population growth ] to world economic , political , and ecological systems and , as these systems begin to fail , to our humanitarian values [ Executive Summary , page 10 ] .
The sense of near emergency is electric : ... world population growth is widely recognized within the government as a current danger of the highest magnitude calling for urgent measures [ Page 194 ] .
... it is of the utmost urgency that governments now recognize the facts and implications of population growth , determine the ultimate population sizes that make sense for their countries and start vigorous programs at once to achieve their desired goals [ Page 15 ] .
The threat to security briefly summarized ,
... population factors are indeed critical in , and often determinants of , violent conflict in developing areas .
Segmental ( religious , social , racial ) differences , migration , rapid population growth , differential levels of knowledge and skills , rural / urban differences , population pressure and the spatial location of population in relation to resources - in this rough order of importance -- all appear to be important contributions to conflict and violence ...
Clearly , conflicts which are regarded in primarily political terms often have demographic roots .
Recognition of these relationships appears crucial to any under standing or prevention of such hostilities [ Page 66 ] .
The report gives three examples of population wars : the El Salvador - Honduras “ Soccer War , ” the Nigerian Civil War , and the Pakistan - India - Bangladesh War , 1970 - 7 1 .
( With hindsight , we can see that the two - decade - long civil war in Lebanon is another classic example , and that the civil wars in The Sudan , Somalia and other countries on the African continent are realizations of the projections made in NSSM 200 .
South Africa is on the brink .
War between Israel and Arab countries fueled by population growth is all but inevitable . )
Where population size is greater than available resources , or is expanding more rapidly than the available resources , there is a tendency toward internal disorders and violence and , sometimes , disruptive international policies or violence [ Page 69 ] .
( This was a vital element , surely , in the 1991 U.S. - Iraq War , much more costly than decades of successful worldwide population growth control . )
In developing countries , the burden of population factors , added to others , will weaken unstable governments , often only marginally effective in good times , and open the way to extremist regimes [ Page 84 ] .
( The Sudan is a vivid recent example . )
The depth of concern for this ominous and progressive threat to national security is reflected in the objectives and goals outlined in the report :
The World Population Plan of Action and the resolutions adopted by consensus of the 137 nations at the August 1974 U.N. World Population Conference , though not ideal , provide an excellent framework for developing a worldwide system of population / family planning programs [ Executive Summary , page 19 ] .
At the UN World Population Conference , only the Vatican opposed the Plan : . . . the Conference adopted by acclamation ( only the Holy See stating a general reservation ) a complete World Population Plan of Action [ Page 87 ] .
SUGGESTED GOALS AND MEANS
Our objective should be to assure that developing countries make family planning information , education and means available to all their peoples by 1980 [ Page 130 ] .
... intense efforts are required to assure full availability by 1980 of birth control information and means to all fertile individuals , especially in rural areas [ Executive Summary , page 9 ] .
While specific goals in this area are difficult to state , our aim should be for the world to achieve a replacement level of fertility , ( a two - child family on the average ) , by about the year 2000 .
. .. Attainment of this goal will require greatly intensified population programs ... U.S. leadership is essential [ Executive Summary , page 14 ] .
It is now all too clear how crucial this leadership was .
The U.S. withdrew from this role shortly after the election of President Carter , just one year after the initiation of public policy based on the report .
Initiatives for curtailment of population growth have been deteriorating ever since .
After suitable preparation in the U.S. , announce a U.S. goal to maintain our present national average fertility no higher than replacement level and attain stability by 2000 [ Executive Summary , page 19 ] .
Only nominal attention is [ currently ] given to population education or sex education in schools ... [ Page 158 ] ...
Recommendation : That U.S. agencies stress the importance of education of the next generation of parents , starting in elementary schools , toward a two - child family ideal .
That AID ( the Agency for International Development ) stimulate specific efforts to develop means of educating children of elementary school age to the ideal of the two - child family ... [ Page 159 ] .
Despite the Helms Amendment , which clearly ruled out abortion assistance in U.S. foreign aid programs , there was a clear consensus that continued widespread use of abortion would be required to meet / attain the objective .
While the agencies participating in this study have no specific recommendations to propose on abortion , the following issues are believed important and should be considered in the context of a global population strategy .
. .. Certain facts about abortion need to be appreciated : --
No country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion [ Page 182 ] . --
Indeed , abortion , legal and illegal , now has become the most widespread fertility control method in use in the world today [ Page 183 ] .
--
It would be unwise to restrict abortion research for the following reasons : 1 ) The persistent and ubiquitous nature of abortion .
2 ) Widespread lack of safe abortion techniques ... [ Page 185 ] .
An important goal in NSSM 200 dealt with leadership :
These programs will have only modest success until there is much stronger and wider acceptance of their real importance by leadership groups .
Such acceptance and support will be essential to assure that the population information , education and service programs have vital moral backing , administrative capacity , technical skills and government financing [ Page 195 ] .
The report recommended spending whatever could reasonably be absorbed to achieve these goals :
We recommend increases in the AID budget requests to the Congress on the order of $ 35 - $ 50 million annually through FY 1980 ( above the $ 137.5 million requested for FY 1975 ) ...
However , the level of funds needed in the future could change significantly , depending on such factors as major breakthroughs in fertility control technologies and LDC receptivity to population assistance [ Executive Summary , page 24 ] .
A ONE - CHILD FAMILY POLICY FOR THE U.S.
We know that even after a country reduces fertility to the replacement level , that , thanks to the phenomenon of momentum , the population continues to grow for another 70 years before stability is achieved .
A goal of NSSM 200 was to attain this stability here by the year 2000 .
One of the chief coordinators of the NSSM 200 study recently acknowledged that the government recognized the one - child family norm would be necessary to achieve this goal and was under obligation to encourage Americans to limit family size .
NO ACCOMMODATION TO THE VATICAN
The study frankly dismissed the arguments that have been raised by the Vatican to counter efforts to reduce population growth .
The position of the Roman Catholic Church on population growth centers on the need for economic development in Third World countries as a way to bring growth rates down .
NSSM 200 takes an entirely different tack :
We cannot wait for overall modernization and development to produce lower fertility rates naturally since this will undoubtedly take many decades in most developing countries ...
[ Executive Summary , page 7 ] .
Clearly development per se is a powerful determinant of fertility .
However , since it is unlikely that most LDCs will develop sufficiently during the next 25 - 30 years , it is crucial to identify those sectors that most directly and powerfully affect fertility [ Page 137 ] .
There is also even less cause for optimism on the rapidity of socio-economic progress that would generate rapid fertility reduction in the poor LDCs , than on the feasibility of extending family planning services to those in their populations who may wish to take advantage of them [ Page 99 ] .
This directly opposes the Vatican position .
But we can be certain of the desirable direction of change and can state as a plausible objective the target of achieving replacement fertility rates by the year 2000 [ Page 99 ] .
These statements manifestly rule out any accommodation to the Vatican on the issue of population growth control .
IMPLEMENTATION OF NSSM 200 IS BROUGHT TO A HALT During 1976 , Catholic activists worked diligently to undermine population growth control efforts .
Dr. R.T. Ravenholt , who directed the global population program of the U.S. Agency for International Development in the Department of State from 1966 to 1979 , tells the story .
On March 4 , 1991 , he addressed the Washington State Chapter of Zero Population Growth ( ZPG ) on “ Pronatalist Zealotry and Population Pressure Conflicts : How Catholics Seized Control of U.S. Family Planning Programs , ” and described some of these activities : Following a meeting of Presidential candidate Jimmy Carter and his campaign staff with fifteen Catholic leaders at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington , D.C. , on August 31 , 1976 , on which occasion they pressed Carter to deemphasize federal support for family planning in exchange for a modicum of Catholic support for his presidential race ...
Joseph Califano became Secretary of HEW ...
When Father Hesburgh [ President of Notre Dame University ] declined the role of AID Administrator , the appointment was given to John J. Gilligan , a Notre Dame graduate and a former governor of Ohio ...
John H. Sullivan moved from Congressman Clement Zablocki ’ s office into AID ...
Congressman Zablocki and Jack Sullivan had persistently worked to curb AID ’s high powered family planning program .
In 1973 , Jack Sullivan and allied zealots helped Senator Jesse Helms develop the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. ” AN IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE : TIME MAGAZINE TELLS IT LIKE IT IS
The headline on the cover of the February 24 , 1992 issue of TIME magazine was : “ Holy Alliance : How Reagan and the Pope Conspired to Assist Poland ’s Solidarity Movement and Hasten the Demise of Communism , ” referring to an article written by prize - winning journalist Carl Bernstein .
He reports :
The Catholic Team :
The key Administration players were all devout Roman Catholics -- CIA chief William Casey , [ Richard ] Allen [ Reagan ’s first National Security Advisor ] , [ William ] Clark [ Reagan ’s second National Security Advisor ] , [ Alexander ] Haig [ Secretary of State ] , [ Vernon ] Walters [ Ambassador at Large ] and William Wilson , Reagan ’s first ambassador to the Vatican .
They regarded the U.S. - Vatican relationship as a holy alliance : the moral force of the Pope and the teachings of their church combined with their notion of American democracy .
In a section of his TIME article headed , “ The U.S. and the Vatican on Birth Control , ” Bernstein writes three very revealing paragraphs :
In response to concerns of the Vatican , the Reagan Administration agreed to alter its foreign aid program to comply with the church ’s teachings on birth control .
According to William Wilson , the President ’s first ambassador to the Vatican , the State Department reluctantly agreed to an out - right ban on the use of any U.S. aid funds by either countries or international health organizations for the promotion of ... abortions .
As a result of this position , announced at the World Conference on Population in Mexico City in 1984 , the U.S. withdrew funding from , among others , two of the world ’s largest family planning organizations : the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nations Fund for Population Activities .
‘ American policy was changed as a result of the Vatican ’s not agreeing with our policy , ’ Wilson explains .
‘ American aid programs around the world did not meet the criteria the Vatican had for family planning .
AID [ the Agency for International Development ] sent various people from [ the Department of State to Rome , and I ’d accompany them to meet the president of the Pontifical Council for the Family , and in long discussions they finally got the message .
But it was a struggle .
They finally selected different programs and abandoned others as a result of this intervention . ’
‘ I might have touched on that in some of my discussions with [ CIA director William ] Casey , ’ acknowledges Pio Cardinal Laghi , the former apostolic delegate to Washington .
‘ Certainly Casey already knew about our positions about that . ’
Bernstein makes clear what the cadre of devout Catholics in the Reagan Administration did to protect the papacy and Catholic teaching from the potential fall - out from NSSM 200 .
He quotes the U.S. ambassador to the Vatican , William Wilson , who reveals that during the Reagan Administration , papal policy on birth control and abortion replaced the policy set forth by NSSM 200 ; and so the 21st century will be irredeemably less livable because of “ this intervention . ”
A CODE OF SILENCE CLOAKS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF NSSM 200 Immediately after President Ford adopted the recommendations of NSSM 200 on November 26 , 1975 , a peculiar silence fell over the whole matter .
The report was never printed .
There are only a handful of photocopies .
Those who wrote the report recommended that it be classified for 5 years .
Werner Fornos , President of the Population Institute , with the aid of several members of Congress , succeeded in getting the NSSM 200 report declassified for a brief period in 1976 .
Despite his best efforts , and the explosiveness of this report detailing major changes in the lives of every American , he was unable to achieve any press coverage whatsoever .
Instead , he found the report reclassified as a result of the objections of “ members of the national security establishment ” to the early declassification .
In the end , as noted , the document remained classified for 14 years , rather than the recommended 5 years .
Declassification in 1989 apparently resulted from application of the Freedom of Information Act. THE SILENCE EXTENDS BEYOND NSSM 200 The Vatican must be confronted on this issue .
Says Representative Scheuer : “ The Roman Catholic Church and its allies cannot be allowed to dictate the rules of the game when it comes to preservation of life on this planet at some level of decency .
” 12 Clearly , Carl Bernstein ’s article in TIME has been the most important development in revealing the influences of the Vatican on American policy .
Rep .
Scheuer ’s article , published in this journal , and Ravenholt ’s speech to ZPG were both major advances .
Congressman Scheuer has put it succinctly : “ The issue of population growth is too crucial to the future welfare of our nation and of the world to be left to the Roman Catholic hierarchy and it allies in the fundamentalist movement . ”

The pressures must be countered so that the rational and measured policies proposed by the Rockefeller Commission and NSSM 200 can be implemented as rapidly as possible .

BIRTH CONTROL PERCEIVED AS A THREAT TO PAPAL AUTHORITY
Why is the Roman Catholic Church obliged to halt legalized abortion and contraception despite the strong wishes of Americans ?
In Papal Power : A Study of Vatican Control Over Lay Catholic Elites ( The University of California Press , 1980 ) , Jean - Guy Vaillancourt , Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of Montreal , closely examines the sources of papal power .
It is derived in significant part from papal AUTHORITY .
If the Pope ’s AUTHORITY is diminished , papal power is diminished .
However , some AUTHORITY is derived from papal power and if papal power is diminished , then AUTHORITY is undermined .
The relationship is circular .
Less AUTHORITY means less power which means even less AUTHORITY .
With diminishing power , survival of the institution of the Roman Catholic Church in its present hierarchical form is gravely threatened .
Thus , the very survival of the Vatican is threatened by programs to control population growth .
In April , 1992 , in an exceedingly rare public admission of this threat , Cardinal John O’Connor of New York , delivering a major address to the Franciscan University of Steubenville , acknowledged , “ The fact is that attacks on the Catholic Church ’s stance on abortion -- unless they are rebutted -- effectively erode Church AUTHORITY on all matters , indeed on the AUTHORITY of God himself . ”
This threat was recognized decades ago by the Papal Commission on Population and Birth Control which met from 1964 until 1966 .
According to Commission member Thomas Burch , the Pope himself assigned the Commission the task of finding a way of modifying the Church ’s position on birth control without destroying papal AUTHORITY , which is absolutely essential for the continued survival of the Vatican and the Catholic Church as we know it today .
The Commission failed to find a way and the result was the encyclical Humanae Vitae which banned the use of contraception .
The Vatican clearly believes that if solutions to the population problem are applied , the teaching of the church will be undermined and the dominance of the papacy will be vitiated .
Thus , it is convinced that it cannot compromise on the issue of birth control , regardless of our national policy .
NSSM 200 forthrightly opposes
Rome on population strategy , family planning and abortion in the interest of national security .

Global Food Crisis The Fury of the Poor
Around the world , rising food prices have made basic staples like rice and corn unaffordable for many people , pushing the poor to the barricades because they can no longer get enough to eat .
But the worst is yet to come .

Israel is yet again embroiled in a war that was completely predictable and arguably avoidable if proper foresight had been exercised and if the ill - fated disengagement from Gaza had not led to the inevitable installation of a Hamas regime .
At present , however , Israelis and Americans stand by the principle that they do not talk with terrorist groups like Hamas .
Already there are those who dare to disagree with this policy .
Italian Foreign Minister Massimo D'Alema said this week that , “ Without engaging in dialogue with the Palestinians who govern Gaza , the peace process will have difficulties in moving ahead . "
As he points out , numerous influential voices in Israel are saying the same thing .
Interestingly , the same discussion is going on among politicians in the United States .
In the Democratic presidential campaign there has been a disagreement between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
Although Clinton says she wants to “ engage ” America ’s adversaries , in her paper on the issue for the Council on Foreign Relations she sets out very severe conditions that should pertain before she would start talking and rules out the possibility of talking with terrorists .
Obama , conversely , wants to talk with the enemies of the United States such as Iran and North Korea without any preconditions .
As far as I can tell , Obama does not say whether he would ever talk to terrorists or not .
To talk or not to talk ?
There is no point , it is argued , talking to a group or a country that supports terrorism and wants to destroy us .
Unless the enemy changes , talking is not only pointless but also counterproductive and dangerous and shows weakness .
The counterargument was made by Obama in his speech after losing the Texas , Ohio and Rhode Island primaries to Clinton .
Citing the examples of Presidents Kennedy and Reagan , Obama argued that , “ Strong countries and strong leaders are n't afraid to tell hard truths to petty dictators . ”
The question is : Which view is the correct one ?
Some would argue that the disastrous and delusional Munich Agreement signed by Hitler , Chamberlain , Mussolini and Daladier proves how pointless and counterproductive it is to talk or negotiate with enemies .
However , it needs closer examination .
Clearly , negotiating with enemies just in order to appease and elicit a worthless piece of paper is a true demonstration of weakness and is doomed to failure from the very start .
There is , however , an alternative .
The Torah tells us that , when God wanted to take the Israelites out of Egypt , he first sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh on a diplomatic mission backed up with the threat of force .
Force was used after diplomacy failed .
Furthermore , in Deuteronomy ( 20:11 ) , God tells the Israelites , “ When you draw near to a city to wage war against it , you shall call out to it for peace .
If it does not respond to you in peace … then the entire people found within in shall be a tribute for you . ”
Not a zero sum game
So the Jewish religion seems to advocate the necessity of communicating with enemies .
This does not mean that we should become pacifists .
This is not a zero sum game .
As long as it does not embolden them or weaken us , there is a moral obligation to seek every avenue for peace , including direct talks with enemies .
And , as in the biblical model mentioned above , if the leader is forceful enough and is ready to follow up with real consequences if the enemy does not comply , direct talks can be very productive .
The tyrants and dictators of this world must be told plainly and directly , out of the mouths of power , that they must either change their ways or suffer severe and irrevocable consequences .
If this is what Mr. Obama has in mind when he advocates talking with our enemies without preconditions , it makes a lot of sense to me .
It would seem that Israel can learn from that strategy too .
Scientists at Brookhaven Lab have discovered a state of two - dimensional ( 2D ) fluctuating superconductivity in a high - temperature superconductor with a particular arrangement of electrical charges known as " stripes . "
The finding was uncovered during studies of directional dependence in the material 's electron - transport and magnetic properties .
In the 2D plane , the material acts as a superconductor - conducts electricity with no resistance - at a significantly higher temperature than in the 3D state .
" The results provide many insights into the interplay between the stripe order and superconductivity , which may shed light on the mechanism underlying high - temperature superconductivity , " said Brookhaven physicist Qiang Li .
Understanding the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity is one of the outstanding scientific issues in condensed matter physics , Li said .
Understanding this mechanism could lead to new strategies for increasing the superconducting transition temperature of other superconductors to make them more practical for applications such as electrical transmission lines .
" As electricity demand increases , the challenge to the national electricity grid to provide reliable power will soon grow to crisis levels , " Li said .
" Superconductors offer powerful opportunities for restoring the reliability of the power grid and increasing its capacity and efficiency by providing reactive power reserves against blackouts , and by generating and transmitting electricity . "
This research was presented at The March 2008 American Physical Society Meeting in New Orleans , La. , March 10 - 14 .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Sen. Hillary Clinton 's chief presidential campaign strategist is quitting his post amid criticism of his public relations firm 's contacts with the Colombian government over a pending free - trade deal , Clinton 's campaign announced .
Mark Penn will continue to advise Hillary Clinton 's presidential campaign .
Mark Penn and his political consulting firm will continue to advise the New York senator 's Democratic presidential bid , but Penn will give up his job as chief strategist , campaign manager Maggie Williams said .
" After the events of the last few days , Mark Penn has asked to give up his role as chief strategist of the Clinton campaign , " Williams said .
Clinton did not answer reporters ' questions about Penn 's exit during a campaign stop in New Mexico on Sunday .
Penn is CEO of public relations giant Burson - Marsteller and is president of Penn , Schoen and Berland , his political consulting firm .
Friday , he acknowledged he had met with the Colombian ambassador to the United States earlier in the week in his role as Burson - Marsteller 's chief to discuss the pending U.S. - Colombia trade pact , which Clinton has criticized on the campaign trail .
Penn called the meeting " an error in judgment that will not be repeated , " and apologized .
That prompted Colombia 's government to fire the company Saturday , calling the remarks " a lack of respect to Colombians . "
Clinton and top aides were sharply critical of rival Democrat Barack Obama in February when reports indicated that his top economic adviser had suggested to a Canadian official that Obama was not as supportive of changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement as the Illinois senator claimed to be on the campaign trail .
Penn said Friday that Clinton 's opposition to the U.S. - Colombia pact , which the Bush administration is trying to push through Congress , " is clear and was not discussed " during his meeting with the ambassador .
And Clinton spokesman Mo Elleithee said Penn 's meeting was " not in any way done on behalf of the campaign . "
But Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell -- a key Clinton backer in his state 's April 22 primary -- suggested Sunday that Penn needed to go .
" I think you 've got to make it very clear for someone who is a consultant , who you are representing and who you are not representing , and I would hope that Mr. Penn , when he talked to the Colombians , made that clear .
And it does n't sound to me like he did , and that 's something the campaign should take into question , " Rendell told NBC 's " Meet the Press . "
Sources in the Clinton campaign said that Penn realized this weekend that he needed to step aside , and that Clinton was disappointed that he had met with the Colombians .
