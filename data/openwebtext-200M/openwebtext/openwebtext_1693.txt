April 1st — National Atheist's Day
By David J. Stewart | April 2007 | Updated March 2016
I learned this week that astronomers have estimated there are at least 200 sextillion stars in the universe . [ 1 ] Wow !
A “ sextillion ” is a 1 with 21 zeros behind it !
Even more amazing is that scientists tell us there are more stars in the universe than there are grains of sand upon all of earth 's beaches .
Yet , just one atom of sand contains more atoms than all the stars in the universe !!!
How could anyone deny that God exists , and that He created all things by His power !
Only a wicked heart of rebellion , ingratitude and intentional unbelief could compel a person to deny God 's existence .
Truly , God is amazing and His greatness is unsearchable !
Psalms 145:2 - 3 , “ Every day will I bless thee ; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever .
Great is the LORD , and greatly to be praised ; and his greatness is unsearchable . ”
I was recently thinking about the cow , as I ate a delicious homemade burger .
Here 's a great recipe for Hellmann 's burgers .
They 're so good , I do n't even use ketchup or mustard .
As I ate my burger , I thought about how God made cows to feed a lot of people .
This animal has short legs and a big meaty body , to feed a lot of hungry people .
Evolution could n't do that !
God is so good !
Psalms 145:9 , “ The LORD is good to all : and his tender mercies are over all his works . ”
Please look at the colorful and tasty looking photo to the right .
I see juicy red tomatoes , blessed blueberries , crisp red apples , delicious strawberries , various sorts of bell peppers , corn , squash , grapes , cucumbers , et cetera .
How could Evolution do this ?
How could a “ Big Bang , ” resulting in cosmic chaos and accidental aftermath , evolve into a highly organized universe that any honest scientist knows was created with design , purpose and order .
A big bang explosion could n't do this .
It is IMPOSSIBLE !!!
Only a complete fool would deny the existence of almighty God.
Creation itself is a clear and incontrovertible witness to the existence of a divine Creator .
Oh the wickedness of those who blaspheme God , by denying His eternal Power and Godhead !
“ For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse . ” — Romans 1:20
The Absurdity Of Claiming To Be An Atheist
The satanic bogus theories of Evolution have never been substantiated by legitimate science .
There is only speculation and unfounded theories , that sinfully attempt to undermine the inspired Words of God .
Science supports the Holy Bible .
Archaeology supports the Holy Bible .
Astronomy supports the Holy Bible .
No branch of science , history or expertise has proved the Bible wrong .
None !
I 'm betting on God 's side , because He has a perfect batting average !
It was atheist Bill Maher , host of Politically Incorrect on ABC , who said on August 22 , 2001 :
“ The Bible is a Fairy Tale ! ”
One of these days Mr. Maher will reap the fruits of his unbelief in the fires of Hell ...
“ In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God , and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ ” ( 2nd Thessalonians 1:8 ) .
I marvel that a mere man , who has only been conscious of life and the universe for less than 50 years , will speak so boldly against the God of the universe and His Holy Word !!!
My friend , unless you have traveled all of time and the space in the universe , you cannot say that there is no God .
Paul McCartney of The Beatles said :
“ We probably seem to be anti-religious ... none of us believes in God . ” ( Hit Parader , Jan 1970 , p.15 )
The Beatles were Communists !
Their music often promoted Communism and the overthrow of authority in songs such as “ Revolution No. 9 , ” “ Working Class Hero , ” “ Back in the USSR , ” “ Power to the People , ” “ Sometime in New York City , ” “ Give Peace a Chance , ” “ Bloody Sunday ” ( which called British police " Anglo pigs " ) , “ Attica State ” ( “ now 's the time for revolution ” ) , “ Angela ” ( which glorified Communist Angela Davis ) , and “ Piggies . ”
All of The Beatles were whoremongers .
Ringo Star stated :
“ We got drunk a lot .
You could n't help it .
We had a lot of girls .
We soon realized that they were easy to get ” ( TV Guide , July 29 , 1978 , p. 21 ) .
McCartney said :
“ We did n't all get into music for a job !
We got into it to avoid a job , in truth - and get lots of girls . ”
Hebrews 13:4 , “ Marriage is honourable in all , and the bed undefiled : but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge . ”
Where are John Lennon and George Harrison now ?
Sadly , they 're burning in the torments and fires of Hell .
Most rich people think they already have Heaven on earth , so they snub their noses at God in their sinful pride .
Angelina Jolie ( pictured left ) is a Godless heathen bound for Hellfire if she does n't repent towards God in faith ( Acts 20:21 ) .
When asked “ Is there a God ? , ” Jolie responded ...
" Hmm ...
For some people .
I hope so , for them .
For the people who believe in it , I hope so .
There does n't need to be a God for me .
There 's something in people that 's spiritual , that 's godlike .
I do n't feel like doing things just because people say things , but I also do n't really know if it 's better to just not believe in anything , either . "
Well Ms. Jolie , you may be sincere ; but you are sincerely WRONG !
You need Jesus Christ , who is Almighty God ( Isaiah 9:6 ; John 1:1- 3,14 ; John 10:33 ; Colossians 2:9 ; 1st Timothy 3:16 ; Revelation 1:8 — King James Bible ) .
Woe unto the world !
Woe unto them who live their lives as if there is no God !
Psalm 53:1 states , “ The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God .
Corrupt are they , and have done abominable iniquity : there is none that doeth good . ”
Those who deny God and His Word are CORRUPT !
The legendary secular author Ernest Hemingway , who would later take his own life by suicide in 1961 , said :
“ All thinking men are atheists . ”
Do you agree with Mr. Hemingway ?
If you do , then listen to the Words of warning from Revelation 21:8 , “ But the fearful , and unbelieving , and the abominable , and murderers , and whoremongers , and sorcerers , and idolaters , and all liars , shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone : which is the second death . ”
I truly feel sorry for professed atheists , because they are only hurting themselves .
The Scriptures are very adamant that “ Except a man be born again , he cannot see the kingdom of God ” ( John 3:3 ) .
I sincerely do n't want to see William Shatner , Billy Joel , Barry Manilow , Warren Buffet and Angelina Jolie perish in their sins and unbelief to burn in the Lake of Fire forever ( Revelation 20:13 - 15 ) .
The Bible is penned in black on white paper , for the world to read .
Please take a look around you , the next time that you visit your local grocery store , as you fill your cart with blessing after blessing from God .
We breath God 's clean air ( unless men have polluted it ) .
We drink God 's pure water ( unless men have polluted it ) .
God is a good God .
We enjoy the blessing of health from God .
If God remains faithful to reach out to us , we can never blame him in eternity for refusing Him .
2nd Timothy 2:13 , “ If we believe not , yet he abideth faithful : he can not deny himself . ”
God is right in everything that He does !!!
I believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ , do you ?
According to 1st Corinthians 15:1 - 4 , the “ Gospel ” constitutes three elements : Christ DIED on the cross for our sins , He was BURIED , and then He miraculously bodily RESURRECTED three days later .
It is so simple to be saved , JUST BELIEVE THE GOOD NEWS .
That 's how you receive the gift of eternal life .
Just believe the Gospel , make it your only hope for Heaven .
We read in Galatians 3:2 , “ This only would I learn of you , Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law , or by the hearing of faith ?
Are ye so foolish ?
having begun in the Spirit , are ye now made perfect by the flesh ? ”
The apostle Paul wrote a letter to the church at Galatia .
Paul only wanted to know ONE THING ...
HOW DID YOU GET THE INDWELLING HOLY SPIRIT ?
THAT IS TO SAY , HOW DID YOU GET SAVED ?
Was it by doing the works of the law ( i.e. , the Ten Commandments ) .
Or did you simply hear the Gospel preached and gladly receive it ?
If you believe ( trust ) the Gospel , you are saved !!!
Salvation is that simple !!!
It is a free gift ( Romans 5:15 , 18 ; Romans 6:23 ; Ephesians 2:8-10 ) .
Tragically , Gene Roddenberry ( Star Trek TV series creator ) died in his sins without Christ ) .
Also , Leonard Nimoy ( “ Spock ” ) died in his strange female goddess religion without Christ .
Legendary singer , England Dan , died in his satanic Baha'i Faith and went to Hell .
David Bowie asked for a Buddhist funeral .
Steve Jobs of Apple Computers was a devour Buddhist .
They are being tormented in Hell right now , and forever !
I could name hundreds of famous actors , singers and celebrities who either deny God 's existence or reject Jesus Christ as their Savior .
Either way , they 're damned under the curse of God 's law ( Galatians 3:10 ) .
I do not rejoice that anyone goes to Hell , and neither does God ( Ezekiel 33:10 ; 2nd Peter 3:9 ) .
The choice is yours alone to make .
Wicked people may unite hand - in - hand , even nation - with - nation , against God , but when we all die , we die alone .
We are judged alone ( Romans 14:10 - 12 ; James 4:12 ; Ecclesiastes 12:14 ) .
Judgment Day is coming !
( Hebrews 9:27 ; Hebrews 4:13 - All Scripture references are ONLY to the trustworthy King James Bible ) .
Here are some more arrogant statements exclaimed against God almighty by foolish atheists :
“ By simple common sense I do n't believe in God , in none . ” — Actor , Charlie Chaplin
“ I gradually , decided that just because I did n't have or could n't find the ultimate answer did n't mean I was going to buy the religious fairytale .
As an atheist you have to rationalize things . ”
— Singer , Billy Joel
“ I have NEVER seen the slightest scientific proof of the religious theories of Heaven and Hell , of future life for individuals , or of a personal God . ” — Inventor , Thomas Edison
“ My belief system is that when this is over , you do n't look down from Heaven and wait for your loved ones to join you ... your molecules continue and in due time become something else . ”
— Actor , William Shatner
It was Helen Keller who blasphemed God's Word by stating :
" There is so much in the bible against which every instinct of my being rebels , so much so that I regret the necessity which has compelled me to read it through from beginning to end .
I do not think that the knowledge I have gained of its history and sources compensates me for the unpleasant details it has forced upon my attention . "
Not coincidentally , the “ I love you ” hand sign which Ms. Keller allegedly developed is also used in satanic rituals and by Rock - n - Roll idolaters .
In fact , satanist Anton LaVey has a picture of Keller 's hand sign ( with the thumb extended ) in the 1969 Satanic Bible .
The link I just provided takes you to an actual photo from The Satanic Bible .
The argument about the extended thumb not being a satanic hand sign is simply not true .
Communist Karl Marx said :
“ The social principles of Christianity preach cowardice , self - contempt , abasement , submission , humility , in a word all the qualities of the canaille . ”
Do you not see that the common denominator of Communism , Rock - n - Roll , immorality , and Satanism is ATHEISM ?
One of the primary goals of Communism is to cause moral decay .
Communist leader Vladimir Lenin stated :
“ The best revolutionary is a youth devoid of morals . ”
David Noebel best summarized the influence of the Beatles , particularly John Lennon , when he said :
“ ... the present rock ' n ' roll scene , Lennon 's legacy , is one giant , multi-media portrait of degradation - a sleazy world of immorality , venereal disease , anarchy , nihilism , cocaine , heroin , marijuana , death , Satanism , perversion , and orgies ” ( The Legacy of John Lennon , by David Noebel , 1982 , p. 15 ) .
Although the above quote speaks of JOHN Lennon of the Beatles , one could easily think it was speaking of Vladimir Lenin .
Is this not EXACTLY the fulfillment of Vladimir Lenin 's Communist agenda ... a youth devoid of morals ?
Yes , it certainly is !
You can't tell Lenin from Lennon when it comes to beliefs and morality !
These are the fruits of atheism .
Truly , April Fool 's Day is a fitting holiday for all the Communistic , Rock - n - Rolling , Satanic , immoral , child - murdering , feminist , ATHEISTS in the world .
There 's not a bigger bunch of fools on the planet .
“ For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen , being understood by the things that are made , even his eternal power and Godhead ; so that they are without excuse :
Because that , when they knew God , they glorified him not as God , neither were thankful ; but became vain in their imaginations , and their foolish heart was darkened .
Professing themselves to be wise , they became fools ...
Having the understanding darkened , being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them , because of the blindness of their heart :
Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness , to work all uncleanness with greediness . ”
— Romans 1:20 - 22 and Ephesians 4:18-19
When the truth is revealed , there 's no such thing as an atheist .
There are only ingrates who refuse to acknowledge the goodness and omnipotent power of God.
Romans 1:20 confirms that there is no such thing as an atheist .
All the proof anyone needs of God is found right outside your front door , which is why on Judgment Day all professed atheists will be without excuse .
I assure you that there are no atheists in Hell .
Do you know where most atheists are from ?
They come out of heathen State universities .
Most young people profess to be homosexuals in a heathen university , which is where they are indoctrinated with that garbage .
Most people decide to become atheist in some heathen school .
Colossians 2:4 and 18 , “ And this I say , lest any man should beguile you with enticing words .
...
Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels , intruding into those things which he hath not seen , vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind . ”
The Scriptures warn about taking unsound advice from unsaved people .

Tory minister Iain Duncan Smith last night announced a controversial plan to move the unemployed to areas of the country where there are more jobs .
The Work and Pensions Secretary said jobless workers could be forced to move hundreds of miles away from their homes .
His comments echo former
Tory minister Norman Tebbit who in 1981 said the unemployed should " get on your bike " and look for work .
Former Tory leader Dun-can Smith insisted it was the only way to help millions of people " trapped in estates where there is no work " .
If they agreed to give up benefits , they would be allowed to go to the top of housing waiting lists in a new area .
Mr Duncan Smith said : " Sometimes you just need to be able to move to the work . "
Shadow Education Secretary Ed Balls described the new proposal as " profoundly unfair " .
The former American President ’s updates are written in the third person , suggesting that they are written by an aide , as is the case with President Obama ’s use of social media .
An account at twitter .com / george_wbush has also been created , mirroring the Facebook site ’s updates .
Bush spokesman David Sherzer , however , told the AFP news agency that the account was unofficial and that the former president had no future plans to " tweet " .
Embattled BP is to cut costs by $ 14bn ( £ 9.5 bn ) in six months as part of a radical plan to sustain profitability in the wake of the explosion at its Deepwater Horizon oil rig that has led to the worst spill in US history .
Well - placed City sources say that BP is planning to sell its remaining North Sea interests as well as stakes in dozens of exploration and production projects where it does not exercise overall control .
The board will also consider whether to sell its 1.4 % stake in Rosneft , Russia 's largest oil company , which it acquired at the time of Rosneft 's 2006 flotation for $ 1bn .
But there is no question of BP selling out of its Russian joint venture with TNK , as that operation accounts for 25 % of its worldwide resources and around 10 % of profits .
BP 's British and European assets account for little more than 4 % of its global portfolio and several projects in the North Sea are being wound down as supplies become exhausted .
But a sale of what is left would symbolise a historic retreat .
The $ 14bn figure is what BP could save by December via reduced capital expenditure , a suspension of three quarterly dividend payments and asset sales .
Similar savings could be achieved by the summer of 2011 if the company , under chief executive Tony Hayward , is forced to introduce an even deeper cost - reduction programme .
BP has told the City that it aims to save around $ 10bn via sales and a reduction in spending on capital projects over the next 12 months .
It would not comment further .
But sources say the company is determined still to push ahead with investments in potentially lucrative projects in South America , Asia and the Middle East , and is prepared to raise funds by issuing corporate bonds to City investors or by increasing borrowings .
However , the cost of servicing increased indebtedness could be steep as its credit rating has been slashed by credit rating agencies .
President Obama last week forced the company to set up a $ 20 bn fund to pay for environmental damage from the disaster , which has strained relations between Britain and the US .
But that sum does not include the cost of more than 150 lawsuits filed by people and businesses harmed by pollution that could take years to clean up .
On Friday , credit rating agency Moody 's said it was concerned by the escalating cost of the oil spill , which is expected to continue until at least August .
It also warned that the $ 20 bn compensation fund would not cover BP 's liabilities .
It said : " Our assessment reflects a substantial upward revision of the estimated size of the leak , the continued failure to bring the leaking Macondo well [ in the Gulf ] under control , and the mounting costs and claims for damages . "
The agency added that uncertainty over the ultimate cost for litigation claims and other contingent liabilities will hang over BP 's creditworthiness for years to come .
Moody 's concern is shared by Russian president Dmitry Medvedev , who said he was concerned that the company faces " annihilation " , while Louisiana state treasurer John Kennedy estimates the total cost of the spill could range from $ 40bn to $ 100bn , much more than the $ 20 bn that BP has agreed to ringfence in an escrow fund .
Richard Griffith , an oil analyst with Evolution Securities , said President Obama 's energy policy had taken a huge knock .
Griffith said : " The idea has been to reduce US dependence on foreign imports by increasing domestic production .
But that strategy now appears to be at serious risk with little prospect of opening other areas around the US to offshore drilling . "

The Korea Space Launch Vehicle - 1 , South Korea 's second space rocket , sits on its launch pad at the Naro Space Center in Goheung , South Korea , Tuesday , June 8 , 2010 .
The rocket is scheduled to blast off on June 9 .
The launch of the first rocket last August failed due to problems in fairing assembly .
The Korean letters on the rocket read : " Republic of Korea . " ( AP Photo / Korea Pool )
( AP ) -- South Korea 's space program suffered a setback Wednesday when the planned launch of a satellite was postponed due to malfunctioning firefighting equipment .
The two - stage Naro rocket was supposed to blast off in the late afternoon carrying an observation satellite to study global warming and climate change .
The process was halted , however , after fire retardant suddenly sprayed from one of three nozzles set up near the launch pad to extinguish any blaze , said Pyun Kyung - bum , a spokesman at the Ministry of Education , Science and Technology .
Cable news channel YTN showed white fire retardant spewing out and dozens of engineers later checking the launch pad .
The first stage of the two - stage rocket was designed and built by Russia and the second by South Korea .
Experts from the two countries were trying to find the cause of the problem and planned to consult on a new launch date , Pyun said .
The planned liftoff at the coastal Naro space center in Goheung , 290 miles ( 465 kilometers ) south of Seoul , would have been the country 's second launch of a rocket from its own territory .
In the first attempt last August , the satellite failed to go into orbit because one of its two covers apparently failed to come off after liftoff .
Since 1992 , South Korea has launched 11 satellites from overseas sites , all on foreign - made rockets .
The launch preparations came amid heightened tension on the Korean peninsula after South Korea referred North Korea to the U.N. Security Council over the sinking of a navy ship that killed 46 South Korean sailors .
North Korea - which denies involvement in the sinking - has threatened to retaliate against South Korea for taking it to the U.N. body , saying the South 's action will intensify military tension and could trigger a war .
There was no immediate North Korean reaction to the planned launch by South Korea .
Last year , North Korea said it would closely watch the international response to South Korea 's launch after a North Korean rocket launch drew a U.N. rebuke .
North Korea has developed a variety of missiles and launched a long - range rocket from a domestic site in April last year in defiance of international warnings .
It said the rocket carried a satellite into orbit as part of a peaceful space development program , but the U.S. and its allies said nothing reached space and the launch was actually a test of long - range missile technology .
North Korea , unlike the South , is banned from any ballistic missile activity by U.N. Security Council resolutions as part of efforts to eliminate its nuclear and long - range missile programs .
The two Koreas are still technically at war because the 1950 - 53 Korean conflict ended with a cease - fire , not a peace treaty .
The Science Ministry said South Korea plans to develop a space launch vehicle with its own technology by 2020 .
China , Japan and India are Asia 's current space powers .
Japan has launched numerous satellites while China sent its first astronaut into space in 2003 and carried out its first spacewalk in 2008 .
India launched a satellite into moon orbit in 2008 , but had to abandon it nearly a year later after communication links snapped and scientists lost control of it .

A second “ containment ” vessel will increase the amount of oil being captured to as much as 28,000 barrels of oil per day , Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen said today in what amounted to the first official admission that the quantity of oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico exceeds all previous estimates .
If the containment capacity does reach 28,000 barrels of oil simple math shows it will have exceeded the highest estimates of spill flow rate made thus far by either BP or the government .
The highest of those estimates have been between 12,000 and 19,000 barrels of oil per day .
Allen said that government scientists have been asked to “ re-evaluate ” their earlier spill flow estimates .
Labor and community leaders have questioned BP and government figures since the early days of the crisis .
Robert “ Tiger ” Hammond , president of the Greater New Orleans AFL - CIO , said back in mid-May , “ First it was 1,000 gallons , then 5,000 , then 20,000 and now who knows how much .
There ’s no way that you can rely on BP to tell the truth about the amount of oil leaking into the Gulf . ”
As oil from the spill contaminated increasing swaths of the Louisiana coastline businesses throughout the area have either shut down or are on their last legs .
With his business ground to a halt , Brad Robin , an oyster fisherman in Ycloskey , La. has had to lay off 50 workers who would now be using his equipment to bring in the seafood .
Jeff Pohlmann , owner of Today ’s Ketch , a small seafood restaurant in Chalmette , La. ca n’t get “ the good quality stuff my friends and neighbors have always caught in these waters . ”
His fear is that his business and his neighbors ’ way of life could be ruined forever .
While some business owners like them have received small checks to cover lost wages , for example , most continue to wait for BP to process the larger claims for business losses .
Local claimants say they get friendly voices when they call BP but they do n’t get any money .
Curt Eysink , director of the state Workforce Commission , said that of some 6,000 claims paid in Louisiana , only three were larger than $ 5,000 and none exceeded $ 10,000 .
“ It is completely unreasonable to assume that these payments are sufficient to sustain affected businesses , ” he said .
The White House announced , meanwhile , that President Obama will offer his condolences tonight at the White House to families of the 11 workers killed when the Deepwater Horizon exploded two months ago .
“ They were the very first victims of what is a very long and sad tragedy , ” White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said .
“ It has changed the lives of many .
It has changed the lives of those 11 families .
It will do untold economic and environmental damage .
It ’s the largest disaster this country has ever seen .
They are not – they ’re certainly not forgotten . ”
On another front , the oil spill ’s effect on wildlife is also increasing .
In just five days , the rescue center at Fort Jackson has received more than five times as many oiled birds as it received in the previous six weeks since the oil spill began .
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services said yesterday that the Louisiana center has reported 415 birds since the BP well exploded in April .
All but 66 of those were reported since last Thursday .
Since the start of the spill crews have found 633 dead birds , many of them visibly oiled .
32 sea turtles have been rescued .

As South Africa prepares to welcome the World Cup to its shores , plans by Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba to block all porn from entering the country suggest that soon the only ball control that its citizens will legally be allowed to watch will be taking place on a football pitch – in front of a crowd of thousands .
In putting forward these proposals , Gigaba publicly aligned South Africa with other notable bastions of free speech , including Yemen , the United Arab Emirates and , er , Australia .
Late last week , he met with the Justice Alliance of South Africa to discuss drafting of a bill that would impose a total ban on pornography on the internet and mobile phones .
The Internet and Cell Phone Pornography Bill ( pdf ) would require pornography to be filtered out at the tier one service provider level to avoid it entering the country .
Such a proposal would have a significant advance on current legislation , particularly the Film and Publication Act , which merely bans pornography featuring the abuse of children .
By contrast , the Internet and Cell Phone Bill appears to seek a total ban of pornography on these electronic channels using the far wider definition of pornography provided in the Sexual Offences Act .
According to Gigaba : " Cars are already provided with brakes and seatbelts , it is not an extra that consumers have to pay for .
There is no reason why the internet should be provided without the necessary restrictive mechanisms built into it . "
He also added : " The Bill is aimed at the total ban of pornography on internet and mobile phones .
United Arab Emirates and Yemen already have legislation in this regard .
Australia and New Zealand are currently seeking to do so . "
Lest readers be in any doubt as to the seriousness of the intent , the latest draft of the bill makes clear that ISPs will need some fancy footwork to escape its consequences .
The Bill proposes : " Any Internet service provider or Mobile phone service provider who distributes , or allows to be distributed through the Internet or through a mobile phone in the Republic of South Africa , any pornography , shall be guilty of an offence and liable , upon conviction , to a fine or imprisonment for a period not exceeding five years , or to both a fine and such imprisonment . "
Bootnote
Yemen currently has two ISPs that are alleged to block material that includes gambling , sex education and Christian and other material that could " convert " Muslims to other religions .
The UAE is alleged to censor politically sensitive material , all Israeli domains and opinions that the UAE government does not agree with .
All voice over IP is blocked .
For such sterling efforts , Yemen has earned a place on ONI 's watchlist , while the UAE is merely included in the ' substantial ' category .
For its role in blocking access to material that has been categorised as " refused classification " ( RC ) , Australia has been in ONI ’s ' nominal ' category since 2009 .
For her work in reporting on issues of a sexual nature , your own correspondent has learned that she is frequently blocked in the Middle East – though not yet , to her knowledge , in Australia . ®
who reject anal penetration , promiscuity , and effeminacy
among men who have sex with men and by Luke Shelton and Bill Weintraub
Frot ( rhymes with " hot " ) is the contemporary term for the male - male erotic practice formerly known as " frottage " : full - body , phallus - on - phallus sex , done face - to - face and heart - to - heart .
The Man2 Man Alliance is a coalition of Men -- some of whom self - identify as " gay , " others as " straight , " and others as " bi " -- but most of whom today have rejected those out - dated labels and now simply identify as Men -- Men who are determined to win recognition from society of the genuineness of their feelings for one another ; and of the validity of the expression of that affection through Frot , phallus - on - phallus sex , which is not only life - affirming and masculine but mindful of both participants ' shared and mutual enjoyment .
This Man2 Man Alliance website , then , and our affiliated Heroic Homosex and Frot Men domains , are advocacy sites , dedicated to putting forth the truth that two Men can best have a physically and emotionally loving relationship when it's expressed through the celebration of their Mutual Masculinity and the exaltation of their Mutual Manhood .
This central premise flies in the face of beliefs cherished by both the dominant " heterosexual " and " homosexual " cultures .
" Straight / heterosexual " culture defines Men within the confines of a narrow and sterile idea of how men should relate to one another , both emotionally and physically .
Too often , men are taught that any physical bonding with another man that involves sex or emotion automatically brands them as something less than a man .
While " gay male " culture has become obsessed with anal penetration , incessantly asserting that anal is the ultimate expression of erotic contact between males , and that no sexual encounter is complete unless it culminates in an act of anal penetration .
Yet the erotic pleasure in anal penetration is so minimal , and , when joined with promiscuity , the dangers anal presents to its practitioners and the community so great , that it 's difficult to conceive of a practice more ruinous or less enjoyable taking center place in a sexual subculture .
These dangers , of which HIV / AIDS is the best known , but which include hepatitis B and C , syphilis , gonorrhea , chlamydia , the human papilloma virus , herpes , and a host of other pathogens , will persist even after AIDS has been cured or can be prevented through vaccination .
And more anally - transmitted diseases most certainly await discovery .
For anal penetration is an exceptionally efficient mode of disease transmission , and we can be sure that pathogens will continue to find an infective niche in anal .
In addition , no magic or wishful thinking can transform either the anus or the rectum into genital organs , nor can the feelings experienced by a male being penetrated anally be compared to those of genital stimulation .
Further , anal penetration subjugates one of the participants to the other , effectively emasculating him , turning him into a pseudo - woman , a proxy in a heterosexualized form of contact .
This is an inherently unequal act , epitomized by its tedious terminology of " tops " and " bottoms , " which is unmindful of the basic human need for a shared experience without pain and with dignity .
Whereas Frot , phallus - against - phallus contact , is the acme of sexual activity between Men because it 's focused on that which makes Men Masculine , namely their genitals -- their Manhood -- rather than their organs of fecal excretion .
To draw a parallel with male - female sex : Men and Women connect to one another genitally .
They are made that way , like counterweights or puzzle pieces , complementary of one another .
In the same way , during phallus - to - phallus sexual activity , Men are related to one another as they should be , in that part of their body that fits together genitally and sensually .
For a Man and a Woman sex is a naturally penetrative act .
For two Men the natural experience is that which stimulates both of them phallically -- not anally .
Neither the anus nor the rectum are genitalia , period .
And to say so is not in and of itself confrontational , but simply affirmative of a natural affinity the majority of Men feel for one another .
To be able to have a healthy , fulfilling , safe act that is cooperative in the achievement of gratification should be hailed as a boon to both cultures -- but instead it has been met with skepticism in " straight " society and derision in the " gay male " community .
This continuing denigration of healthy , loving , and innately Masculine sexual intimacy is a result of ignorance and prejudice , and the Men of the Alliance are committed to exposing and defeating both .
The Alliance and its allied websites also present in detail the historical and cultural context of the recognition of same - sex contact between Men .
This is relevant to all Men whether they currently self - identify as " heterosexual " or " homosexual . "
Because historically , in many cultures , Men could express erotic desires for both sexes and be considered totally within the realm of normality .
In fact , Frot is an expression of our most basic male biology , that we are not only capable of giving and receiving pleasure phallically with each other as Men , but that we are hard - wired to enjoy it .
Recognizing phallus - against - phallus sex as a part of the natural interplay among Men will go a long way to removing the prohibitions still in place in our society against the physical and sexual expression between Men of their bond and friendship .
That 's not to say every friendship between Men should involve sex , but rather that if it evolves into a phallic , sexual sharing it is not an aberrant or immoral behavior , but a natural and imminently uplifting experience .
Finally , the Alliance does not support promiscuity among Men who have sex with Men , and encourages its members to practice monogamy and fidelity .
To us this is not complicated .
Promiscuity is psychologically debilitating and physically dangerous , and the sexually transmitted infections which plague the gay male community and threaten society as a whole would disappear were it not for promiscuity , and anal promiscuity in particular .
Many religious individuals and organizations have condemned anal promiscuity and pointed to its role in the dissemination of disease , and we agree with them .
Unfortunately , however , all too often those same individuals and organizations have linked their condemnation of anal promiscuity with a blanket condemnation of any expression of male - male attraction , affection , intimacy , or love , and in so doing have strengthened the hand of those in the gay male community who unhesitatingly accuse Men opposed to anal and promiscuity of erotophobia and homophobia .
We submit that such condemnations of male affection and amity have , in evangelical terms , aided and abetted the work of the adversary , and we urge Christians to reconsider , through thought and prayer , the effects of their actions .
We also directly question under what scriptural authority those condemnations have been made .
Jesus , who , Christians believe , died that men may spiritually live and who intercedes for them before the throne of God , when incarnate on earth made no condemnation of affection between men .
The Old Testament speaks of " a man who lies with a man as with a woman " - but that does not apply to Men who practice Frot - for we are present sexually with a Man as only another Man can be .
And in the story of David and Jonathan the Bible sets forth as clear a model for love between brave and heroic Men as could be imagined .
Why is that story there ?
The evangelicals among us understand that nothing in scripture is insignificant , or present for no reason , and least of all the account , clear and compelling , of the Warrior Love of Jonathan and David .
Moreover , among the ancient Greeks , whose piety and devotion to their Gods was unsurpassed , male - male love affairs were the norm , and Manhood was exalted and equated with Virtue -- in ancient Greek Areté ( αρετη ) .
We said earlier that historically , in many cultures , Men could express erotic desires for both sexes and be considered totally within the realm of normality .
That was true in ancient Greece , where Areté -- Manly Virtue -- was the core societal and cultural value .
As the great classicist KJ Dover has said :
[ The Greeks ] did not consider male - male relations incompatible with concurrent male - female relations or with marriage ...
Again :
The societal and cultural norm was for the same Man -- not two different males , but the same Man -- to have * both * a wife and a male lover .
And -- because both relationships were sanctioned by the Gods , the Man who had both a wife and a male lover did not suffer any psychic distress as a result .
To the contrary --
He saw himself as a complete and whole Man who was fulfilling two societally - sanctioned roles -- in a responsible and indeed Virtuous way .
The Greek God Zeus and his wife Hera on Olympos
Zeus ' male lover Ganymedes stands between them
For just that reason , and because , ultimately , Manhood is a spiritual quality , mediated by the Warrior Gods , in the Alliance we worship a Divine Being whom we call Ares -- Ares , who is the source of Areté -- Manly Excellence , Manly Goodness , Manly Virtue -- and of Manliness and Fighting Manhood itself .
Ares is the Warrior God , God of Fight , God of Manhood , God of Fighting Manhood , and the Father of Eros -- Eros , the God of Romantic Passion between Men .
So : The Man2 Man Alliance is a new force in our country and globally , a force both temporal and spiritual , which calls upon men who love men to do so as Men , bravely and loyally , through the act of phallic bonding , an act that is uniquely male and uniquely ours .
In summary :
1. Phallus - Against - Phallus Sex , in the past commonly called " frottage , " and today most often termed " Frot , " is an inherently equal , natural , and masculine form of mutually and directy genital sexual expression .
2 . Anal penetration , which at present is extolled by the mainstream gay male community , is by contrast inherently unequal , unnatural , and effeminizing , and is a vector for a host of physical ills , including some which are among the most terrifying known to humankind .
3 . Most straight - identified men have same - sex erotic needs and desires which our contemporary heterosexualized culture cruelly , un-necessarily , and unreasonably demands they deny .
4 . Frot offers all Men a Masculine , healthy , intimate , and sensually fulfilling expression of love , affection , and comradeship .
5 . The Man2 Man Alliance therefore calls upon all Men who Love Men to reject anal penetration , effeminacy , and promiscuity , and to embrace phallus - to - phallus intimacy , masculinity , and fidelity .

September 14 , 2017 1 . To show Men who Love Men , primarily through The Man2 Man Alliance , that they can express that Love in a way which celebrates and exalts the Mutual Manhood of both Men -- while eschewing anal , promiscuity , effeminacy , and other forms of licentiousness .
2 . To strongly encourage all Men , primarily through Ares Is Lord , to train either in Traditional or Mixed Martial Arts by explaining to Men that they have a religious obligation to Embody and Enact the Fighting Manhood of the World of Being here in the World of Becoming .
the centrality of Fighting to the spiritual welfare of Men .
NOT
NOT
The Men of the Alliance reject hedonism and ethical nihilism .
That means we reject any male - male sexual practice that does not directly celebrate and exalt the mutual Manhood of both Men through Combative and Aggressive Phallus - Against - Phallus .
It also means that we reject any ethical or other belief system that does not have Manhood and Manliness at its core , and that fails to identify Manhood , Fighting Manhood , with Virtue .
NOT
The Men of the Alliance also reject the categories of sexual orientation and all labels associated with or arising from those categories , including , but not limited to , " gay , " " straight , " " homosexual , " and " heterosexual " --
And any other labels which some closeted creature and internet charlatan might happen to dredge up from the disturbed and dismal depths of its UN - conscious .
We reject those labels , and we reject anyone who uses them .
Additional Reading
Our Man2 Man
Alliance sites are huge -- more than 1000 webpages in each -- and newcomers can find that daunting .
To start we recommend these core articles :
Hyacinthine Love
or Some Thoughts on Cock - rubbing and the Cultural Tyranny of Butt - fucking
Bill Weintraub 's first published article , Hyacinthine Love takes up three of the most important themes of the Alliance :
Certainties
Published in 2017 , but written in 1999 , Certainties is a sequel and companion piece to Hyacinthine Love , and further explores both the deeply romantic and mythic nature of the relationship discussed in Hyacinthine Love , a relationship which was expressed sexually in combative and aggressive phallus - against - phallus .
Frot : The Next Sexual Revolution
This article discusses the history of the dominant culture of anal penetration ( analism ) , describes how it parallels the previous heterosexual model , and talks about how the advantages of equality , mutually genital pleasure , and masculinity will accrue to men through Frot : The Next Sexual Revolution .
What Sex Is
This article , which contains sexually explicit images , explores the essentially genital nature of sex , whether between men and men or men and women .
One of the most popular pages on the site , and absolutely essential reading .
An Anus Is Not a Vagina
Warning : some adult content .
This Man2 Man Alliance policy paper , which is in three parts , discusses three aspects of anal penetration :
Part 1 . The Biology of Anal Penetration , examines the anatomy and physiology of the anus and rectum , with particular attention paid to the various diseases and mechanical problems they 're subject to when penetrated ;
Part 2 . The Psychology of Anal Penetration , looks at the question of pleasure and pain in anal penetration , and asks what it is that anally - receptive men actually experience during penetration ; and
Part 3 . The Ideology of Anal Penetration , analyzes the belief systems which underlie and support this fringe sexuality .
An Anus Is Not a Vagina is essential reading for those who wish to understand the reality and the role of anal penetration in gay male life today .
Sex Between Men : An Activity , not a Condition is a key Man2 Man Alliance policy paper which examines the difference between sex between Men as an activity -- and as a condition .
An examination of the ancient Greek past as well as our global present , Sex Between Men : An Activity , not a Condition is essential reading for those who wish to understand why the Alliance rejects the categories of sexual orientation , and what our Alliance vision is for the Future of Men .
A direct result of our discussions of Masculinity over the last three years , Sex Between Men : An Activity , not a Condition is a key policy paper and important reading for all members of The Man2 Man Alliance -- as well as the general public .
Why Be Faithful
Why Be Faithful is a Man2 Man Alliance policy paper which looks at at the health and psychological risks of sexual promiscuity , and examines the benefits of Fidelity .
Here are some highlights :
In Part I , we examine in depth the many concurrent epidemics of STD affecting men who have sex with men , and although we of course endorse
Frot as a very low risk activity , we also note that
no sexual behavior outside of Fidelity to one uninfected lifetime partner can confer absolute protection from STD .
And we warn
Frot men explicitly , as we 've done countless times before , that they cannot combine Frot and promiscuity :
Men who are promiscuous , even in low - risk activities , still run the risk not only of acquiring an STD , but of being part of a process of disease creation which will , ultimately , affect everyone in the community .
In Part II , we talk about the many benefits of stable , loving , long term relationships , paying particular attention to the norm of warrior altrusim .
We also address " open relationships " by asking , " Can there be committment without fidelity ? " ; and respond :
Only a sexually exclusive relationship can protect male lovers from the dangers not just of STDs , but of emotional infidelity .
and we add :
Men who have sex with men , like the rest of humanity , do best in relationships when their sexual and emotional energies are focused upon each other exclusively .
We also look at abstinence both among older gay - identified men :
For a Frot Man to choose abstinence rather than take part in a form of sex he dislikes and which is dangerous as well , is good -- it 's a response which protects both his integrity and his health , and gives him time to look for a long term relationship with another Frot guy -- which is what he needs ;
and among young people :
Delaying sexual onset -- abstinence -- is just as important for young people who identify as gay as for other teens .
Gay - identified teens and men are not members of some alien species .
They 're human beings , and have the same needs for purity and security in their emotional and sexual relationships as " heterosexual " people .
And the best way for you as a young gay - identified person to achieve those goals is to abstain from sex until you 're sure you 've met the man with whom you will spend the rest of your life .
We ask whether biology is destiny , and look at the phenomenon of gay male promiscuity in the modern world :
Only among gay - identified men in the post - industrialized world , has a culture of absolute promiscuity , with no effective restraints upon individual behavior , developed .
That development is , as we shall see , though supported by an ideology and subcultural norms , very recent .
Indeed , this sort of unbridled promiscuity is so new that we may reasonably regard it as a social experiment -- and one which has , by any reasonable measures , including the physical and psychological health of its participants , and their happiness , failed .
We then look closely at the ideology of multipartnered pansexualism and the implications of the beliefs of the pansexualists .
And finally , we come back to the benefits of Fidelity and of what we call
Why Be Faithful is one of our most important policy papers to date .
So we hope you 'll take the time to read Why Be Faithful
You 'll be glad you did .
Although Masculinity has been a core value of the Alliance from its inception , in 2006 we began exploring Masculinity and Men 's issues in more depth .
And for that reason we strongly recommend these articles :
The Power of the Masculine discusses two core concepts : Natural Masculinity and heterosexualization .
We continue that discussion in a number of articles , including
Natural Masculinity and Phallic Bonding ;
Creating a Masculine , Socially - Dignified Space : Loving a Man as a Man ; and ,
Natural Masculinity and the Weight of the Lies .
Also highly recommended are :
WARRIORS !;
too male ;
MANPHOBIA : Fired for being into UFC ;
and the other articles listed in Warriors Speak VIII .
Just as Masculinity has been a core value of the Alliance since its inception , so has Spirituality .
As can be seen in such relatively early articles as Masculinity and Spirit and Phallic , Masculine , Heroic .
In the Fall of 2006 , the Warriors of the Alliance deepened their understanding of the spiritual apsect of Frot through a series of posts on our Personal Stories message board .
Those discussions have now been brought togther in our core Alliance article
Sacred Phallic
Love explores three of our core Warrior beliefs : Masculinity is a Divine Principle ; Manhood a Divine Gift ; and Frot a Holy Sacrament .
So strongly do we believe these things that many of us Worship a Divine Being whom we call Ares , and who Sokrates , in the Cratylus , identifies as the God of Manhood and Manliness .
Not only is Ares the God of Manhood and Fighting --
He 's also the father of the God Eros -- the God of Romantic Passion between Men. Both Ares and Eros are vast and vastly powerful spiritual forces who use their Creative Energy to mediate -- for Men -- between the Kosmic Realm of Pure Being -- and the daily realm of our human senses .
Sacred Phallic
Love is essential reading for those who wish to understand this most important aspect to , and the spiritual basis of , our Sacred Warrior Man2 Man Alliance .
In addition , there are these representative Policy Papers and other Articles : Walter Odets , the sex police , and the big lie ; Protective stupidity and the debasement of language under analism ; MSM HIV Timeline ;

The Man2 Man Alliance , in response to requests from individual Frot Men , has begun the process of organizing real - time , real - life Regional Chapters .
Called simply " Frot Men [ Name of city or region ] " -- for example , " Frot Men Portland " -- these chapters are our latest organizing tool in our ongoing battle to defeat analism and radically improve the lives of Men who Love Men .
This page : 1 . discusses the challenge of cultural inertia faced by the Alliance and our regional coordinators ; 2 . sets forth the requirements for opening a regional chapter ; 3 . explains how the regional chapters relate to The Man2 Man Alliance worldwide ; and , 4 . lists the regional chapters .
If you 're interested in opening a regional chapter , please visit this page .
In 2004 we presented four essays on the nature of Men who Love Men which are still highly recommended .
The first is our Man2 Man Alliance policy paper , Are Men Who Have Sex With Men Intergendered ?
The question is an important one , because until men understand the truth about male sexuality , they will remain vulnerable to attacks designed to confuse and frighten them , attacks coming from both the analist left and the religious right .
And because in our experience those attacks are so destructive of the lives of men , we include as an accompanying article a powerful editorial from Alliance founder Bill Weintraub , titled Awash in Lies .
This is a strong personal statement from Bill about the reality of men who have sex with men .
In addition , in 2004 we welcomed a new essayist to the cultural section of the site , long - time Alliance contributor Dr. Robert Loring , Th.D. , Ph.D. , who presents , in A Case of Rape , a telling tale of analist rape and its aftermath ;
and his own very moving and persuasive meditation on masculinity and loyalty , Brothers of the Heart .
All four essays are excellent and highly recommended .
Our Definitions page is a compendium of terms readers frequently encounter in the various articles , essays , and message board posts on our Man2 Man Alliance and Heroic Homosex sites .
We also have a FAQS page which helps answer those frequently asked questions guys have about Frot and the Man2 Man Alliance .
And please note in that regard that other than HeroicHomosex.org and FrotMen.org , which are subsidiaries of the Man2 Man Alliance --
And Ares Is Lord.org , which is the religious arm of the Alliance ,
the Man2 Man Alliance is NOT AFFILIATED with any other group on or off the web .
If someone or some site says that he 's affiliated with the Alliance , or that his work is endorsed by Bill Weintraub or the Man2 Man Alliance -- he 's lying .
Plain and simple .
If you have a question about affiliations or endorsements , please write to Bill :
bill@Man2ManAlliance.org
Also noteworthy :
In Multipartnered Pansexualism or Heroic Love ?
we examine ten representative messages generated by proponents of the dominant culture of anal sex , including documents from AIDS Service Organizations , pornographers , academics , safer sex educators , gay sex advice columnists , personal ads , and major media ; analyze how they support the culture of anal penetration and promiscuity among gay men ; and describe our goals for a new m2 m culture .
In Do Condoms Work ? , we look at HIV prevention programs , and explain why we support " Primary Behavior Change , " rather than " condom campaigns . "
And in Is Unwanted Anal Penetration Date Rape ? , we examine the ways in which participants in mainstream gay male anal culture pressure and coerce men into frot so as to penetrate them anally , and suggest ways men into frot can avoid becoming the victims of what is in fact analist date rape .
Visitors interested in other discussions of sexual culture will find a list further down this page .
The Heroes section of our site contains many articles on the Ancient World .
Here 's a complete list :
In addition , we have a seven - part series on the Spartan Agogé :
Descriptions of the various articles can be found on the Heroes Site Guide .
In addition , we invite site visitors to learn about our other domains by clicking here and scrolling down our Fidelity Alliance page , which contains portals to our other sites .
We caution visitors that some of our sites contain explicit pictures and descriptions of men having phallus - to - phallus sex , and we ask that you not visit those sites if you believe they will trouble you .
We maintain our adult sites as a means of modeling and affirming phallus - to - phallus for those men who are interested and seek validation .
Unfortunately , gay male life , and the internet , are now awash in a sea of anal sleaze , raunch , and kink , and we believe it 's important to present images of healthy , non-promiscuous , phallus - to - phallus alternatives for men who love men .
We call such alternatives , collectively , Heroic Man2Man , and that 's what our sites are about -- the beauty and spirituality of the uniquely male act of phallic mating .
Mating -- not promiscuous rubbing .
And bonding -- not meaningless sex .
Love between men who are strong and noble .
Love between people who are decent and caring .
That 's our vision .
We invite you to share it , and to join with us in building a new and better m2 m world .

This is the first story from Fritz Leiber that I was less than completely happy with .
GATHER , DARKNESS starts out with heavyhanded exposition and a lack of vigor ; it took some effort to keep reading .
Almost exactly halfway through , though , the writing seemed to perk up and suddenly there was genuine suspense and excitement ( this was about the time Jarles was given over to the brainwashing expert ) .
There were still some clunky moments here and there , but the second half felt much more like what I have come to expect from Leiber .
( A welcome touch of Leiber 's gentle wit : the priests have a faint violet halo hovering over their heads when their suits are on , and one priest making his way through town at night grumbles , " A halo hardly gave you enough light at night to keep from tripping over things ! " )
GATHER , DARKNESS !
started out as a three part serial in ASTOUNDING SCIENCE FICTION , beginning in the May 1943 issue .
Reportedly , Leiber was given the same premise from John Campbell that Robert Heinlein worked up into SIXTH COLUMN .. that is , a future dictatorship using fake religion to control the masses .
As you might expect , the two books ended up quite differently ( it 's hard to imagine two writers with more differing viewpoints than Heinlein and Leiber ) .
Two hundred years after the cataclysm ( there are vague hints of a nuclear war , " the Blasted Heath " where nothing grows is a scar left by the ancient weapons ) the entire world is being crushed by a huge theocracy calling itself the Hierarchy .
It has some of the trappings of Catholicism , but it has set up a new deity called the Great God .
The Hierarchy keeps the commoners in constant labor in a feudal society , controlling every aspect the laborers ' lives while carrying on their own power struggles and backstabbing inevitably in any large bureaucracy .
It might seem there is no way that this rigid tyranny can be brought down , but in fact an opposition has sprung up ... the Witchraft .
Now , right from the opening paragraphs , Leiber makes it obvious that both the Hierarchy and the Witchcraft are using advanced technology to simulate magic .
From the huge stone colossus of the Great God looking down at the city ( this statue can smile and gesture , quite an impressive sight ) , to the forcefields which inflate the priests ' robes and protect them from harm to the small fighter aircraft which are fashioned to look like angels , it 's all an elaborate charade from the Hierarchy .
And the Witchcraft are working at undermining their authority with holograms of huge gray wolves , haunted houses , clouds of blackness chasing people and so forth .
There are hints of a few surviving remnants of a more ancient witchcraft , too , the genuine folk beliefs and practices which somehow have not completely vanished .
A likeable old hag named Mother Jujy represents this original witchcraft and , although she is colorful and sympathetic , she plays a minor role .
To be honest , I was really hoping to see actual no -fooling Black Magic rear its head at some point .
Some shocking moment when an actual demon or sorcerer stepped in , not a member of either political party using tech tricks .
Nope .
Maybe if this had appeared in UNKNOWN , instead ..... I think the real reason GATHER , DARKNESS !
seemed dated to me is that , sadly enough , its imagery and symbols have been so watered down by our time .
Back in 1943 , the use of organized religion in a story as a cruel oppressive sham might have had more impact and shock value than it does today .
Too many scandals and abuses of power by religious figures have robbed holy symbols of much of their potency .
When was the last time you saw a movie where an evil creature was actually repelled by a crucifix ?
And witchcraft has been so co-opted and defended by proponents of neo -paganism that any use of a witch as a villain gets a barrage of protesting letters .
So GATHER , DARKNESS ! , with its sinister priesthood and heroic witches , does n't really seem that striking or revolutionary a concept any more .
There are a few touches in the story that I really enjoyed .
The witches have familiars , small spider monkey - like creatures that can communicate telepathically with their owners and which live on blood from those owners .
It turns out these are greatly simplified and modified clones of the owners .
The perfect pet , almost a twin , completely devoted and dependent , these critters are so appealing and creepy at the same time that they are one of the best aspects of the book .
And there is one other point that took me by surprise .
One of the weapons the Hierarchy priests use are the rods of wrath , evidently a small thing like a flashlight which projects a thin beam of violet energy .
Usually , these seem to be a sort of raygun but there is this one duel : " Like two ancient swordsmen , then , the warlock and the deacon duelled together .
Their weapons were two endless blades of violet incandescence , but their tactics were those of sabreurs - feint , cut , parry , swift riposte .
" What the heck .
This seems vaguely familiar , two men fighting with blades of destructive light .
I 'm sure I`ve seen this in a movie somewhere .
The latest bombshells come from former Lehman lawyer Oliver Budde , who spent many years drafting the bank 's compensation disclosures and hiding the restricted stock unit ( RSU ) component of Fuld 's pay .
Lehman had to change that after Budde left , but it did n't : " data - share - img= " " data - share = " twitter , facebook , linkedin , reddit , google , mail " data - share - count = " false " >
Dick Fuld said under oath that he was paid less than $ 310 million from 2000 through 2007 , and that he held , rather than sold , the “ vast majority ” of his shares , if not all of them .
But it ’s becoming increasingly clear that he was lying .
The latest bombshells come from former Lehman lawyer Oliver Budde , who spent many years drafting the bank ’s compensation disclosures and hiding the restricted stock unit ( RSU ) component of Fuld ’s pay .
Lehman had to change that after Budde left , but it did n’t :
Budde calculated that while Lehman reported Fuld ’s RSUs as worth $ 146 million , the real figure , based on the Section 16 reports , was $ 409.5 million .
Lehman had counted just 2 of 15 RSU awards …
Considering his options , Budde decided to go to the SEC as a whistleblower .
He sent a detailed two - page e-mail on April 14 , 2008 , to the SEC ’s Enforcement Division , under the subject line “ Possible Material Noncompliance with New Executive Compensation Disclosure Rules . ” …
He got a standardized form thanking him for his letter in return .
He never heard anything else …
While Fuld said he earned less than $ 310 million from 2000 through 2007 , he actually had received $ 529.4 million , according to Budde ’s calculations .
In direct contradiction to Fuld ’s claim to Waxman that he had not sold the majority of his shares , Budde estimates that Fuld earned $ 469 million from stock sales between 2000 and 2008 .
Budde ’s numbers are almost identical to the numbers already published by Lucian Bebchuk , so they are credible on their face .
And Budde clearly knows what he ’s talking about .
It comes down to this :
Fuld claimed that he was paid less than $ 310 million over the years in question , and lost nearly all of it .
In fact , according to Budde , he was paid $ 529 million , and kept $ 469 million — more than he said he was paid in total .
Fuld ’s in a lot of legal jeopardy already , of course .
But we ’re still waiting for a villain from this crisis to end up in jail .
Is there any chance , do you think , that an aggressive attorney general somewhere might launch a criminal prosecution for perjury ?

Whether they ’ve looked at the trees , the insects , or the jaguars , scientists have agreed that Yasuní National Park ( map ) in Ecuador ’s Amazonian rain forest is one of the most diverse places on earth .
But nature left one thing underground that could seal the fate of all that life above : Nearly one billion barrels of oil .
In the coming weeks , Ecuador aims to sign a unique agreement to forgo drilling for oil in a huge plot of this rain forest in exchange for money .
The idea is that contributions from industrialized nations and , potentially , from corporations would make up for the badly needed petroleum revenue that the South American nation would lose by keeping the fossil fuel underground .
Although there have been many hurdles — including a controversy over whether the deal would forfeit too much of Ecuador ’s sovereignty — the government ’s chief negotiator now says the agreement will be signed by early July .
If it comes together , some hope that the so - called Yasuní - ITT Initiative — named for the area ’s Ishpingo , Tiputini , and Tambococha oil fields — could be a model for combating global warming .
A Nation that Runs on Oil
The deal would be a landmark for Ecuador , a nation that practically runs on oil .
One - third of the government ’s revenue comes from oil payments , according to official sources ; observers say the true figure is probably much more .
Crude is the largest export .
The reliance on a single commodity began four decades ago , when Texaco completed a pipeline from the Amazon lowlands in the east , known as the Oriente , over the Andes .
Ecuador quickly became South America ’s second - largest oil producer .
It has since pumped about 4.5 billion barrels of crude worth more than $ 100 billion .
The bonanza came at a cost to forests and wildlife , though .
Tens of thousands of fortune - seekers from Ecuador ’s highlands joined the boom .
They carved homesteads and plantations from virgin forest along oil - well access roads .
As a result , Ecuador ’s rate of rain forest deforestation is among the highest in the world .
Also , billions of gallons of toxic liquids were dumped into unlined pits at hundreds of oil well and processing sites .
Who will pay to clean up the polluted land and water , and compensate people harmed by the chemicals , is the subject of a 17 - year lawsuit that could be decided later this year .
If an Ecuadorian judge follows the recommendation of a court - appointed expert panel , he could order Chevron ( which merged with Texaco in 2001 ) to pay a $ 27 billion fine , possibly the world ’s largest civil penalty .
Chevron admits dumping drilling fluids , but it says it practiced methods accepted at the time and that it performed a cleanup overseen by Ecuadorian regulators before transferring operations to its successor , state - owned Petroecuador .
This history was all part of the backdrop in September 2007 when Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa unveiled a proposal to ban drilling in a plot of the Oriente about half the size of Rhode Island , mostly inside Yasuní Park .
When Ecuador created the park in 1979 , the government severely restricted road building and logging , but was at that time unwilling to ban drilling for oil .
Now , Correa says , the nation would be willing to leave some of that oil in place .
Although the proposed protected area is not as large as some environmentalists would like , it 's a block that holds about 20 percent of Ecuador ’s reserves .
The only catch : Correa wants the nations of the world to contribute about $ 3.5 billion to compensate Ecuador for the revenue it would lose .
At the time , he said that would be about half the value of the oil in the so - called ITT block .
He touted the proposal ’s benefits in helping to alleviate global warming ; leaving the oil in the ground would prevent 400 million tons of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere .
Above The Oil Reserve , Rich Diversity
Kelly Swing , director and founder of the Tiputini Biological Station , a research base in Yasuní administered by the Universidad San Francisco de Quito , talks about how curbing drilling would be a boon to the forest itself .
According to one study , a single hectare of Yasuní forest ( about the size of two football fields , including end zones ) contains 100,000 insect species , more varieties than scientists have recorded anywhere else .
Other studies show that more frog and toad species hop through Yasuní ’s forests than are native to the United States and Canada combined .
Within the 2 - square - mile ( 5 - square - kilometer ) boundaries of Swing ’s Tiputini Station , researchers have identified 200 species of mammals , including 10 of primates , 100 of bats ( more than twice the number native to North America ) and big cats like jaguars and pumas .
( See Swing 's slide show . )
And at Estación Científica Yasuní , several hours by motorized canoe upstream from Tiputini , a research center administered by the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador , botanist Álvaro Pérez has methodically identified every single tree — a total of about 300,000 — in a plot a little smaller than Washington , D.C. ’s National Mall .
Such meticulous record keeping has helped researchers determine that on average 655 tree species spring from every hectare of Yasuní ’s soil , more than are native to the continental United States .
Correa ’s proposal to protect this reserve from oil development drew praise in Europe — with Germany ’s government pledging about $ 1 billion to the effort — and there were predictions that an agreement would be signed during the Copenhagen climate talks last December .
But early this year , Correa appeared to back away from the plan , saying his negotiators were ceding too much Ecuadoran sovereignty in exchange for contributions .
His foreign minister and Roque Sevilla , a former mayor of Quito who headed a presidential commission on the effort , resigned in protest .
Commentators said the plan was at a standstill .
But Correa appointed a new negotiating team , which recently worked out an agreement to have the United Nations Development Programme administer the project ’s trust fund .
A six - member oversight board will include at least three Ecuadorians , a provision designed to alleviate concern about the influence of outsiders .
Ivonne A - Baki , former Ecuadorian ambassador to the United States , now Ecuador ’s negotiator for the agreement , says the document will be signed in a ceremony in Quito by early July .
In a telephone interview , A - Baki said she expects several countries to announce new commitments now that management of donations is clear , although she would not name any beyond Germany .
A - Baki said she also has heard from many companies that might want to contribute .
She declined to identify them , though she said supporting the Yasuni plan would be a cagey move for an oil company looking to garner good publicity .
“ If I were BP , ” she says , “ I ’d be the first one to do it . ”
Sevilla , the former head of the presidential commission on Yasuní - ITT , says the plan has faced stiff opposition in Ecuador because it runs counter to an entire history of use and extraction of mineral resources .
“ In the short term it will be very difficult , because we are breaking a paradigm , ” he says .
“ But afterwards , they are going to use this example for the future . ”
And here I thought trees reproduced with seeds .
President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach MORE on Saturday used a speech to West Point cadets to defend his escalation of the war in Afghanistan .
Obama also placed a heavy emphasis on winning international cooperation and bolstering non-military sources of American power .
Obama ’s remarks to the graduating class revealed both continuity with former President Bush ’s hard stance against violent extremists and a break with the unilateralism that Bush critics called a defining feature of his presidency .
“ America has not succeeded by stepping outside the currents of cooperation , we have succeeded by steering those currents in the direction of liberty and justice – so nations thrive by meeting their responsibilities , and face consequences when they don’t , ” Obama said .
ADVERTISEMENT
He called for an “ international order that can meet the challenges of our generation ” that range from nuclear proliferation to climate change .
Speaking before about 1,000 cadets -- many of whom will be deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan -- Obama cited continuing threats to the U.S. by violent extremists while proclaiming that American intervention has “ brought hope ” to the Afghan people .
“ The war began only because our own cities and civilians were attacked by violent extremists who plotted from that distant place , and it continues only because that plotting persists to this day , ” Obama said in prepared remarks at the military academy in upstate New York .
Obama also told the West Point cadets that the U.S. faces a suite of challenges that cannot be met solely with military power .
“ We will be steadfast in strengthening those old alliances that have served us so well , including those who will serve by your side in Afghanistan and around the globe .
As influence extends to more countries and capitals , we must also build new partnerships , and shape stronger international standards and institutions , ” Obama said .
“ This engagement is not an end in itself .
The international order we seek is one that can resolve the challenges of our times – countering violent extremism and insurgency ; stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and securing nuclear materials ; combating a changing climate and sustaining global growth ; helping countries feed themselves and care for their sick ; preventing conflict and healing its wounds , ” he added .
Obama used a similar theme when discussing domestic policy .
He strongly – and repeatedly – praised the military while noting “ now the rest of us must do our part . ”
He called for preparing children to compete in a global marketplace , developing energy sources that end reliance on foreign oil , and strong U.S. science and research .
“ At no time in human history has a nation of diminished economic vitality maintained its military and political primacy , ” Obama said .
Obama last addressed West Point in December , when he offered his explanation for sending an additional 30,000 troops to the country .
The decision divided Democrats , and disappointed many of the president ’s supporters on the left , who had hoped the president would wind down conflict in both Iraq and Afghanistan .
Obama has said that troops from Afghanistan will begin returning home 18 months after they arrived .
“ This war has changed over the last nine years , though it is no less important than it was in those days after 9/11 , ” Obama said Saturday in his remarks .
“ We toppled the Taliban regime ; now we must break the momentum of a Taliban insurgency and train Afghan Security Forces , ” he continued .
“ We have supported the election of a sovereign government ; now we must strengthen its capacity .
We have brought hope to the Afghan people ; now we must see that their country does not fall prey to our common enemies .
” Obama ’s speech fusing a defense of the war and with pledges of a new foreign policy direction comes ahead of a Capitol Hill debate on war funding legislation .
The Senate hopes to approve a supplemental funding bill before leaving for the Memorial Day recess , with the House taking up the legislation after the Senate .
The House vote will be complicated by opposition to the war effort from liberal Democrats , who are wary of continuing the engagement in Afghanistan .
Obama also used the speech to cite continuing terrorist threats while defending the administration ’s record on intelligence .
Intelligence agencies have come under GOP attack for failing to more quickly detect the plot of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the failed Christmas Day airline bomber .
The criticism has put the White House on the defensive , and Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair resigned under pressure earlier this week .
“ Though we have had more success in eliminating al Qaeda leaders in recent months than in recent years , they will continue to recruit , plot , and exploit our open society .
We see that in bombs that go off in Kabul and Karachi , ” Obama said .
“ We see it in attempts to blow up an airliner over Detroit or a SUV in Times Square , even as these failed attacks show that pressure on networks like al Qaeda is forcing them to rely on terrorists with less time and space to train .
We see it in al Qaeda ’s gross distortion of Islam , their disrespect for human life , and their attempts to prey upon fear , and hatred , and prejudice , ” he added .

Joran van der Sloot : Stephany Flores Ramirez Murder ( PHOTOS , VIDEO )
, 22 , the Dutch man arrested and later released in the May 30 , 2005 disappearance of , is now suspected of killingin Peru on May 30 , 2010 -- exactly five years , to the day , after the first crime was committed in Aruba .
At a news conference held in Lima , Cesar Guardia Vasquez told the gathered reporters there is " incriminating evidence " linking van der Sloot to the killing of the 21 - year - old woman .
Her lifeless body was discovered face down in his hotel room - with multiple stab wounds .
Several witnesses saw the couple return to his room at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday .
Video from the previous night shows the pair at the Atlantic City Casino in Lima .
The woman 's father , Ricardo Flores , told reporters that his daughter 's car was found 50 blocks from the hotel , and inside they found date rape drugs .
It is believed to be the vehicle used by van der Sloot to flee the murder scene at the hotel .
According to immigration officials , van der Sloot crossed into Chile on Monday and may be headed for Argentina .
Interpol has issued an international arrest warrant .

We 've included another from the Natalee Holloway case :
Factories used to be arranged in a straight line .
That 's because there was one steam engine , and it turned a shaft .
All the machines were set up along the shaft , with a belt giving each of them power .
The office needed to be right next to this building , so management could monitor what was going on .
150 years later , why go to work in an office / plant / factory ?
That 's where the machines are .
That 's where the items I need to work on are .
The boss needs to keep tabs on my productivity .
There are important meetings to go to .
It 's a source of energy .
The people I collaborate with all day are there .
I need someplace to go .
But …
If you have a laptop , you probably have the machine already , in your house .
If you do work with a keyboard and a mouse , the items you need to work on are on your laptop , not in the office .
The boss can easily keep tabs on productivity digitally .
How many meetings are important ?
If you did n't go , what would happen ?
You can get energy from people other than those in the same company .
Of the 100 people in your office , how many do you collaborate with daily ?
So go someplace .
But it does n't have to be to your office .
If we were starting this whole office thing today , it 's inconceivable we'd pay the rent / time / commuting cost to get what we get .
I think in ten years the TV show ' the Office ' will be seen as a quaint antique .
When you need to have a meeting , have a meeting .
When you need to collaborate , collaborate .
The rest of the time , do the work , wherever you like .
The gain in speed , productivity and happiness is massive .
What 's missing is # 7 … someplace to go .
Once someone figures that part out , the office is dead .
From her front yard , Malinda Beeman can see the round pinkish - brown dome of Chinati Peak rising out of the desert miles away .
It ’s so quiet most days that she can yell at her five dogs and hear the echo reverberate off some cactus - covered mesa who knows how far from home .
“ It ’s just a different life experience , ” Beeman says .
In what she describes as an all - encompassing obsession , Beeman is fighting to preserve that lifestyle , which she and hundreds of other artists have discovered in the West Texas town of Marfa , by waging war with a company that has plans to erect at least 1,000 three - story mirrored satellite dishes — designed to harness the energy of the blisteringly bright desert sun and turn it into electrical power .
Presidio County Judge Jerry Agan and others in this tiny outpost find the opposition from the solar - fighters puzzling .
Over the past two decades , creative spirits like Beeman have effectively transformed Marfa from a boarded - up dot on the map into a mecca for writers , painters and sculptors inspired by the desolate landscape .
Most of the newcomers are the type you might expect to champion an investment in clean , alternative energy .
“ It ’s astounding to me , because most of the people involved [ in the opposition ] are pro green power , ” Agan says .
Tessera Solar , a London - based company with American headquarters in Houston , plans to install the solar power generation site — the first of its kind in Texas — on about 200 acres of land two miles east of Marfa .
Power generated there will help keep the lights on and the air conditioning running some 400 miles east in San Antonio .
The company plans to break ground on the project later this year .
In its first phase , Tessera plans to install 1,080 of the huge mirrored discs — called SunCatchers — that will generate about 27 megawatts of power .
CPS Energy , which supplies gas and electricity for San Antonio , will buy the energy from Tessera .
Raul Cardenas , manager of renewable energy programs at CPS , says the initial phase will generate enough power for an average of about 4,000 homes .
The project could eventually expand to include twice as many SunCatchers and take up some 600 acres , though Tessera says it 's unlikely the project would grow that large .
Neither CPS nor Tessera officials would disclose the cost of the 20 - year contract they signed in May 2009 .
But Randy Etheridge , development director for Tessera , says they are still looking for ways to fund the project .
The company has applied for both state and federal grants .
And Tessera may seek property tax incentives from Presidio County , though Etheridge says it ’s too soon to know .
“ It looks like it ’s going to be a tremendous project , ” he says .
Agan and other longtime locals support the solar initiative ; they support most anything that will bring jobs and tax revenue to an area that has long languished economically .
But some residents of Antelope Hills — the rural neighborhood next door to the Tessera site — do n’t view the project so positively .
“ The placement of this right here essentially is killing the subdivision , ” Beeman says as she drives up to a freshly painted green gate that marks the private property where the solar plant will be erected .
“ People were going to build their little houses , they were going to add to the tax base , but now they see their property being worthless .
It ’s a horrible shock . ”
An artist who moved from Colorado to Marfa more than a decade ago , Beeman has a small farm on her 15 acres of desert .
She raises llamas , milk goats , chickens and those five dogs , and she works on her art , which now seems to always turn into mirrored discs , a consequence of her obsession with the Tessera project , she says .
The plot of land Tessera plans to use for its solar project is about a half - mile from her home on the edge of Antelope Hills subdivision .
Like her , many of the subdivision residents either moved from afar to live in the idyllic Texas desert or purchased second homes to get away from bustling city life .
Beeman says she ’s all for green energy , and she ’s not opposed to the idea of the solar plant .
But she objects to the location of Tessera ’s project right on the edge of Marfa .
She worries about noise that the giant discs might produce and light pollution that could mar the brilliant moonlit night sky .
“ Instead of coming to a little gem of a town in the middle of the prairie , you ’re going to see a power plant for miles , ” she says .
She 's gathering signatures from her neighbors who oppose the solar installation , and she plans to present Presidio County commissioners with a sheaf of names opposing the Tessera project .
She wants the county to do all it can to prevent Tessera from using the site in her neighborhood , or at least minimize the impact .
“ You ca n’t just let this happen , ” she says .
Elizabeth Redding and Dirk Vaughan live in Antelope Hills , too , just up the road from Beeman .
They moved there about four years ago from Arizona and Utah , respectively , to start a new life together in the “ weird Marfa combination of culture and Dairy Queen chili dogs , ” Vaughan says .
Their house is a stark , gray , two - story stucco structure , and they ’ve tried to keep their footprint on the desert environment to a minimum .
From their stone patio , Redding and Vaughan take in an expansive panorama of the Davis Mountains .
“ The view is just priceless , ” says Redding , who owns the Marfa Table , a restaurant on the main drag in between the bookstore and the radio station .
Redding was livid when she learned about Tessera ’s plans , describing the company as a sleazy profit - monger that presented its project as a done deal instead of first engaging with the community .
“ It just offended me , so I was angry , ” she says .
Her view , though , has tempered some .
Tessera agreed not to pave the road through the subdivision , and it agreed to rearrange the solar disc installation to keep equipment farther from the homes in Antelope Hills .
And she ’s pleased that Tessera is working with researchers at the McDonald Observatory in Fort Davis to limit light pollution from the solar installation .
“ Ideally , I would like them to be somewhere else , ” she says .
“ I think it ’s inevitable , unfortunately . ”
Vaughan has a more pragmatic take and says he was astounded at the “ naïve idealism and hypocrisy ” some of his neighbors have shown .
“ These are all liberal , recycle , take - your - reusable - bag - to - H - E - B [ types ] , and everybody is taking this immediate not - in - my - backyard , close - minded , contentious ” stance , Vaughan says .
The power plant , he says , will be tolerable .
The solar discs might even be better neighbors than a potential homeowner who could buy the acreage and put in obnoxious fountains or a huge estate that uses massive amounts of water and other natural resources , he says .
And in a nation that uses such gargantuan amounts of energy , alternative , renewable sources are a must , Vaughan says .
Tessera does n’t want to be a “ flash in the pan ” company in Marfa , he says , and he hopes to get one of 20 permanent jobs that will be created at the solar installation .
“ A lot of this is about change , and Marfa is really hard to change , ” Vaughan says .
“ The new liberals are as intransigent as the conservatives they ’re fleeing from . ”
The solar project near Marfa is one of four that Tessera has in the works , but it ’s not the only one that has sparked controversy .
It has plans to install 34,000 solar discs in southern California ’s Mojave Desert .
That project has drawn the ire of environmental groups that worry the solar discs will disturb the pristine land and damage the habitat of endangered species in the region .
Michael Webber , associate director of the Center for International Energy and Environmental Policy at the University of Texas , calls the clash between conservation groups and clean - energy developers a “ crazy conundrum . ”
Both are trying to do right by the environment , but they end up at odds because solar installations require so much land .
But Webber says the potential for noise and light pollution from the Marfa project is minimal , and the prospect of Texas - based environmental groups launching major opposition is unlikely .
Plus , the solar plant could be a windfall for a small , poor county like Presidio , he says .
In addition to about 100 initial construction jobs and 20 long - term jobs at the site , the company will have to pay property taxes on potentially many millions of dollars worth of solar equipment it installs .
“ It might be a game - changer for them , ” Webber says .
The Marfa project could also be good for Texas as it delves into the solar power industry , Webber says .
Texas is by far the largest wind power generator in the nation , but it has lagged in producing solar energy .
The Marfa - San Antonio solar power marriage , he says , is a “ match made in heaven . ”
The sun shines brightest and hottest in Marfa , producing the most energy at the exact time of day when San Antonio ’s air - conditioned homes reach their peak electricity demand .
“ The good news is I think this is the front tip of a quickly growing curve , ” Webber says .
For their part , Tessera officials say they are doing all they can to accommodate their new neighbors in Marfa .
Etheridge , the development director , says the company is conducting studies to ensure light and noise pollution are minimal .
It is working with the city to use the least amount of water possible to clean and maintain the solar discs .
And when it comes time to hire workers at the plant , he says , Tessera will give priority to qualified local applicants .
“ Everybody has questions because they ’re not familiar with the technology , ” Etheridge says .
“ We want this to be a win - win situation for everyone . ”
Logging in as Root
Martin Meredith wrote a blog post about logging in as root and the people who so strongly advocate against it [ 1 ] .
The question is whether you should ssh directly to the root account on a remote server or whether you should ssh to a non -root account and use sudo or su to gain administrative privileges .
Does sudo / su make your system more secure ?
Some years ago the administrator of a SE Linux Play Machine used the same home directory for play users to login as for administrative logins as for his own logins – he used newrole to gain administrative access ( like su or sudo but for SE Linux ) .
His machine was owned by one of his friends who created a shell function named newrole in one of his login scripts that used netcat to send the administrative password out over the net .
He did n’t immediately realise that this was a problem until his friend changed the password and locked him out !
This is one example of a system being 0wned due to having the double - authentication – of course if he had logged in directly with administrative privs while using the same home directory that the attacker could write to then he would still have lost but the attacker would have had to do a little more work .
When you login you have lots of shell scripts run on your behalf which have the ability to totally control your environment , if someone has taken over those scripts then they can control everything you see , when you think you run sudo or something they can get the password .
When you ssh in to a server your security relies on the security of the client end - point , the encryption of the ssh protocol ( including keeping all keys secure to prevent MITM attacks ) , and the integrity of all the programs that are executed before you have control of the remote system .
One benefit for using sshd to spawn a session without full privileges is in the case where you fear an exploit against sshd and are running SE Linux or some other security system that goes way beyond Unix permissions .
It is possible to configure SE Linux in the “ strict ” configuration to deny administrative rights to any shell that is launched directly by the sshd .
Therefore someone who cracks sshd could only wait until an administrator logs in and runs newrole and they would n’t be able to immediately take over the system .
If the sysadmin suspected that a sshd compromise is possible then a sysadmin could login through some other method ( maybe visit the server and login at the console ) to upgrade the sshd .
This is however a very unusual scenario and I suspect that most people who advocate using sudo exclusively do n’t use a SE Linux strict configuration .
Does su/sudo improve auditing ?
If you have multiple people with root access to one system it can be difficult to determine who did what .
If you force everyone to use su or sudo then you will have a record of which Unix account was used to start the root session .
Of course if multiple people start root shells via su and leave them running then it can be difficult to determine which of the people who had such shells running made the mistake – but at least that reduces the list of suspects .
If you put “ PermitUserEnvironment yes ” in /etc / ssh / sshd_config then you have the option of setting environment variables by ssh authorized_keys entries , so you could have an entry such as the following :
environment =” ORIG_USER=john@example.com ” ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz[…]/w== john@example.com
Then you could have the . bashrc file ( or a similar file for your favorite shell ) have code such as the following to log the relevant data to syslogd :
if [ " $ SSH_TTY " = " " ] ; then
logger -p auth .
info " user $ ORIG_USER ran command \ " $ BASH_EXECUTION_STRING\ " as root "
else
logger - p auth .
info " user $ ORIG_USER logged in as root on tty $ ( tty ) "
fi
I think that forcing the use of su or sudo might improve the ability to track other sysadmins if the system is not well configured .
But it seems obvious that the same level of tracking can be implemented in other ways with a small amount of effort .
It took me about 30 minutes to devise the above shell code and configuration options , it should take people who read this blog post about 5 minutes to implement it ( or maybe 10 minutes if they use a different shell or have some other combination of Bash configuration that results in non-obvious use of initialisation scripts ( EG if you have a . bash_profile file then . bashrc may not be executed ) .
Once you have the above infrastructure for logging root login sessions it would n’t be difficult to run a little script that asks the sysadmin “ what is the purpose for your root login ” and logs what they type .
If several sysadmins are logged in at the same time and one of them describes the purpose of their login as “ to reconfigure LDAP ” then you know who to talk to if your LDAP server stops working !
Should you run commands with minimum privilege ?
It ’s generally regarded that running each command with the minimum privilege is a good idea .
But if the only reason you login to a server is to do root tasks ( restarting daemons , writing to files that are owned by root , etc ) then there really is n’t a lot of potential for achieving anything by doing so .
If you need to use a client for a particular service ( EG a web browser to test the functionality of a web server or proxy server ) then you can login to a different account for that purpose – the typical sysadmin desktop has a dozen xterms open at once , using one for root access to do the work and another for non -root access to do the testing is probably a good option .
Can root be used for local access ?
Linux Journal has an article about the distribution that used to be known as Lindows ( later Linspire ) which used root as the default login for desktop use [ 2 ] .
It suggests using a non -root account because “ If someone can trick you into running a program or if a virus somehow runs while you are logged in , that program then has the ability to do anything at all ” – of course someone could trick you into running a program or virus that attempts to run sudo ( to see if you enabled it without password checks ) and if that does n’t work waits until you run sudo and sniffs the password ( using pty interception or X event sniffing ) .
The article does correctly note that you can easily accidentally damage your system as root .
Given that the skills of typical Linux desktop users are significantly less than those of typical system administrators it seems reasonable to assume that certain risks of mistake which are significant for desktop users are n’t a big deal with skilled sysadmins .
I think that it was a bad decision by the Lindows people to use root for everything due to the risk of errors .
If you make a mistake on a desktop system as non-root then if your home directory was backed up recently and you use IMAP or caching IMAP for email access then you probably wo n’t lose much of note .
But if you make a serious mistake as root then the minimum damage is being forced to do a complete reinstall , which is time consuming and annoying even if you have the installation media handy and your Internet connection has enough quota for the month to complete the process .
Finally there are some services that seek out people who use the root account for desktop use .
Debian has some support channels on IRC [ 3 ] and I decided to use the root account from my SE Linux Play Machine [ 4 ] to see how they go .
#debian has banned strings matching root .
# linpeople did n’t like me because “ Deopped you on channel # linpeople because it is registered with channel services “ .
# linuxhelp and #help let me in , but nothing seemed to be happening in those channels .
Last time I tried this experiment I had a minor debate with someone who repeated a mantra about not using root and did n’t show any interest in reading my explanation of why root : user_r : user_t is safe for IRC .
I ca n’t imagine that good the #debian people expect to gain from denying people the ability to access that channel with an IRC client that reports itself to be running as root .
Doing so precludes the possibility of educating them if you think that they are doing something wrong ( such as running a distribution like Lindows / Linspire ) .
Conclusion
I routinely ssh directly to servers as root .
I ’ve been doing so for as long as ssh has been around and I used to telnet to systems as root before that .
Logging in to a server as root without encryption is in most cases a really bad idea , but before ssh was invented it was the only option that was available .
For the vast majority of server deployments I think that there is no good reason to avoid sshing directly as root .
From the Editors : Larry King Live Senior Producer Nancy Baker was on site in London for Larry King 's interview with Lady Gaga .
She filed this report :
It ’s not every day that you have the opportunity to meet a global sensation .
I traveled to London this week for Larry King ’s interview with superstar Lady Gaga .
Arranging this special one - on - one – part of our celebration of Larry ’s 25th anniversary with CNN – was no easy task .
Lady Gaga is in the midst of her sold - out world tour , The Monster ’s Ball .
To say her schedule is jam - packed is to understate the case .
Still , her team carved out the time .
The venue was a designated room in the backstage area of the O2 Arena , where Lady Gaga would thrill ( and I do mean THRILL ! ) her fans with a brilliant concert performance just hours later .
Right on time – to the minute – Lady Gaga walked in , accompanied by just three people .
“ Hi everyone , I ’m Gaga , ” she introduced herself to our CNN crew – which was more than three times as large as her modest entourage .
She then proceeded to shake hands with everybody .
She could not have been more gracious .
I – and everybody else on the crew – had wondered what she was going to wear .
She did not disappoint .
Just the opposite .
Lady Gaga paid a witty tribute to Larry by donning a white silk shirt and unique black suspenders .
To add to the visual punch , Larry took his seat on our New York set sporting a black shirt and white suspenders !
Was this study in sartorial opposites planned ahead of time ?
No. Absolutely not .
It was serendipity .
And it added a terrific touch to a unique show .
Lady Gaga was as candid as she was articulate throughout the interview .
Her frankness extended to her very honest comments about growing up in the Roman Catholic Church .
Here 's Jon Stewart doing eight minutes on the promises that Barack Obama has broken on civil liberties since he took office — from arresting whistleblowers to maintaining the suspension of habeas corpus to continuing warrantless wiretaps to sustaining extraordinary rendition to authorizing the execution of American citizens without trial outside of combat zones .
Like I said before : I did n't expect the guy to walk on water , but I 'd love it if he would n't wallow in shit .
Jon Stewart on Obama 's executive power record
I saw this and I could n't believe it .
But then I thought , well , Boehner 's only saying out loud what some Democrats seem to believe anyway :
We can't afford the war AND Social Security , so naturally , Social Security 's gotta get slashed .
Makes perfect sense , right ?
Because , you know , stopping the war would be simply unthinkable !
( And was n't it the Republicans who first promised us the Iraq invasion would pay for itself ? )
Boehner 's criticism of the Democratic agenda then moved to the recently - negotiated financial regulatory reform package , which he likened to " killing an ant with a nuclear weapon . "
According to the Pittsburgh Tribune - Review , Boehner argued that the financial system would be better served by " more transparency and better enforcement by regulators . "
The minority leader also answered questions about Social Security , which he said could not remain solvent as it is currently structured .
Ensuring there 's enough money to pay for the war will require reforming the country 's entitlement system , Boehner said .
He said he'd favor increasing the Social Security retirement age to 70 for people who have at least 20 years until retirement , tying cost - of - living increases to the consumer price index rather than wage inflation and limiting payments to those who need them .
" We need to look at the American people and explain to them that we 're broke , " Boehner said .
" If you have substantial non-Social Security income while you 're retired , why are we paying you at a time when we 're broke ?
We just need to be honest with people .
No , John .
How about you being honest with people ?
Social Security is not broke .
It 's solvent through 2036 and can fund about 80 % of its obligations after that .
All we have to do to fix it is to raise the current tax by one percent , and remove the cap on earnings that made Republicans so happy .
You know that .
You think we have n't noticed the class war in this country ?
You think we 've forgotten that Social Security is pay - as - you - go , and does n't have a damned thing to do with our national deficit .
Why would you say something that 's a bold - faced lie ?
Because the Republicans have been dying to privatize the system ever since it began .
They hate the idea of a financial transaction happening somewhere that does n't make money for their corporate sponsors on Wall Street .
( And let 's not even get into what would have happened to a privatized system in the crash . )
They want workers to be desperate and disposable , grateful for crumbs .
That 's why Republicans always want means - testing .
They want to turn Social Security into a poverty program so it wo n't have such broad - based support .
They 're trying to confuse and worry people with this manufactured deficit " crisis . "
And they 're telling us it 's much more important to keep the war going than to take care of the people in this country .
You saw the unemployment vote last week -- that 's the Republican agenda , in all its naked glory .
They want cheap , disposable labor with no security whatsoever .
And if we do n't do something soon to stop them , we 'll have it .
We take the time to learn about your organization , your values , and your mission .
We evaluate your strategic outcomes -- whether they be fund - or friend - raising , legislative change , community building , online advocacy , etc -- and assess where you are now in relation to those goals .
Then we propose solutions to help you close the gap .
This unique , outcomes - based planning process results in communications initiatives that are tied inextricably to your mission ; acting as proactive drivers of change .
Once we know where you need to go , we devise the channels and tools that will get you there .
We 'll present several design " comps " for your review .
Each will be distinct and fully realized , yet commonly informed by your organization 's goals , audience , and calls - to - action .
You 'll choose the concept you like best and we 'll tweak and revise it until you 're absolutely in love with the final product .
What you see when we deliver your final product will be the pixel - perfect " live " version of what you saw during the concepting phase .
No surprises .
We 'll handle every production detail , from printing and mailing , to site development , to testing , deployment , and launch .
You have important world - saving work to do , after all .

The world of contemporary advertising is increasingly dominated by high - production multimedia events , acts of guerrilla marketing and viral Internet campaigns .
In this context it could be thought that the billboard is becoming eclipsed as an advertising tool .
Advertising and Printing services are also gaining utmost importance .
The reality is that the billboard continues to be a marketing form that produces amazingly inspirational and inventive designs .
This post brings together 20 examples of the coolest billboards of recent years .
Absolut Vodka ’s long - running ad campaign is one of the most successful branding operations in recent history .
This Christmas - themed billboard has the iconic bottle shape formed in illuminated Christmas tree lights .
In Spring 2010 , the MAK Center for Art and Architecture in Los Angeles presented the exhibiting project , How Many Billboards ?
Art in Stead .
The exhibition is an ambitious urban project with 21 leading artists commissioned to create billboard artwork to be sited around the city .
This piece is by artist Kerry Tribe .
BMW ’s ad in central Moscow , at 15 - metres tall and 400 - metres long , is surely one of the biggest billboards ever seen .

Next Friday , June 11th , South Africa will step onto the world stage as host nation of the 2010 FIFA World Cup as the international soccer tournament begins - welcoming 32 teams from around the world .
South Africa was selected as the host six years ago , and has been preparing ever since , building five new stadiums , upgrading five existing stadiums , and building up public transportation , including a new rapid transit railway .
Over the past weeks , the teams and their legions of fans have begun arriving while final preparations are made and and dress rehearsals held for the Opening Ceremony on Friday .
The tournament takes place over a month , ending on July 11th .
Collected here are recent scenes from South Africa as it readies itself to welcome the world .

According to the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation ( JCT ) , the House health care bill passed last Friday empowers the federal government to imprison people for up to five years if they willfully refuse to buy federally regulated and approved health insurance .
Shomari Stone of Komo 4 News in Seattle pressed the Speaker on this point yesterday .

UPDATE : This video has since been marked “ private ” by an unknown party .
We are trying to track down a public version .
UPDATE : It ’s back up !
President Barack Obama recently told ABC News ’ Jake Tapper that he shares Pelosi ’s belief that jail time is an appropriate punishment for not buying health insurance .
Obama did not always believe this .
Debating Hillary Clinton in 2008 , Obama said :
Once the World Cup hosts have got the action under way in South Africa on Friday afternoon the drone of the vuvuzelas might die down and the sound of drums should come through as the second game kicks off in Cape Town .
They might sound straight out of Africa but the drums will be pounding for Uruguay , telling a tale that stretches across oceans , religions and races .
It is entirely fitting that Uruguay grabbed the last place in the 2010 tournament - and not only because they were the first champions .
Africa 's World Cup is surely strengthened by the presence of the country that did most to pioneer the selection of people of African descent .
One of them , Isabelino Gradin , was top scorer in the first Copa America in 1916 .
Three years later he played in the third version of the tournament in Brazil , where his presence had a huge motivational effect on his forbears from Africa , If ever a player deserves a statue for his influence on the development of the global game , it is Gradin .
His presence in the sky blue shirt of Uruguay was not a coincidence .
It was the product of enlightened social policies in the country at the start of the 20th century , where Uruguay attempted to replace the feudal hierarchies so common in South America with a prototype welfare state .
Football came to the continent brought by the British and full of first world prestige .
In Brazil the game endured a difficult journey as it spread down from well - heeled students to the sons of slaves .
The aristocrats fought hard to keep it to themselves .
Policies of social inclusion meant that this process took place quicker in Uruguay .
The country had - and still has - a small population but it was soon able to call on talent from all backgrounds , which helps explain why Uruguay were so good so early .
The drums of candombe - the name of the Uruguayan rhythm - pounded out for Gradin and Jose Leandro Andrade , the hero of the triumphs of the 1920s , and for Obdulio Varela , the great captain of the 1950 side - nowadays they pound out for left wing - back Alvaro Pereira .
But they do n't just pound out for him .
They do so for the whole team .
Candombe has clear African roots but today 's drummers are just as likely to be descendants of Spanish or Italian immigrants .
The rhythm is part of Uruguay 's cultural heritage .
Many of the South African population seem to have adopted Brazil as their second team .
Perhaps they should also follow Uruguay - though not , of course , on 16 June when the Sky Blues are up against the Bafana Bafana and the vuvuzelas will drown out the candombe drums .
South African fans back Uruguay in a warm - up game .

Uruguay are the first South American team in action in the World Cup .
Chile are the last , which is probably just as well - there is more time for centre forward Humberto Suazo to recover from his hamstring injury .
I wonder if the problem Suazo has picked up was avoidable .
If so , it means that coach Marcelo Bielsa has made a mistake with his physical preparation - as almost certainly happened eight years ago .
Bielsa is a self - confessed attack obsessive .
He wants his team to play in the opponent 's half , exerting constant pressure .
It is high - tempo , high - pressure football , which requires a high level of fitness .
Back in 2002 , when Bielsa was in charge of his native Argentina , the players were too drained at the end of the European season to carry out their coach 's attacking ambitions .
In the build - up to the World Cup some of them complained to the Argentine media that they were being worked too hard in training .
Their complaints looked justified when , in the warm - up before the opening match defensive linchpin Roberto Ayala pulled up with a tear and played no part in the competition - an important factor in their first round elimination .
This time , Suazo was carrying a knock when he joined up with the Chile squad last month .
Giving a chance for fans in the provinces to wave off the side , Chile played a number of warm - up friendlies up and down the country .
Suazo stayed out - until the last one against Israel , when he played , scored and then came off at half - time with the hamstring problem that may well force him out of Chile 's first two World Cup ties .
Everything is easy in hindsight , but fielding Suazo against the Israelis looks like a mistake - Diego Maradona , for example , resisted the temptation to play Lionel Messi in Argentina 's farewell game against Canada , even though the Buenos Aires crowd were calling for him .
Messi had taken a knock in training and Maradona decided that the risk of playing him was not worth taking .
Bielsa perhaps wishes he had done the same .
Suazo was South America 's top scorer in qualifying and Chile have no clear replacement for him in their squad .
As former great goalscorer Marcelo Salas put it : " We 're going to miss him a lot because in the system Chile play , the centre forward is either Suazo or it's Suazo . "

Other questions on South American football to vickerycolumn@hotmail.com , and I 'll pick out a couple for next week .
A quick note of apology but I 've got so much on at the moment that I do n't have time to get back individually to all the questions , so I 'm very sorry if you have n't had a reply .
However , please keep sending them in - they all get read and considered and they all help in formulating themes for future columns .
From last week 's postbag :
Q ) Does the economic necessity of exporting the next / new Messi or Kaka lead to young players in South America being hyped too early ?
Stuart Bird
A ) No doubt about it .
The seller has a clear vested interest in hyping his product - remember when Birmingham were talked into believing that Luciano Figueroa was the new Batistuta ?
Also , with so many top players abroad it can be dangerously easy to build up huge reputations in the contemporary domestic game .
It is easy to get caught up in the hype as well - a crime I have been guilty of along the way .
I remember the rise of Robinho .
One pundit , a player with World Cup experience , said that he was going to be better than Maradona !
For all his talent , I think that is taking it way too far and makes it hard for the player to cope when he moves to Europe and finds out that he is not quite as outstanding as he had been led to believe .
I read an excellent article recently on Diego Milito by Juan Pablo Varsky , a very good Argentine journalist , making the point that this is a story of someone who benefited from being a late developer - as a kid nobody was telling Milito that he was some kind of phenomenon and he has grown into a far better player at 30 than he was at 20 .
Q ) I am living in Brazil at the moment and loving the build - up to the World Cup .
One thing has surprised me though - like so many others I am taking part in a World Cup tipping competition but to my surprise not one of my friends or ( girlfriend 's ) relatives here have picked Brazil to win it .
One friend even has them bowing out in the group stage !
I was wondering if this kind of pessimism is normal before a big competition or do Brazilians genuinely not fancy their team 's chances in South Africa ?
If so , why ?
Brendan Clark
A ) Four years ago they all thought that Brazil had won the competition before it started and only had to turn up to collect the trophy .
So they got burned that time .
And this time there are plenty in the media who might have a quiet smirk at Dunga 's failure - he has made plenty of enemies in the press .
Throw in the fact that this side has been constructed on a team - over - stars basis , without the usual hubbub over big names , and it is understandable that this build - up is a bit low key - but nothing that a convincing victory can not put right .
Astronomy .
What 's the first thing you think of when you read that word ?
The many beautiful vistas returned from Hubble ?
A family in a backyard huddled around a small telescope ?
Giant research observatories such as the Keck ?
Whatever may come to mind , it usually involves a telescope .
But the very nature of telescopes has changed over the centuries , with different arrangements of lenses dominating for decades before succumbing to some combination of basic physics or technical limitations .
We 'll ( somewhat belatedly ) celebrate the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's telescope by taking you on a quick tour of four centuries of progress and frustration .
The birth of the lens
As early as the thirteenth century , artisans in Venice and Florence were producing seeing glasses for elderly presbyopic ( long - sightedness caused by age ) scholars .
Magnifying glasses were common among universities and monasteries at the dawn of the fourteenth century , where they became a symbol of wisdom and respect .
These glasses were held against the eye , where , due to their small size and rounded shape , they were named " lentils of glass " or , in the latin , " lenses . "
The glass was n't good by modern standards , having inclusions of air bubbles and a notably greenish tint from iron .
By 1350 , when we see them appear in illustrations , the two - lensed spectacle had been invented in Venice and rapidly became a sign of education and wisdom among the scholars and noble elite of the day .
The fifteenth century saw the convex lens ' opposite appear : the concave lens for myopia , a vision impairment of the young .
We have documentation of these being available as early as 1450 .
The problem solved , nobody seemed to hold any further interest in optics until Thomas Digges , the first astronomer to attempt a measurement of parallax .
Digges ( or his son Leonard , or both — it is n't clear ) used a convex lens and a concave mirror to magnify distant objects , but the shortcomings of such an arrangement were obvious : the observer was in the way of the mirror .
His device was forgotten , and Digges was best remembered for his popularization of the heliocentric system .
In 1608 , Hans Lipperhey in the Netherlands applied for a patent on a pair of lenses , one with a much shorter focal length than the other , arranged in a tube .
He called it a " spyglass " as it allowed the observation of greatly distant events from a secluded retreat — Lipperhey noted that counting coins from afar was a suitable use .
The patent was denied because the device was so very easily constructed .
Lipperhey 's design was biconcave , two concave lenses arranged so as to compress incoming light into a smaller area , where it would appear magnified .
By early 1609 , small spyglasses of two to three powers were being produced by the spectacle makers of Paris and Venice .
By mid-1609 , they were dotted around France and Italy .
In August 1609 , Thomas Harriot is known to have turned such a spyglass on the Moon , but with only three powers , he was unable to correctly discern craters and mountains .
Such a feat would require at least five to six powers .
The spyglass meets astronomy
We need to go back further , though , to see why the telescope was even necessary for astronomy , as obvious as it may seem to the modern reader .
Tycho Brahe and his contemporaries did n't have telescopes , but they did have similar devices to enhance the precision of the eye .
A wall quadrant such as the one Brahe invented ( though ' built ' may be the better word ) could be used to derive the position of a celestial object with great accuracy using no more than one 's naked eye — greater accuracy than a 5 power telescope could manage alone .
The positions that allowed Kepler to nearly derive Newton 's law of universal gravitation were taken using such a device .
Even " almost derive " was good enough ; Kepler 's Laws ( strictly a special case of Newton 's Universal Gravitation where one mass is irrelevant ) were enough to give him a place in the history books , even though he never had the benefit of a telescope .
It was this wall quadrants device that gave birth to the astronomical telescope .
One does not compare the car to the industrial steam engine , even though they share great commonality — one instead compares it to the horse and coach .
Astronomy 's horse and coach were the quadrants , its car was the telescope ; they may be entirely unrelated devices in operation , but they were put to use for the same purpose .
The big breakthrough came when Galileo was informed of Lipperhey 's failure to secure a patent .
He was certainly aware of the Venetian prowess in lens grinding , as well as work in optics that Kepler had done .
Galileo decided to make such a device for himself , inspired by a mixture of Renaissance gung - ho and a desire to make his name .
Presumably , he reasoned that a device able to magnify distant objects would also minimize the uncertainty in their position , providing an improved version of the wall quadrant .
Galilean telescope
What his telescope gave him was nothing short of astonishing : far from simple positions , Galileo discovered mountains on the moon , librations that proved the Moon was spherical and not a flat disc , moons of Jupiter that flew in the face of contemporary Catholic thought , and a view of the Milky Way that indicated it was n't an " atmospheric phenomena , " but rather was made of countless faint stars .
The unquestionably true dogma of many Christians was now unquestionably false .
Galileo began to question the knowledge of Ptolemy , Plato , Pythagoras and Aristotle , setting into motion the golden age of astronomy and its ascendance to being a true science .
THE first day 's operation of a new style of bicycle lane along a key city road left motorists confused and traffic stalled for much of the morning as drivers grappled with the change .
Melbourne City Council in 2008 approved '' Copenhagen - style ' ' cycle lanes for Albert Street , which carries 25,000 cars a day into and out of the CBD .
The council installed the cycle lanes in May , and yesterday its officers began warning motorists not to park in them .

At 9.49 am , motorists are stuck behind parked cars .

During morning and afternoon rush hours , Albert Street will still have two lanes of traffic on each side .
Outside rush hours , however , the inside lane of traffic will turn into parking space - creating a line of parked cars that acts as a buffer for a cycling lane .
The Master Builders Association of Victoria , which has offices on Albert Street , opposed the bike lanes , saying they would endanger cyclists and create a hazard for drivers .
MONTREAL — Canada 's copyright law is so outdated , it is illegal for people to copy CDs onto iPods or to record television shows to be viewed later .
But all that will change if a new copyright law introduced in the House of Commons Wednesday is passed .
Other than legitimizing common practices , however , the new law comes down hard on piracy , making it easier for recording companies and film studios to go after those who share files illegally .
" From the computations that we 've done , ( piracy ) destroys billions of dollars of value per year , " Industry Minister Tony Clement said at a news conference at the Montreal offices of gaming company Electronic Arts — one of the industries that Clement said will benefit greatly from the new law .
Under the proposed law , Internet service providers would be required to notify their users if they receive notice that a copyright has been infringed .
The ISPs would then be required to hold on to the personal information of the infringing member , and to turn it over if a court orders them to do so .
Under the current law , ISPs only notify copyright infringers on a voluntary basis .
Penalties for consumer - based file - sharing will be eased under the law , which will distinguish between those who share files for commercial purposes versus those who do it for their own use .
The latter category will have reduced fines .
Among other changes , the law makes it illegal to circumvent digital locks — even for personal or educational purposes .
This means that no one is permitted to hack into a DVD and share the file on the web , but because there are no exceptions to this rule , someone who backs up a DVD movie has likely committed an infringement , since most DVDs already contain digital locks .
Altering a DVD bought in one of five other regions , such as Europe , in order to enable it to be played on a North American DVD player would also constitute a copyright infringement — a practice that is currently legal .
There is an exemption to the digital lock rule : Someone who purchases a cellular phone may unlock it in order to switch service providers ( from Rogers to Bell , for example ) , assuming the user 's contract with the phone company has ended .
The new bill also relaxes many of the copyright rules for educational purposes , as part of what 's called a fair - dealing clause .
For example , it will allow teachers to use copyrighted materials as part of a lesson , unless there is a digital lock .
This is the second time the Conservative government has introduced changes to the copyright law .
Introduced in 2008 , Bill C - 61 died when the government called an election .
Clement said the new law strikes a balance between the rights ' of consumers and copyright holders , but renowned copyright expert Michael Geist , of the University of Ottawa , called it " regressive . "
" Especially around the issue of digital locks , " Geist said , pointing to the example of book - sharing .
Under the proposed law , he said , people would be able to share books for educational purposes — but not digital books , if they are protected by a digital lock .
Furthermore , teachers would not be allowed to photocopy and distribute books if there is also an electronic version that is digitally locked .
The Business Software Alliance , the Entertainment Software Association of Canada , and the Canadian Film and Television Production Association all welcomed the bill Wednesday .
For its part , the Canadian Association of University Students said the bill should make more exceptions for educational purposes , while the Alliance of Canadian Cinema , Television and Radio Artists said there should be more provisions to compensate artists .
" Half the law is missing , " Stephen Waddell , executive director of the Alliance of Canadian Cinema , Television and Radio Artists said yesterday in a statement .
Backed by a statement of support from Barenaked Ladies band member Kevin Hearn , the alliance said the privacy law should extend the private copying levy , currently added to blank CDs , to iPods and other digital devices .
The Conservative government has rejected adding such a levy , calling it a " tax on iPods . "
ACTRA did n't totally pan the bill .
It welcomed provisions that will better protect against piracy .
That notion was seconded by the Entertainment Software Association of Canada .
" This gives us the tools to go after the large - scale pirates who are really profiting , " said Danielle Parr , the association 's executive director .
How to Play Monkey - Robot - Pirate - Ninja - Zombie ( moropinzee )
In honour of Talk Like a Pirate Day , I thought I ’d revisit my version of the classic rock - paper - scissors , or rochambeau , as it is sometimes known .
As you can see from the schematic below , each thing can beat two other things , and is , in turn beaten by two other things .
The players both count to five ( three ) , though it is obviously better to repeat the name of the game ( Monkey ! Robot !
Pirate ! Ninja ! Zombie ! ) .
Each time you raise your fist and swing it down .
On the fifth ( third ) count , you form your hand into one of the five gestures .
( It is recommended that in addition to the hand gesture , you also add an aural component to this — see below for suggested noises . )
So , what beats what , and what are the gestures ?
What ?
Monkey
Monkey fools Ninja
Monkey unplugs Robot
Suggested noise : ee-ee-eek !
Robot
Robot chokes Ninja
Robot crushes Zombie
Suggested noise : ex - ter - min-ate !
Pirate
Pirate drowns Robot
Pirate skewers Monkey
Suggested noise : arrrrr !
Ninja
Ninja karate chops Pirate
Ninja decapitates Zombie
Suggested noise : keeee - ah !
Zombie
Zombie eats Pirate
Zombie savages Monkey
Suggested noise : braaaaaaaaaainsss !
There is a logic to the hand gestures provided , and with any luck they are perfectly obvious .
Now , you may be wondering , “ Mark , are you totally insane ?
Are you procrastinating , perchance ?
Or are you just bored ? ”
The answer is yes .
Update : based on a scientific survey of the comments , Twitter and Facebook updates , “ moropinzee ” seems to be the easiest name for this game to remember .
Someone also had the excellent notion that there could be a full - body dance to celebrate a win .
Swirlee.com had an earlier concept , and I ’ve come up with the hand signs , graphics and sound effects .
( I ’ve also seen it on some message boards too , so yeah , a little derivative . )

A chaotic predawn confrontation at an Antioch home where marijuana was being grown ended Tuesday morning with a 15 - year - old home - invasion suspect dead and the couple who live there critically wounded by gunfire , police said .
The triple shooting happened at 4:30 a.m. in a four - bedroom home on the 1300 block of Aster Drive occupied by a man and woman and their two small children , said Antioch police Capt .
Allan Cantando .
Two rooms contained young marijuana plants , Cantando said .
The residents called 911 , saying they had been awakened by a group of teenagers breaking into their one - story home through a rear window .
During a confrontation , the homeowners , a 35 - year - old male and his wife , were shot numerous times , police said .
The woman was shot as she ran down a hallway , authorities said .
15 - year - old killed
The male homeowner shot and killed a 15 - year - old suspect and held a 17 - year - old suspect at gunpoint until police arrived , Cantando said .
It was n't clear whether he used his own gun or had wrestled a gun away from one of the suspects .
The identities of the two teens and the homeowners were not released .
Antioch and Pittsburg police , along with Contra Costa County sheriff 's deputies , K - 9 units and the California Highway Patrol , were searching for the third assailant , who escaped through the rear window .
Authorities say he may have been injured because a blood trail was found immediately outside .
The residents were airlifted to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek , where they were listed in critical condition , said Sgt. Diane Aguinaga .
Their two children , a 10 - month - old girl and 2 - year - old boy , were unhurt and are now in the custody of their grandmother , police said .
Police said they were investigating whether the youths were after the marijuana or money generated from the plants and whether the marijuana was being grown for medical reasons .
" Indoor marijuana grows are getting more common , " Cantando said , but the operation at the house where the shooting occurred " was not on our radar . "
2007 home invasion
The shooting comes three years after a deadly robbery in Pittsburg of a home filled with marijuana and owned by PC World magazine Editor Rex Farrance .
Farrance , 59 , was shot and killed in the January 2007 home - invasion robbery and his wife was pistol - whipped .
Three men were convicted in the case .
Farrance 's family has said that the men decided to target the home after learning from his son's friend that marijuana was grown in the home and money would be readily available .
Tuesday 's slaying in Antioch frazzled residents in a neighborhood that has signs declaring it a " Drug Free Zone . "
Brian Schmid , 27 , who lives on adjacent West 18th Street , said he frequently smelled marijuana wafting from the home when he parked his car , but never imagined that violence could erupt .
" I pretty much knew it was coming from there , " Schmid said .
" It 's a tragedy .
I just do n't see how something like marijuana could be worth someone 's life .
It 's not worth it . "
Danielle Solorio , 33 , who also lives on West 18th , said other homes in the neighborhood have been targeted by burglars .
" I'm terrified , " Solorio said .
" I have two small children in my house .
At first I was just thinking it was a drug deal gone bad - that sucks , but when it 's an invasion and killing , it 's very scary .
I want out . "
A new report blasts the Federal Reserve and the Treasury for their handling of the AIG crisis .
Panel : AIG bailout ' poisonous '
A new report by the panel created to oversee spending under the Troubled Asset Relief Program blasts the Federal Reserve and the Treasury for creating the too - big - to - fail problem with its handling of the American International Group crisis in 2008 .
The Congressional Oversight Panel report condemns government officials for the initial September 2008 decision , backed by then - Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson , to save the company from collapse by lending it $ 85 billion in taxpayer funds from the Federal Reserve to save the insurance behemoth .
While the loans from the Treasury and Fed eventually grew to over $ 200 billion , the report aims its fire at the initial decision to bail out AIG , rather than letting it fail .

" The government ’s actions in rescuing AIG continue to have a poisonous effect on the marketplace , " the report says .
" The AIG rescue demonstrated that Treasury and the Federal Reserve would commit taxpayers to pay any price and bear any burden to prevent the collapse of America ‘s largest financial institutions and to assure repayment to the creditors doing business with them . "
The panel ’s report was issued just after midnight Thursday morning , the same day that members of the House and Senate will be conferencing to reconcile their versions of the Wall Street bill aimed at preventing future AIGs .
Federal Reserve and Treasury officials should have tried much harder to save AIG without using taxpayer money , said Elizabeth Warren , a Harvard Law School bankruptcy professor and chairwoman of the panel .
" The negotiations would have been difficult , and they might have failed , " she said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters .
" But the benefits of crafting a private or even a joint public - private solution were so superior to the cost of a complete government bailout that they should have been pursued as vigorously as humanly possible . "
The panel has embraced its role as watchdog , to the discomfort of federal officials .
In March , it roundly criticized the Treasury for what it calls lax oversight of Citigroup .
" If the regulators do n't ask for the information that reveals the gaps in the firm 's own understanding of its risks , then the regulators have failed profoundly , " Warren said .
On June 1 , AIG announced that its plan to sell its Asian insurance business had fallen apart , slowing the process of returning money to the government .
As of May 27 , the company still owed the Fed $ 26.1 billion , according to the report .
Federal officials have defended their oversight of the insurance giant , which reported total losses of $ 110 billion in 2008 and 2009 and is nearly 80 percent owned by taxpayers .
Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a hearing before the House Budget Committee Wednesday morning that he believes AIG will eventually repay taxpayers fully .
Innovation in Education
Where are all the science majors ?
FORTUNE --
In a move to measure its workforce not too long ago , Nationwide Insurance surveyed its 36,000 employees at the time .
Its CEO was in for a shock .
The single largest employment category had nothing to do with insurance and was instead " technology . "
The story is told by Brian Fitzgerald , executive director of the Business - Higher Education Forum ( BHEF ) , to dramatize the transformation of the U.S. workforce .
At Nationwide , an entire upper tier of computer scientists had to be brought in from India because the company did n't have enough in Ohio .
" You can be selling insurance or manufacturing cars , " Fitzgerald says , " but almost every American corporation has been turned into a technology operation . "
Nationwide ( NFS ) is n't alone .
The number of computer science degrees awarded to U.S. citizens from 2004 to 2007 ( the latest figures available ) declined 27 % , according to the National Science Board .
But the shortfall is n't just in computer science .
Neither universities nor high schools are preparing enough U.S. students in so - called STEM subjects : science , technology , engineering , and math .
While observers blame different causes -- lousy secondary schools , boring college courses , lazy students -- few deny a crisis exists .
For every new Ph.D. in the physical sciences , according to the Aerospace Industries Association , the U.S. graduates 50 new MBAs and 18 lawyers ; more than half of those with bachelor of science degrees still enter careers having nothing to do with science .
The ACT testing service says only 17 % of high school seniors are both interested in STEM majors and have attained math proficiency .
Even among students who begin college pursuing a STEM degree , only half wind up with one .
Finding new STEM teachers has become especially urgent :
As of two years ago , nearly 60 % of U.S. workers with STEM degrees were 45 and older .
It used to be that universities did n't particularly worry about the number of STEM grads .
But that was before the days of Google and the ravenous demand for technologists .
Colleges are only starting to adapt .
Calculus has long been known as a " STEM killer , " so many schools are trying to get away from passive lectures and make students learn interactively with computers .
Engineering schools are trying to introduce jazzier real - world problems into the curriculum .
The Obama administration has focused on lower levels in the educational food chain .
Earlier this year the President announced $ 250 million in federal spending and private investment to hire thousands of math and science schoolteachers .
For its part , BHEF has attempted to think anew about old assumptions , like the belief that smaller class size boosts student achievement .
Working with BHEF , Raytheon ( RTN , Fortune 500 ) systems engineers tried to gauge the effects of raising pay on attracting teacher talent ; the analysis showed it might just result in higher pay across competing professions .
Smaller classes , for example , may simply mean less qualified teachers get hired because of inadequate supply .
Fitzgerald himself well understands the STEM challenge :
In 1970 he started college as a chemistry major -- and graduated with a literature degree .
Before Stephen Colbert , There Was Bob Hope Bob Hope , the original political comedian , gently skewered presidents .
June 19 , 2010  -- From Franklin D. Roosevelt to Bill Clinton , there was one man who spoofed and satirized 11 United States presidents on a national stage -- Bob Hope .
Sharp but never too pointed in his criticisms , he always got big laughs .
Now , the Library of Congress in Washington , D.C. , is celebrating Hope 's humor and his unique way with the White House in an exhibit called " Hope for America : Performers , Politics & Pop Culture . "
Through the years ,
Hope was often the one to get the president 's ear .
" Normally I do n't go for too many political jokes , " quipped Hope .
" Too many of them are getting elected . "
Hope also loved taking shots at America 's political system .
He famously once said , " No one party can fool all of the people all of the time .
That 's why we have two parties . "
Hope was always asked the inevitable question -- would he consider running for office ?
He once told Johnny Carson he would n't because " The money 's not right .
And I would n't want to be president because [ Hope 's wife ]
Dolores would n't want to move into a house that 's smaller . "
Alan Gevinson , the exhibition 's curator , explains Hope 's affable relationship with the Commanders - in - Chief he teased on a nightly basis by saying , " The Presidents felt comfortable with his manner of joke . "
Also known for his self - deprecating humor , Hope 's jokes were often at his own expense .
After seeing his image on a medal presented to him by President Kennedy , Hope remarked , " I told Senator Simon I should have had a nose job .
But he said there would 've been less gold . "
The exhibit replaces a previous one that ran for 10 years called , " Bob Hope and American Variety , " which focused on Hope and vaudeville .
Now , for the first time , the Library is publicly displaying 85,000 pages of Hope 's joke files .
He died in 2003 at the age of 100 , but donated his recordings and collection to the Library .
The exhibition also features personal papers , radio broadcasts , TV appearances , and films from the Bob Hope Collection donated to the Library by the Hope family in 1998 .
Visitors can view the documents on digital kiosks in the exhibit .
Also on display are Hope 's Presidential Medal of Freedom and his famous golf club .
The humanitarian side of Hope is also highlighted , including his commitment to entertaining American troops stationed abroad .
He began making the trademark trips in 1941 and continued to do so throughout his life .
While Hope is the focus of the exhibition , it also traces the evolution of 20th century political humor and explores the 1960s surge of mainstream political satire through entertainers like Elaine May and George Carlin .
The exhibit observes that " For better or worse , politicians and entertainers have dominated the public life in America for much of the 20th century . "
And into the 21th century , the exhibit shows with clips of Sarah Palin and Tina Fey .
The exhibition begins with a video tribute from the comedian who now delivers many of the political punches , Stephen Colbert .
Colbert sums up Hope 's contribution to comedy , politics , and the American consciousness by saying , " No entertainer did more than Bob Hope . "

Members of the UK government struck down part of its controversial Digital Economy Bill on Wednesday , but opted for legislation which may be equally contentious .
Ministers wanted the power to change laws surrounding online copyrights without having to seek parliament 's approval .
Lords struck it down , calling it objectionable , but its replacement is also prompting criticism .
The bill , which passed through the Lords by 165 votes to 140 , now enables the High Court to issue an injunction against sites suspected of hosting material that infringes copyright and effectively force them to shut down .
Detractors criticized the bill saying the new amendment would allow ministers to systematically monitor user data even when no illegal activity has taken place .
But government officials said it would provide a mechanism to thwart piracy and enforce copyrights now and as technology evolves .
There are several sites out there on the web , many of which are based outside the UK , which refuse to stop supplying access to illegal content - indeed whose business plan depends on supplying illegal content , Lord Clement - Jones said .
This site - blocking remedy would give rights holders an explicit , swift recourse to courts to block access to those sites .
The Internet Service Providers ' Association ( ISPA ) , a body that represents the interests of Internet providers , urged supporters to urgently reconsider their position .
We regret that this amendment has been hastily constructed and rushed through at report stage without due consideration of the implications or consultation with the interested parties that would be affected , ISPA said .
The Open Rights Group , an organization that promotes transparency and democracy , said the amendment was appalling , saying users are now faced with a choice between future proof copyright enforcement , and an approach likely to produce straightforward threats , bans and withdrawals of sites with user generated content .
PARIS — The French government said it plans to increase the retirement age , setting up a battle with unions who want the French to continue retiring earlier than most other Europeans .
The government said it plans to introduce a bill to raise the retirement age from the current minimum of 60 — though it did n't say to what age — and create a new tax on high earners , to try to fix the nation 's debt - choked pension system .
Unions have scheduled a nationwide demonstration on May 27 to protest the proposed overhaul .
The sparring comes as France and other European countries are under pressure to rein in their budget deficits after the Greek debt crisis caused financial chaos .
France has the same high credit rating as Germany , but some economists are concerned that Paris could suffer a downgrade unless it demonstrates budget discipline .
" It 's a litmus test , " said economist Christian Saint - Etienne , head of the Générations Citoyennes think tank .
" France 's creditworthiness is at stake . "
When he was at Harvard , Conan O'Brien and some friends stole a costume from the actor who played Robin .
Funny prank !
Here 's another : O'Brien just submitted his version of The Tonight Show to the Emmys , to compete against Leno .
Now , O'Brien 's Tonight Show will compete against Jay Leno's Tonight Show in the category of best variety show .
Hee hee haw haw .
But both will be competing against The Daily Show , whose writers use Emmys to prop up their uneven coffee tables , so neither of them will probably win anyway .
Still , how dare O'Brien besmirch what some call the Nobel Prize of Television !
We are now going to care even less about the Emmys than we usually do .

IRS Notice – What to do if You Receive One
Every year , the Internal Revenue Service sends millions of notices and letters to taxpayers .
The IRS sends notices for various reasons , typically for problems with a prior tax return .
The IRS takes several months to process returns and they normally start sending a strong push of IRS notices to taxpayers beginning mid June each year .
Here are a few things to keep in mind if you receive an IRS notice :
Do not panic and make things worse on yourself .
Just because you receive an IRS notice does not mean that you owe thousands of dollars or are heading directly to prison .
Many of these notices can be dealt with quickly and easily .
An IRS notice will more than likely cover one very specific issue .
Some of the most common include : notify you of a change to your account , request payment of back taxes , or ask for additional information .
Make sure you read your IRS notice carefully so you know what is being asked of you .
If you receive an IRS notice asking for a correction , compare this information to your return to see if it is accurate .
Is the correction accurate ?
If so , you probably do not need to do anything else .
Of course , if you owe money or the notice tells you that further action is needed you should comply .
What about a correction that you do not agree with ?
In this case , you need to take additional steps to fix the problem .
It is your responsibility to respond in writing telling the IRS why you do not agree .
Along with this explanation , you should include documents that back up your claim .
After doing so , you should give the IRS up to 30 days to respond .
You are not left out in the dark when you receive a notice .
Instead , the IRS includes specific instructions that you are asked to follow .
Most IRS notices are self explanatory .
The majority of people who receive a notice do not need to call the IRS or visit a local office .
But if you do have a question or concern , you can contact the IRS at the number listed on your notice .
Keep copies of all notices and letters that you receive .
Along with this , make copies of any correspondence that you send back .
Are you interested in learning more about IRS notices ?
If so , you should review Publication 594 , The IRS Collection Process .
Also , details concerning penalties and interest are available in Publication 17 , Your Federal Income Tax for Individuals .
If you receive one of these , there is no reason to panic .
The IRS sends notices to millions of taxpayers , and as long as you comply with their request you do not have anything to worry about .
Typical IRS notices are part of an automated procedure used by the IRS and if there is a serious problem , you will have time fix .
Be sure to keep in mind that the IRS is willing to work with taxpayers on any tax problem and the sooner it is resolved , the less the consequences will be .

Reader Jeff Semenak , who lives in Lansing , reports that the Lansing State Journal courthouse notes occasionally mention that someone has been convicted of “ seducing an unmarried woman . ”
I checked and indeed found over 30 such notes from 2002 to 2008 .
The statute , Michigan Penal Code § 750.532 , provides ,
Any man who shall seduce and debauch any unmarried woman shall be guilty of a felony , punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 5 years or by fine of not more than 2,500 dollars ….
One story on the subject , John Schneider , It ’s a Crime , Lansing State Journal , Feb. 15 , 2000 , at 1B , reports that ,
[ A] ssistant Ingham County Prosecutor Sam Smith … explained that in the case that appeared in the newspaper , simple seduction was n’t the original charge .
The man was charged with a more serious offense .
The seduction plea became , as Smith put it , the “ resolution ” to the case .
That ’s most often how it ’s employed , Smith said — as a “ reasonable resolution . ”
Smith stopped short of saying that consensual sex between consenting unmarried adults would never be prosecuted as a crime , but admitted it would be rare .
Of course if one of the parties is married , the crime becomes adultery , but that ’s rarely prosecuted , either , Smith said .
But this still strikes me as wrong .
Say someone refuses to accept such a “ reasonable resolution ” and pleads not guilty , perhaps because he claims the sex was consensual and that he should n’t have to go to jail for it .
Nothing in the law keeps the prosecutor from charging the person both with the more serious offense ( presumably rape ) and with seduction , so that even if the jurors accept the man ’s story , they ’ll still convict him of seduction .
I do n’t think we should put our trust in the noblesse oblige of prosecutors when it comes to sex crimes any more than when it comes to speech crimes .
Seduction should n’t be criminal just so that prosecutors find it easier to reach plea bargains in rape cases .
Otherwise , why not just make all sex — or for that matter all breathing — a crime ?
That will make it even easier for prosecutors to reach a “ reasonable resolution ” plea bargain whenever they think a defendant is guilty of a crime ( a sex crime or otherwise ) but doubt that they ’ll be able to prove it .
Guide
To understand Vows , we 're going to start with a general overview of the different components involved in writing tests , and then go through some of them in more detail .
Structure of a test suite
Test suites in Vows are the largest unit of tests .
The convention is to have one test suite per file , and have the suite 's subject match the file name .
Test suites are created with vows .
describe .
var suite = vows.describe(' subject ' ) ;
Tests are added to suites in batches .
This is done with the addBatch method .
suite.addBatch({} ) ;
You can add as many batches to a suite as you want .
Batches are executed sequentially .
suite.addBatch({/* run 1st */}).addBatch({/* 2nd */}).addBatch({/* 3rd */} ) ;
Chaining batches is useful when you want to test functionality in a certain order .
Batches contain contexts , which describe different components and states you want to test .
suite.addBatch ({ ' A context ' : {} , ' Another context ' : {} } ) ;
Contexts are executed in parallel , they are fully asynchronous .
The order in which they finish is therefore undefined .
Contexts usually contain topics and vows , which in combination define your tests .
suite.addBatch ({ ' A context ' : { topic : function ( ) {/*
Do something async */} , ' I am a vow ' : function ( topic ) { /*
Test the result of the topic */ } } , ' Another context ' : {} } ) ;
Contexts can contain sub-contexts which get executed as soon as the parent context finishes :
suite.addBatch ({ ' A context ' : { topic : function ( ) {/*
Do something async */} , ' I am a vow ' : function ( topic ) { /*
Test the result of the topic */ } , ' A sub - context ' : { /*
Executed when the tests above finish running */ } } , ' Another context ' : { /*
Executed in parallel to ' A context ' */ } } ) ;
Summary
» A Suite is an object which contains zero or more batches , and can be executed or exported .
» A batch is an object literal , representing a structure of nested contexts .
» A context is an object with an optional topic , zero or more vows and zero or more sub-contexts .
» A topic is either a value or a function which can execute asynchronous code .
» A vow is a function which receives the topic as an argument , and runs assertions on it .
With that in mind , we can imagine the following grammar :
Suite → Batch * Batch → Context * Context → Topic ?
Vow * Context *
Here 's an annotated example :
vows.describe(' Array') .addBatch ({ // Batch ' An array ' : { // Context ' with 3 elements ' : { // Sub-Context topic : [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , // Topic 'has a length of 3 ' : function ( topic ) { // Vow assert.equal(topic.length , 3 ) ; } } , ' with zero elements ' : { // Sub -Context topic : [ ] , // Topic 'has a length of 0 ' : function ( topic ) { // Vow assert.equal(topic.length , 0 ) ; } , 'returns * undefined * , when `pop ( ) `ed ' : function ( topic ) { assert.isUndefined(topic.pop ( ) ) ; } } } } ) ;
How topics work
Understanding topics is one of the keys to understanding Vows .
Unlike other testing frameworks ,
Vows forces a clear separation between the element which is tested , the topic , and the actual tests , the vows .
Let 's start with a simple example of a context :
{ topic : 42 , ' should be equal to 42 ' : function ( topic ) { assert.equal ( topic , 42 ) ; } }
So this shows us that the value of the topic is passed down to our test function ( refered to as a vow from now on ) as an argument .
Simple enough .
Now let 's look at an equivalent example , written differently :
{ topic : function ( ) { return 42 } , ' should be equal to 42 ' : function ( topic ) { assert.equal ( topic , 42 ) ; } }
Same thing .
Topics can be functions too .
The return value becomes the topic .
Now what if we have multiple vows ?
{ topic : function ( ) { return 42 } , ' should be a number ' : function ( topic ) { assert .isNumber ( topic ) ; } , ' should be equal to 42 ' : function ( topic ) { assert.equal ( topic , 42 ) ; } }
It works as expected , the value is passed down to each vow .
Note that the topic function is only run once .
Scope
Sometimes , you might need a parent topic 's value , from inside a child topic .
This is easy , because there is a notion of topic scope .
Let 's look at an example :
{ topic : new ( DataStore ) , ' should respond to `get ( ) ` and `put ( ) `' : function ( store ) { assert.isFunction ( store.get ) ; assert.isFunction ( store.put ) ; } , ' calling `get ( 42 ) `' : { topic : function ( store ) { return store. get ( 42 ) } , ' should return the object with id 42 ' : function ( topic ) { assert.equal ( topic.id , 42 ) ; } } }
In the example above , the value of the top - level topic is passed as an argument to the inner topic , in the same manner it 's passed to the vows .
For clarity , I named both arguments which refer to the outer topic as store .
Note that the scoping is n't limited to a single level .
Consider :
topic : function ( a , /* Parent topic */ b , /* Parent of parent topic */ c /* Parent of parent of parent topic */) {}
So the parent topics are passed along to each topic function in the certain order : the immediate parent is always the first argument ( a ) , and the outer topics follow ( b , then c ) , like the layers of an onion .
Running a suite
The simplest way to run a test suite , is with the run method :
vows.describe('subject').addBatch ({/* ... */}).run ( ) ;
The run method takes an optional callback , which is called when all tests are done running .
The test results are passed to the callback ( if provided ) , as an object :
{ honored : 145 , broken : 4 , errored : 1 , pending : 0 , total : 150 , time : 5.491 } ;
Now if we want to execute this test suite , assuming it's in subject - test.js , we just do :
$ node subject - test.js
The results will be printed to the console with the default reporter , ' dot - matrix ' .
Exporting the suite
When your tests become more complex , spanning multiple files , you 're going to need a way to run them as a single entity .
Vows has a test runner called vows , which you can use to run multiple test suites at once .
To make use of it , you need to export your tests , instead of just running them .
There 's a couple of ways to do that , the easiest is through the export method :
// subject - test.js vows.describe(' subject').addBatch ({/* ... */}).export ( module ) ;
export takes one argument , the module you want to export the test suite to .
Fortunately , node provides a global variable called module , which is a reference to the current module .
Now to run that file with the test runner , we can do :
$ vows subject - test.js
The result should be identical to running it directly with node .
The difference is that we can now do :
$ vows test /*
to run all the tests in our test / folder , and get combined results .
We can also pass options to vows .
For example , to get a " spec style " output , pass the -- spec flag .
The reference section has more information on the different options you can pass to it .
Another way to export your test suites is by simply adding them to the exports object , the same way you would export an API to a library :
exports.suite1 = vows.describe(' suite one ' ) ; exports.suite2 = vows.describe(' suite two ' ) ;
So let 's recap
// subject - test.js //
A test suite , describing ' subject ' vows.describe(' subject ') //
Create the suite , describing ' subject ' .addBatch({} ) //
Add the 1st batch .addBatch ({} ) //
Add a 2nd batch .addBatch ({} ) // Add a 3rd batch .export ( module ) ; // Export it
Writing asynchronous tests
Before diving into asynchronous testing , make sure you read the section about topics .
Let 's say we want to test that a certain file exists , and satisfies a couple criteria .
As you know , we do n't ' return ' a value from an asynchronous function call -- the value is passed to the callback function .
So how can we do that with topics ?
Take a look :
{ topic : function ( ) { fs.stat ('~/ FILE ' , this .callback ) ; } , ' can be accessed ' : function ( err , stat ) { assert.isNull ( err ) ; //
We have no error assert .isObject ( stat ) ; //
We have a stat object } , ' is not empty ' : function ( err , stat ) { assert.isNotZero ( stat.size ) ; //
The file size is > 0 } }
The key here is the special ' this .
callback ' function , which is available inside all topics .
When this .
callback is called , it passes on the arguments it received to the test functions , one by one , as if the values were returned by the topic function itself .
In essence , this allows us to decouple the callback from the async function call .
This is how Vows keeps track of all the asynchronous calls , and can warn you if something has n't returned .
Note that topics which make use of ' this .
callback ' must not return anything .
And likewise , topics which do not return anything must make use of ' this .
callback '.
EventEmitters
Vows also supports EventEmitter - based async out of the box , so if that works better for your purpose , you can return an instance of EventEmitter from a topic , and the tests will be run when it emits a " success " or " error " event :
{ topic : function ( ) { var emitter = new ( events .
EventEmitter ) ; fs.stat ( '~ / FILE ' , function ( e , res ) { if ( e ) { emitter .emit( ' error ' , e ) } else { emitter .emit( ' success ' , res ) } } ) ; return emitter ; } , ' can be accessed ' : function ( err , stat ) { assert.isNull ( err ) ; //
We have no error assert .isObject ( stat ) ; //
We have a stat object } , ' is not empty ' : function ( err , stat ) { assert.isNotZero ( stat.size ) ; //
The file size is > 0 } }
Order of execution and parallelism
We talked about how batches and contexts are executed briefly , but it 's now time to delve into it in more detail :
{ topic : function ( ) { fs.stat ('~/FILE ' , this .callback ) ; } , ' after a successful `fs.stat` ' : { topic : function ( stat ) { fs.open ( '~/ FILE ' , " r " , stat. mode , this .callback ) ; } , ' after a successful `fs.open` ' : { topic : function ( fd , stat ) { fs.read ( fd , stat.size , 0 , " utf8 " , this .callback ) ; } , 'we can `fs.read` to get the file contents ' : function ( data ) { assert .isString ( data ) ; } } } }
In the example above , we make use of nested contexts to mimic nested callbacks .
As you can tell , the result of the parent topic is passed down to its children , as arguments .
This example as a whole is therefore mostly sequential , while remaining asynchronous .
Now let 's look at an example which uses parallel tests to check for some devices :
{ '/ dev/stdout ' : { topic : function ( ) { path.exists ('/ dev/ stdout ' , this .callback ) } , ' exists ' : function ( result ) { assert.isTrue ( result ) } } , '/ dev/tty ' : { topic : function ( ) { path.exists ('/dev/tty ' , this .callback ) } , ' exists ' : function ( result ) { assert.isTrue ( result ) } } , '/ dev/ null ' : { topic : function ( ) { path.exists ('/ dev/null ' , this .callback ) } , ' exists ' : function ( result ) { assert.isTrue ( result ) } } }
So in this case , the tests can finish in any order , and must not rely on each other .
The test suite will exit when the last I/O call completes , and the assertions for it are run .
In other words , sibling contexts are executed in parallel , while nested contexts are executed sequentially .
Note that this all happens asynchronously , so while some contexts may be waiting for a parent context to finish , sibling contexts can still execute in the meantime .
Assertions
Vows extends the assertion module which comes bundled with node , with many useful functions , as well as better error reporting for the existing ones .
It 's always best to use the more specific assertion functions when testing a value , you 'll get much better error reporting , because your intention is clearer .
Let 's say we have the following array :
var ary = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ;
and try to assert that it has 5 elements .
With the built - in assert.equal , we would do something like this :
assert.equal(ary.length , 5 ) ;
And get the following error :
expected 5 , got 3
Now let 's try that with one of our more specific assertion functions , assert.lengthOf :
assert.lengthOf(ary , 5 ) ;
This reports the following error :
expected [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] to have 5 elements
Other useful assertion functions bundled with vows include assert .
match , assert.instanceOf , assert.include and assert.isEmpty -- head over to the reference to get the full list .
Macros
Sometimes , it 's useful to abstract tests which are used throughout the test suite .
A batch in Vows , is a tree - like data structure -- an Object literal to be precise .
This proves to be pretty powerful , as you 'll see .
One of the things I have to test in the majority of the code I write are HTTP status codes .
So let 's first look at the straightforward way of doing this , given an asynchronous client library :
{ topic : function ( ) { client.get ( '/ resources /42 ' , this .callback ) ; } , ' should respond with a 200 OK ' : function ( e , res ) { assert.equal ( res.status , 200 ) ; } }
Not too bad .
But we might have a hundred of these , if we 're testing an API .
So let 's see what we can do with macros :
function assertStatus ( code ) { return function ( e , res ) { assert.equal ( res.status , code ) ; } ; }
This is a function which takes a status code , and returns a function which tests for that status code .
We can now improve our test like this :
{ topic : function ( ) { client.get ( '/ resources /42 ' , this .callback ) ; } , ' should respond with a 200 OK ' : assertStatus ( 200 ) }
Much better .
How about the topic ?
Let 's write a macro for our API calls :
var api = { get : function ( path ) { return function ( ) { client.
get ( path , this .callback ) ; } ; } } ;
And rewrite our tests :
{ topic : api.get ( '/ resources /42 ' ) , ' should respond with a 200 OK ' : assertStatus ( 200 ) }
Fantastic .
Here 's a an example of what these macros could look like :
{ ' GET /' : { topic : api.get ('/' ) , ' should respond with a 200 OK ' : assertStatus ( 200 ) } , ' POST /' : { topic : api.post ('/' ) , ' should respond with a 405 Method not allowed ' : assertStatus ( 405 ) } , ' GET / resources ( no api - key ) ' : { topic : api.get ( '/ resources ' ) , ' should respond with a 403 Forbidden ' : assertStatus ( 403 ) } , ' GET / resources?apikey=af816e859c249fe ' : { topic : api.get ('/resources?apikey=af816e859c249fe ' ) , ' should return a 200 OK ' : assertStatus ( 200 ) , ' should return a list of resources ' : function ( res ) { assert .isArray ( res.body ) ; } } }
Can we push it further ?
Of course we can , and this is when it gets really interesting .
I 'm going to show you how you can generate contextual tests .
Instead of having a separate function which generates a topic , and another one which generates a vow , we 're going to have a function which generates a context which contains both a topic and a vow .
The topic will perform a contextual request .
This is the interesting part : we 're going to parse the context description to generate the api requests .
So the test will be encoded within its description .
Let 's look at a possible implementation :
// //
Send a request and check the response status . // function respondsWith ( status ) { var context = { topic : function ( ) { //
Get the current context 's name , such as " POST / " // and split it at the space .
var req = this.context.name.split(/ +/) , // [ " POST " , " / " ] method = req [ 0].toLowerCase ( ) , // " post " path = req [ 1 ] ; // " / " //
Perform the contextual client request , // with the above method and path .
client [ method ] ( path , this .callback ) ; } } ; // Create and assign the vow to the context .
//
The description is generated from the expected status code // and status name , from node 's http module .
context [ ' should respond with a ' + status + ' ' + http.STATUS_CODES[status ] ] = assertStatus ( status ) ; return context ; }
Now the first three contexts of our batch can be re-written as :
{ ' GET /' : respondsWith ( 200 ) , ' POST /' : respondsWith ( 405 ) , ' GET / resources ( no key ) ' : respondsWith ( 403 ) }
And when run , we get :
GET / ✓ should respond with a 200 OK POST / ✓ should respond with a 405 Method Not Allowed GET / resources ( no key ) ✓ should respond with a 403 Forbidden
The fourth context is a little more complex , as it has two vows , but I 'll let you figure that one out !

Students at the Friedrich Schiller University of Jena have made an awesome looking bipedal humanoid robot using nothing but Legos !
“ Pinocchio “ , as the robot is called , may be suspended from strings , but it can mimic the human gait right down to the swinging leg motion and heel - toe step .
It was created to teach the students about robotic walking and programming techniques .
This latest creation using a Lego Mindstorms kit demonstrates the versatility of the platform that is slowly shedding its amateur status and producing increasingly impressive devices .
Check out Pinnochio in the ultra - brief video below .
We keep running into awesome looking robots built with nothing more than ingenuity and the Lego Mindstorms system .
There have been bots that balance on two wheels , function as ATMs , even solve Rubik ’s cubes .
Now , it looks like the platform is even finding good use in academia .
Pinnochio is the student project of Marc Heydenreich and Eric Jabor under the direction of Martin Grimmer of the LaufLabor at Uni Jena .
The LaufLabor has used Lego for student projects in the past , including a basketball shooting arm by Sebastian Carthusians and a ball kicking leg by Astrid Hartensetin .
Both are available to watch on YouTube .
All of these Lego projects bring an element of fun to robotics , but they still teach rigorous programming skills .
Pinnochio has the two phase gait ( swing / stance ) that characterizes proper human locomotion .
The Lego Mindstorms platform has been serving as a de facto learning tool for a while now , helping amateur / semi-professional robotics engineers try out new ideas on the cheap .
Perhaps with more projects like Pinocchio the system will find a formal place in robotics education .
And who knows , with the right advancements and effort the robot may be made to eventually mimic its namesake – cutting its strings and learning to walk on its own .

It has been hiding in plain sight for the past 500 years , and now two Johns Hopkins professors believe they have found it : one of Michelangelo ’s rare anatomical drawings in a panel high on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel .
Michelangelo was a conscientious student of human anatomy and enthusiastically dissected corpses throughout his life , but few of his anatomical drawings survive .
This one , a depiction of the human brain and brain stem , appears to be drawn on the neck of God , but not all art historians can see it there .
This is not the first picture of a human organ someone has found , or at least imagined , in Michelangelo ’s Sistine frescoes .
In 1990 , in an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association , a physician described what he saw as a rendering of the human brain in the Creation of Adam , the panel showing God touching Adam ’s finger .
And one physician , a professor of medicine at Baylor University , published an article in a medical journal in 2000 suggesting that Michelangelo had included a drawing of a kidney in another ceiling panel .
The author was , perhaps not coincidentally , a kidney specialist .
The latest find , described in a study in the May issue of the journal Neurosurgery , appears directly above the altar in “ The Separation of Light From Darkness , ” another panel from the series of nine depicting scenes from the Book of Genesis .

In January , I reported how Microsoft had launched what amounted to a denial of service attack on the CPAN Testers server .
It seems that 4 months later , we have yet again been targeted for attack from Microsoft .
After the last attack , any IP address matching ' 65.55 .*.*' , hitting the main CPAN Testers website , was blocked ( returning a 403 code ) .
Every few weeks I check to see whether Microsoft have actually learnt and calmed down their attack on the server .
So far , disappointingly , despite an alleged Microsoft developer saying they would look into it , the attack on the server has continue with little alteration to their frequency and numbers .
Had they changed and been considerably less aggressive I would have lifted the ban .
Yesterday , Microsoft launch a further attack on the server using a complete new set of IP addresses .
Now , just to clarify , this was n't just a complete new set of IP addresses , but a completely new set PLUS the original set , thus effective doubling the attack on the server .
Now you could claim stupidity or ignorance on behalf of the msnbot / Bing developers , but after being warned last time , and receiving 403s from their existing bots , by adding in a whole new set of IPs , I consider this latest attack nothing short of malicious .
These new IP address have now been added to the blocklist , and I 'm now writing a script to alert me should any new IP address from Microsoft be added to their attack formation .
Thankfully , I happened to be on the server at the time as both attacks hit , and managed to catch the IPs before they took out the server completely .
With my last post about this , I was accused of doing a disservice to Perl .
Had I not been furious at the time , and written about the incident , I would n't have learnt that this was a Microsoft tactic that had infuriate a lot of people , and discovered that I was n't the only sysadmin or website administrator around the world that had chosen to block Microsoft from their websites and servers .
If Microsoft think thuggery is the way to improve their search content , then they are very sadly mistaken .

Update : Microsoft have now been in touch , and again apologised .
We 'll have to wait and see whether this can be resolved .
The commercial spaceflight company SpaceX successfully test fires the nine - engine first stage of its first Falcon 9 rocket on March 13 , 2010 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida .
The private spaceflight company SpaceX has officially setFriday as the target date for the launch debut of its new Falcon 9 rocket .
The new commercial rocket , designed to haul cargo to the International Space Station , may one day also carry astronauts to Earth orbit .
Space Exploration Technologies ( SpaceX ) of Hawthorne , Calif. , planned to roll out Falcon9 today to its dedicated seaside launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air ForceStation in Florida .
The rocket has a four - hour window in which to launch , starting at 11 a.m. EDT ( 1500 GMT ) .
If weather or some other obstacle preventsthe test from taking place Friday , SpaceX can try again on Saturday .
Both days have about a 60 percent chance of favorableweather , forecasters predict .
Cumulus clouds and anvil clouds fromthunderstorms could prevent the launch .
The one major hurdle left before the fledgling rocket can attemptto launch is final approval of its flight termination system ( FTS ) , anexplosive charge that would destroy the rocket if it flew off course .
BothSpaceX and the U.S. air force , which monitors the launch area , must beconfident that the system works before Falcon 9 can lift off .
" We are now looking good for final approval of the FTSby this Friday , June 4th , just in time for our first launch attempt , " SpaceX officials said in a Tuesday statement .
This test version of Falcon 9 will carry a mockup ofSpaceX's Dragon capsule , which is designed to carry cargo , and eventuallyhumans , to the International Space Station .
This SPACE .comgraphic shows how SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon stack up to other rockets .
NASA has already awarded SpaceX a $ 1.6 billion contract touse Falcon 9 and Dragon to haul cargo to the station starting in 2011 .
If allgoes well on the first test launch , real cargo will fly atop the second Falcon9 flight , the company has said .
This testlaunch has been held up by the approval process and by a crowded range .
Thesuccessful launch May 27 of a GPS satellite cleared up a window for SpaceX toproceed .
The company said its expectations are not set too high forthis first effort to run through a complete countdown and launch of the 178 - foot ( 54 - meter ) tall rocket .
" Since this is a test launch , our primary goal is tocollect as much data as possible , with success being measured as a percentageof how many flight milestones we are able to complete in this firstattempt , " SpaceX said in the statement .
" It would be a great day ifwe reach orbital velocity , but still a good day if the first stage functionscorrectly , even if the second stage malfunctions .
It would be a bad day ifsomething happens on the launch pad itself and we 're not able to gain anyflight data . "

The Billboard Liberation Front ( BLF ) and the McDonald ’s Corporation ( MCD ) have launched a new advertising improvement campaign .
The initiative features a bold new slogan , “ I ’m Sick of It , ” and is designed to counter the brand - negatives that have gnawed at MCD since the release of irresponsible attack - films like “ Supersize Me ” and “ Food , Inc . ”
By embracing the traditional American values of conformity , convenience , and mediocrity , it is intended to reverse the damage done by the nay - saying health - Nazis and cow - hugging America - haters who have taken a bite out of MCD ’s market share and hounded its beloved corporate mascot Ronald McDonald into exile .
“ In an uncertain world , customers want comfort and sameness in their eating habits , ” the spokesclown observed , speaking from the cramped office he shares with fellow expatriate Joe Camel .
“ It ’s not just about portion size , though that ’s still important .
In these troubled times it ’s more about familiarity , about conformity , and most of all about not taking any risks .
MCD has responded to that shift in consumer attitudes , and has reengineered its product line to reflect a culinary landscape that prides itself on mediocrity . ”
Mr. Camel , speaking through a throat - tube , added : “ McDonald ’s is the cardiologist of America ’s destiny . ”
To accomplish this historic turnaround , McDonald ’s turned to the re-branding experts at BLF , America ’s premier Advertising Improvement Agency .
“ It ’s time for McDonald ’s to retake the cultural High Ground , ” explained BLF Recreative Director ______ deCoverly .
“ They ’ve been on the defensive for years , using generic ‘ lifestyle ’ ads that deny their core values .
Now they ’re fighting back , and reclaiming their cultural legacy . ”
Unashamed to take a bold stance on America ’s milquetoast taste , McDonald ’s and the Billboard Liberation Front proudly unveil their new campaign : “ I ’m Sick of It . ”
The initial improvement can be seen at the corner of California and Hyde in San Francisco .

A boat captain working to rescue sea turtles in the Gulf of Mexico says he has seen BP ships burning sea turtles and other wildlife alive .
Captain Mike Ellis said in an interview posted on You Tube that the boats are conducting controlled burns to get rid of the oil .
" They drag a boom between two shrimp boats and whatever gets caught between the two boats , they circle it up and catch it on fire .
Once the turtles are in there , they ca n’t get out , " Ellis said .
Ellis said he had to cut short his three - week trip rescuing the turtles because BP quit allowing him access to rescue turtles before the burns .

According to reports , Toyota 's chief test driver , 67 - year - old Hiromu Naruse , has died in a crash on highway 410 near the famed Nürburgring race track in Germany .
He was driving the recently spied Lexus LFA Nürburgring Edition ( above ) at the time of the accident , and reports say he veered into oncoming traffic and collided head - on with two others test drivers in a BMW .
The two BMW test drivers survived the crash , though one is reportedly still in critical condition .
German video of the crash scene after the accident took place can be viewed below .
Police are investigating the crash and have yet to determine its cause .
Naruse was heavily involved with the development of the Lexus LFA supercar he was driving , along with many other past sports cars from Toyota 's history since he joined the company in 1963 .
Enthusiasts today call him the " Godfather of the LFA , " though he was involved in the development of sports cars for Toyota going as far back as the storied 2000GT from the late 1960s .
The prototype of a special edition version of the LFA that he was driving when the accident occurred was reportedly worth 1.5 million euro .
Image caption Sir David King has called on governments to " de- fossilise " their economies
Future oil extraction could create new environmental , social and technological challenges , says the UK 's former chief scientist .
Sir David King said that , as global oil demand started to outstrip supply , oil companies would be forced to drill in unconventional places .
He cited the Gulf of Mexico oil spill as an example of the risks associated with the oil production .
Sir David was speaking at a press conference in London .
His comments come days before the World Forum on Enterprise and the Environment , organised by the Smith School of the University of Oxford .
This event is meant to draw governments ' attention to the global addiction to fossil fuels .
Sir David is the director of the Smith School .
' De- fossilising '
The scientist has called on governments to " de- fossilise " their economies and accelerate the development of alternative energy sources , such as biofuels , to reduce the world 's dependence on oil .
He added that global oil resorces might in fact be drying up faster that many - including governments - have been led to believe .
Only the oil exporting countries will benefit from [ rising oil prices ]
Sir David King , Former UK chief scientific adviser
Sir David said that detailed , objective analyses showed that conventional oil reserves were actually 30 % lower than generally accepted .
The possible consequences of conventional oil supplies running out fast have been described in a Smith School report , published in the journal Energy Policy in March .
" As early as 2015 , oil production capacity is going to begin to be challenged in terms of meeting rising demand , particularly from continuing growth of the economies of China and India , " Sir David commented at the press conference .
This leaves the world very little time to wean itself off oil , he said .
" As we meet the point where the demand and supply equation begins to get very close , once again we 'll see oil prices go up .
As they go up , the pressure grows on the international oil companies - Shell , BP , Exxon Mobil , Chevron , etc. - to develop oil reserves that are unconventional . "
He stressed that as we were " pushed " into more and more unconventional sources of oil , this would also push the boundary of what could be managed technically , while also managing the environmental and social consequences .
After the BP's Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank off the coast of the US state of Louisiana on 20 April , some 20 to 45 million gallons of oil are believed to have leaked into the Gulf of Mexico .
The spill has been described as the biggest environmental disaster in US history .
Global economy
Sir David also described a possible negative effect of rising oil prices on the world 's economy , which is still recovering from the recent financial crisis .
" Oil production capacity [ will be ] falling behind anticipated demand beyond about 2015 - 2020 , depending on the rate of economic recovery , " he said .
The world 's poorest countries will be the first to suffer - but for Britain and the US it will also be difficult to cope , added the scientist .
He stressed that oil exporting nations will be the only winners .
He concluded that , together with an effect on climate change , these two " highly pressing " reasons should be enough to persuade world leaders to reduce dependence on fossil fuels , something that will become " a very significant issue as we move into the next decade " .

Marc Ambinder does a good job of debunking the idea that the Obama Administration ’s failure to waive the Jones Act has impeded the cleanup effort in the Gulf Of Mexico :
The truth :
Not a single government that has offered its assets for free has been refused by the U.S. …
The government , on Obama ’s orders , is moving to quickly streamline the complicated procedures for waiving the Jones Act , which only applies to ships within three miles off the coast .
The Coast Guard says that no one has asked them to waive the Jones Act yet . …
Most of the containment and assistance offers would n’t apply , because ships would be well outside the three - mile threshold , or because they fall into a category of ships with a specific purpose , like oil skimmers .
They ’re already exempt .
So where are the Dutch ships , the Norwegian ships , the Belgian ships ?
For one thing , we ’re using Norweigian skimmers .
The Dutch have experience with much smaller spills , and their expertise is n’t as pertinent .
For another , Dutch engineers ARE consulting with the U.S. government .
Finally , it ’s worth noting that many foreign offers of help have been conditional — that is : “ We ’ll sell you these supplies at this cost . ”
Mexico has offered assistance for free , and the U.S is using it .
15 foreign countries have signed reciprocity agreements with the U.S. and are helping with the clean - up effort .
Four new Neotropical plant species in the hyperdiverse genus Solanum ( Solanaceae ) , which includes plants as diverse as the deadly nightshade as well as the more palatable tomato have been published in the open access online - only journal PLoS ONE by Dr. Sandra Knapp of the Natural History Museum , London .
Although several thousand new plant species are described each year , this paper represents a botanical pioneer : it is the first to be published in an online - only journal whilst adhering to the strict botanical code that sets out how new species can be named .
The naming of new taxa in plants is governed by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature ( ICBN ) , which has traditionally been thought to not allow publication of new names in anything other than print on paper .
This article provides a solution to this conundrum by separating the printing process from the publisher and enabling the author to print their own copies and distribute them to relevant museums and institutions on the day of publication .
As such , it is the first to effectively publish new plant names in an online - only journal while complying with the rules and recommendations of the ICBN .
Because PLoS ONE is also an open - access journal , the article and the associated guidelines are freely available for the community to download and use as the ' type- specimen ' for such a publication .
Dr Knapp is a leading plant taxonomist , author of numerous books and a world authority on Solanaceae , the nightshade family which includes potatoes and tomatoes .
She is well acquainted with the Codes of Nomenclature , of which the ICBN is one ( the others govern cultivated plant , animals and bacterial names ) .
" These codes are possibly the best and longest lasting example of voluntary adherence to standards in science ; they have been in use since the early 19th Century , and although legalistic , are not legally binding , " she notes .
Instead , they rely on the community of scientists adhering to the standards set out by generations of taxonomists .
They exist to help maintain stability in naming by providing clear rules for publication .
" Without such codes governing naming , there would be chaos ; numerous different names could exist for the same species and numerous different species would potentially be referred to by the same name .
This would impact all branches of life sciences as the name of a species -- be it a pathogen or a crop -- represents a fundamental part of communicating knowledge about the natural world . "
A key part of the current code for the ICBN is that names must be associated with a print copy on the same day the article is published .
However , publishing is rapidly changing and many journals , such as those published by the Public Library of Science , are online only .
As publishing changes , so the Codes themselves will change , but the rate of change in publishing is currently outstripping that of the Codes .
By separating the printing process from the publisher , this paper is the first botanical example of how flexibility of both authors and publishers can result in change without subsequent instability in names .
The botanical code is amended every 6 years through the deliberations of a Nomenclature Section at International Botanical Congresses , the last was in Vienna in 2005 , and the next in Melbourne in 2011 .
In 2005 , new recommendations were introduced to set guidelines for future electronic publishing .
Dr Knapp will preside as President of the 2011 Nomenclature Section in Melbourne , and the issue of electronic publishing of new names will be part of the debates about changes to the Code that will help taxonomists keep pace with the rapidly changing nature of scholarly communication .
" The Code will evolve and adapt to the changing needs of scientists , and publishers have an important role to play to help ensure that the changes are implemented correctly " Dr Knapp confirms .
In this paper she describes new species of Solanum , one of only a dozen genera of flowering plants with more than 1000 species .
This is part of a project providing an authoritative , global , in - depth treatment of all species of Solanum funded by the US National Science Foundation under the Planetary Biodiversity Inventory programme ; this web taxonomy is freely available on - line at Solanaceae Source ( www.solancaeaesource.org).
The four new Solanum species are from the New World tropics and are all related to the European woody nightshade , Solanum dulcamara .
They are named for local botanists in their countries of origin or for characteristics of the plants themselves ; type specimens of each new species are housed in countries where they are native .

The Washington Post recently got ahold of an itemized receipt of DOD spending at Guantanamo , one that confirms both the runamokery of contracting excess and the Bush adminstration ’s oversized expectations for the Cuban outpost .
The notorious detention center , Don Rumsfeld ’s “ least worst place ” for terrorists now imprisons 181 detainees ( down from a high of 680 ) and was ordered closed by President Obama last year .
But the bulk of the Pentagon ’s spending was done by then , set in motion in early 2002 when of the prison was added to the century - old naval base .
The grand total for base renovations , when operating costs and outlays for the top - secret Camp 7 are considered , is estimated at around $ 2 billion , which puts the per prisoner tally right now at about $ 11 million per prisoner .
Even just considering the $ 500 million in capital expenditures detailed in the Post that ’s still $ 2.8 million per prisoner .
True , the military personnel stationed at the base should be comfortable and not feel completely isolated on the 45 square - mile swath of island where Gitmo is based .
But at the same time , the cash thrown down suggests an extravagant expansion and the investment in Guantanamo Bay as the crown - jewel HQ in the US ’s War on Terror .
There are legit , if high , construction costs , like $ 2.6 million for a road stretching 8 - miles along the fenced and mined perimeter of the base ( bordering Cuba ) , $ 18.2 million for a hospital , and $ 2.9 million for a psych ward .
But some of the expenditures seem comically excessive and characteristically overpriced .
Some particulars :
KBR ’s bill for building prison facilities : $ 169 million ( not including bonuses )
Courthouse complex : $ 13 million
Baseball and football fields : $ 7.3 million
27 playgrounds :* $ 3.5 million
A heretofore empty sleeping quarters for visitors attending military commissions : $ 2.2 million
KFC / Taco
Bell building remodel : $ 773,000
Starbucks coffee house ( and ice cream shop ) building remodel : $ 683,000
An unused go - kart track : $ 296,000
“ Club Survivor , ” an abandoned volleyball court : $ 249,000
Marquee welcome signs : $ 188,000
* There are only 398 kids under 18 at Gitmo right now , that ’s a playground for every 15 kids .
Playgrounds are awesome and all but how could there ever be enough people on base , playing with their kids at the same time , or even playing without kids , to warrant 27 of them ?
So the base has all sorts of amenities now .
And if the prison is indeed closed we ’ll still have our naval base in Cuba , but it likely wo n’t be crowded with military personnel .
So what do we do with the courthouse , the coffee house , the playgrounds ?
Fewer people will use them or we ’ll find a reason to stock the base full to enjoy the surroundings .
Or maybe the military can set up vacation packages for the curious to tour the base : stay in the sleeping quarters , witness a mock tribunal , visit the prison , wear orange …
It ’s not a very tasteful idea , but Americans are suckers for a good prison tour .
And maybe we could send classes there on field trips so we could all , you know , learn a thing or two from our past transgressions .
The first step ( after prowling the web ) was assembling the kit of parts .
Here they are , arrayed on my front porch :
on the bottom step , the item I was most worried about finding , the single burner hot plate .
The last time I saw something like that , it was an illegal object in my dorm room , in a time before the web .
( Yes , I am OLD ! )
Most web authors claimed I 'd need 1000 watts .
I found a couple in on - line hardware stores and at Amazon , but for $ 20 plus shipping .
( lower wattage ones were about $ 14 ) Since my target total expenditure is $ 60 , and I found a commercial smoker for $ 38.40 at Home Depot , that was outta budget .
But a local remainders store ( Big Lots ! ) had one for $ 7.99 , and another local low - rent chain ( Reny's ) had one for $ 9.99 .
This is a Maine adventure .
I figured I needed to have the burner in hand to know the size of the base of the cooker , hoping to find a lot of variety in pots and other enclosures .
So I started by spending 8 bucks at Big Lots !
( yes , the ! is part of the name )
In the middle , the cookery gear .
I found a small saucepan for $ 2.99 at Christmas Tree Shops a and a " grilling skillet " with folding handle for $ 3.99 .
Without their handles , these looked just about right for the wood chips container and the food grill .
Also in the middle is a candy / frying thermometer with a range of 100 °F - 450 °F ( $ 6.99 from a local hardware store ) , a rubber stopper to hold it ( $ 1.50 ) and a rubber washer to block the bottom hole .
This turned out to be unnecessary in that role but handy in another .
< br /> < br />
On the top , the pottery .
an azalea pot ( $ 9.99 ) will be the base , and a bulb bowl ( $ 6.99 ) will be the top .
Yes , I made sure the top fit inside the base at the garden store .
These are standard unglazed terra cotta pots , roughly 30 cm at the top , with 2.5 cm holes in the bottoms .
They might be a bit small for the kind of cooking Phil wants to do , but I 'm going to start here and see how it all goes .
Oh yeah , the cute little feet were $ 1.99 each , but who could resist them , and they make a space for the heater cord .
So sweet .

Anlässlich der “ Initiative 108e ” schrieb unser Pirat Sebastian P. aus dem Stadtverband Potsdam Vertreter im brandenburgischen Landtag an und bat um Unterstützung der Petition zur Verschärfung des Straftatbestands der Abgeordnetenbestechung .
Antwort bekam er von der Landtagsverwaltung und der Fraktion “ Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen ” .
Der Schriftwechsel soll hier unkommentiert dokumentiert werden :
Schreiben von Sebastian am 23 .
Mai 2010
– – – – – – – – – – –
Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren ,
im Folgenden möchte ich Sie und die weiteren Abgeordneten des Brandenburger Landtags um die Unterstützung einer nicht - öffentlichen Petition bitten und Ihnen diese beschreiben .
Die Piratenpartei Deutschland , Landesverband Brandenburg , wurde auf die „ Initiative § 108e “ aufmerksam gemacht . [ 1 ]
Initiator ist das Mitglied Sebastian Nerz . [ 2 ]
Die Initiative unterstützt eine Petition , die der ehemalige MdB Jörg Tauss beim Deutschen Bundestag einreichte . [ 3 ]
Diese fordert eine Ratifizierung der UN - Konvention gegen Korruption [ 4 ] [ 5 ] und eine angemessene Neuregelung des § 108e StGB “ Abgeordnetenbestechung ” [ 6 ] .
Es gibt zwei große Lücken im gegenwärtigen Strafrecht bezüglich Abgeordnetenbestechung .
Es ist nicht strafbar
(1 ) einen Abgeordneten zu Gunsten Dritter zu bestechen ( Familie , Freunde , etc. ) ;
( 2 ) einen Abgeordneten außerhalb des Parlaments und seinen Ausschüssen zu bestechen ( z.B. in Fraktionssitzungen , in denen grundlegende Entscheidungen zur Parlamentsarbeit der Fraktion gefällt werden ) . [ 7 ]
Seit 2003 gibt es das UN - Abkommen UNCAC ( United Nations Convention against Corruption ) , das Deutschland zwar unterzeichnet , aber bis heute nicht ratifiziert hat . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ]
Mit Hinblick auf die aktuellen Sponsoringskandale in der deutschen Politik , ist ein Bekenntnis zu der UN - Konvention eine Möglichkeit Vertrauen in Politik zurückzugewinnen .
Klare Regelungen , die Abgeordnetenbestechung verbieten , sollten in einem demokratischen Staat gesetzlich festgeschrieben sein .
Als Unterzeichner der Petition , wollen wir daher die Umsetzung des UN - Abkommens erreichen .
Ende Februar 2010 reichte daher der ehemalige MdB Jörg Tauss jene Petition beim Bundestag ein . [ 3 ]
Der Petitionstext lautet : “ Der Deutsche Bundestag möge beschließen , dem Eindruck einer zunehmenden Verflechtung von Geld und Politik auch durch eine unverzügliche Umsetzung der UN - Konvention gegen Korruption in Deutschland entgegen zu treten , in dem er seinen langjährigen mehrheitlichen Widerstand gegen eine juristisch handhabbare und wirkungsvolle Verschärfung von § 108e StGB ( Abgeordnetenbestechung ) aufgibt ” . [ 3 ] [ 8 ]
Verblüffenderweise lehnte es der Petitionsausschuss des Deutschen Bundestages ab , die Petition öffentlich zu behandeln [ 9 ] , sodass die gewohnte Behandlung als ePetition auf dem Bundestagsserver unmöglich ist .
Das Thema Abgeordnetenbestechung ist aber zu bedeutend , um es hinter verschlossenen Türen zu verhandeln .
Die Initiative § 108e setzt sich daher für eine offene Auseinandersetzung mit dem Thema ein .
Wir wollen eine öffentliche Behandlung der Petition und eine Neuregelung des strafrechtlichen Rahmens zur Abgeordnetenbestechung erwirken .
Wir würden uns wünschen , dass der Brandenburger Landtag ein Zeichen setzt und diese Petition unterstützt .
Dies wäre sinnvoll , um den Bürgern und Wählern zu zeigen , dass Abgeordnete nicht vorrangig die Interessen einer Lobby , sondern die der Bürger vertreten .
Das Vertrauen in Politiker würde gestärkt , die Politikverdrossenheit vieler Bürger reduziert und die Wahlbeteiligung an Parlamentswahlen erhöht werden .
Dazu würden wir gerne die Unterschriften der Abgeordneten sammeln und im Anschluss die Anzahl der Mitzeichner veröffentlichen .
Wir bitten Sie darum , die Petition zu unterstützen , indem Sie diese mitzeichnen , sie den anderen Abgeordneten des Brandenburger Landtags zukommen und von diesen unterzeichnen lassen und die gesammelten unterschriebenen Formulare an uns zurückzusenden .
Hierzu werden wir Ihnen gerne die Formulare unter [ 10 ] und [ 11 ] an die Postanschrift des Landtags zukommen lassen .
Bitte senden Sie die Formulare nicht an die Bundestagsanschrift , sondern zwecks Zählung an die Geschäftsstelle der Piratenpartei LV Brandenburg .
Piratenpartei LV Brandenburg
August - Bebel - Str. 68
14482 Potsdam
Ich bitte Sie darum , uns die Unterschriften bis zum 11 .
Juni zukommen zu lassen .
Bitte informieren
Sie auch die Abgeordneten , dass sie sich auch ein personalisiertes Formular generieren lassen können . [ 12 ]
Die Piratenpartei Deutschland pflegt eine Internetpräsenz , auf der Sie die aktuelle Anzahl der gesammelten Unterschriften sowie weitere Informationen einsehen können . [ 13 ]
Bitte teilen
Sie uns mit , ob Sie diese Initiative und Petition im Landtag publik machen werden .
Mit freundlichen Grüßen
i. A. Sebastian P. ,
Piratenpartei Deutschland ,
Landesverband Brandenburg

Eine Antwort von Landtagsverwaltung und Grünen - Fraktion erfolgte am 8 . Juni .
Während die Landtagsverwaltung mitteilte , dass sie die Mail an alle Mitglieder des Landtags weitergeleitet habe , liest sich die Antwort des Fraktionsvorsitzende der Grünen folgendermaßen :
Antwort der Landtagsfraktion “ Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen ”
– – – – – – – – –
Sehr geehrter Herr P. ,
dem inhaltlichen Anliegen , Abgeordnetenbestechung strafbar zu machen , verschließen wir uns dagegen nicht .
Ich möchte
Sie darauf hinweisen , dass die Bundestagsfraktion von Bündnis 90 / Die Grünen bereits seit mehreren Jahren mit parlamentarische Anstrengungen gegen
Abgeordnetenbestechung aktiv sind .
Nach Diskussion in unserer Fraktion möchte ich Ihnen jedoch mitteilen , dass wir Ihr Ansinnen nicht unterstützen .
Wir finden es sehr befremdlich , dass Sie Ihre Aktion ausgerechnet an dem Tag starten , an dem das Gerichtsurteil zu Herrn Tauss gefällt wurde .
Sie werden verstehen , dass wir Ihrem Wunsch daher nicht entsprechen werden .
Mit freundlichen Grüßen

LimeWire , the ubiquitous P2P service commonly associated with illegal file - sharing , has been found liable for facilitating the distribution of copyright infringement .
In a 59 - page decision , U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood ruled in favor of the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .
In his ruling , Kimba stated that Lime Wire ( the company behind LimeWire ) " optimized LimeWire 's features to ensure that users can download digital recordings , the majority of which are protected by copyright . "
According to CNET , the decision could have major ramifications for file - sharing and copyright infringement cases across the country .
The RIAA is likely to file an injunction to cease the operation of LimeWire 's P2P network .
The RIAA could also sue for damages that could escalate into the millions .
Mark Gorton , LimeWire 's founder , is also being held liable for assisting users in committing copyright infringement .
P2P file - sharing networks , especially LimeWire and the original version of Napster , have long been a point of contention .
In 2000 , A&M Records sued Napster for facilitating copyright infringement , a case that Napster lost .
In 2002 , Napster declared bankruptcy , but was eventually acquired by Best Buy and is now a pay - per - month music service .
Your Thoughts
Clearly the web has changed how we distribute music , movies and files .
Long gone are the days of records , cassettes and CDs .
Now files are not only distributed digitally through systems such as LimeWire or Napster , but also through stores like iTunes and via streaming radio services like Pandora and Last.fm .
The RIAA ( and the MPAA ) has had a history of suing both the downloaders and the creators of the P2P software that facilitate illegal file - sharing .
While music sales hit an all - time high in 2009 , music industry growth has slowed .
How piracy plays into this whole equation is difficult to know for certain .
What do you think of today 's decision ?
Is the RIAA in the right over LimeWire ?
Or does it set a dangerous precedent that attacks web tools that have legitimate uses ?
Let us know in the comments .

The Red Rectangle nebula , which lies about 2,300 light years away towards the constellation of the Unicorn ( Monoceros ) , is shown in unprecedented detail as captured recently by the Hubble Space Telescope .
At the nebula 's centre is a young binary star system that surely powers the nebula but does not , as yet , explain its colours .
The unusual shape of the Red Rectangle is likely due to a thick dust torus which pinches the otherwise spherical outflow into tip - touching cone shapes .
Because we view the torus edge - on , the boundary edges of the cone shapes seem to form an X .
The distinct rungs suggest the outflow occurs in fits and starts .
The unusual colours of the nebula are less well understood , however , and current speculation holds that they are partly provided by hydrocarbon molecules that may actually be building blocks for organic life .
In a few million years , as one of the central stars becomes further depleted of nuclear fuel , the Red Rectangle nebula will likely bloom into a planetary nebula

Last week , Haaretz correspondent Barak Ravid ( as reported in the Hebrew edition online on June 16 ) detected implicit criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the address by President Shimon Peres to the World Zionist Organization Congress .
Ravid highlighted Peres ' sound bite , in which he suggested that " Hasbara is very important , but proper policy is the best kind of hasbara , " referring to the uniquely Israeli concept of information combined with public relations .
Our ceremonial , nonpolitical president proceeded to clarify that the " proper policy " would be yet another peace initiative on the part of Israel .
Peres , who prides himself on the originality of his epigrams , was effectively plagiarizing his former protege Yossi Beilin .
It was he who , during Oslo 's heyday , coined the idea that sound policy obviated the need for effectively presenting Israel 's case to the world .
Both Peres and Beilin should be asked why , after years of peace - processing , and after Netanyahu embraced a position on a Palestinian state that was once enunciated only by the extreme margins of the Israeli left , Israel 's public relations situation today is worse than it was two decades ago under Yitzhak Shamir ( once considered the epitome of Israeli immobilism ) .
Has Israel 's position really worsened only recently , even compared with the firestorm last year during Operation Cast Lead when Israel was led by Ehud Olmert , who peace - processed with the best of them , and thus followed Peres ' prescription to a T ?
Surely the president has nothing to offer beyond the extreme concessions made by Olmert , his Kadima party colleague - concessions which , in a crunch , did not provide Israel with any hasbara dividend .
Peres and Beilin would probably paraphrase the Hebrew catchphrase associated with using brute force : " What does not succeed with peace - processing will succeed with yet more peace - processing . "
Oslo and its prime movers are responsible for the atrophied state of Israeli hasbara , given their overconfidence that the peace process would obviate the need for hasbara basics .
Since we were working toward an accommodation with the Palestinians , why befoul the air by referring to the faults of the other side , whether past and present ?
So , for example , the collaboration between the Palestinian national movement and Nazi Germany was airbrushed out of the discussion .
Yasser Arafat 's 1994 Johannesburg speech - in which he likened the Oslo Accords to Mohammed 's temporary truce with the Quraysh tribe , his enemies in Mecca , until he gathered sufficient strength to overcome them - was ignored or marginalized .
This contrasted with an Arab and Palestinian policy of weakening and besmirching Israel at every possible international forum , while Peres was busily recruiting donors to contribute to the Palestinians ' wellbeing ( and , in effect , to Arafat 's secret accounts ) .
The Osloids were understandably still battling for Israeli public opinion and therefore passed over any unpleasant facts that would undermine public confidence in a New Middle East .
Israel since Oslo has almost completely abdicated the narrative of historic right in its diplomatic presentations and official documents , concentrating exclusively on the elusive goal of attaining a secure peace .
Our official spokespeople stopped citing the historic right of the Jewish people to their land .
Although Shiloh , Bethel and Hebron were every bit as important to the Jewish national legacy as Reims , Canterbury or Valley Forge to their respective nations , such emotional attachments were considered a handicap rather than a hasbara asset .
One did not have to be a " right - wing messianic " to invoke these historical arguments .
David - Ben Gurion ( whom Peres constantly invokes ) had effectively marshaled them during the battle for statehood .
The Palestinians , for their part , never abandoned their historical claims , first and foremost among them the right of return .
Similarly they have never conceded Israel 's right to be a Jewish state .
Israeli education ministers encouraged this stubbornness by incorporating poets like Mahmoud Darwish into the state curriculum or encouraging greater understanding of the Arab concept of the Nakba .
In response to Israel 's call for peace , the Palestinian side invoked historic justice and legitimacy ; the peace they sought was a " just peace . "
Is it any surprise that , following years of asymmetric information warfare , a large body of world opinion is totally unfamiliar with the case for Israeli legitimacy ?
If Israel only wants peace and the Arabs want justice , the fair trade is inevitably peace for " justice , " as the Arabs understand it .
I do not want to be overly simplistic - like Peres - and blame our situation totally on the peace - processors .
Today Israel , as in the 1970s , is confronting an adverse international constellation .
The United States is internally divided and the White House is currently occupied , as it was during the Carter administration , by a president consumed with a sense of American guilt toward the developing world .
Despite the encouraging results of the recent Dutch elections , Western Europe has not yet signaled that it is willing to fight for its values or even its identity .
The Non-Aligned Movement has recovered from its collapse in the late 1980s , and its near - disappearance in the 1990s , with the ascendancy of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Hugo Chavez and Recep Tayyip Erdogan , whose anti-Israeli demagoguery is bolstered by their countries ' economic assets or strategic position .
Putin's Russia and the People 's Republic of China , while somewhat better than they were under Brezhnev and in the twilight of Maoism , respectively , are also far removed from their policy of the early 1990s .
Their resentment of American leadership often motivates them to distinguish themselves from it by accommodating the renascent forces of anti-Israeli radicalism .
In this climate , Israeli concessions will at best be viewed as " an important step in the right direction " ( British Foreign Secretary William Hague ) , thus presaging further concessions .
Therefore , such concessions should be made sparingly while a hasbara campaign stressing Israel 's historic rights should be ramped up .

It is not the first book of yours that made me feel that way , but it was the difference in motivating me to become a small part of the movement to use gold farming for development and freedom .
The kind of stuff you were writing about seems so possible .
So I ’ve created a wiki where people might work together to undertake the quest .
I wanted to let you know because of your huge role in this already .
My next plan is to help build a free online marketplace where some kind of ‘ fair trade ’ gold / power - leveling can be exchanged .
I ’d like to make this website as open and collaborative as possible so that anyone can improve and build on it .
Then to help gold farmers get access to computers , games and bandwidth that do n’t come with the same requirements of their current bosses – donated for free , that they can use on their own terms .
There will be many challenges on the way but I believe it will be worth it .
As you said , we can all lead ourselves .

A Pennsylvania woman is suing the Phillies and the man behind the portly mascot over injuries she says were caused by the furry critter climbing on top of her at a minor league game in 2008 .
Attorney John Speicher says Grace Crass was injured when the Phanatic climbed on top of her during a
game .
Crass claims the bumbling bird exacerbated her arthritis , ultimately forcing her into knee replacement surgery .
.
Speicher acknowledges that suing the Phanatic seems " like suing Santa Claus , " but his client experience a real injury because of the mascot 's shenanigans .
The suit names the Phillies , their minor league affiliate and Tom Burgoyne , the man who plays the Phanatic .
It seeks more than $ 50,000 in damages .
Phillies spokeswoman Bonnie Clark declined comment on the suit .
According to the Philadelphia Daily News , the Phillie Phanatic was successfully sued at least three times between 1995 and 1998 , and the Phillies were ordered to pay the plaintiffs a total of more than $ 2.65 million .
Imagine yourself leaving your home everyday and walking miles , just to get water .
Now imagine arriving at your destination , to find that the only source of water is a dirty swamp filled with muddy , contaminated water , which is what you must bring back to your friends and family .
For millions of people living in the world right now , that is their reality .
50 % of hospital beds are filled with people who are sick because they drink dirty water .
If you are like me , you can't even understand a world like this , because we have an endless supply of clean water right at our fingertips .
We do n't even realize how lucky we are , because it seems so simple .
But if you 've ever seen a video of people living in these conditions , they are the happiest people you 've ever seen .
They dance and sing and are just so happy to be alive .
When I found out about Charity : Water , an organization that raises money to build wells in communities suffering from the lack of clean water , I knew I wanted to do something to help .
I am so blessed with the life that I have , while some people truly have nothing .
So lieu of gifts for my sweet sixteen , I would appreciate it if you made a donation to Charity : Water .
Just $ 20 can give someone clean water for 20 years !
Any donation helps !
Thank you !
Most people ask me why I do n't want presents for my birthday .

But funding a well ?

THURSDAY , June 3 ( HealthDay News ) --
One in five high school students in the United States has taken a prescription medication that was not prescribed for them , a new survey shows .
Conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the survey covers a variety of risky behaviors among American youth .
" We are very concerned that 20 percent of high school students are reporting this behavior , " said survey author Danice K. Eaton , a research scientist at the CDC .
" It can be dangerous to take a prescription drug that has n't been prescribed to you . "
Studies have shown that taking non-prescribed prescription drugs can lead to overdose , addiction and death , Eaton explained .
" Taking a prescription drug that has n't been prescribed to you is a health risk behavior , " she said .
In the survey , 16,460 high school students were asked if they had ever taken prescription drugs such as OxyContin , Percocet , Vicodin , Adderall , Ritalin or Xanax , without a doctor 's prescription .
The abuse of prescription drugs was widest among whites at 23 percent , followed by Hispanics at 17 percent , and black students at 12 percent .
In addition , the abuse of prescription drugs was most common among 12th graders ( 26 percent ) and lowest among ninth graders ( 15 percent ) , the researchers found .
But , prescription drug abuse was the same for boys and girls , at 20 percent .
This is the first time a question about prescription drugs has been asked in the survey , Eaton said .
The next survey will be in 2011 , with the data being released in 2012 .
This will be the first opportunity to see trends in the abuse of prescription drugs , she noted .
In the meantime , the " awareness that there is such a high prevalence of prescription drug abuse among high school students is the main thing that we can emphasize from our data , " Eaton said .
Dr. David Katz , director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine , said there are too many prescription drugs waiting to be abused .
" When prescription drugs are available in a home to the patient for whom they were prescribed , they are also available to the patient 's teenager , " he said .
Educating teens about the potential harms of prescription drugs , and including discussion of prescription medications in all drug control programs , is warranted , Katz said .
" Parental awareness , which this report helps cultivate , and vigilance will be more important still , " he said .
" But perhaps the ultimate solution to this problem is a more dedicated societal commitment to disease prevention and health promotion , so that fewer prescription drugs are in circulation , and available for such misuse . "
The survey also asked about alcohol and drug abuse .
In all , 72 percent of the students said they had used alcohol .
Furthermore , 37 percent had used marijuana , 6.4 percent had used cocaine , 4.1 percent had used methamphetamine and 6.7 percent had used ecstasy .
These findings were basically the same as those in the last survey , which was done in 2007 , the researchers noted .
On the bright side , high school students seemed to be eating better .
The number of students who drank a soda a day dropped , from 34 percent in 2007 to 29 percent in 2009 .
More students ate fruit or 100 percent fruit juice ( 30 percent in 2005 and 34 percent in 2009 ) .
Fewer students engaged in risky weight - loss diets , such as not eating , taking diet pills or vomiting or taking laxatives .
However , students are still engaging in other risky behaviors such as :
78 percent had not eaten fruits or vegetables five or more times daily in the week before the survey .
82 percent said they had not been physically active for at least an hour per day .
19 percent smoked cigarettes .
28 percent rode in a car driven by a person who had been drinking alcohol .
39 percent of sexually active students had had sex without using a condom .
These numbers are also similar to the 2007 numbers , the researchers noted .

Christopher Hitchens diagnosed with cancer , cuts short his book tour
Christopher Hitchens , May 17 , 2010 in Washington , DC . ( Marvin Joseph / TWP )
Christopher Hitchens is being treated for cancer , forcing the D.C. writer to cut short his latest book tour .
In a statement released through his publisher Twelve , the British - born provocateur , 61 , said that he has " been advised by my physician that I must undergo a course of chemotherapy on my esophagus .
This advice seems persuasive to me . "
The notorious chainsmoker announced in 2008 he had given up tobacco -- driven , he said , by " fear . "
( His wife Carol Blue told us then he " wants to live -- live to see his political enemies defeated . " )
But he was still sneaking a smoke or two when our colleague Manuel Roig - Franzia interviewed him last month .
Here ’s some disconcerting news for health - conscious eaters who favor eggs from free - range hens :
A Taiwanese study found that the eggs contain much higher levels of industrial pollutants than eggs laid by caged hens .
The researchers focused on two types of pollutants , polychlorinated dibenzo - p - dioxins and dibenzofurans ( known collectively as PCCD / Fs ) , which are released into the environment by municipal waste incinerators , factories and other industrial sources .
A report from the International Program on Chemical Safety says the chemicals have caused cancer , liver damage , problems with the skin and nervous system , reproductive problems and other undesirable effects in animals .
The researchers collected 60 free range eggs from farms in southern Taiwan and compared them with 120 eggs from caged hens that were purchased throughout the country .
Then they measured the levels of 17 kinds of PCCD / Fs .
For the free range eggs , the levels ranged from 6.18 to 41.3 picograms per gram of lipid , with an average value of 17.5 pg/ g.
Levels for the caged eggs ranged from 2.85 to 19.8 pg/g , with an average value of 7.65 .
The researchers also calculated the toxic equivalency quotient ( TEQ ) for both kinds of eggs using a system endorsed by the World Health Organization .
The levels for the free range eggs were 5.7 times higher than the levels for the caged eggs .
In addition , 17 % of the free range eggs had levels that European regulators have deemed unsafe for consumption .
All of the caged eggs were easily in the safe zone , the researchers found .
The results were published in the latest edition of the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry .
The researchers believe the free range eggs have more contaminants because they are found in the environments where free range hens roam .
Studies have found the chemicals in “ feedstuffs , soil , plants , worms and insects , ” they wrote .
Their own measurements of dirt from free range farms persuaded them that soil contamination is at least partly to blame .
The problem probably is n’t limited to Taiwan .
Scientists have also found the same trend in the European Union , and one study found that about 10 % of free range eggs exceeded the safety limit set by regulators there .
“ The issue of contamination in free range eggs could be a global issue , and more research should be done to identify the factors from the external environment that influence and modify the PCDD / F levels in eggs from free range hens , ” the authors wrote .
In case you were wondering , their research was not sponsored by the commercial egg - laying industry .
The scientists had grants from the National Science Council of Taiwan and the Taiwanese Ministry of Education .

Israeli tanks move in to protect the country 's dead settlers .
JERUSALEM — After decades of bitter conflict and the loss of thousands of innocent lives , Israeli and Palestinian forces clashed once again this week , with each side laying claim to a five - mile stretch of desperately needed cemetery space .
Advertisement
Fighting over the disputed territory , which is located on the easternmost border of the Gaza Strip , has thus far resulted in more than four dozen casualties .
According to sources , the swath of cemetery space is being called the rightful burial home of both the Israeli and Palestinian people .
" Israel has always been the deathplace of the Jews , " said Moshe Abrahim , a religion professor at Bar - Ilan University .
" My father was killed here , and his father and mother , and both of his uncles before him were killed here .
To have this area occupied by Palestinian bodies is an insult to our great history . "

An Israeli soldier looks out over a field of disputed holes .
Added Abrahim , " I 'd sooner die than give up my God - given grave . "
The first episodes of violence over the narrow strip of cemetery began early Monday morning when a Palestinian suicide bomber detonated himself outside of a Jewish mausoleum , leaving one dead and outraging hundreds .
In response , Israel launched a series of swift air strikes , destroying six Palestinian funeral homes and killing an estimated 15 pallbearers .

Unfazed by the counterattack , Islamic extremists vowed never to surrender , and said they would continue to perish " for as long as it takes . "
" So many martyrs for almighty Allah and His blessed prophet Mohammed have sacrificed their lives so that we might someday lose ours , " said Ali Akhtar , leader of the terrorist organization known as Islam 's Undertakers .
" Palestine will not rest until each and every one of its sons has a place beneath this glorious land .
Our day of victory is at hand ! "

Since Monday 's attack , violence has erupted across the disputed region , with Islamic radicals throwing rocks and launching mortar fire at approaching Jewish hearses .
Fearing that the prized graveyard would be lost to a surge of Palestinian bodies , Israel reportedly took action , sealing 500 soldiers inside military coffins and placing them in strategic tombs .
Israeli troops have been ordered to stand their ground and remain interred indefinitely .

In a press conference Wednesday , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said that the state of Israel was doing everything in its power to prevent Palestinians from being buried inside the cemetery , including setting up security checkpoints to inspect suspicious vehicles for shovels , tombstones , and embalming fluid .
Olmert , however , would not respond to questions about whether Israel had overstepped its boundaries during an incident earlier this week that saw four Palestinian octogenarians detained on suspicion of being " on the brink of death . "

As is often the case in the region , innocent civilians from both sides have borne the brunt of the fighting .
Asalaa Bahiya — a recently dead Palestinian woman — was repeatedly fired upon by Israeli soldiers after her body was spotted entering the disputed cemetery .
In addition , a young Israeli cadaver was captured by Islamic militants , blindfolded , and dragged from a nearby Jerusalem morgue .
" How could God have allowed this to happen ? " said Yitzchak Meltzer , a grieving Tel Aviv resident who watched helplessly as his firstborn son was driven from his grave by extremists .
" To have to rebury your own child — it 's a parent 's worst nightmare come true . "

Though some hold out hope for the day when Israeli and Palestinian citizens are buried side by side in peace and harmony , all attempts to bring the conflict to a close have so far failed .
A United States –sponsored peace plan that proposed dividing the cemetery space directly in half was dismissed as unjust by both sides , with each claiming it was entitled to the entire graveyard .
Likewise , a compromise solution to cremate all deceased citizens was rejected by Israel as " barbaric . "
With bodies mounting on both sides , members of the ruling Hamas Party released a statement Monday suggesting that the violence could continue for years to come .

" As long as Israelis continue to age , decline in vigor and strength , and ultimately pass away , never will their nation know the meaning of peace , " the statement read in part .
" Either they stop dying at once , or prepare to suffer the consequences . "
More than a century on , the illegal cashiering in France of Captain Alfred Dreyfus shows what can happen to basic liberties when national security is invoked

HE LED an unremarkable , bourgeois life in fin-de - siècle Paris , riding his horses in the Bois de Boulogne , and sending his family to the Normandy coast to take the sea air .
He was a conscientious , if not particularly likeable , army officer , and a graduate of Polytechnique , the highly competitive French engineering school .
His father was a successful industrialist from Alsace ( which had fallen to the Germans after the Franco - Prussian war in 1870 - 71 ) , supplying him with an unusually handsome income for a man of his rank .
He also happened to be Jewish .
In 1894 , Captain Alfred Dreyfus was secretly arrested , wrongfully convicted by a court martial of high treason , sentenced to life imprisonment , stripped of his military rank and shipped off in chains to solitary confinement in the sweltering heat of Devil 's Island , a French territory off the coast of South America .
The only evidence presented at his trial was a torn - up note containing confidential military information , which had been found in a wastepaper basket at the German embassy by a cleaning lady working as a French spy .
It was written in a hand that was said , implausibly , to resemble the captain's .
How could the French army have conspired to bring down an innocent man in the name of national security ?
To this day , and despite the scores of books on the subject , the affair that rocked and divided France fascinates historians .
Three new works re-examine what happened for contemporary readers .
In a dense study , Frederick Brown of the State University of New York , sees the affair as the product of culture wars .
The French army was humiliated by the loss of Alsace - Lorraine , then shaken by the Paris Commune uprising .
Nationalist feeling , spiced with paranoia about traitors and spies , took hold at a time when the top brass was forced to improve military performance through reform .
Meritocratic recruitment drew in outsiders like Dreyfus .
But this also made him the object of suspicion by the old Catholic families , who traditionally manned France 's officer class .
Mr Brown is particularly good on the battle of ideas , symbolised by the construction of two of the capital 's landmarks .
In 1875 the first stone was laid for the Sacré Coeur basilica in Montmartre , designed as a statement of religious renewal , national atonement and devotion to Rome .
Across the river , the following decade , Gustave Eiffel began work on his monumental iron tower as an emblem of industry and science .
The clerical elite was scandalised : it towered over the churches , did not speak to God , and reflected “ imbecility , bad taste and foolish arrogance ” .
As one anti-Semitic writer declared at the time , “ Only a Jew could have submitted such a project . ”
Political instability and insecurity fuelled social paranoia and anti-Jewish sentiment .
Conspiracy theories about Jewish financiers were the talk of Paris salons .
“ La France Juive ” , by Edouard Drumont , an anti-Semitic tract published in 1886 , became a bestseller .
The respectable Catholic press , notably La Croix , joined in .
In one diocesan newsletter in the Cévennes , readers were told about “ the Jew ” , who , it declared , was : “ Servile , slithering , artful , filthy and vile when he is the weaker one ; he becomes arrogant when he has the upper hand , as he does now . ”
Against this background , the clubby French military elite hunted for a traitor .
A perfunctory internal investigation swiftly fingered Dreyfus , the only Jewish trainee officer on the General Staff .
He stood out , in the words of Lieutenant - Colonel Jean Sandherr , head of intelligence , as reported to a young diplomat , for “ his indiscreet curiosity , his constant snooping , his air of mystery , and finally his false and conceited character , in which one recognises all the pride and all the ignominy of his race . ”
The military hierarchy closed ranks : its singular aim to defend its honour , and incriminate Dreyfus , triumphed over the facts .
In the end , justice prevailed .
Yet it took five years before the Dreyfusards secured a second military trial , at which the captain was again found guilty , this time after the top brass forged evidence against him .
Dreyfus 's name was not officially cleared until 1906 .
He was readmitted to the French army , served in the first world war and died in 1935 .
In another scholarly study , Ruth Harris , an Oxford University historian , shows how the battle to establish his innocence was never , as myth would have it , a neat tale pitting the forces of truth and justice against paranoid military authority and national honour .
This , she writes , was “ good rhetoric but poor history ” .
Anti-clerical republicans — most famously , Emile Zola and his front - page letter to President Félix Faure entitled “ J'Accuse ” — took on the Catholic elite , with its hold over the military hierarchy .
But the Dreyfus affair often cut across political and religious lines .
Léon Blum , Georges Clemenceau , Jean Jaurès and other Dreyfusards intellectuels , a term originally coined to insult them , were aghast at left - leaning friends who refused to join the campaign .
Through a close reading of a mass of private documents , Ms Harris subtly draws the complex , and contradictory , human behaviour behind the public affair .
Louis Begley , an American novelist and retired lawyer , and a Jewish refugee from Nazi- occupied Poland , has produced the shortest of the three books .
It is also the paciest read .
As a primer on the affair , this is a first - rate narrative and a heartfelt plea to modern democracies to stick to their values and defend basic liberties , however threatened they feel .
The author draws an intriguing parallel between the Dreyfus affair and the Guantánamo detainees under President George Bush , held on suspicion of terrorist links , grossly mistreated and denied basic rights .
Yet he stretches his point .
Dreyfus was innocent , like some of those held at Guantánamo .
Crucially , however , he was the “ enemy ” within : picked from the ranks of the officer class , by the military 's own elite , and in a country — unlike America — that was not at war .
More than a century on , the Dreyfus affair still holds important lessons about freedom , notably the fragility of basic liberties when national security is invoked .
It is also a reminder of the deep roots of anti-Semitism , in France and beyond .
Even after Dreyfus 's death , the family felt the consequences .
As Mr Begley notes , Dreyfus 's wife , Lucie , changed her name and fled Vichy France for the free zone in the south .
Her granddaughter , Madeleine , who fought in the French Resistance , was sent to Auschwitz .
Hackage GSoC : Beginnings of an Infrastructure for Modular Features
Hi everyone .
The process of transforming the Hackage codebase is ongoing , and I ’ve made some sweeping changes and introduced a few regressions .
( I ’d more optimistically call them “ todo list items ” . )
I ’ve spent 3 / 4 of the last week working on the code base , and 1/4 reading books and websites and working on the site design .
Site design here refers to the interface that everyone who uses Hackage sees , and I ’ve posted a preliminary draft of the proposed URIs .
The goal is to make a REST API which can be read and manipulated by automated clients , and of course perused by web browsers just like the current Hackage .
One of the purposes of REST ( Representational State Transfer ) is simplifying state between the client and server by manipulating representation of resources using plain old HTTP .
Those Haskellers who are familiar with REST might point out that documenting an API and setting up URI conventions ( like I did on the Hackage wiki ) are partly antithetical to the goals of REST , which eschew servers that only understand highly specific remote procedural calls and clients which construct URIs based on hard - coded conventions ( coupling ) .
Roy Fielding , the inventor of REST , stresses that REST APIs must be hypertext - driven .
Do n’t worry : my intention is to make all of the URIs fully discoverable from the server root , whether browsing the HTML representation or , say , a JSON version .
The URI page is an aid in design , not documentation .
Since there tends to be a one - to - one mapping between each URI / method pair I ’ve listed and each feature I ’d like to implement , it tells me what I have left to do .
Fine - tuning data structures
To this end , I ’ve made and committed some changes to hackage - server .
Some of time was spent adjusting a few important types , and the rest dealing with the subsequent code breakages .
It is still better and safer than doing similar things in a dynamically typed programming language , where I ’d end up either sweeping the entire code base or analyzing call graphs manually to determine what broke .
Here ’s an example of a type I altered , the PkgInfo type , which holds information about a specific package version :
data PkgInfo = PkgInfo { -- |
The name and version represented here pkgInfoId :: ! PackageIdentifier , -- | Parsed information from the cabal file .
pkgDesc :: !GenericPackageDescription , -- |
The current .cabal file text .
pkgData :: !
ByteString , -- |
The actual package . tar. gz file , where BlobId -- is a filename in the state / blobs / folder . --
The head of the list is the current package tarball .
pkgTarball :: ![( Blob Id , UploadInfo ) ] , -- | Previous .cabal file texts , and when they were uploaded .
pkgDataOld :: ![( ByteString , UploadInfo ) ] , -- |
When the package was created with the .cabal file .
pkgUploadData :: ! UploadInfo } deriving ( Typeable , Show )
type UploadInfo = ( UTCTime , UserId )
The global Hackage state defines a mapping from PackageName to [ PkgInfo ] .
Subtle differences in which types of values are allowed to inhabit PkgInfo have important consequences for package uploading policy .
There are a few notable results of this definition .
A package can exist without a tarball .
This is more significant for importing data to create secondary Hackages than the normal upload process .
The more incrementally importing can happen , the simpler it will be .
Alternatively , this would allow for a metadata - only Hackage mirror .
Cabal files can be updated , with a complete history , without having to change the version number .
This would allow maintainers to expand version brackets or compiler flags , so long as the changes do n’t break anything ( constricting version brackets is more dangerous ) .
Tarballs can be updated , also with a complete history , without having to change the version number .
This probably wo n’t be enabled on the main Hackage , but exceptions can be granted by admins .
If an ultra-unstable Hackage mirror came about , as opposed to the somewhat - unstable model we have now , this might be allowed .
Modular RESTful features
The HackageFeature data structure is intended to encapsulate the behavior of a feature and its state .
Features include the core feature set — the minimal functionality that a server must have to be considered a Hackage server , which is serving package tarballs and cabal files — supplemented by user accounts , package pages , reverse dependencies , Linux distro integration , and so on .
The most important field of a feature is the locations :: [ ( BranchPath , ServerResponse ) ] .
The BranchPath is the generic form of a URI , a list of BranchComponent s. Taking inspiration from Ruby on Rails routing , you can construct one with the syntax " / package / : package / reports / :id " , where visiting http://hackage.haskell.org/HDBC/reports/4/ will pass [ ( " package " , " HDBC " ) , ( " id " , " 4 " ) ] to the code serving build reports .
You can define arbitrary ServerPart Response s at a path , or you can use a Resource abstraction which lets you specify different HTTP methods ( GET , POST , PUT , and DELETE ) .
This system is still in development .
HTTP goodies
Because each resource defines its method set upfront , it ’s possible to make an HTTP OPTIONS method for each one .
This is an example of something you get “ for free ” by structuring resources in certain ways .
As I ’ve discovered , there can be an unfortunate trade - off : requiring too much structure makes it unpleasant to extend Hackage with new functionality ( having to deal with all of the guts of the server ) .
Too little structure means that those implementing new features can accidentally break the site ’s design principles and generally cause havoc .
A reasonable middle ground is the convention over configuration approach : I ’d have plenty of configurable structure internally , and combinators which build on that structure by filling in recommended conventions .
This applies particularly to getting the most out of HTTP .
The idea of content negotiation in HTTP is simple , although there ’s no clear path ahead for implementing it yet .
For Hackage , content negotiation consists of responding to preferences in the client ’s Accept header , which contains MIME types with various priorities .
( Other sorts of negotiation include those for languages and encoding . )
A web browser like Firefox might send
text /html , application/xhtml+xml ,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 , and a hypothetical newer cabal - install client would send application / json for miscellaneous data it needs to read .
Authentication functionality is essentially done , although I had originally planned to work on it later this month .
The types might still need some tweaking , of course .
There is a system of access control lists called UserList s , each of which is a Data .
IntSet of UserId s. With this , we can have an extensible hierarchy of user groups , such as site administrators , per-package maintainers , and trustees ( allowed to manipulate all packages without possessing other admin functionality ) .
The type signature for the main authentication function is :
requireHackageAuth :: MonadIO m => Users -> Maybe UserList -> Maybe AuthType -> ServerPartT m UserId
Users is the type containing the site ’s entire user database .
AuthType , either BasicAuth or DigestAuth , can be passed in to force the type of authentication : either basic or digest .
Since all passwords are currently hashed in crypt form .
This method either returns the UserId , assuming authentication succeeded , or forces a 401 Unauthorized or 403 Forbidden .
With this , we can easily extend it to handle specific tasks :
requirePackageAuth :: ( MonadIO m , Package pkg ) => pkg -> ServerPartT m UserId requirePackageAuth pkg = do userDb <- query $ GetUserDb pkgm <- query $ GetPackageMaintainers ( packageName pkg ) trust <- query $ GetHackageTrustees let groupSum = Groups.unions [ trust , fromMaybe Groups.empty pkgm ] requireHackageAuth userDb ( Just groupSum ) Nothing
Import / export
To paraphrase Don ’s comment on my previous post , we absolutely can’t afford to lose any data .
Although the state / db/ directory contains all of happstack - state ’s MACID data , and can be periodically backed - up off - site , binary data is by nature easy to mess up and hard to recover .
A bit of redundancy in storage is a reasonable safeguard , and there ’s little more redundant than English , at least compared to bit - packing .
Antoine had implemented an extensive Hackage - to - CSV export / import system , where instead of e.g. having a single bit represent whether an account is enabled or disabled , we use the words “ enabled ” and “ disabled ” , and put the resulting export tarball in a safe place .
Instead of having one centralized system , each HackageFeature should take care of its own data , and so I ’d like to work on decentralizing the system in the days ahead .
The type signatures , suggested by Duncan , are :
data HackageFeature = { ... dumpBackup :: IO [ BackupEntry ] , restoreBackup :: [ BackupEntry ] -> IO ( ) , ... }
type BackupEntry = ( [ FilePath ] , ByteString )
Bringing features together
There are notable tasks remaining for the basic infrastructure , such as implementing this import / export system .
Another major one is creating a hook system with the usual dual nature of one part that responds to actions ( like uploading pages ) and another which edits documents on the fly ( like adding sections to a package page ) .
If you have experience with website plugin systems , what are your thoughts on getting this done this in a strongly , safety typed manner ?
Having taken a brief tour of the internal server proto - design and the types of functionality that can be implemented with it , I ’d like to show how we can leverage these to implement some useful features , some this summer if we as a community approve of them :
Build reports , to see if a given package builds on your OS ( might save time for unfortunately oft - neglected Windows - users ) , on your architecture , with your set of dependencies .
I would strongly encourage all of you to at least submit anonymized build reports once the feature goes live ( check out the client - side implementation ) , if not the full build log , although I promise we wo n’t stoop to a “ Do you want to submit a build report ? ” query every single time a build fails : maybe only just the first time :)
Submitting or not is more of a configuration option .
Build reports will probably be anonymized for the public interface , but available in full to package maintainers through the requireHackageAuth authentication mechanism .
authentication mechanism .
Reverse dependencies .
This is a HackageFeature that does n’t need to define any of its own persistent data , just its own compact index of depedencies that subscribes to a package uploading hook .
You can peruse Roel ’s revdeps Hackage , and if you feel like setting up hackage - scripts with Apache , you can apply his patch to run your own .

Hackage mirrors .
It should be simple to write a mirroring client that polls hackage .
haskell.org ’s recent changes , retrieves the new tarballs , and HTTP PUTs them to a mirror with proper authentication .
Candidate package uploads : improved package checking .
This would allow you to create a temporary package resource , perhaps available at / package / : package / candidate / , to augment the current checking system .
Currently , checking gives you a preview of the package page with any Cabal - generated warnings .
Here , you could set up a package on the Hackage website that ’s not included on the package list or index tarball .
It would employ its own mapping from PackageName to PkgInfo .
You can make a candidate package go live at any time , even allowing others to install your candidate package before then .
This is a slightly different idea from the ultra-unstable zoo of packages I mentioned with PkgInfo , but has similar quality assurance goals .
Thanks for reading what I ’ve been up to .
Critique is welcomed .

Image caption Derrick Bird was a self - employed taxi driver
Twelve people have been killed and 25 injured by a gunman who opened fire in west Cumbria .
A body thought to be that of the suspect - taxi driver Derrick Bird - has been found in the Boot area .
The first fatality was in Whitehaven before the gunman drove south , apparently shooting people at random .
Witnesses said the suspect drove through the town with a gun hanging out of his car window , before heading south through Gosforth and Seascale .
A GP in the town of Seascale said he and a colleague had later certified two other people dead .
Dr Barrie Walker said : " The surgery was called and I went out .
I 've certified one of them dead .
My colleague saw another , " he said .
" At present there are two people dead and one seriously injured in Seascale .
I know one of the victims .
She was in the street .
" The second person was on a bicycle and was shot on the bike . "
BBC Look North Chief Reporter Chris Stewart said a farmer is also believed to have been killed in the Gosforth area .
After the shootings , detectives said 52 - year - old Mr Bird drove to the central Lakes in a Citroen Picasso , then abandoned it in the Boot area .
Before the body was discovered people living nearby were urged to stay indoors for their own protection .
Helicopters and armed officers from other police forces were brought in to help apprehend the gunman .
Soon afterwards , Deputy Chief Constable Stuart
Hyde said : " I can confirm that we 've found a body in a wooded area near Boot which we believe to be Mr Bird , together with a firearm .
" A formal identification will be made later . "
Nuclear plant shut
Mr Hyde added : " Our focus now is to try and work out what has caused this and where Mr Bird has been over the last 24 hours and in particular the last few hours .
" I would plead to anyone who has seen him or has seen any of the incidents , please come forward , speak to us and help us piece together exactly was has happened in this very , very tragic set of circumstances .
" We have a number of crime scenes across the county , which are being staffed by police officers , and I would ask people to show a little bit of restraint and respect in regard to those scenes as we try and piece together exactly what has gone on . "
AT THE SCENE IN WHITEHAVEN A man 's body was lying behind a taxi rank in a cordoned - off street , covered by some sort of blanket .
People were being kept away by police but witnesses I spoke to said they had heard two shots at around 1040 BST .
Passers - by in Whitehaven were also talking about other incidents they had heard of so I quickly realised that this was n't limited to one shooting .
Within the space of less than four hours it became clear that the gunman had gone on a shooting rampage .
I heard of a cyclist being shot in Seascale and someone else being killed near Egremont .
The police began giving briefings in Whitehaven and told us a body had been found in woods near the village of Boot and they believed the incident was now over .
But they went on to say they still did n't know how many had been killed or injured .
A major incident has been declared at West Cumberland Hospital , in Whitehaven , where the NHS said all routine operations had been cancelled .
The Accident and Emergency department at the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle is also on full incident stand - by , the hospital trust said .
The Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant in west Cumbria closed its gates as a safety precaution and afternoon shift workers were being told to stay away , though the site has since reopened .
The Whitehaven victim , believed to be a colleague of 52 - year - old Mr Bird , was killed at 1035 BST .
A local taxi firm boss , Glenda Pears , said : " We just do n't know what 's happened .
" The lad that 's been killed was friends with him .
They used to stand together having a craic on the rank .
" He was friends with everybody and used to stand and joke on Duke Street . "
Sue Matthews , a telephonist at A2B Taxis in Whitehaven , said the Mr Bird was self - employed and lived alone .
She described him as a " quiet fellow " .
At the start of Prime Minister 's Questions David Cameron expressed his shock at the events which had unfolded .
He said : " The government will do everything it possibly can to help the local community and those affected .
" When lives and communities are suddenly shattered in this way , our thoughts should be with all those caught up with these tragic events . "
An emergency helpline has been opened for people concerned about the incident .
Cumbria Police Casualty Bureau Line on 0800 096 0095 .
A PARAGLIDER is being hailed " the luckiest woman in the world " after surviving a violent storm that sucked her up higher than the peak of Mt Everest .
Ewa Wisnierska , 35 , was catapulted upwards like a leaf at speeds of up to 20 metres per second to a height of almost 10,000m .
The German world champion paraglider then lapsed into unconsciousness as she was pounded by hail , almost struck by lightning , and covered in ice .
She was unconscious inside the storm system for 40 minutes before coming to and being found , still covered in ice , about 60 km from where she had taken off in northern NSW .
A Chinese paraglider , 42 , who was sucked into the same storm , was found dead on Thursday , a day after disappearing .
The pair were among 200 paragliders who took part in training flights on Wednesday for next week 's Paragliding World Championships in Manila .
Wisnierska , ranked number 1 in last year 's world championships in Brazil , said yesterday she had been unable to avoid the storm .
" I was just praying , please , please put me somewhere away from the cloud , " she said from her hotel room , where she was resting her bruised and frostbitten body .
As she was flung upward , above the height of the 8850 m
Mt Everest to near the cruising height of jumbo jets , Wisnierska noticed ice forming on her sunglasses and instruments , before losing consciousness .
At that height , temperatures can drop to - 40C or 50C .
Eventually Wisnierska , who reached 9946 m ( 30,000 feet ) , lost consciousness .
Doctors told her later that blacking out may have saved her life , because her metabolism had slowed down .
More than 40 minutes later , and still at a height of 6900 m , she woke to find herself still stuck in the storm , in darkness and with her gloves frozen .
" It was amazing , because the glider was still flying . " she said .
" I do n't know how is it possible , because there was hail everywhere , into the glider , into my harness and it was still flying . "
Though dazed and confused from a lack of oxygen , Wisnierska turned her attention to getting back to the ground after she escaped the storm clouds .
" I was shaking and everything , but I thought I just need to fly straight and get out of this cloud , " Wisnierska said .
" I thought I need to go down just to warm up .
" I thought ' Where could I land ? '
I could n't see any road or anything , but then I saw a small farm , and tried to fly towards it , and landed very safe . "
Unable to gather her thoughts to call for help , it was several minutes before her crew called by radio .
They found her , about 60 km from her launch site , still covered with ice .
Godfrey Wenness , the organiser of the championships , said Wisnierska was the luckiest woman alive .
" This is like winning lotto 10 times in a row .
That 's how lucky this woman is , " Wenness said .
" I would say she is the luckiest woman in the world right now , not exaggerating or being sensational at all .
The Chinese man died , she survived .
" There 's no logical reason why she got away with it , " he said .
Organisers of the World Paragliding Championships have confirmed that He Zhongpin , 42 , of the Chinese paragliding team , died after being sucked into the storm .
An exact cause of death was yet to be determined , but it is believed he died from extreme hypothermia and hypoxia , or lack of oxygen to the brain .
Though all pilots were extremely saddened by Mr He 's death , the championships would continue as scheduled , organisers said .
Despite frostbite to her ears and legs , Wisnierska still hopes to compete .
" Flying is too fantastic to stop because of an accident , " she said .
" I do n't know who to thank .
" I thanked the angels , but I do n't believe in God . "

Do n’t Think Dirty !
It is true that from time to time we make assumptions that are not necessarily in evidence .
So , that being said look at this picture and tell us what you see :
The rumour mill is aflame with stories that an upcoming version of the infamous Nissan Skyline GT - R will be offered as a hybrid or even a 100 % electric car .
The comments began after the GT - R’s chief engineer Kazutoshi Mizuno confirmed at an event in Australia that an alternative power train was in development for the car affectionately nicknamed “ Godzilla ” .
The performance specifications of any hybrid or electric version of the Skyline would have to be jaw - droppingly impressive to avoid a revolt amongst the car ’s rabid fans , most are agreeing that a hybrid drive train would make the most sense but with Nissan ’s expertise in the electric car field ( the Nissan Leaf is the only electric car currently in mass production ) and electric version cannot be ruled out .
We ’ll keep you posted as further information becomes available .

Ever wondered how a torch made of 500 diodes will look like ?
Well these pictures are your answer .
Here you have pictures where the normal torch is compared with the one with 500 diodes and the difference is staggering .
It is almost like a spotlight .
When used indoors , the light is blinding and you can compare this to the normal one used indoors and see the difference for yourself .
This is a great way to find things in the dark and you will not even notice the difference between the day and night .
It is hard to believe that tiny diodes when put together can give out this kind of light .
I guess it is like tiny drops many a mighty ocean .
This is something anybody can try building .
Do n’t forget to wear sun glasses though you do n’t want to hurt your eyes .

Though it is hard to imagine that eight and a half years in anything the Obama Administration could do with regards to the Afghan War would constitute a “ hasty exit , ” President Obama attempted to reassure again today that this would not happen , in comments which formally disavowed the July 2011 drawdown date he set himself in December .
“ We did n’t say we ’d be switching off the lights , ” Obama insisted , adding that “ we said we ’d begin a transition phase that would allow the Afghan government to take more and more responsibility . ”
Officials have been dismissing the July 2011 date as largely meaningless in the first place , but President Obama has avoided comment on it , since his announcement of the most recent escalation in December .
Actually what President Obama said was that the US would begin to “ start the pullout ” in July 2011 at the time , and Vice President Biden was sticking with that story as recently as last week , saying that a “ whole lot of people ” would be moving out in July .
Biden ’s comments were quickly disavowed by a number of officials , including Secretary of Defense Robert Gates .
Since Gen. David Petraeus was tapped to head the war yesterday , it has been expected that the date would be quickly disavowed , as President Obama did .
The date was little but an excuse to convince opponents of the surge to withhold judgement on the war at any rate , but its new role as the “ beginning of a transition phase ” has downgraded it to complete irrelevance , as officials have been claiming for years that they have been encouraging the Afghan government to take “ more and more responsibility ” to no real effect .
European nations which have attempted to put realistic timetables on the war have predicted several more decades of conflict on a number of fronts .
The reality however is that there is no end in sight on this war , and even ridiculously far - sighted dates are just guesses of when the war will , for some reason , stop getting worse and start getting better .
The evidence suggests that every escalation will just make matters worse , and officials have no strategy other than more escalation , making the prospect of such a turn - around unlikely , at best .

Lyon ever was the gastronomic capital of France is debatable , but it sure has spawned some great dishes , including salade Lyonnaise , not the most simple salad ever made but one that approaches perfection in a way others do not .
The combination of bitter greens ( traditionally frisée , though escarole , dandelion , and arugula all work beautifully ) , crisp bacon , barely cooked eggs and warm vinaigrette is really unbeatable .
This is obviously a bit of work , but all of it is dead easy , especially once you master the egg poaching .
There are a number of ways to do this , and most work as long as you do n’t start with fiercely boiling water .
The water , salted , should be barely simmering .
Crack the eggs individually into a small bowl before slipping them gently into the water .
Let sit for three or four minutes , or until the whites barely solidify and the yolks remain as runny as possible .
( Trust me on this : if you let the yolk harden even the slightest bit , you ’ll be missing out on perhaps the most pleasurable aspect of the dish . )
That ’s it .
Fresh eggs are easier to work with  and better tasting  because the whites wo n’t spread out much in the water .
( If they do , you can sort of gather them back toward the nucleus of each egg with a spoon , but I think this is a waste of time . )
Some people think that adding vinegar to the water helps the whites coagulate , but I ’ve never found that to be true .
The New York Times calls bull on Bobby :
Mr. Jindal , a Republican like all but one of the other gulf state governors , has been alone among them for his publicly critical stance toward the federal agencies in the response .
But experts said such antagonism could actually slow down that response .
" You can ask for the moon and say you did n’t get it , but I do n’t think that ’s going to add anything to the response capabilities , " said Doug Lentsch , who was chief of the Coast Guard ’s Pollution Response Branch in Washington , D. C. , during the Exxon Valdez disaster and helped develop the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 .
" When that stuff happens , you actually take away the ability of the unified command to get their job done . "
Thank you , Mr. Lentsch .
What a great way of putting it .
Bobby Jindal would have you believe he 's been on a one - man crusade to save Louisiana from the Federal government 's oil spill , but the reality is he 's just trying to score political points in the GOP and get the oil industry out of the crosshairs .
He 's not cleaning oil , he 's just playing games .
CBS has already documented the fact that Jindal has been holding up the deployment of National Guard troops to fight the spill , despite the fact that they were long ago authorized by the Obama administration .
Now Jindal says the reason he did n't deploy the troops because he did n't need the resources .
But if that 's true , what the hell has he been whining about for the past several weeks ?
Today 's report in the NYT adds more detail to Jindal 's failure .
The basic story : Louisiana 's spill response plan was inadequate , largely because the state failed to fully develop a plan .
As a result , instead of following a methodical , well - prepared plan , Bobby Jindal winged it , pursuing grandiose ( and politically sexy ) schemes that most state and local officials as well as experts consider counterproductive , such as Jindal 's proposed barrier islands .
For example :
The state 's oil spill coordinator 's office has had its budget slashed by 50 % over the last decade .
Last year , Jindal cut funding from the state 's oil spill research program .
The state 's oil spill contingency plan 's include " pages of blank charts that are supposed to detail available supplies of equipment like oil - skimming vessels . "
A plan for a worst - case scenario was labeled " to be developed . "
Before Jindal decided to attack the Federal response , state officials signed off on all Coast Guard response plans .
Jindal , who raged at the Federal government for not having enough boom , requested three times as much boom as the state 's plan had called for -- and 50 % more boom than existed in the entire nation .
The NYT report also details how Jindal developed and used his foolish " sand berm " idea as a political weapon .
Nobody -- clearly not even Jindal himself -- actually took his idea seriously , but because it sounded nice at first glance , he proposed and almost immediately turned around and attacked the administration for not approving it , even though nobody thought it would actually work -- and some thought it would make things worse .
Update :
For more on why Jindal 's berm plan is just plain old dumb , check out this post by Joe Romm .
This past week , Outer Blogness - and - beyond has been full of reports from all sorts of families on all sorts of family situations !
To start with , we can hardly discuss Mormon families without hearing from the Polygamists !
( Fascinating podcast — definitely worth a listen . )
Eliza is no longer haunted by polygamy now that she no longer believes it might be imposed on her in the afterlife .
The modern poly life , however , still has its challenges .
In other old - school Mormon doctrines , the Faithful Dissident wonders about the possibility of choosing your eternal family ( rather than focusing solely on the biological family ) .
Speaking of your extended biological family , Holly discusses some interesting genetic studies about Jewish populations .
And Reina has good reason to be proud of the nation of her ancestors .
But the Urban Koda , discussing marriage and apostasy , provided this week ’s feel - good message :
I ’m not with her because I ’m obligated to her because of the kids , or other obligations , or that I ’m worried what people might think if we were to split up .
I ’m with her , because I genuinely love her , and I enjoy being with her .
It ’s great when family love works that way .
Nonetheless , even the happiest families have an element of challenge and compromise .
Take the Christian Mom whose daughter has been caught pole - dancing .
See the exmo- atheist dad flying his family to Scotland and proudly participating in his daughter ’s ( Catholic ) baptism .
And who can forget the hiding - the - booze drama when the Mormon parents come to town ?
( Tangential but interesting , check out Aerin ’s post on Lolita and male feminists . )
Speaking of alternative families , pride came to Utah this week — check out the pics !
This led to some constructive discussion of who ’s pushing their views on whom .
And about who killed traditional marriage .
After all that , it may take some creativity to come out to your family .
Considering the challenges of being in a mixed - faith family , I was intrigued by this post .
In a nutshell , a Mormon author was incensed that folks on facebook would call a former Mormon “ brave . ”
Then ( in a round - about - self - effacing - way ) he implied that his own play was much braver than some bitter ol ’ apostate .
I think this is just a case of a believer who is honestly unfamiliar with what it ’s like to come out as unbeliever to your faithful - LDS family — and it may be an opportunity to have a positive and constructive discussion with him about it .
Moving on from families to general Mormon topics , Jonathan did a bit of number crunching , and found that tithing to the CoJCoL - dS is not a terribly efficient way of giving humanitarian aid .
El Guapo crunches some more numbers on membership .
And the Demon of Kolob was not impressed by the behavior of some Mormons on a recent cruise .
In Mormon funnies , Joseph Smith and Nikola Tesla are both portrayed with rays of power coming out of their hands .
( Recall that Tesla got the patent for the first wireless communications , as I learned from Schoolhouse Rock , and Italian comic book , and blogging . )
Now , sadly , we have to move on to the bad news : the ecological disaster that keeps on giving .
( Or disasters . )
Who to blame ?
And what to do ?
I wish I knew the answer , especially for the last question …

I have been waiting to draw this page for three years .
THREE YEARS
Two pages left .
As a hospital - based doctor , I am one of the people responsible for the country ’s ever - escalating cost of healthcare .
And I can tell you that the new healthcare plan will do nothing to restrain me .
There is enormous pressure on healthcare providers to continue practicing the most expensive medicine in the world .
To resist that pressure , we need some help from policymakers .
Consider the case of a man I ’ll call Mr. A .
At the age of 80 , he is admitted to intensive care after a huge stroke .
He also has pneumonia and kidney failure .
He is too sick to tell us his views on aggressive care at the end of life , but his family is happy to fill the void .
They insist we use every tool at our disposal to prolong his life , despite brain scans making it clear that he will never again be able to walk , talk or feed himself .
The total bill for the last month of life ?
Many tens of thousands of dollars .
Or contemplate Mrs. B ’s case .
She arrives at the ER with shortness of breath .
Tests find iron deficiency anemia .
The most likely cause , based on her history , is an ulcer — probably a benign one .
We can perform an upper GI X -ray , do a blood test for a bacterial infection that commonly causes ulcers and send her home with pills .
Or we can opt for more precise , and far more expensive , tests in which a specialist examines her innards with a fiber - optic scope and takes tissue samples .
In rare cases , this procedure catches something an X - ray can’t .
When presented with the options , the patient chooses the scope .
The result ?
She spends an unnecessary night in the hospital , has $ 1,000 or more of tests and goes home with the same diagnosis and the same medicines she would have if we ’d done the far less expensive X -ray .
And that ’s not all .
Once patients like Mrs. B are diagnosed , they often insist on being prescribed the ulcer medicine they saw last week on a TV ad , which is likely to be a new ( and expensive ) medication rather than one of the reliable drugs that are older and cheaper .
Both of these patients are composites of people we see at the hospital every day , and they demonstrate why it will be so hard to rein in healthcare spending .
Americans have spent the last several decades hearing that all you have to do is be a little assertive to get top - of - the - line treatment .
They have had prescription coverage through their health insurance for so long that they have trouble understanding why I wo n’t prescribe a convenient Z - Pack of antibiotics ( at a cost of $ 60 or so ) instead of amoxicillin , which they have to remember to take three times a day ( at a cost of about $ 4 ) .
Websites and magazines tell them that if the doctors say a condition is untreatable , they should shop around for a specialist , or bully the doctor into trying an experimental treatment and the insurance company into paying for it .
Healthcare rationing is already in place , of course , for uninsured people .
If they qualify for care in public systems like the one in Houston ’s Harris County , where I live , it takes weeks to get through the administrative process and longer still to get an appointment at a clinic .
And if a patient needs a specialist , that will mean another wait , which can lead to life - threatening delays in diagnosis and treatment .
Medicaid ( and soon Medicare ) patients also face rationing of a sort , in that they often can’t find doctors willing to treat them .
Paradoxically , even as costs are rising , hospitals and doctors are finding their work to be less and less profitable .
Even the best insurance plan wo n’t cover the entire cost of Mr. A ’s hospital stay these days , and Mrs. B’s HMO may deny coverage for even a one - night hospital stay .
Doctors who accept patients admitted from the ER are often working for free or paid a small subsidy by the hospital , and those who see uninsured or Medicaid patients in their offices are unlikely to recoup enough to cover their overhead for the visits .
Some efforts are being made to control costs .
Hospitals keep an eye on “ unnecessary days , ” and medical personnel are becoming experts on “ cost - effective care . ”
But the savings of such efforts are insignificant compared with what we spend on futile care at the end of life , or expensive tests and treatments that lead to better outcomes in only a tiny fraction of cases .
Even though President Obama ’s healthcare plan will expand the number of people with insurance , it wo n’t change the reality that we cannot afford to give every patient and family all they want , or to provide four - star medicine when the three - star version is almost as likely to succeed .
Decreasing payments for services will only force hospitals to close and doctors to stop accepting new patients .
Unless someone comes up with a rational program for deciding healthcare priorities , American healthcare is going to become too expensive for any but the rich — and for members of Congress .
Do n’t we deserve better than that ?
Stella Fitzgibbons is a board - certified physician in internal medicine .

GRAND ISLE , Louisiana Ã¢â‚¬â€ Michael Seymour peers at the oiled pelican floating near an island of mangrove trees and winces in frustration because — once again — there ’s absolutely nothing he can do to help .
An amber sheen has stained the pelican ’s white head and brown chest and wings .
But the oil is n’t thick enough to keep it from flying away if Seymour approaches .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The only way to catch a bird in that condition is to chase it repeatedly until it gets tired , ” says Seymour , an ornithologist with the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries .
“ We ’re just going to be putting him under more stress than we need to . ”
Oiled birds are n’t hard to find some 54 days after an explosion on the BP - leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig sparked the worst environmental catastrophe in US history .
The problem is finding a bird that can be rescued without doing more harm than good , Seymour says .
He ’s seen eggs crushed by well - meaning amateurs who trampled through a pelican colony to capture a single oiled bird .
ADVERTISEMENT
Even stepping onto a rocky shore can send hundreds of panicked nesting birds into the skies , exposing their fledglings and eggs to the sweltering sun .
Taking an oiled chick away from its parents means it may never learn the skills it needs to survive on its own .
And capturing a lightly oiled bird still able to fly and feed itself could mean leaving its chicks or eggs untended .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It ’s a tough decision to make , but sometimes we have to make hard decisions for the greater good of the birds , ” Seymour says as he directs the boat captain to move on to another island and leave the oiled pelican behind .
Sometimes they can’t help but take a risk , like with a baby pelican that had fallen out of its nest into a puddle of oil .
But , too often , Seymour has to simply watch the birds preen and hope that they can clean themselves .
ADVERTISEMENT
Further complicating the rescue efforts is the very topography which makes Louisiana ’s coastal wetlands such prime nesting grounds .
It can take 30 minutes to walk ten feet through the tangled , sunken mangrove roots where there ’s plenty of places for the frightened birds to hide .
There ’s nothing to stand on at all in many of the bayous .
And the shifting tides can push the oil deep into the marshes .
Most of Louisiana ’s oiled birds are captured only if their feathers are so sticky they can’t fly and if they can be plucked off the water or a solid shore .
ADVERTISEMENT
The work will be easier for rescue crews working along the rock or sandy beaches of Mississippi , Alabama and Florida .
But with the slick spreading across such a vast region , most badly oiled birds will likely die before they can be rescued , if they ’re found at all .
Some 530 oiled birds have been captured in time to be treated and hopefully released back into the wild .
Another 725 bird carcasses have collected for evidence .
Oil is still gushing out of the ruptured well some 52 miles offshore and far below the surface .
“ It sure would be nice to have that well capped , ” Seymour tells AFP Sunday .
“ We do n’t know when this is going to end and we know the oil is going to keep coming in waves . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The biggest concern in Louisiana is the threat to species which were already on the brink , like the brown pelicans and reddish egrets , Seymour says .
The brown pelican — Louisiana ’s state bird — was nearly wiped in the 1970 ’s due to contamination from the pesticide DDT .
Careful management , and a ban on DDT , allowed the pelicans to thrive to the point where they were taken off the endangered species last November .
Now , it faces the double threat of oil and chemical dispersants in the water and contamination from the fish that are swimming in it .
ADVERTISEMENT
There are only about 100 reddish egrets breeding pairs left in the state , Seymour says .
And a thick ribbon of oil has slipped past the protective boom to coat an island near Grand Isle where a dozen of those pairs are nesting .
“ You ca n’t afford to lose any of those birds , ” he tells AFP .
I think MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews was right in calling for the creation of a Civilian Conservation Corp to put thousands of young people to work cleaning up one of our nation ’s most beautiful and economically viable areas .
Even if it ’s plugged tomorrow , which seems unlikely , millions of barrels of life killing crude oil has to be cleaned up .
Experts are saying that the job will take us well into next year .
In three seasons the ecological balance can be restored along with the sea life on which many families depend to make a livelihood .
However , if the well is n’t plugged and the oil cleaned up soon , shore areas as far away as the East Coast is in line for ruin as well .
British Petroleum should pay a dear price for the mess they have made .
The oil catastrophe in the Gulf demands more fundamental solutions to their reckless business practices .
BP should be nationalized and put under people ’s democratic control .
Let the people who care about the environment have the final say on regulation enforcement and penalties : the men and women who fish for a living , the tourist industries , unions and civic groups .
Why ?
Because this and other incidents show that the first priority of the big oil companies is to stuff their pockets with billions of dollars in profits by any means necessary .
Worker safety and the protection of the environment are secondary to their profits .
What is happening in the Gulf is the worst we ’ve seen but if these profits hungry pirates are allowed to violate regulations and disregard human life and nature what is happening today will happen again and again .
And what is happening now must not happen again .
“ Drill Baby Drill ” turns out to be “ spill baby spill ” , and when it comes to the wildlife and oil workers its “ kill baby kill ” for profits .
But back to the cleanup .
In the meantime the national unemployment is still over 10 % and may go higher .
According to the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress ( JEC ) , the unemployment rate among young workers 16 - 21 years old is almost 20 % the ” highest unemployment rate fro this age group since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking unemployment data in 1947 ″ .
The rate for 16 and 17 year olds in April 2010 was 29 % nationally .
In some communities over 50 % of teenage youth have no jobs .
This problem is especially acute when it comes to African American and Latino youth .
If something dramatic is not done to alleviate this problem , the long - term impact could be disastrous .
Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney chair of the JEC , warned that , “ In light of the scarring effect this recession will have on our young workers , we have to be especially diligent to do everything we can to create jobs , to bring down the record unemployment among young people , and to help these young workers build new skills . ”
An immediate measure that will help ease this problem would be to train and send thousands of unemployed youth to the Gulf Coast to do a historic public service and gain some skills .
These young people should be paid decent wages and have the right to unionize and have affirmative action and full OSHA protection .
Who ’s going to foot the bill ?
Frankly I say let BP pay until the job is done .

Michelle R. sent in a segment from CNN that asks children to associate positive or negative attributes with various skin tones , much like a famous 1940s experiment that asked children which doll they preferred .
The original experiment , and recreations since then , have found that children of all races tend to view lighter - skinned dolls or images more positively ( prettier , smarter , more desirable as a classmate ) than darker - skinned ones , and to believe that adults do so as well ( sorry for the ads before each segment ) .
Anderson Cooper then talks to some of the children about their answers :
It ’s fascinating that kids pick up on competing cultural themes and use them in their answers — that is , skin color is n’t supposed to matter and you judge people as individuals , but people still do care about skin color .
And they all agree that the “ good ” skin color ( from their own perspective or what they think adults prefer ) is lighter .
And to hear a girl refer to her own skin color as “ nasty ” … heartbreaking .

Zimbabwe 173 for 7 ( Chigumbura 76 , Johnson 4 - 23 ) beat Australia 172 for 7 ( Clarke 49 ) by 1 run
Scorecard
Elton Chigumbura works the ball to leg during his 76 Getty Images
Zimbabwe delivered Australia a wake - up call after taking two wickets in the final over to seal a one - run win in their warm - up in St Lucia .
Australia were on track chasing Zimbabwe 's 173 for 7 when David Warner smashed 72 off 49 and the captain Michael Clarke took them to the verge of victory with 49 from 42 .
Australia wanted 13 from the final over but the task became too difficult when Clarke was bowled from the second - last ball by Chris Mpofu .
Mitchell Johnson was then run-out from a wide and Brett Lee could only manage a bye from the final delivery .
It was a practice game but it was Australia 's first T20 defeat of the season and it will worry them that they lost so much momentum at the vital stages of the chase .
Zimbabwe had relied on Elton Chigumbura to lift them after they were 36 for 4 in the sixth over .
Chigumbura quickly provided some substance as he blasted six sixes and five fours in his 76 off 33 balls .
Craig Ervine chipped in with a valuable 39 in the stand of 114 that took the side to safety .
Lee made an encouraging comeback from his broken thumb with 1 for 13 off four and Johnson led the figures with 4 for 23 .
Life was not as rosy for Nathan Hauritz , Daniel Christian and Shane Watson , who all went at 12 or more an over .
The Australians , who left out Shaun Tait and Cameron White , play a Windward Island XI on Thursday in their last chance to fire before their opening match of the tournament against Pakistan on Sunday .
Zimbabwe face Sri Lanka on Monday in Guyana before running into New Zealand .
I have been looking for this video , but havnt found it yet .
It was back a few years ago when Chris Pronger was still with the St. Louis Blues , they were playing the Red Wings in the playoffs .
Chris took a puck to the chest that left him winded , he later got up and started skating to the bench but then he collapsed again on the ice .
If anyone has this video , easy best answer for you .
Thanks .
We do n't know how we missed this the first time it was making the rounds on the internet -- but we have a theory .
Twenty five - year old Iron Man fanatic Anthony Le spent one month and over $ 4,000 making the Iron Man ( well , War Machine , actually ) suit you see above ( and in the video below ) .
It 's constructed mostly of high - impact urethane and has a resin helmet which was made from a clay mold .
It 's incredibly impressive , and insanely detailed -- and it looks just like Iron Man .
So yeah , the first time we saw this , we probably just assumed we were looking at the real Iron Man and moved on without ever investigating or reading the text .
And for that , we are truly sorry .

Earth and space are about to come into contact in a way that ’s new to human history .
To make preparations , authorities in Washington DC are holding a meeting : The Space Weather
Many technologies of the 21st century are vulnerable to solar storms .
Richard Fisher , head of NASA ’s Heliophysics Division , explains what it ’s all about :
“ The sun is waking up from a deep slumber , and in the next few years we expect to see much higher levels of solar activity .
At the same time , our technological society has developed an unprecedented sensitivity to solar storms .
The intersection of these two issues is what we ’re getting together to discuss . ”
The National Academy of Sciences framed the problem two years ago in a landmark report entitled “ Severe Space Weather Events — Societal and Economic Impacts . ”
It noted how people of the 21st - century rely on high - tech systems for the basics of daily life .
Smart power grids , GPS navigation , air travel , financial services and emergency radio communications can all be knocked out by intense solar activity .
A century - class solar storm , the Academy warned , could cause twenty times more economic damage than Hurricane Katrina .
Much of the damage can be mitigated if managers know a storm is coming .
Putting satellites in ‘ safe mode ’ and disconnecting transformers can protect these assets from damaging electrical surges .
Preventative action , however , requires accurate forecasting — a job that has been assigned to NOAA .
“ Space weather forecasting is still in its infancy , but we ’re making rapid progress , ” says Thomas Bogdan , director of NOAA ’s Space Weather Prediction Center in Boulder , Colorado .
Bogdan sees the collaboration between NASA and NOAA as key .
“ NASA ’s fleet of heliophysics research spacecraft provides us with up - to - the - minute information about what ’s happening on the sun .
They are an important complement to our own GOES and POES satellites , which focus more on the near - Earth environment . ”
Among dozens of NASA spacecraft , he notes three of special significance : STEREO , SDO and ACE .

STEREO ( Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ) is a pair of spacecraft stationed on opposite sides of the sun with a combined view of 90 % of the stellar surface .
In the past , active sunspots could hide out on the sun ’s farside , invisible from Earth , and then suddenly emerge over the limb spitting flares and CMEs .
STEREO makes such surprise attacks impossible .
SDO ( the Solar Dynamics Observatory ) is the newest addition to NASA ’s fleet .
Just launched in February , it is able to photograph solar active regions with unprecedented spectral , temporal and spatial resolution .
Researchers can now study eruptions in exquisite detail , raising hopes that they will learn how flares work and how to predict them .
SDO also monitors the sun ’s extreme UV output , which controls the response of Earth ’s atmosphere to solar variability .
On April 19 , 2010 , SDO observed one of the most massive eruptions in years .
Earth was not in the line of fire … this time .

Bogdan ’s favorite NASA satellite , however , is an old one : the Advanced Composition Explorer ( ACE ) launched in 1997 .
“ Where would we be without it ? ” he wonders .
ACE is a solar wind monitor .
It sits upstream between the sun and Earth , detecting solar wind gusts , billion - ton CMEs , and radiation storms as much as 30 minutes before they hit our planet .
“ ACE is our best early warning system , ” says Bogdan .
“ It allows us to notify utility and satellite operators when a storm is about to hit . ” NASA spacecraft were not originally intended for operational forecasting — ” but it turns out that our data have practical economic and civil uses , ” notes Fisher .
“ This is a good example of space science supporting modern society . ” 2010 marks the 4th year in a row that policymakers , researchers , legislators and reporters have gathered in Washington DC to share ideas about space weather .
This year , forum organizers plan to sharpen the focus on critical infrastructure protection .
The ultimate goal is to improve the nation ’s ability to prepare , mitigate , and respond to potentially devastating space weather events .
“ I believe we ’re on the threshold of a new era in which space weather can be as influential in our daily lives as ordinary terrestrial weather . ”
Fisher concludes .
“ We take this very seriously indeed . ”

Here ’s an excellent article on hedge fund managers by Robert Reich .
Who could be opposed to closing a tax loophole that allows hedge - fund and private equity managers to treat their earnings as capital gains — and pay a rate of only 15 percent rather than the 35 percent applied to ordinary income ?
Answer :
Some of the nation ’s most prominent and wealthiest private asset managers , such as Paul Allen and Henry Kravis , who , along with hordes of lobbyists , are determined to keep the loophole wide open .
The House has already tried three times to close it only to have the Senate cave in because of campaign donations from these and other financiers who benefit from it .
But the measure will be brought up again in the next few weeks , and this time the result could be different .
Few senators want to be overtly seen as favoring Wall Street .
And tax revenues are needed to help pay for extensions of popular tax cuts , such as the college tax credit that reduces college costs for tens of thousands of poor and middle class families .
Closing this particular loophole would net some $ 20 billion .
It ’s not as if these investment fund managers are worth a $ 20 billion subsidy .
Nonetheless they argue that if they have to pay at the normal rate they ’ll be discouraged from investing in innovative companies and start - ups .
But if such investments are worthwhile they should n’t need to be subsidized .
Besides , in the years leading up to the crash of 2008 , hedge - fund and private equity fund managers were n’t exactly models of public service .
Many speculated in ways that destabilized the whole financial system .
Nor are these fund managers especially deserving , as compared to poor and middle - class families that need a tax break to send their kids to college .
Nor are they particularly needy .
Last year , the 25 most successful hedge - fund managers earned a billion dollars each .
One of them earned 4 billion dollars .
( Paul Allen ’s personal yacht holds two luxury submarines and a helicopter .
Henry Kravis is one of the wealthiest people in the world . )
Several of these private investment fund managers , by the way , have taken a lead in the national drive to cut the federal budget deficit .
The senior chairman and co-founder of the Blackstone Group , one of the largest private equity funds , is Peter G. Peterson , who never tires of telling the nation it faces economic ruin if deficits are n’t brought under control .
Curiously , I have not heard Peterson advocate closing this tax loophole as one way to further the cause of fiscal responsibility .
Closing tax loopholes for billionaires may seem like a no - brainer , especially at a time when the nation is cutting back spending on the middle class — slashing budgets that fund child care , public schools , and public universities .

30 days after our first list of incredible things you could do with all that oil , the list gets much more incredible .
It gets especially bad now that the official leak rate estimate could be as high as 60,000 barrels - a- day .
At least 1.33 million barrels has now been released into the Gulf .
Boston University 's Cutler Cleveland published a similar list on his blog and ecosalon with an index of incredible things that have equivalent energy cost to the disastrous leak .

Chuck Liddell had to go to hospital after his first - round defeat against Rich Franklin at UFC 115 © UFC Enlarge
UFC President Dana
White has said that Chuck Liddell will not fight again following his first - round loss to Rich Franklin at UFC 115 .
The loss was the former light - heavyweight champion 's fifth in six fights and his third straight defeat by knockout .
Liddell , once revered as the most feared fighter in MMA , made a good start to the fight in Vancouver , catching Franklin with a few early shots , but quickly capitulated as his opponent directed several accurate punches towards his head .
The 40 - year - old , who began his professional fighting career in 1998 , had to go to hospital after the fight and White believes the nature of Liddell 's latest defeat suggests that he is no longer worthy of a place in UFC .
" I 'll be the first one to say he does not have the same chin he used to , " White said .
" You get to a point in your career and the chin just goes .
I 've been around fighters my whole life and you could have hit Chuck in the face with a pole at one time and it would n't have knocked him out .
He had an incredible chin .
" We all turn 40 and we all get old .
Michael Jordan was the greatest basketball player in the world .
It happens to everybody .
" He wanted this and he gave it his best shot .
He went out like Chuck Liddell would .
He was blasting and throwing bombs and he gave the fans a last , good fight with the Iceman . "
Liddell is yet to make a formal announcement regarding his future .

Ron Paul : Get Off Obama's Ass On BP
LOS ANGELES — Archaeologists from the University of California , Los Angeles , and Ireland have discovered the world ’s oldest leather shoe , an exquisitely preserved , 5,600 - year - old woman ’s size 7 lace - up , in a cave in Armenia .
The shoe , 1,000 years older than the great pyramid of Egypt and 400 years older than Stonehenge in the United Kingdom , was in such pristine condition that at first researchers thought it was just a few centuries old .
It was stuffed with grass that may have been used to keep the wearer ’s foot warm or that might have been to preserve the shoe ’s shape for storage , the researchers reported Wednesday in the online journal PLoS One .
Both grass and shoe were well preserved , like other organic materials discovered in preliminary excavations of the cave on the border between Armenia and Iran , including winemaking apparatus complete with grapes and three human heads preserved in jars .
Most such materials degrade over time ; the team attributed the unusual preservation to the cave ’s perennially cool temperature and low humidity and a concrete - like layer of sheep dung that sealed everything in and prevented fungi from destroying the remains .
“ The conditions in the cave . . . are rather rare , ” allowing preservation of artifacts from a time period for which such materials are scarce , said UCLA archaeologist Charles Stanish , who was not involved in the research .
The cave , he added , is only one of at least 39 that researchers are just beginning to explore .
“ The potential to rewrite the early history of northern Mesopotamia is quite vast , ” he said .
“ The shoe itself is really interesting and cool , ” added archaeologist Mitchell S. Rothman of Widener University in Chester , Penn. , who was not involved in the research .
“ But it is just a marker of how incredibly good the preservation is at the site , which is incredibly important . ”
The artifacts date from the Chalcolithic or Copper Age , when the first metal tools began appearing .
“ The fourth millennium is when the modern world appears — the first cities , the first kings , the first axes , the first bureaucrats , and the first international trading system , ” Rothman said .
Southern Iraq , where the first cities appeared , had no natural resources of its own and all the raw materials had to come from the surrounding mountains , from sites like this one .
The site “ connects us up to this growing picture of the development of societies , ” he said .
The new paper focuses primarily on the shoe , however .
Prior to the discovery , the oldest known footwear from Eurasia was found on Otzi , the Iceman discovered on a glacier in the Otztal Alps on the border between Austria and Italy .
Those shoes are about 5,300 years old , but were in relatively poor shape .
They were moccasin - type footwear in which the sole is attached to an upper “ sock ” with leather thongs .
The oldest known footwear — more sandal than shoe — were discovered in Missouri and are about 6,900 years old .
Made from woven fibers and leather , they are also in poor condition .
Radiocarbon dating indicated that the newly found shoe was from about 3,600 B.C.
Its relatively sophisticated design , however , suggests that the style had already been in use for a long period , said UCLA archaeologist Gregory Areshian , the co-leader of the research team .
Previously , he added , researchers had tried to reconstruct what shoes had looked like from impressions on pottery and other fragmentary artifacts .
“ Here we have it in an absolutely tangible way . ”
The shoe is shaped to fit the wearer ’s right foot .
It is 9.65 inches long , which corresponds to a U.S. woman ’s size 7 .
Though small , it could easily have fitted a man from that era , said archaeologist Ron Pinhasi of University College Cork in Ireland , Areshian ’s co-leader .
Researchers have so far excavated only about 2 per cent of the cave , which is at least 150 feet deep .
They already know that the main part of the cave was not used for living , but primarily for storage and , perhaps , ritualistic purposes .
The inhabitants apparently lived under rock shelters outside the caves .
The team believes the cave was abandoned following an earthquake , which caused the ceiling to collapse .
After that , “ it was used by pastoralists who grazed their sheep there ” until about the 12th Century AD , when there is evidence of bread baking and other uses , Areshian said .
The research was funded by the National Geographic Society , UCLA and several foundations .
news G20 Dispatches : So Alternative
Christopher Bird and Christopher Drost are Torontoist ’s staffers accredited for the G20 .
They will be reporting on the inside for the duration of the summit ; Torontoist ’s complete G20 coverage , including reporting from the streets , is here .
Watching the World Cup at the International Media Centre .
At the end of a long day of reporting , Chris Drost and I sit back at the International Media Centre ’s open bar , drinking Mill Street Organic on the taxpayer ’s dime ( thank you , fellow citizens ) , watching Japan destroy Denmark on a giant projection TV next to half a dozen happy - as - shit reporters from Fuji TV , and thanking sweet Jesus above that we ’re not stuck in the Alternative Media Centre any longer .
There is no free beer in the Alternative Media Centre , and that is only one of many , many reasons it ’s the media centre where nobody wants to be .
The Alternative Media Centre is the dumping ground for , well , “ alternative media , ” which makes it seem like Broken Social Scene should be playing in the background .
Really , what it is is a collection point for bloggers , NGOs , and other potentially troublesome organizations .
“ But wait ! ” you say .
“ You ’re bloggers . ”
Yes , but we are Torontoist , with ties to a major national newspaper , and that makes all the difference here .
OpenFile , with actual salaried employees and a big budget , is consigned to the Alternative Media Centre because they kill no trees and do n’t even hang out with people who kill trees .
Here in the Real Media Centre , it ’s all about killing trees .
Inside the Alternative Media Centre .
The government ’s working theory , apparently , is that the Alternative Media Centre will become some sort of oasis for all the disparate news sources of the world .
It ’s early yet so maybe it ’ll happen .
Right now , though , it does n’t feel that way .
The Alternative Media Centre is a cavernous banquet hall in the newly renovated Allstream Centre , across the street from the International Media Centre in the Direct Energy Building at the CNE , and despite some nice attempts to provide amenities ( wifi , pastries , buffet lunch , a flatscreen showing World Cup — and do n’t think for a second everybody here is n’t watching the soccer whenever they have a spare moment ) , it still feels like a hastily thrown together lecture hall .
It ’s the Charlie Brown of media centres .
The Alternative Media Centre has wifi ?
The International Media Centre has ethernet everywhere , connected to a massive pipe .
The Alternative Media Centre has televisions showing the various press briefings ?
The International Media Centre has the actual briefings , and the ability to ask questions at said briefings .
The Alternative Media Centre has complimentary Coke , Sprite , and ginger ale ?
The International Media Centre has fucking Pop Shoppe .
( And , of course , free beer and wine . )
And then there are the measures that makes one think the Alternative Media Centre is n’t just meant to handle media overflow , but to actually introduce ( or , if you prefer , reinforce ) the pernicious element of class to the media scrum .
The accreditation badges for everybody else here are big honking things with photographs and barcodes and scanny things ; everybody has them , right down to the catering staff — except for AMC reporters , who instead get a dinky little card with no photograph that looks like you could fake one at Kinko ’s for ten bucks .
Both media centres are right inside the Princes ’ Gate , but only “ real ” media people are allowed to drive through the Princes ’
Gate ; AMC - accredited folks have to go all the way around to the Dufferin Gate , which makes absolutely no sense considering that everybody parks in the same parking lot .
Inside the Alternative Media Centre .
The NGOs who have arrived early all seem concerned with one thing : access to the International Media Centre .
You can understand why .
Government officials have suggested that perhaps the first - tier media or public officials will come over and visit the Alternative Media Centre , but that seems like suggesting that maybe that people who are bored of Toronto will find the big-city thrills they seek in Ajax .
Besides , all you need to know about how many people the organizers expect to come over and give talks at the Alternative Media Centre can be summed up like this : at the start of the week , the raised stage they have for presentations had a long table with multiple microphones , of the sort you expect to see when seven to ten people are all speaking in a row .
Now ?
There ’s one lonely podium .
ONE , CARE Canada , WorldVision , RESULTS , PLAN , and UNICEF are all stuck here in the AMC , and every single one of them wants somebody in the International Media Centre because they ’ve all been working for months to convince the Harper government that Canada should argue for the adoption of serious agendas to reduce child mortality and maternal health at the G20 summit .
Sheila Nix , the U.S. executive director of ONE , says that their goal is to get the G8 to commit to tracking child mortality and maternal health statistics at the level of detail needed to actually figure out what works to prevent it .
This is not small ball we ’re talking about here , policy - wise .
This is stuff that matters .
Now , within inches of the goal line , they ’re off the field and waiting to see what Stephen Harper does .
Nix complains that for NGOs , “ this is a brand new level of segregation … this is the first time we ’ve been in a separate place . ”
One NGO staffer , preferring to remain anonymous , muttered that the collective worry was that now , without the NGOs in the spotlight , Harper might choose to abandon the reproductive health elements of the agendas they ’ve spent meeting after meeting pushing .
( This seems unlikely .
If Stephen Harper wants to torpedo parental planning funding , he ’ll do it in public with a dead - eyed “ fuck you ” on his face . )
Inside the Alternative Media Centre .
They ’re not alone .
A frustrated OECD trade union representative from France complains that “ it ’s always like this . ”
Representatives from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis And Malaria — a fund that was created by the G8 in the first place — sit around wondering what happens next .
A group of five representatives of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty from various African nations sit at their laptops , presumably telling their readers about the David Miller press conference / ad pitch for Toronto .
( Number of uses of “ world class ” in said presser : four .
Number of positive comparisons to London , New York City and Paris : one apiece . )
Rajesh Latchman , of the National Welfare Forum in South Africa , shakes his head and says “ sadly , we do n’t expect much to come out of this G20 . ”
Then he cheers himself up by talking about how Bafana Bafana smacked around the French on Monday , demonstrating that the French definitely have their uses in this world .
That ’s what life is like in the Alternative Media Centre .
You wait a lot .
You watch the TV feeds a lot .
( At this point it ’s mostly planes landing .
A ONE staffer cracks “ this is just like being at the airport ! ”
Another responds , “ there ’s no free pastry at the airport . ” )
There ’s no fake lake to cheer you up .
You try not to notice that the catering staff have fancier security passes than you do .
And you call everybody you can in an attempt to get the hell out of here .
After one sad half - day at the Alternative Media Centre , Christopher Bird and Christopher Drost received their clearance from the RCMP and were given badges for the International Media Centre .
They will be reporting from there for the duration of the summit .

In re Loehmann ’s Holdings Inc. , Case No. 10-10677 ( REG ) ( Bankr . S.D.N.Y. June 2 , 2011 )
International naval forces battling piracy in the lawless seas off the Horn of Africa are to be joined for the first time by a submarine .
A single Dutch Walrus - class boat will operate in the area from September to November this year as part of NATO 's Operation Ocean Shield taskforce .
They do n't like being the Royal Netherlands Navy .
But there 's only one Royal Navy , and they 're not it
According to a NATO statement issued yesterday , Holland agreed to assign one of its four submarines following a request from Alliance military officials .
The statement goes on to say :
The submarine will be used to monitor communication between pirate vessels and their warlords on shore , helping to curtail the hijacking of commercial ships for ransoms worth millions in US dollars .
This will be the first submarine to contribute to NATO ’s anti-piracy mission “ Operation Ocean Shield ” off the horn of Africa .
As one of four Walrus - class submarines belonging to the Royal Netherlands Navy , it is one of the most modern non-nuclear submarines .
Built with stealth technologies , it is very difficult to detect – even by other submarines – and can remain submerged for long periods .
The various international naval taskforces operating in the Gulf of Aden and adjacent parts of the Indian Ocean have thus far been composed of surface warships only .
Holland 's Walrus - class submarines use diesel - electric propulsion rather than the nuclear powerplants universal in the US and British submarine fleets .
This means that when fully submerged they must run on battery power , reducing them to a crawl ( a short sprint at speeds approaching those of merchant shipping can be managed , but this will drain the batteries in half an hour or less ) .
In order to move faster than a few knots , such a sub must come to the surface : though batteries can be recharged moving a little faster at periscope depth by the use of a " snorkel " or " snort " air - intake mast to run the diesels underwater .
These limitations mean that diesel - electric subs struggle to have major effect in open - ocean warfare , where they have difficulties in getting close to a moving target without giving their presence away .
However their electric drive is extremely quiet in operation , meaning that they were hard to find when fully submerged using the passive ( listening - only ) sonar tactics of yesteryear .
If such a boat had managed to get into the path of an opposition ship or fleet without putting up masts and so popping up on radar , it could have been dangerous during the brief period before its batteries were exhausted .
The scope for open - ocean war against fully equipped enemies has been largely nil for twenty years now , however , and advanced navies are shifting to the use of low - frequency active pinging sonars that would sniff out a Walrus - class anyway .
The Dutch submarines will probably never again be much in demand for their torpedo tubes and multiple arrays of cunning passive sonar , as they were back in the 1980s .
So why did NATO ask specifically for a Walrus boat , rather than a nuclear one able to stay down for months going as fast - or faster than - a surface ship the whole time ?
The answer is that a small conventional boat ( a Walrus class displaces 2800 tons submerged compared to a new British Astute boat 's 7,800 ) can covertly get into much shallower waters than a massive nuclear - powered one can .
This means that its electronic support measures ( ESM , that is the comms and radar detection / interception gear ) mast can get a lot closer to signals to and from the shore - and , perhaps , to and from captured ships anchored close in .
The Dutch submariners are already known to have done a lot of useful sneaky work off the Balkans in the 1990s , and it seems that they are now being recalled for more of the same off Somalia .
Much though the recent brouhaha in the Western media over Somali pirates has largely died down , the region 's buccaneers have n't gone away ( nor did they spring up suddenly in recent times - the Gulf of Aden has been a piracy hotspot time out of mind ) .
The MV Golden Blessing , a 14,000 - ton chemical tanker registered out of Singapore , was seized two days ago : a responding German frigate is " monitoring the situation " , but based on past experience a ransom payment is now much more likely than a forcible recapture .
According to the International Maritime Bureau there were four other unsuccessful pirate attacks in the region during the preceding week .
One was repelled by gunfire from an armed security team aboard the target vessel : the other merchant skippers managed to evade their pursuers by use of non-deadly means . ®
The word " slick " did not come to mind as Tony Hayward , the embattled chief executive of BP , foundered in a sea of congressional questioning this week .
Never in the face of righteous political indignation did expertise look so unconvincing and so unworthy of its status .
But in many respects Mr. Hayward and BP were simply unlucky :
They were caught out by an event they did n't think would happen and then compounded the problem by sounding clueless when asked to explain what went wrong or how they would fix it .

Dropping ultra-cold quantum gas down an elevator shaft could help prove Einstein wrong .
Scientists have shown that it ’s possible to keep sufficiently close tabs on quantum mechanical objects in free fall to tell whether two such objects experience gravity the same way .
In 1907 , Einstein suggested that if you were in a windowless elevator that was plunging towards Earth in free fall , you would feel the same weightlessness as if you were floating in outer space .
This notion , known as the equivalence principle , laid the foundation for general relativity .
It explains why a pebble and a piano fall at the same speed if dropped from the same roof , despite their different masses .
It ’s also a necessary first step toward describing the effects of gravity as curvature in spacetime .
“ It ’s a very important cornerstone , ” said physicist Ernst Rasel of the Leibniz University of Hannover in Germany .
But , he added , the equivalence principle “ is just a postulate — it ’s not coming out of a law . ”
So of course , physicists have spent the past century trying to break it .
Earlier tests used man-made , macroscopic objects like rotating pendulums to make sure two elements of different masses fall toward Earth at the same speed .
Physicists also have bounced laser light off mirrors left on the moon in the 1960s to make sure the Earth and the moon feel the same acceleration from the sun ’s gravity .
So far , to the limits of the experiments ’ accuracy , Einstein ’s idea has held up .
To get more precise measurements , physicists are turning to smaller and smaller test masses , all the way down to the atomic scale where conventional laws of motion give way to quantum mechanics .
In the June 18 Science , Rasel and his colleagues describe a technically tricky but conceptually simple test of how quantum objects experience gravity in a free - fall : Drop one down an elevator shaft .
Though the elevator trial has n’t directly tested general relativity yet , it proves that tests with two different kinds of atoms can be done with unprecedented sensitivity .
Rasel ’s team used a quantum object called a Bose - Einstein condensate , a gas so cold its atoms all act as one particle .
The team used lasers to cool rubidium atoms to a few billionths of a degree above absolute zero .
Because rubidium is a type of particle called a boson , several of its atoms can pack together in the same quantum state and act as one particle , or one matter wave .
Normally , preparing a Bose - Einstein condensate takes a room full of carefully aligned lasers , vacuum chambers and delicate electronics .
But Rasel and colleagues crammed all the necessary equipment into a capsule 24 inches wide and 85 inches tall .
The team then dropped the capsule down the 480 - foot - tall drop tower at the Center for Applied Space Technology and Microgravity in Bremen , Germany , which was designed for similar experiments in low gravity .
“ It ’s just so impressive as an experiment , ” comments Paulo Nussenzveig of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil .
“ It ’s inspiring .
If these people did it , then it can be done . ”
The researchers managed to watch the Bose - Einstein condensate carefully enough that at the end of the fall , they were confident that nothing but gravity acted on the quantum gas .
Then , just to be sure , they repeated the drop 180 times .
“ We ’ve demonstrated that you can do this reliably , ” Rasel said .
This reliability will be important for doing similar experiments in space , which Rasel said is the ultimate goal .
“ One of the things that is important for all these relativity tests , you will measure very small effects , so you need to accumulate data over a long period of time , ” Nussenzveig noted .
“ That means running the experiment again and again and again and again . ”
In space , physicists will be able to watch a quantum gas fall continuously for years , as opposed to the four seconds it spends in the drop tower .
Next , Rasel and his colleagues plan to drop quantum gases of two different elements , rubidium and potassium , to see if they behave the same way .
If their matter waves are out of phase , it ’s a sign that something ’s wrong with the equivalence principle .
Watching Bose - Einstein condensates in free fall could also help sketch a map of the intersection between quantum mechanics and general relativity .
These twin pillars of modern physics do n’t play well together — scientists have yet to come up with a description of the universe that describes both at the same time .
“ Performing this experiment with an intrinsically quantum mechanical object inside it can in principle lead to new insight , bringing together these two very important developments from 20th century physics , ” Nussenzveig said .
“ This is opening up a new testing ground . ”

Sig Rogich is a hyper - connected Nevada Republican who helped elect Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush , and once worked a few steps from the Oval Office in a White House corner later occupied by Karl Rove .
So which candidate gets Rogich 's considerable support in the Nevada Senate race : Democrat Harry Reid or Republican Sharron Angle ?
" Harry Reid , " says the GOP strategist , who started " Republicans for Reid " months ago .
" I could never support somebody who espouses the radical positions that Angle does . "
IN PICTURES : Notable women in US politics
Rogich 's position is another small but significant sign that Reid , the Senate majority leader whose popularity has plummeted in Nevada , has a new hope for re-election .
Reid 's rival — according to consultants and elected officials in both parties , as well as independent observers — may be a more flawed candidate than Reid .
And that 's saying something .
Reid , 70 , is a highly visible symbol of what many Nevadans consider to be a liberal , big- spending Obama agenda .
A majority of the state 's voters disapprove of his performance , polls show , and they are restless .
Nevada is among the hardest hit states in terms of unemployment and housing , with the jobless rate at 13.7 percent in April and record foreclosures .
On top of that , Reid is more comfortable in Congress than on the campaign trail .
He can be prickly , and is prone to silly mistakes .
Reid apologized in January after a book revealed that during the 2008 presidential campaign , he described Obama as a light - skinned African - American " with no Negro dialect , unless he wanted to have one . "
And there 's Reid 's biggest handicap :
While early primaries suggest this year 's elections will be marked by an anti-establishment , anti-Washington sentiment , Reid is Washington 's Mr. Establishment — leader of an unpopular Senate who spends his many nights in Washington at the Ritz - Carlton .
Who can blame Republicans for waxing nostalgic about 2004 , when South Dakota voters turned out then - Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle ?
" And now , " Rogich says of Angle , " we 've got this nightmare . "
The Republican mayor of Reno , longtime Reid backer Bob Cashell , calls Angle an " ultra right - winger " who is " just too far to the right for me . "
While Rogich and Cashell supported Reid before Angle 's GOP primary victory , their concerns about her reflect the feelings of many inside the GOP establishment .
Angle , 60 , was an anti-tax , anti-government social conservative years before the tea party emerged .
A largely unknown former state lawmaker with 10 grandchildren , she is as far outside the political establishment as Reid is inside .
Angle supports phasing out Social Security , wiping out the Education Department and returning to the days almost a century ago when the federal income tax was unconstitutional .
She has not said how she would — or even if she would — propose replacing government pensions or lost tax receipts .
During four terms in the state Assembly , she agitated leaders of both parties as a vote - no oppositional figure with sometimes unconventional views .
She wanted female inmates to enter a drug rehabilitation program devised by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard , an idea she still defends .
Angle backs the processing of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain , a wildly unpopular idea in Nevada .
She is , for now , often the subject of ridicule .
" Harry Reid has been on the ropes , " says Eric Herzik , chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada - Reno , " but now he has as an opponent , Sharron Angle , who ... . "
At that , Herzik begins to laugh .
Why ?
" Because , " he says , " she may be the only Republican alive Harry Reid can beat . "
Reid wasted no time trying to cement that image in Nevada , unleashing an ad within days of Angle 's primary victory that depicts her as a heartless extremist who would slash Social Security and Medicare for the elderly .
The narrator asks , " What 's next ? "
That ominous tag line , Reid advisers suggest , will be a constant refrain as the Democrat spends his campaign budget — on track toward $ 25 million and expected to overwhelm what Angle can muster — to turn voters against her .
With his poll numbers so low and the public mood so sour , Reid 's advisers know the score :
If the election remains a referendum on the incumbent , Reid probably loses .
He needs to make the race about Angle .
Still , voters also will get a heavy dose of advertising that highlights Reid 's political clout , and what it can deliver to recession - bitten Nevadans .
It 's a tactic endorsed by former President Bill Clinton , who has told Reid that he might as well embrace his Washington record because he can't run from it .
" We 're not trying to show them that Washington is working , " said Reid spokesman Jon Summers , " We 're trying to show them that Harry Reid is working for them . "
Angle , meanwhile , is struggling to expand her political operation beyond her Reno living room .
She is getting help from the GOP and its allies , including a group led by Rove .
" I can't keep up , " sighed her harried spokesman , Jerry Stacy , as he declined an interview request on behalf of his boss .
Reid also declined an interview for this story .
Angle was in Washington this week to meet party leaders and start softening the rougher edges of her image .
During an interview with Fox News Channel 's Sean Hannity , Angle disavowed her opposition to the Social Security program and said she just wanted to " personalize " it .

Apparently Kanye West and Drake have both been sued for stealing songs .
Kanye West was accused for stealing the song Stronger .
Vincent Peters , a rapper from Virginia , claims he sent his version of the song to Kanye West ’s manager , John Monopoly .
Peters was hoping that Monopoly would produce the track for him .
Peters claims that Kanye ’s version stole many of the lyrics from his track .
Peters never got the deal with Monopoly but several months after he sent Monopoly the song , it came out on Kanye ’s album .
The lawsuit against West asks that :
“ West and the record labels be prohibited from selling , distributing or performing the allegedly copyrighted song , and that they destroy all copies they have of the single . ”
The chances of this happening are obviously slim and I ’m assuming it will just be settled out of court , that ’s how these things usually work .
In Drake ’s case , he is being sued by Playboy .
They are suing him for copyright infringement in regards to his song Best I Ever Had .
Playboy says that the song Drake samples at the start is the song “ Fallin ’ In Love , ” by Hamilton , Joe Frank and Dennison / Reynolds .
They say that Drake should have known that the song was protected by copyright .
Like in the Kanye lawsuit , Playboy wants Drake to stop selling / distributing the song and to stop profiting from it .
Once again , this probably wo n’t happen .
Either way it ’ll be interesting to see how this all plays out .
Washington ( CNN ) --
A top Democrat kept up the Joe Barton drumbeat Sunday , saying the Republican legislator 's defense of BP last week was an example of GOP ideology that favors big business .
Republicans seeking to change the subject countered that the nation 's focus should be on efforts to stop the Gulf oil gusher and criticized the Obama administration for failing to make that happen .
The statement last Thursday by Republican Rep. Joe Barton of Texas -- which was quickly retracted under pressure from House GOP leadership -- provided Democrats an opportunity to deflect growing public disenchantment with how the government was responding to the oil disaster .
Acknowledging the political gift handed to his party by Barton , White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel told the ABC program " This Week " that Barton 's comment and other pro-BP statements by Republicans including Kentucky Senate candidate Rand Paul would be a factor in the November congressional elections .
" In case you forgot what Republican governance is like , Joe Barton reminded you , " Emanuel said , calling Barton 's comments a " philosophy " that considered BP the " aggrieved party " instead of the oil giant responsible for the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history .
" These are n't political gaffes -- Joe Barton was speaking from prepared remarks , " Emanuel said , calling the comment reflective of a GOP approach that considers the government to be the problem , not BP .
However , a statement later Sunday from the House Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans said Barton spoke off the cuff .
The statement included what it said were his prepared remarks , which made no mention of an apology to BP or criticism of the fund the company created to pay for damages from the oil spill .
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of oil - rich Alaska also challenged Emanuel 's comments , telling the CNN program " State of the Union " that the White House chief of staff was trying to deflect attention away from the magnitude and severity of the oil disaster .
" Let 's not be distracted by saying , you know , Joe Barton made this gaffe or this -- this inappropriate comment , " Murkowski said .
" Let 's focus on what we need to do , which is getting relief to the Gulf , making sure that they have every asset possible , making sure that we 've got a claims compensation system that works for them .
Let 's focus on providing what the people of the Gulf need , not pointing fingers back and forth and saying , 'oh , you know , what you said was wrong . ' "
At a House committee hearing intended to grill BP CEO Tony Hayward , Barton instead drew the headlines for an opening statement that apologized to BP over the $ 20 billion account to pay damage claims that the company created at the request of President Barack Obama .
" I am ashamed of what happened at the White House yesterday , " said Barton , the ranking Republican on the panel .
" I think it is a tragedy of the first proportion that a private corporation would be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown -- in this case a $ 20 billion dollar shakedown . "
Democrats including Vice President Joe Biden and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs immediately criticized Barton , and Republicans quickly distanced themselves from their colleague .
By mid-afternoon , Barton issued a statement retracting his apology to BP and instead apologizing for calling the fund a shakedown .
Now the Democratic National Committee is promising a television ad focusing on Barton 's comment , and Emanuel made sure to keep the issue alive on Sunday .
Murkowski and her Republican colleague Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama , both criticized Barton 's comment , with Shelby calling it a " dumb mistake " and declaring on the CBS program " Face the Nation " that his party believed the oil disaster was a " man-made incident , a big mistake " by BP .
" They tried to do it on the cheap , I believe , made some shortcuts and they paid for it , and now we paid for it , " he said of the massive oil leak .
Shelby also invited two of the Republicans cited by Emanuel -- Barton and Paul -- to visit the Gulf Coast region and witness themselves what is happening .
However , Shelby also added that Barton " only spoke for himself -- that is not mainstream Republican thought . "
On the same program , though , Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Barton 's comment was " illustrative that the oil industry rules the roost . "
He noted that senators from major oil - producing states were trying to prevent the chamber from voting on a bill that would greatly increase the liability of oil companies for damages from spills .
Tens of millions of Americans , lumped into a diffuse and fractious movement known as the Christian right , have begun to dismantle the intellectual and scientific rigor of the Enlightenment .
They are creating a theocratic state based on “ biblical law , ” and shutting out all those they define as the enemy .
This movement , veering closer and closer to traditional fascism , seeks to force a recalcitrant world to submit before an imperial America .
It champions the eradication of social deviants , beginning with homosexuals , and moving on to immigrants , secular humanists , feminists , Jews , Muslims and those they dismiss as “ nominal Christians ” — meaning Christians who do not embrace their perverted and heretical interpretation of the Bible .
Those who defy the mass movement are condemned as posing a threat to the health and hygiene of the country and the family .
All will be purged .
The followers of deviant faiths , from Judaism to Islam , must be converted or repressed .
The deviant media , the deviant public schools , the deviant entertainment industry , the deviant secular humanist government and judiciary and the deviant churches will be reformed or closed .
There will be a relentless promotion of Christian “ values , ” already under way on Christian radio and television and in Christian schools , as information and facts are replaced with overt forms of indoctrination .
The march toward this terrifying dystopia has begun .
It is taking place on the streets of Arizona , on cable news channels , at tea party rallies , in the Texas public schools , among militia members and within a Republican Party that is being hijacked by this lunatic fringe .
Elizabeth Dilling , who wrote “ The Red Network ” and was a Nazi sympathizer , is touted as required reading by trash - talk television hosts like Glenn Beck .
Thomas Jefferson , who favored separation of church and state , is ignored in Christian schools and soon will be ignored in Texas public school textbooks .
The Christian right hails the “ significant contributions ” of the Confederacy .
Sen .
Joseph McCarthy , who led the anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s , has been rehabilitated , and the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is defined as part of the worldwide battle against Islamic terror .
Legislation like the new Jim Crow laws of Arizona is being considered by 17 other states .
The rise of this Christian fascism , a rise we ignore at our peril , is being fueled by an ineffectual and bankrupt liberal class that has proved to be unable to roll back surging unemployment , protect us from speculators on Wall Street , or save our dispossessed working class from foreclosures , bankruptcies and misery .
The liberal class has proved useless in combating the largest environmental disaster in our history , ending costly and futile imperial wars or stopping the corporate plundering of the nation .
And the gutlessness of the liberal class has left it , and the values it represents , reviled and hated .
The Democrats have refused to repeal the gross violations of international and domestic law codified by the Bush administration .
This means that Christian fascists who achieve power will have the “ legal ” tools to spy on , arrest , deny habeas corpus to , and torture or assassinate American citizens — as does the Obama administration .
Those who remain in a reality - based world often dismiss these malcontents as buffoons and simpletons .
They do not take seriously those , like Beck , who pander to the primitive yearnings for vengeance , new glory and moral renewal .
Critics of the movement continue to employ the tools of reason , research and fact to challenge the absurdities propagated by creationists who think they will float naked into the heavens when Jesus returns to Earth .
The magical thinking , the flagrant distortion in interpreting the Bible , the contradictions that abound within the movement ’s belief system and the laughable pseudoscience , however , are impervious to reason .
We can not convince those in the movement to wake up .
It is we who are asleep .
Those who embrace this movement see life as an epic battle against forces of evil and Satanism .
The world is black and white .
They need to feel , even if they are not , that they are victims surrounded by dark and sinister groups bent on their destruction .
They need to believe they know the will of God and can fulfill it , especially through violence .
They need to sanctify their rage , a rage that lies at the core of the ideology .
They seek total cultural and political domination .
They are using the space within the open society to destroy it .
These movements work within the confining rules of the secular state because they have no choice .
The intolerance they promote is muted in the public assurances of their slickest operators .
Given enough power , and they are working hard to get it , any such cooperation will vanish .
The demand for total control and for a Christian nation and the refusal to permit any dissent are on display within their inner sanctums .
These pastors have established within their churches tiny , despotic fiefdoms , and they seek to replicate these little tyrannies on a larger scale .
Many of the tens of millions within the Christian right live on the edge of poverty .
The Bible , interpreted for them by pastors whose connection with God means they cannot be questioned , is their handbook for daily life .
The rigidity and simplicity of their belief are potent weapons in the fight against their own demons and the struggle to keep their lives on track .
The reality - based world , one where Satan , miracles , destiny , angels and magic did not exist , battered them like driftwood .
It took their jobs and destroyed their future .
It rotted their communities .
It flooded their lives with alcohol , drugs , physical violence , deprivation and despair .
And then they discovered that God has a plan for them .
God will save them .
God intervenes in their lives to promote and protect them .
The emotional distance they have traveled from the real world to the world of Christian fantasy is immense .
And the rational , secular forces , those that speak in the language of fact and evidence , are hated and ultimately feared , for they seek to pull believers back into “ the culture of death ” that nearly destroyed them .
There are wild contradictions within this belief system .
Personal independence is celebrated alongside an abject subservience to leaders who claim to speak for God .
The movement says it defends the sanctity of life and advocates the death penalty , militarism , war and righteous genocide .
It speaks of love and promotes fear of damnation and hate .
There is a terrifying cognitive dissonance in every word they utter .
The movement is , for many , an emotional life raft .
It is all that holds them together .
But the ideology , while it regiments and orders lives , is merciless .
Those who deviate from the ideology , including “ backsliders ” who leave these church organizations , are branded as heretics and subjected to little inquisitions , which are the natural outgrowth of messianic movements .
If the Christian right seizes the legislative , executive and judicial branches of government , these little inquisitions will become big inquisitions .
The cult of masculinity pervades the movement .
Feminism and homosexuality , believers are told , have rendered the American male physically and spiritually impotent .
Jesus , for the Christian right , is a muscular man of action , casting out demons , battling the Antichrist , attacking hypocrites and castigating the corrupt .
This cult of masculinity , with its glorification of violence , is deeply appealing to those who feel disempowered and humiliated .
It vents the rage that drove many people into the arms of the movement .
It encourages them to lash back at those who , they are told , seek to destroy them .
The paranoia about the outside world is stoked through bizarre conspiracy theories , many championed in books such as Pat Robertson ’s “ The New World Order , ” a xenophobic rant that includes attacks on liberals and democratic institutions .
The obsession with violence pervades the popular novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins .
In their apocalyptic novel , “ Glorious Appearing , ” based on LaHaye ’s interpretation of biblical prophecies about the Second Coming , Christ returns and eviscerates the flesh of millions of nonbelievers with the sound of his voice .
There are long descriptions of horror and blood , of how “ the very words of the Lord had superheated their blood , causing it to burst through their veins and skin . ”
Eyes disintegrate .
Tongues melt .
Flesh dissolves .
The Left Behind series , of which this novel is a part , contains the best - selling adult novels in the country .
Violence must be used to cleanse the world .
These Christian fascists are called to a perpetual state of war .
“ Any teaching of peace prior to [ Christ ’s ] return is heresy … ” says televangelist James Robinson .
Natural disasters , terrorist attacks , instability in Israel and even the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are seen as glorious signposts .
The war in Iraq is predicted , believers insist , in the ninth chapter of the Book of Revelations , where four angels “ which are bound in the great river Euphrates will be released to slay the third part of men . ”
The march is inevitable and irreversible and requires everyone to be ready to fight , kill and perhaps die .
Global war , even nuclear war , is not to be feared , but welcomed as the harbinger of the Second Coming .
And leading the avenging armies is an angry , violent Messiah who dooms hundreds of millions of apostates to a horrible and gruesome death .
The Christian right , while embracing a form of primitivism , seeks the imprint of law and science to legitimate its absurd mythologies .
Its members seek this imprint because , despite their protestations to the contrary , they are a distinctly modern , totalitarian movement .
They seek to co-opt the pillars of the Enlightenment in order to abolish the Enlightenment .
Creationism , or “ intelligent design , ” like eugenics for the Nazis or “ Soviet ” science for Stalin , must be introduced into the mainstream as a valid scientific discipline — hence the rewriting of textbooks .
The Christian right defends itself in the legal and scientific jargon of modernity .
Facts and opinions , once they are used “ scientifically ” to support the irrational , become interchangeable .
Reality is no longer based on the gathering of facts and evidence .
It is based on ideology .
Facts are altered .
Lies become true .
Hannah Arendt called it “ nihilistic relativism , ” although a better phrase might be collective insanity .
The Christian right has , for this reason , its own creationist “ scientists ” who use the language of science to promote anti-science .
It has fought successfully to have creationist books sold in national park bookstores at the Grand Canyon and taught in public schools in states such as Texas , Louisiana and Arkansas .
Creationism shapes the worldview of hundreds of thousands of students in Christian schools and colleges .
This pseudoscience claims to have proved that all animal species , or at least their progenitors , fit on Noah ’s ark .
It challenges research in AIDS and pregnancy prevention .
It corrupts and discredits the disciplines of biology , astronomy , geology , paleontology and physics .
Once creationists can argue on the same platform as geologists , asserting that the Grand Canyon was not created 6 billion years ago but 6,000 years ago by the great flood that lifted up Noah ’s ark , we have lost .
The acceptance of mythology as a legitimate alternative to reality is a body blow to the rational , secular state .
The destruction of rational and empirically based belief systems is fundamental to the creation of all totalitarian ideologies .
Certitude , for those who could not cope with the uncertainty of life , is one of the most powerful appeals of the movement .
Dispassionate intellectual inquiry , with its constant readjustments and demand for evidence , threatens certitude .
For this reason incertitude must be abolished .
“ What convinces masses are not facts , ” Arendt wrote in “ Origins of Totalitarianism , ” “ and not even invented facts , but only the consistency of the system which they are presumably part .
Repetition , somewhat overrated in importance because of the common belief in the masses ’ inferior capacity to grasp and remember , is important because it convinces them of consistency in time . ”
Augustine defined the grace of love as Volo ut sis — I want you to be .
There is , he wrote , an affirmation of the mystery of the other in relationships based on love , an affirmation of unexplained and unfathomable differences .
Relationships based on love recognize that others have a right to be .
These relationships accept the sacredness of difference .
This acceptance means that no one individual or belief system captures or espouses an absolute truth .
All struggle , in their own way , some outside of religious systems and some within them , to interpret mystery and transcendence .
The sacredness of the other is anathema for the Christian right , which cannot acknowledge the legitimacy of other ways of being and believing .
If other belief systems , including atheism , have moral validity , the infallibility of the movement ’s doctrine , which constitutes its chief appeal , is shattered .
There can be no alternative ways to think or to be .
All alternatives must be crushed .
Ideological , theological and political debates are useless with the Christian right .
It does not respond to a dialogue .
It is impervious to rational thought and discussion .
The naive attempts to placate a movement bent on our destruction , to prove to it that we too have “ values , ” only strengthens its legitimacy and weakness our own .
If we do not have a right to be , if our very existence is not legitimate in the eyes of God , there can be no dialogue .
At this point it is a fight for survival .
Those gathered into the arms of this Christian fascist movement are desperately struggling to survive in an increasingly hostile environment .
We failed them ; we owe them more :
This is their response .
The financial dislocations , the struggles with domestic and sexual abuse , the battle against addictions , the poverty and the despair that many in the movement endure are tragic , painful and real .
They have a right to their rage and alienation .
But they are also being used and manipulated by forces that seek to dismantle what is left of our democracy and abolish the pluralism that was once the hallmark of our society .
The spark that could set this conflagration ablaze could be lying in the hands of a small Islamic terrorist cell .
It could be in the hands of greedy Wall Street speculators who gamble with taxpayer money in the elaborate global system of casino capitalism .
The next catastrophic attack , or the next economic meltdown , could be our Reichstag fire .
It could be the excuse used by these totalitarian forces , this Christian fascism , to extinguish what remains of our open society .
Let us not stand meekly at the open gates of the city waiting passively for the barbarians .
They are coming .
They are slouching toward Bethlehem .
Let us shake off our complacency and cynicism .
Let us openly defy the liberal establishment , which will not save us , to demand and fight for economic reparations for our working class .
Let us reincorporate these dispossessed into our economy .
Let us give them a reality - based hope for the future .
Time is running out .
If we do not act , American fascists , clutching Christian crosses , waving American flags and orchestrating mass recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance , will use this rage to snuff us out .

UC transportation engineering PhD student Zhixia Li found that factors affecting whether we run yellow lights include lane position , type of vehicle , travel speed and speed limit , and the timing of the light .

Engineering graduate student Zhixia Li was attracted to UC because of the real - world education and experience the university provides .
In return , he 's headed a real - world project that every driver can relate to : the " yellow light dilemma . "
Are you , as a driver , more likely to stop or speed through a yellow light ?
Transportation engineering PhD student Zhixia Li was attracted to the University of Cincinnati because of the real - world education and experience the university provides .
In return , he 's headed a real - world project that every driver can relate to .
It 's a project on which he has presented and published nationally , and it looks at what he calls the " yellow light dilemma . "
Are you , as a driver , more likely to stop or to speed through a yellow light ?
Here 's what he found when conducting research , in cooperation with the Ohio Department of Transportation , at intersections in Akron , Cleves and Fairfield , Ohio : Certain factors make it more likely that you 'll opt to speed through an intersection rather than stop at the light .
The results of his research with his advisor Prof.
Heng Wei , " Analysis of Drivers ' Stopping Behaviors Associated with the Yellow Phase Dilemma Zone — An Empirical Study in Fairfield , OH , " will be presented at the 2010 American Society of Highway Engineers National Conference on June 9 - 13 , 2010 , in Cincinnati , at the Hilton Cincinnati Netherland Plaza .
So what are the factors that make us run the yellow ?
These include
Lane position : Drivers in the right lane are 1.6 times more likely to speed through a yellow light as compared to drivers in the left lane .
Type of vehicle : Drivers in heavy trucks are more likely to " pass through " a yellow light versus drivers of automobiles , SUVs , vans or pickup trucks .
Travel speed and speed limit :
The greater the traveling speed of a vehicle at the onset of a yellow light , the more likely that vehicle is to pass through a yellow light .
Another finding : the higher the posted speed limit , the more likely vehicles are to pass through a yellow light .
Timing of light : Yellow lights are typically set to persist between 3 to 5 seconds .
Drivers coming upon an intersection where the yellow light persists longer are more likely to pass through the yellow light .
For each " additional " second a yellow light persists , drivers are more than three times as likely to pass through an intersection .
So , for example , a driver is more than three times as likely to pass through a yellow light set to persist for 5 seconds versus a yellow light set to persist for 4 seconds .
Ditto for a yellow light that persists for 4 seconds versus a yellow light that persists for 3 seconds .
This UC research will help traffic engineers consider and test safety and traffic efficiency measures , including the positioning of sensors that time traffic lights .
And it just might help drivers consider their own actions when in the yellow light dilemma zone .

LEAMINGTON , Ont. --
An F1 tornado touched down in Leamington early Sunday amidst a torrential flood that 's drowned crops the Harrow area , damaged trees and left ditches overflowing across the southern reaches of the county .
" ( Harrow ) just looks like a massive lake when you drive down there , " said Essex Deputy Mayor Richard Meloche , reached Sunday at the Red Bull Air Race .
He said Harrow , Colchester and Oxley were inundated by the storm .
" There 's going to be a lot of corn crops that are going to have to be replanted . "
Late Sunday afternoon Environment Canada confirmed that a tornado in the F1 range touched down in Leamington and travelled a distance of 300 to 400 metres .
There was damage over an area of two kilometres , with the rest of the damage caused by downbursts , said Peter Kimbell of Environment Canada .
Near Kingsville , said county warden Nelson Santos , properties near the Albuna Townline were doused by a " one - two punch " of rain and suspected tornado activity .
Cedar Beach was also flooded .
Though none were killed or injured , he said , trees in the area are " toppled , twisted and snapped off . "
Gas lines have broken in some places .
Kimbell said two tornado warnings were issued overnight .
One was sent out at 11:15 a.m. , but no tornado materialized .
A second was issued at 2:37 a.m .
That second warning sparked off a major wind event he declined to identify as a tornado without further inspection .
A rain warning was also issued around 12:20 a.m .
That rain , said Essex Region Conservation Authority flood control co-ordinator Tim Byrne , came in a very short amount of time .
He said many flood control systems around the county were old and not up to the task of handling snap rains .
" The rainfall we did receive did not warrant us issuing a flood advisory , " he said .
Leamington has been under a state of emergency as of 6:25 a.m. Sunday .
Decades - old trees were toppled , power lines were torn down and homes were destroyed .
No death or injuries have been reported , but strong winds caused severe structural and tree damage .
Broken tree limbs are scattered throughout the affected areas , including Erie Street South from Seacliff Drive to the marina and smaller streets branching off .
Leamington 's public works department called out most of its employees to deal with the wreckage .
" We 're just trying to clean the streets , " said Allin Gelinau , who usually does garbage pickup for the town .
" You come out here and it 's like a war zone , " he said .
" This is the first time I 've seen anything like it , " he said .
There is also damage to the marina area , including Seacliff Park and docks that have shifted away from the pier .
Falling trees and debris shattered the windows of vehicles and properties .
" I 've lived here all my life and I have n't seen anything like this , " said Leamington Deputy Mayor Robert Schmidt .
" It 's quite shocking . "
Schmidt declared the state of emergency shortly after meeting with the town 's emergency response team .
Leamington Mayor John Adams is out of town and could not be reached for comment .

NEW YORK — More than a year removed from public office , former vice president Al Gore and his wife Tipper are enjoying the best sex of their lives , the happy couple reported Monday .
Advertisement
" For far too many years , we did n't have time to really focus on us , " Gore told Matt Lauer during an interview on Today .
" Between raising the kids and running for office and everything else , there always seemed to be something that took precedence over romance .
But now , with the kids all grown up and a job that does n't take up every waking moment of the day , I can finally enjoy some nice moments of intimacy with my beautiful and , dare I say , sexy wife . "
Gore said that in the past 12 months , he and Tipper have " rekindled the flame of passion " in their marriage , taking time each day to lavish attention and affection on each other .
Citing one such example , Gore said that last Friday , he came home from a speech at the American Bar Association 's annual convention to find Tipper waiting for him in the bedroom in a lace teddy with a rose between her teeth .
She then handed him a book of " love coupons " redeemable for a variety of sexual favors .

" It 's that sort of spontaneity that keeps things exciting in a marriage , " said Gore , lovingly stroking his wife 's hair .
" And , believe me , things were pretty exciting that night . "
Added Tipper : " Al can be a real tiger . "
According to Gore , the frequency of his sexual activity with Tipper has increased significantly in the past year .

" I must say I 'm very satisfied with our current volume of lovemaking , " said a visibly relaxed Gore .
" Did I say satisfied ?
I meant overjoyed .
In fact , things are so good , I may have to seriously rethink my plans to make another run for president in 2004 ! "
Though she admitted she 's " never been much of a thrill - seeker in the sex department , " Tipper said a number of her recent intimate encounters with her husband have involved an element of risk : On Feb. 25 , she said , the couple " got amorous " just moments before an endorsement appearance for South Dakota senate candidate Tim Johnson .
A week later , they coupled during a cross-country flight to California .

" Forgive me if I blush , Matt , " Tipper told Lauer , " but Al and I actually made love about half an hour ago , right before coming on this show . "
Despite their current inflamed passion , the Gores said their sex life did not instantly reignite upon departing Washington last year .
Advertisement
" After losing the election , Al was really depressed for a while , " said Tipper , a longtime crusader for mental - health issues .
" With depression , as you may know , there typically comes a loss of sexual appetite .
Over time , though , he gradually realized that this was a good chance to rediscover parts of himself he 'd forgotten .
That 's when we began our sexual re-awakening . "
Not since Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter left the White House for Plains , GA , in January 1981 has there been such an upswing in post -Executive Office coitus .

" Things are less hectic , but it 's not like we 're loafing around doing nothing , " Tipper said .
" Al 's been doing fundraising for his political action committee , and I 've been busy speaking at Democratic fundraisers , as well as continuing my work as honorary chairwoman for the National Mental Health Awareness Campaign .
But in no way does any of that diminish our desire to spend a romantic evening together in a bubble bath , surrounded by scented candles . "
Added Gore : " The difference between our current work lives and the way it was before is that now we come home energized .
Our work keeps us apart just enough to heighten our passion .
It 's a great feeling , coming home from a fundraiser all pumped up and being able to transfer that energy into carrying my wife to bed and letting nature take its course , if you know what I mean . "

" It 's like right after we were married all over again , " a flushed Tipper said .

WPost , NYT Show Tough - Guy Swagger
When Americans wonder how their country has ended up in so many pointless and seemingly endless conflicts around the world , like the meandering Afghan War and the bloody mess in Iraq , a good place to start would be the “ prestige ” newspapers , the Washington Post and the New York Times .

And , they are now engaged in a replay regarding Iran .
On Saturday , the Post ’s editorial writers joined their counterparts at the Times in a new Establishment chorus demanding “ regime change ” in Iran through the ouster of the country ’s Islamic - directed government by supporting the opposition Green Movement , which lost last year ’s presidential election and then mounted public protests .
Since that election one year ago , it has become an accepted truth in the major U.S. news media that the Green Movement ’s candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi won the election which was then stolen by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
So , the thinking goes , President Barack Obama must abandon his naïve efforts to negotiate with Iran over its nuclear program and instead ratchet up bilateral tensions by throwing more U.S. support behind the Iranian opposition – and winking at Israeli plans to launch airstrikes against military targets inside Iran .
Those attacks would supposedly spark an uprising in Iran .
This wishful thinking is reminiscent of the run-up to war in Iraq .
Then , too , the Post and Times – plus much of Washington ’s foreign policy elite – bought into a mythology of their own making , wanting to believe that the internal opposition in Iraq was much stronger than it was and that negotiating with the official leadership was a sign of weakness and betrayal .
The fantasies about Iraq led to neoconservative dreams of a " cake walk " for U.S. troops as Iraqis threw rose petals .
Now , similar uncritical thinking is being applied to Iran .
“ A year ago , ” the Washington Post ’s editorialists wrote on Saturday , “ a movement was born that offers the best chance of ending the threat posed by Iran ’s support for terrorism and pursuit of nuclear weapons , ” adding that : “ Mr. Obama ’s strategy has n’t slowed Iran ’s nuclear program or its aggressions toward Iraq , Lebanon or Israel .
The popular discontent reflected in the Green Movement offers another avenue for action , one that is more in keeping with America ’s ideals .
It ’s time for the president to fully embrace it . ”
Last Thursday , a New York Times editorial took a similar line , praising the new round of anti-Iran sanctions that the Obama administration pushed through the U.N. Security Council , though the Times said they “ do not go far enough . ”
The Times also took a mocking swipe at Brazil and Turkey , which voted against the new sanctions after having convinced Iran to swap about half its low - enriched uranium for more processed uranium that could only be used for peaceful purposes .
“ The day ’s most disturbing development was the two no votes in the Security Council from Turkey and Brazil , ” the Times wrote .
“ Both are disappointed that their efforts to broker a nuclear deal with Iran did n’t go far .
Like pretty much everyone else , they were played by Tehran . ”
But the truth was that the Iran - Turkey - Brazil deal was torpedoed by the United States , although President Obama had privately encouraged it .
Turkey and Brazil were n't " played by Tehran " ; they were double - crossed by Washington .
Other Belligerent Voices
In recent weeks ,
Times star columnist Thomas L. Friedman also has weighed in with an influential column advocating U.S. backing for the Green Movement rather than further negotiations over Iran ’s nuclear program .
The Green Movement ’s “ success — not any nuclear deal with the Iranian clerics — is the only sustainable source of security and stability .
We have spent far too little time and energy nurturing that democratic trend and far too much chasing a nuclear deal , ” Friedman wrote .
These moralistic “ tough - guy ” tones might sit well with armchair warriors like the Washington Post editorial page editor Fred Hiatt and the New York Times executive editor Bill Keller , but they appear likely to continue America ’s stumbling progression toward another Middle East war .
And , as during the prelude to the Iraq War , the attitudes of the Post and Times editorialists are in sync with the warmongering of the neoconservatives .
Regarding Iran , it is hard to distinguish between the opinions of the Post , the Times and , say , neocon propagandist Michael Ledeen writing recently in the Wall Street Journal .
So , over the past several weeks , it has become the collective judgment of key honchos from American journalism that the Obama administration should refuse to seek compromises regarding Iran ’s nuclear program and instead push for “ regime change . ”
However , beyond the human consequences of such war - like policies , there ’s the journalistic concern about these prestigious opinion leaders making up their own “ reality . ”
For instance , there ’s the troublesome fact that virtually all the available evidence indicates that – contrary to Western hopes and desires – President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the June 12 , 2009 , election in Iran and that his chief challenger Mousavi did n’t even come close .
As an analysis by the University of Maryland ’s Program on International Policy Attitudes discovered , not a single Iranian poll – whether before or after the election , whether conducted inside or outside Iran – showed Ahmadinejad with less than majority support .
[ For details , see Consortiumnews.com ’s “ Ahmadinejad Won , Get Over It ! ” ]
However , the Post and Times seem determined to place their cherished myth of Mousavi ’s victory at the center of U.S. foreign policy .
Over the past year , whenever they mention the Iranian elections , the Post and Times characterize the vote as “ disputed ” or cite the opposition ’s accusations that the results were “ rigged ” or “ fraudulent . ”
The Bush Exception
Though one might argue that such wording is fair given the controversy , it is worth noting that the two newspapers took the opposite approach toward the U.S. presidential election in 2000 when the evidence was overwhelming that George W. Bush stole the victory from Al Gore , who got more votes nationally and apparently got most of the legal votes in the key state of Florida .
Rather than forthrightly present the findings of a news media study which discovered Gore ’s rightful Florida victory a year after the election , the editors of the Post and Times buried the startling result and instead highlighted hypothetical partial recounts that still left Bush ahead .
The editorial thinking – after the 9/11 attacks – apparently was that the truth would undermine Bush ’s “ legitimacy ” amid the crisis and open the newspapers to accusations that they had undercut the patriotic unity that was then sweeping the country .
To enforce the " Bush - won " judgment , prominent commentators , such as the Post ’s media writer Howard Kurtz , mocked anyone who bothered to read the recount study ’s actual results and who dared notice the unacceptable outcome ( Gore ’s victory ) .
Those who did became “ conspiracy theorists . ”
[ For details , see the book , Neck Deep . ]
So , the major U.S. news media harps on what is essentially an unsupported conspiracy theory – that Ahmadinejad “ stole ” the Iranian election – while treating as a “ conspiracy theory ” the accurate recognition that Bush did steal the U.S. election .
You can look far and wide for the Post and Times referring to Election 2000 as " disputed " or " rigged " without much success .
To make matters worse , the Times and Post editorialists now have elevated their mythology about Iran ’s “ fraudulent ” election into the chief rationale for relying upon the Green Movement to facilitate “ regime change ” in Iran , despite recent evidence that the opposition is fizzling .
“ As a formal political organization , the reform movement is dead , ” reported Will Yong and Michael Slackman in a news story for Saturday ’s Times that nevertheless carried the hopeful headline , “ Across Iran , Anger Lies Behind Face of Calm . ”
( Given today ’s economic dislocations , a similar headline could be applied to nearly every country on the planet , including the United States . )
Spiking Afghan Peace Meanwhile , in Afghanistan , as the U.S. and NATO casualty lists grow , the New York Times also is taking a hard line , publishing an editorial on Monday , condemning Afghan President Hamid Karzai for even exploring a possible peace deal with the Taliban .
As happened with Obama regarding his initial interest in engaging the Iranian government , Karzai is portrayed as foolish for thinking that a negotiated peace is possible for Afghanistan , at least not before U.S. Gen.
Stanley McChrystal gets more time to pummel the Taliban .
Though acknowledging that McChrystal ’s war escalation so far has met little success , the editorialists said his “ counterinsurgency strategy still seems like the best chance to stabilize Afghanistan and get American troops home . ”
As for Karzai ’s peace overtures , the Times concluded : “ We do n’t know if the Taliban leaders will ever compromise .
But we are sure that they will consider it only under duress .
General McChrystal is going to have to do a much better job [ in an upcoming offensive ] in Kandahar .
Mr. Karzai is going to have to drop his illusions and commit to the fight . ”
It apparently is beyond the ken of the smart editorialists at the Post and Times that they may be the ones suffering from “ illusions . ”

Alright so everyone saw Nolan ’s The Dark Knight .
It was epic .
It ’s pretty obvious by how awesome it was and how well it did , there ’s going to be a sequel .
Theres plenty of rumors floating around about who might be the next bad guy or …bad girl , and I figured I would throw my hat in the ring .
These are obviously all conjecture as I have no idea who it ’ll be but we can pretend I ’m right because I ’m on the internet .
# 1 The Penguin
One the most ridiculous villains in Batman lore , Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot is a diminutive man who uses his size to surprise .
There ’s a lot to work with as Penguin is one of Batmans longest running villains and has a huge amount of stories .
He ’s usually involved in mob affairs but runs completely valid business ventures to hide his less scrupulous affairs and often escapes from serving any penance for his crimes .
His usual schtick involves bringing in random bird elements to crimes and using a parasol filled with various poison gases and a knife .
Who should play him : Philip Seymour Hoffman
This one is rumored to actually be true so I figured I ’d start with it .
It ’s basically the perfect match , much more so than Danny Devito in Burton ’s Batman who may have the stature of the Penguin but lacks the finer qualites .
Penguin is n’t usually protrayed as some disgusting whole fish eating bird monster .
Instead he ’s a very smooth calculating intelligent rogue who uses his various connections to extend a web of power that is embedded in Gotham so well it ca n’t run without him .
In a Nolan film he could be a new mob leader in town replacing any of the various ones that fell out during Dark Knight .
He probably would n’t ever “ fight ” Batman directly , instead staying above the law and Batmans reach but constantly making his influence known .
Runner Ups : Vincent Dinofrio , Seth Rogan
# 2 The Riddler
Edward Nigma is an easily recognized villain in Batman lore , known for his penchant for riddles he ’s been a backbone to a lot of great Batman stories .
Recently they ’ve had him turn a new leaf and he works as a private detective and has helped Batman on a few cases .
He still holds the need to find answers to everything which is why that change is a good fit .
As a villain Riddler often brough gripes from fans because he intentionally left clues so that he would be caught which almost makes anything he did pointless .
The recent change gave him some of his reasoning back and helped develop his character .
Not to be trifled with Riddler is one of the few people to discover Batmans true identity through his own means .
Who should play him : David Tennant
Alright so this ones kind of cheating .
David Tennant is an amazing actor from Doctor Who and is the perfect fit for Riddlers style .
It ’s cheating because Tennant himself said he wants to play Riddler and would jump at the opportunity .
Which is a fantastic idea .
There ’s been talk that Johnny Depp wants to play the Riddler as well but I think ol Dave would be a much better fit , the guy already looks exactly like him and his mannerisms are very similar .
Depp could pull it off sure , but I ’d still give it to Tennant for a better performance all around .
As for how to incluce Riddler in a Nolan style Batman you could introduce him like he is currently as a private detective who spends his hours trying to figure out who Batman is , or just use the set up from Dark Knight and have Riddler be the guy who found out who Bruce was from his finacials at Wayne Enterprises .
It ’d be a lot like the Jim Carrey version ’s orgin … which I did n’t mind , just without Jim Carrey .
Runner Ups : Johnny Depp , Ed Norton , Jeffrey Donovon
# 3 Clayface
Clayface is a great tragic Batman villain , at least in my favorite iteration .
His animated series version is the one that ’s best in my mind as that 2 part orgin story was very emotional for a kid ’s cartoon .
Basically he’s an overworked actor named Matt Hagen who gets in an accident that ruins his face … so he makes a deal with a mob boss for some facial reconstruction clay , why they ’d have this I ’m not sure …
Anyway , he eventually runs out of work and needs more and more of the clay until he can’t pay for it anymore and owes them a bunch of money .
So they do what the mob always does and …fills an entire car with the stuff while hes inside , smothering him and leaving him for death .
That obviously does n’t work and he seeks revenge , making him a tragic villain but one who wants to kill .
Something Batman can’t stand for as much as he ’d like to .
Who should play him : Nathan Fillion
Really it does n’t actually matter who plays him before he changes into a giant clay monster … but I just want to hear Nathan do the voicework for it afterwards .
Surely Clayface would be CGI which probably goes against most of Nolans other Batman characters but I think it ’d be worth it .
Fillion could easily bring the acting chops to the pre clayface Matt Hagen and afterwards bring a great voice to the CGI work .
In a Nolan movie Clayface could be brought in a number of ways but I think the underpaid actor is a good route .
Runner Ups : Paul Walker , Josh Hartnett
# 4 The Mad Hatter
The Mad Hatter has always been one of my favorite Batman villains .
He ’s got a great schtick based on Alice in Wonderland of all things and has an impressive list of mental problems .
Jervis
Tetch has a very offsetting appearence and even weirder demeanor consisting of things like he wo n’t eat a piece of food that does n’t have a hat on it , and states that he is not interested in the sight of his naked teammate because she was n’t wearing a hat .
This is a great great psychotic villain who could fit a very Joker like nische of the next Batman film .
Who should play him : Johnny Depp
A lot of people are saying they want to see Depp as a primary runner for Riddler .
I on the other hand think he’d be a pretty great Mad Hatter .
Give him a little bit of Sweeney Todd with a little bit of Willy Wonka and throw in some psychotic rambling and you ’ve got a perfect cast .
He ’s easily got the chops to come off as creepy and funny while keeping audiences guessing .
The only major problem is he doesnt really look like Mad Hatter but in actuality no one does .
For a Nolan style movie they ’d have to tone down his huge facial features and tiny body , but he could be accenctuated in other places like the costume , much like how Ledger ’s Joker did n’t have white skin but make up instead .
# 5 Poison Ivy
Poison
Ivy is another one of the easy to recognize Batman villains .
She has various orgins all involving plants somehow being more important to her than humans which usually lead her to do insane things for the environment and Batman showin up to stop her .
She was pretty much butchered in her only live action appearence , not that I blame Uma Thurmond but the script was just terrible .
Nolan I ’m sure could come up with a much better orgin and keep her original to the comic …as in ridiculously hot .
Who should play her : Christina Hendricks
Christina is an actress who ’s been in a few Joss Whedon creations but is probably more well known for her role in Mad Men .
She ’s pretty much spot on to play Poison Ivy as she can exude … everything … that ’s needed for the role .
A Nolan
Ivy could be introduced easily as an environmentalist / scientist who ’s wronged by everyone in her life but her plants and seeks revenge on Gotham , and its protector .
Runner Ups : Scarlett Johansson , Felecia Day
# 6 Maxie Zeus
Unlike most on this list so far Maxie Zeus is n’t recognizable at all outside of major Batman fans .
He ’s basically a very rich and influencial businessman who out of no where starts to believe that he ’s the reincarnation of the God Zeus and decides all of Gotham should be under his thumb .
He leads a criminal empire and begins wearing a toga with delusions of grandeur and in some cases a major messianic complex .
Who should play him : Rufus Sewell
Not only does ol Rufus here look exactly like him but he has the acting chops to pull it off …easily .
In Nolan ’s version Maxie could be a normal company CEO who leads his business into criminal undertakings after Wayne Enterprises drops them out of normal business .
This would put him in direct competition with Wayne and set up for a Batman confrontation .
Runner Ups : Really he ’s the only one who should play him but Vincent Dinofrio could pull it off as well ..
# 7 Hush
Hush is a relatively new rogue of Batman ’s who started out kind of boring but has grown pretty well in recent events .
His story could be changed to a film relatively easy as a childhood friend of Bruces who has a falling out and returns deducing that he ’s Batman and trying to ruin both his lives .
Who should play him ?
Clive Owen
Owen would n’t have any trouble with this role at all , in fact it ’s a pretty pitch perfect match .
The only problem with Hush would be he ’s not well known but really he ’s more realistic than a lot of Batman rogues who probably would n’t fit in a Nolan film .
He ’d be fine as a secondary villain much like Two Face , although his motives might be pretty similar .
Alright that ’s it for now .
I might cast a few more of these sometime in the future , I ’ve got a few ideas for Mr. Freeze and Harley Quinn but they ’ll have to wait .
Until then enjoy this cover of Metallica .
A couple years back , Isthmus wrote about how Madison resident Linda Willsey was ticketed by police after getting " doored " by a car in downtown Madison ( " Cops Ticket Biker Hit by Car Door , " 8/14/08 ) .
That story helped prompt passage of a new state law requiring drivers to look before thrusting open their doors .
In late April , one of Willsey 's fellow employees at Community Pharmacy had a similar experience .
Day Host - Jablonski was hit by the mirror of a car as it passed too close to her on South Paterson Street just past East Washington Avenue .
She was not injured , and the mirror ( thank goodness ) was not harmed .
By Host - Jablonski's account , she had words with the driver , who afterward " followed me for a while revving her engine . "
She jotted down the car 's license plate number , which she reported to a parking enforcement officer .
Officer Shawn Kelly responded , and spoke to both Host - Jablonski and the driver .
( The driver , according to his report , explained that scratched paint on her mirror was " old damage . " )
That night , Kelly issued a $ 63.60 citation - to Host - Jablonski !
The violation description on Host - Jablonski's ticket reads , " Bike rules - riding single file only . "
But the cited ordinance refers back to a state statute that says bicyclists " may ride two abreast if such operation does not impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic . "
Art Ross , the city 's bicycle - pedestrian safety coordinator , says it all " depends on how the statute is interpreted . "
He cites an analysis that suggests riding two abreast is usually legal .
Indeed , " There are situations where one could argue it 's safer to ride two abreast . "
Even if it were illegal to ride two abreast , Host - Jablonski denies doing so .
She says she was riding behind and a little to the left of another bicyclist : " I was by no means abreast of her . "
But Officer Kelly 's report says Host - Jablonski , asked to diagram her position , placed an X to the left of the other bike , indicating she was in the roadway .
But while the legality of Host - Jablonski 's conduct seems open to interpretation , the driver 's does not .
State Statute 346.075 clearly states that drivers must give bicycles at least three feet of clearance when passing .
Officer Kelly did not respond to an email contact , but Madison Police spokesman Joel DeSpain says police , on review , " did not find the driver culpable and she was not cited . "
Clayton Griessmeyer , a Verona - based attorney who does pro bono work for local bicycle groups , has agreed to represent Host - Jablonski in contesting her citation and hopes the case will help clarify such situations .
" A lot of drivers in Wisconsin do n't even know the law " about bicycle clearance , he says , noting that this is a subject on which he hears frequent complaints .
And this case suggests " some police do n't know the law either , " or else choose not to enforce it .
Unable to explore the rain forest , he soon went a bit stir-crazy .
The field station had only two hours of electricity each night , and just enough power to run a 25 - watt light bulb .
Fortunately for Dr. Janzen , that was a bumper year for moths , which were attracted to the light .
So he passed the time building a moth collection .
When he recovered enough to wander back into the rain forest , he discovered that it was also a bumper year for caterpillars .
The challenge was to identify which of the many different kinds of caterpillars belonged to which species of moths or butterflies .
Now 71 , he told me from his field station 32 years later that “ my private insanity was to find all of the species before I die . ”
To accomplish his goal , he had to set up a system of collecting the caterpillars , photographing each of them , raising them into adults , then identifying each of the species , at least half of which had not been described previously .
He started by himself , then was joined by his wife , Dr. Hallwachs , an expert on rodents and now caterpillars .
The operation continues to this day , 365 days a year , with the help of 33 trained Costa Rican assistants .
In an area of about 77 square miles , more than 450,000 caterpillars have been studied .
As of a few years ago , the team had identified more than 12,000 species .
That number ballooned to 15,000 species when the team discovered , through the use of DNA typing , or “ bar coding , ” that many of the species were actually made up of multiple distinct species , as many as 11 in one case .
The total number of species in just this one region equals that of all of the moths and butterflies species of North America .
With caterpillars and chrysalises coming into the station at the rate of more than one hundred a day , Dr. Janzen began to discern a trend .
In species belonging to many different groups , he saw caterpillars or chrysalises that bore all sorts of paired eyelike markings of various color schemes , with round or slit pupils .
The variety of patterns suggested that the bugs do not have to match exactly the appearance of any particular predator for the ruse to work .
Moreover , the distinct behavior of many caterpillars when handled underscored that the whole game was to startle the many species of insect - eating birds that foraged in the dry , cloud and rain forests of the conservation area .
Some eye patterns became visible only when the caterpillars were molested and expanded part of their body , and some large specimens wriggled and rattled like snakes .
Why does a financial mathematician think about birds when trying to understand the grounding of aeroplanes after the Icelandic volcano eruption ?
To understand the question , I need to explain that financial mathematicians are primarily concerned with how to make good decisions when faced with uncertainty .
Now , there is a widely held view that rational people will always avoid taking a risk , yet in the financial markets there are thousands of people making money by taking the opposite course of action — are they irrational ?
This is a fundamental question and means that financial mathematicians need to talk to psychologists , sociologists , anthropologists , and in my case , zoologists to get the answer .
Stay put or take a risk ?
I used to work in the oil industry trying to figure out how to find oil , specifically how an oil company should behave , what its strategy should be , if it was running out of oil reserves and was facing bankruptcy .
My employers turned to a zoologist , Alex Kacelnik , for the answer .
Alex is an expert on bird behaviour and explained to the oil executives that their problem was very similar to the problem birds face in the winter .
In a British winter some birds need to find up to 40 % of their body weight in food to survive a cold night .
Often birds have to make a decision : do I stay were I am , where I know there are a few berries , or do I fly off and hopefully find a new bush with a bonanza of berries ?
This problem gets to the heart of the research I now do as a mathematician .
Lets build a simple model .
Say a bird has to find nine berries in six hours and can do this in one of two ways :
Stay where it is with a 50:50 chance of finding one berry in an hour or finding two berries in an hour ;
Fly off to a new field , using a berry 's worth of energy reserves but with a one in six chance of finding ten berries , but a five in six chance of only finding one berry , replacing the energy lost in flying .
Essentially there is a 1/6 chance of a net gain of 9 berries or a 5/6 chance of a net gain of 0 berries .
Both strategies offer the same expected net gain of berries in an hour ( 1.5 = 1/2+2/2 = 9/6+0/6 ) , and so the bird expects to find the nine berries it needs over the six hours .
Most people would agree that the " stay " strategy is less risky than the " fly away " strategy .
So , should the bird play safe ?
Rather than treating this as an abstract problem , why not experiment at being the bird using a simple java applet ( requires Java to be enabled in your browser , opens a new window ) .
What you may discover is that , if in the first four hours you have only found four berries , you are going to die if you carry on with the " rational " strategy of playing it safe , since at most you will end the day with just eight berries .
The best thing to do in this case is to take the risk , since this at least gives you a chance of surviving .
Similarly , if after four hours you have found eight berries , why not take the risk in the fifth hour ?
You may get lucky , but if not , you will get your ninth berry in the final hour by sitting pretty .
The extra berries you find can be laid down as fat and put you in a good position for spring breeding .
Doing some simple maths and plotting hour versus number of berries found , we can identify three regions .
The best strategy for the bird to take depends on the state it is in — the time and number of berries found — and is not static .
It 's not sensible to stick either with a safe or risky strategy throughout the day and irrespective of how well you have done .
It turns out that companies , like oil companies , behave in a similar way .
If you are a small struggling company facing bankruptcy you should be taking a risk , similarly if you are a big wealthy company you can afford to take a risk .
However , if you are a medium sized company , your best bet is to muddle on and not take a risk , since you are as likely to fail as to succeed .
The question for managers is , where , in the state space , are the boundaries between the strategies ?
There is a lot of mathematical research into how decision makers , particularly in finance , should change their strategies depending on their situations .
But what does our simple model tell us about flying through the ash cloud ?
On 22 April , the BBC reported that the International Air Travel Association were stating that : " For an industry that lost $ 9.4bn last year and was forecast to lose a further $ 2.8bn in 2010 , this crisis is devastating . "
The airlines have been very critical of the National Air Traffic Service ( NATS ) for closing airspace on the basis of ash concentrations predicted by computer models .
" [ The crisis ] is an extraordinary situation exaggerated by a poor decision - making process by national governments . "
Is this fair ?
The famous economist , John Maynard Keynes , wrote a Treatise on Probability in 1921 in which he argued that sometimes it was impossible to accurately calculate the chance of an event , for example the chance that a plane will crash if it flies through an ash cloud .
It is hardly surprising that this probability cannot be calculated ; airlines themselves find it hard to predict the precise arrival time of their passengers ( and baggage ) at a specific destinations .
But this inability to calculate probabilities does not mean that mathematics cannot be a great help in making the right decision .
Eruption of Eyjafjallajokull on April 17 2010 .

Essentially the airlines were facing extinction .
Now , our mathematical model of bird behaviour , where the probabilities are known with certainty , suggests that the airlines would willingly take risks in order to survive .
They would be prepared to fly through the ash cloud since , in their mind , there was a small chance of a plane crash compared to the large chance of their bankruptcy .
Crew and passengers were faced with the opposite dilemma to the airlines ; they risked death , not by the planes being grounded , but by flying through the ash cloud .
If the airline regulators had allowed the planes to fly , individuals , either passengers or crew , would be faced with an impossible decision : risk being involved in a crash or risk losing pay or an airfare .
Seen from this perspective , the grounding of the airlines was acting for the " public good " by not forcing the public to make the difficult choice between losing money and risking life .
Mathematics is not about coming up with the " right " number that guides our decision making , rather it is about thinking clearly about a problem .
The bird model demonstrates this point , it does n't really matter what the precise probability of a plane crash is , what is important is making a good decision in the presence of uncertainty .
What is meant by " good " is different if you are a passenger or an airline executive .
The decision to ground the planes was " bad " from the airlines perspective , but for the rest of us , it was the right decision .
As a financial mathematician , involved in trying to understand and explain the credit crisis , what really struck me was a statement made in April , again reported by the BBC , by the airlines : " Airspace was being closed based on theoretical models , not on facts .
Test flights by our members showed that the models were wrong . "
This statement reminded me of one published by The Economist in an article entitled No Defence on 31 January 2008 : " [ French banks ] take an overly mathematical approach to risk .
' It may work in practice but does it work in theory ?
is the stereotype of a French bank , ' says one industry consultant . "
Both these statements reflect a common attitude that mathematical theory , because it cannot deliver " the number " , is not really valid in informing decision making .
But as we have seen , perhaps if bankers and regulators had taken more account of theoretical considerations , we would not have gone through the credit crisis .
The fact is , many problems society faces are problems that we cannot study through experimentation that will lead to absolute certainty .
The only tool we have to get to the heart of the issues is mathematics .
It has been pointed out that no aeroplane has crashed as a result of flying though ash hundreds of miles from a volcano .
This is a good thing and is a consequence of a mathematical understanding of the risks .
Ignore the mathematics and airline executives might think " oops — that was n't supposed to happen " , while hundreds of families are thrown into grief following the crash of a plane .
Do you feel lucky ?

There are some kinks that still need to be worked out for the upcoming , glasses - free 3D gaming device .
The window in which 3D looks 3D on that screen and does n't appear fuzzy or make you feel cross-eyed , is extremely narrow .

But that 's not the fault of the 3DS or Nintendo , that 's all up to the movie makers .
Next I checked out an interactive trailer for Metal Gear Solid in 3D .
The jungle popped in 3D .
Leaves brushed up against the camera .
I could adjust the point of view just slightly with the analog thumbstick .
It was a neat way to show off how subtle 3D can be on this system .
And how , even as a subtle addition , the effect has an amazing impact .

Next was Resident Evil .
This is when I ran into my first issue .
I started off the cutscene with the 3DS resting on the table , but in my hands .
It was a bit further away from my face then it typically would be when playing .
The impact was horrendous .
It felt like I had gone permanently cross eyed .
It made my stomach flop slightly and my eyes quickly tried to correct what they were seeing .
I used the slider on the face of the 3DS to turn the 3D down but it did n't help .
They I tried moving the 3DS slightly closer and suddenly the game 's images synched and the world was amazingly deep .
I tried putting the screen even closer to my face , moving it way too close and the image went double again .
Tilting the 3DS or moving it to either side made the image fuzzy .

There is , I learned , a 3D sweet - spot for the 3DS , a bubble in which the image is perfect and deep .
Outside the bubble things go wrong .
Next I tried out a neat little Nintendo demo that showed 3D sculptures .
I could use the slider to move around the images .
This was the best looking demo of the bunch .
Well almost , certainly the best looking game demo .

Nintendogs and Cats had a neat effect , using the bottom screen to let you interact with the 3D pets and throw objects .
But the 3D did n't blow me away .
It was , though , still very solid , deep 3D .
Next I checked out the Kid Icarus trailer , now in full 3D .
I was impressed with how seemingly powerful the system must be to deliver this level of gameplay and graphics all in 3D .

The most impressive thing I saw this morning , though , was the 3DS ' camera .
The ability to take a picture in 3D and then view it in 3D seconds later may sound like a gimick .
But it 's the sort of gimick that will require a hunt for your socks afterward .
When you activate the camera you use the thumbstick to slide back and forth on what you want the focal point to be in the image .
So you can make the thing closest to you in focus or the thing in the back .
Once you snap the pic you can look at it on that top screen .

The effect is astounding .
I took a picture of the woman who had the 3DS padlocked to her waist .
She 's smiling and has her hands up .
The hands feel like they 're popping out of the screen , behind the room just goes on and on .
It 's astounding .

At the time of publication , it represented the best available science .
A massive oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico continued spreading on April 29 , 2010 , moving perilously close to shore , according to news reports .
The U.S. Coast Guard attempted controlled burns on some of the oil to prevent its spread , but had to halt the process due to high winds .
Meanwhile , the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration constructed a dome - and - pipe system to contain the spread of oil at the sea floor .
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS ) on NASA ’s Terra satellite captured a natural - color image of the oil slick just off the Louisiana coast .
The top image shows a wide - area view , and the bottom image shows a close - up view of the oil slick ( outlined in white in the top image ) .
The oil slick appears as dull gray interlocking comma shapes , one opaque and the other nearly transparent .
The northwestern tip of the oil slick almost touches the Mississippi Delta .
Sunglint — the mirror - like reflection of the Sun off the water — enchances the oil slick ’s visibility .
The oil slick resulted from an explosion that occurred on April 20 , 2010 , on the Deepwater Horizon rig .
Two days after the explosion , the rig sank to the ocean floor , and a pipe connected to the well on the sea floor broke .
Oil began leaking from the pipe , The New York Times reported .
The following week , the U.S. Coast Guard discovered a new leak , and also found that five times as much oil was pouring from the well as initially assumed , according to Reuters .
Various methods of containing oil spills have been developed , including controlled burns , domes over the oil spill , and the use of remotely operated vehicles to manipulate equipment on the sea floor .
The depth of this oil well — 5,000 feet ( 1,500 meters ) below the ocean surface — has complicated all proposed mitigation efforts .
To protect wildlife along the shorelines of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama , and Florida , authorities were monitoring possible impacts of oil residue , and considering using cannons to scare birds away from affected areas and using shrimper boats to skim oil .

Thoughts on two months of pairing
Previous to joining Pivotal Labs , I did n’t do a whole lot of pair programming .
Hoo boy .
It ’s been a little over two months since I started , and the number of hours I ’ve spent solo programming since then would all fit in one workday .
I ’ve had some surprising realizations – about myself , my style , and my abilities – and more than a few DUH moments .
This post is more a collection of anecdotes than a coherent essay , but if you ’ve wondered what full - time pairing is like , I hope it gives you a few insights .
It does contain some profanity .
I blame my co-workers for that .
On Constraints
Pivotal works a strict 8 - hour day , in keeping with the agile principle of sustainable pace .
But because all projects are paired ( you can not buy the services of a single Pivot – we only come in pairs ) everyone has to be in the office at the same times every day .
So everyone arrives at 9 , everyone takes lunch from 12:30 - 1:30 , and by 6:15 the office is a ghost town .
I knew I ’d love the work – and I do – but I thought I ’d be fighting the schedule .
Nine to six would have been fantastic 10 years ago , but now that I have a husband and two kids … not so much .
There is n’t a daycare in the city that stays open past 6 , and it ’s much harder for me to go to doctor appointments , school events , and all the other kidly activities that are , without fail , held between 9 and 6 .
The Punchline
Now that I ’m doing it , I love the fixed schedule .
At other jobs , around 4 pm every day , I ’d start wondering about when I needed to leave .
I ’d try to remember who I was picking up , and when , and then I ’d look it up on my calendar , and then I ’d text Peter and ask whether there was anything I needed to ask or tell the daycare folks , and then I ’d stress about getting enough work done before I had to take off .
There ’s none of that anymore .
I know exactly when I ’m leaving , and since my pair is leaving at the same time there ’s no pressure to stay longer to finish something off .
When I ’m working , I can be completely present .
When I ’m done , I do n’t have to drag a laptop home and check email or fix the build once I get there .
I do n’t even know how to get into Pivotal ’s VPN from home .
I walk out of the building at 6:05 with a clear mind and a clear schedule for the rest of the night .
It ’s fucking exhilarating .
On Getting Shit Done
Fundamentally , what I love about software development is writing code that people actually use .
I love to finish things .
So anything that makes me feel like I ’m really GSD makes me incredibly happy .
When people talk about pairing , you hear a lot about how it “ amplifies ” their productivity .
I am going to go on record with the truth , however .
Pairing does not amplify my productivity .
Instead , it erases all the bad habits I have that keep me from being a superstar on my own .
When I ’m pairing , I can really get shit done .
By myself , I have a lot of roadblocks :
Rabbit Holes .
When trying to figure out some thorny bug by myself , I often follow the wrong line of inquiry too far .
I follow it sometimes for the sake of completeness – of knowing with 100 % certainty that some factor is not what ’s causing the problem – when 90 % or even 50 % certainty would do .
Something in my brain craves completeness , occasionally to the detriment of productivity , and particularly when I am tired ( hello , parenthood ) .
I usually do n’t notice it when it ’s happening .
However , if I have to explain to someone else what I am doing , the ridiculousness of it all suddenly becomes obvious and I ’m able to break out .
Distractions .
If I ’m working by myself , I ’m on email , I ’m on IM , I ’m on twitter , oh my tests are running so I ’ll check hacker news … and on and on .
That time adds up over the day .
And of course once I look at my email I ’ve switched contexts so going back to my code is another context switch , and even though it may only take a few minutes , that also adds up .
It feels amazing to work solidly for four hours at a time on a problem .
But somehow when it ’s just me , I ca n’t always keep that focus .
I think it ’s the addition of the social input and output that lets my frontal cortex actually attend to the problem at hand , without going ooh - shiny all the time .
That , and the guilt trip from my pair when I do wander .
Cheats .
If someone ’s watching , I do n’t take shortcuts .
I write the tests first .
I refactor code that needs it .
I focus on doing the simplest thing that could possibly work , without being sloppy .
I make sure I understand what I ’m doing before I do it .
I ’d like to say that I always do these things when on my own … I really would .
But the truth is that sometimes I put logic in my view code , because christ , if I move that then I need to put it in a helper and make a new file and add a new spec , and I said I ’d be done by the end of the day and it ’s 4:30 and no one ’s reviewing my code so … I just do it .
But if someone else is watching what I ’m doing … I just do n’t .
That feels incredible .
Too - Clever Syndrome .
On the other side , I get excited by knotty technical complexity .
I love to dive in and start changing things to see what happens in situations where it would really be better to write some tests first .
And , I like pushing the boundaries of the language , but I do n’t work on experimental or research code – someone has to read and maintain it – so all the clever metaprogramming is really not suitable .
But it ’s so much fun !
And I get to revel in how smart I am !
It sounds stupid to say that out loud , though .
So I do n’t even go there .
The Nine - to - Fiver
I often hear programmers – mostly young , mostly single – talk disparagingly about “ commodity programmers . ”
They usually mean people who program at work but spend their free time on other stuff , and are n’t really interested in tech .
Since I became a parent , I ’ve turned into that person – the one who needs to leave at a fixed time and ca n’t work weekends .
So for a lot of my peers , that means I ’m not “ passionate ” enough , and that I can’t really be a good engineer .
I got that reaction enough times that I started to believe it .
Well , fuck that .
I know I am amazing at what I do , and I love it .
But it ’s not my whole life .
Working at a company that really respects the boundaries of my time AND enables me to kick ass and get shit done all day has seriously been a revelation .
Socialitis
On the spectrum of social awkwardness , I fall somewhere between the engineers and the marketing guys .
Like many engineers , I miss social cues , do n’t make enough eye contact , forget people ’s names , and have a hard time making small talk .
However , I can fake these skills decently well when necessary , and I ’ve noticed that it ’s a muscle that I can exercise – the more I do it , the better I get , and the less I have to think about it .
About a month after I started at Pivotal , I went to a UCSD engineering alumni event .
At these events , where I am usually the only person not working in Enterprise with a capital E , the social interaction part of the evening is a lot of guys staring at each other ’s shoes .
In the past I ’ve tried to get conversation out of these people , but between their awkwardness and mine it was like pulling teeth .
But this time , for some non-obvious reason … it was easy .
The people and the shoes were about the same .
It ’s me who had changed .
Japanese automaker Lexus has come up with a new hybrid bicycle concept .
It supplements the rider ’s pedal power to the rear wheel with a 25.9V lithium - ion battery pack and a 240W electric motor driving the front wheel , making it both - wheel drive .
The company says the battery of the Lexus Hybrid Bicycle requires around 2 hours for a getting a complete charge .
Featuring a frame finished in carbon fiber , the hybrid bike makes use of an automatic eight - speed internal gear system to enhance your riding experience without leaving any carbon footprint .

Another day , another binary HFT mad finger intervention making a mockery of the NBBO , and the general market .
Earlier , following absolutely no news , Merrill Lynch Canada Inc ( NYSE : HCH ) which had closed at $ 115.93 , decided to trade up 30 % for no reason at the open , hitting a price as high as $ 144.99 after some computerized stock trading Frankenstein blew a fuse and ripped through every offer on its way $ 30 dollars higher .
This continued for about 30 seconds between 9:34:14 and 9:34:49 when 1,700 shares went apeshit about 25 % over the NBBO .
Yet if this was an isolated incident it would be fine , but just over an hour later , the same algo went berserk again , going to town with the stock in the upper $ 130s , trading another 1,200 shares ( see below ) .
An embarrassed NYSE had to immediately come out and DK all the trades , providing no explanation for the DK'ing .
After all , we all know that when it comes to HFT algos blowing up the market , be it 5 /6 , today , or last week when WaPo traded a few million percent higher for a second and tripped circuit breakers , nobody knows nothing .
And as long as the HFT lobby continues to hire every single person from the SEC who believes they are owed a far greater salary from the frontrunning lobby , the lack of knowledge will continue .
NYSE Announcement .
During lunch at Osteria Stellina on a recent Wednesday , chef - owner Christian Caiazzo hunches over the menu with a felt - tip pen , marking every local item with a black star .
Seared black cod ?
Check .
Stinging nettles ?
Another mark .
Lamb livers ?
Those get one , too .
By the time he looks up a few minutes later , it 's nearly impossible to decipher the words underneath .
At first , it may not seem so groundbreaking - in Northern California , the buzzwords " local , sustainable and organic " do n't carry the same weight that they did a decade ago .
But for Caiazzo , local goes one step further .
At his rustic Italian restaurant in Point Reyes Station , nearly everything on the menu - around 90 percent during prime growing season - comes from within about 50 miles , or no farther than the confines of Marin County .
" A lot of places will say they do these sorts of things , and they put a couple of lines about a farm on their menu , " says Caiazzo .
" But then they still have pallets of Sysco ( the mega food supplier ) coming in the back door . "
Local for most places is still often three hours ' drive away , especially if they 're in a city .
Point Reyes Station , flanked by water , pastures and farms , might be one of the few places where Caiazzo 's concept can actually work .
Plus he 's turned the restaurant into somewhat of a gallery , where producers can have their hyper-local goods showcased in a more personal and creative way .
" There 's much more of a one - on - one connection , " says Cow Track Ranch owner Liz Daniels , who supplies items such as her red Merlot lettuce to Osteria Stellina and other restaurants .
It 's different , she says , from dropping off a delivery at the back door and moving along .
Fresh bread , meat
In addition to what Daniels supplies from her Nicasio farm , fresh bread from Brickmaiden - a tiny commercial space with no retail outlet - is wheeled around the corner in a faded red wagon .
Cheese comes from Cowgirl Creamery 's original location just down the street .
And spring lamb is picked up from Barinaga Ranch in Marshall , sometimes just after slaughter .
" I 'll bring back the liver and it 's still warm and I 'm portioning it for the lunch menu .
It 's unreal , " Caiazzo says .
For the 41 - year - old chef , hours - old lamb liver is a far cry from his earliest culinary experiences .
Growing up in a preppy central Connecticut town , his first brush with the stoves was toasting Monte Cristo sandwiches at the local country club .
But his father 's Italian side of the family instilled in him a passion for food and cooking , and with a fast - paced , East Coast mentality , Caiazzo quickly worked his way up through restaurant kitchens , including San Francisco 's Postrio at the height of its popularity .
Peppered with trips abroad , Caiazzo 's resume was similar to those of other aspiring chefs .
Then two successive accidents - one that crushed his knee and another that left him temporarily paralyzed with severe neck injuries - derailed his career , forcing him to slow down .
He moved to Point Reyes Station , where he worked for Cowgirl Creamery and opened Toby 's , an espresso bar .
But , he says , " I always used to think how great it would be to have a restaurant in town that would represent the local producers in a way that I thought simple Italian food could do it .
People do n't know the full extent of what 's really going on out here . "
He was ready to get back into the kitchen when the corner spot that housed Rosie 's Cowboy Cookhouse opened up .
He jumped on it .
" I wanted to go hyper - local from the beginning , " says Caiazzo , " but I knew it would be a challenge . "
Even now , he admits it 's not always the smartest move for the business .
" It 's especially hard with fish , " he says .
" I have customers begging me to cook tuna , but there 's just not much variety out here " and he can't support overfishing .
" People trust us to do the right thing . "
Realistic ambitions
Still , he 's realistic about his limitations .
" We need fruit , so I 'll get stuff from Fresno , " he says .
" We 're not always right - around - the - corner local , but the next best step is supporting the people who are going to farmers ' markets and can grow things to help fill our menu that we just can't grow out here . "
Now Caiazzo is getting into the growing game himself .
Last month , he moved to a 3 - acre farm .
If he can grow a few things he's not getting otherwise , it will be yet another way to bring the operation even closer to home .
And maybe add a few more felt - tipped stars to the menu .

Relatives of fugitive Serbian war crimes suspect say they have had no contact with him for about seven years
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
The family of the fugitive Serbian war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic has filed a request for him to be legally declared dead .
Milos Saljic , the Mladic family 's lawyer , said the motion was submitted to Belgrade 's first municipal court " based on the fact that the family has had no information nor contacts with Mr Mladic for about seven years and that he was a very sick man " .
Mladic was indicted 15 years ago for genocide in the Srebrenica massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and the 43 - month siege of Sarajevo .
The European Union has made his arrest a key condition of further progress in Serbian membership .
The Committee to Protect Journalists has denounced Israel 's editing and distribution of footage confiscated from foreign journalists aboard the Gaza - bound flotilla .
The New York - based press watchdog accuses the Israeli defence force of releasing edited portions of confiscated video on YouTube that fail to get across the reality .
It refers to claims by the Foreign Press Association in Israel that the military " is selectively using footage to bolster its claims that commandos opened fire only after being attacked . "
The CPJ has called on the Israeli government to return all equipment , notes , and footage confiscated from journalists .
Its Middle East and North Africa programme coordinator , Mohamed Abdel Dayem , said : " Israel has confiscated journalistic material and then manipulated it to serve its interests .
It must cease this practice without delay , and return all property seized from journalists who were covering this legitimate news event . "
He also complained about " the treatment meted out " to journalists as being unacceptable .
" It is Israel 's responsibility to conduct its operations in ways that also allow journalists to report the news , " he said .

Fans of “ The Office ” know that childhood was n’t so great for Erin Hannon , the emotionally vulnerable Dunder - Mifflin receptionist played by Ellie Kemper .
But things worked out better for Ms. Kemper , who not only is n’t an orphan and was n’t raised in a foster home , but has a creative younger sister , Carrie , with whom she is about to write a comic novel planned for 2012 .
On Wednesday , the Three Rivers Press imprint of Crown Publishing said it had acquired the book , tentatively titled “ Monday Sessions , ” in which Ellie and Carrie Kemper chronicle a fictitious Manhattan psychiatrist named Dr. Amy Rice through her diary entries and patient files .
Asked in a telephone interview how long she and Carrie had this project up their sleeves , Ellie Kemper said : “ Oh my gosh .
Well , we ’re not sure .
We hope that it ends up coming out of our sleeves . ”
The Kemper siblings are already used to working together at “ The Office , ” where Carrie recently joined as a staff writer , and occasionally writes lines that emerge from her sister ’s mouth .
( “ It ’s a great sense of power over her , ” Carrie Kemper said .
“ If she makes one false move , she ’s off the show . ” )
Dating back to their childhoods in St. Louis , the Kempers worked together on plays and home movies ( one of which , “ The Man Under the Stairs , ” has made its way onto YouTube ) .
Carrie Kemper was also a precociously sensitive diarist at the age of 5 , keeping a journal that is still the talk of the family .
“ I say a lot of really , really controversial things , ” she said .
“ I know that I do spell Dairy Queen D - A - R - E C- W - E - N .
So that was pretty revolutionary . ”
“ I sort of want to publish that , ” said Ellie Kemper , who has also written for The Onion and McSweeney ’s .
“ We wo n’t publish that , but this is the backup . ”
Around Christmastime , the Kempers said , they started brainstorming more seriously for a book project they could work on together .
“ We were really thinking , what could appeal to most of America ? ” Ellie said .
“ And we thought : a series of psychotherapy sessions on the Upper West Side of Manhattan . ”
The Kempers said they wrote a 20 - page proposal for “ Monday Sessions , ” and have a year to write the manuscript , which they say they can do in their downtime during “ The Office . ”
“ Ellie keeps promising me that she has a lot of extra time between scenes , ” Carrie said .
“ Carrie has to write all day , ” Ellie added .
“ I have so much down time on set .
I keep assuring Carrie I ’m just going to write it up while I ’m taking breaks .
I might be talking big , I do n’t know . ”
“ If worse comes to worse , ” Carrie said , “ I figure I can write Ellie off the show for a season , just say that Erin is off writing a book about an Upper West Side therapist .
Then it becomes a weird art - life confusion . ”
“ Monday Sessions ” was acquired by Suzanne O’Neill , senior editor at Three Rivers Press , from Erin Malone of William Morris Endeavor Entertainment , an agent for Carrie and Ellie Kemper .
Cell phones are synonymous with life in the 21st Century .
They do everything — display maps , send email , play games and music .
They also do one other thing — track you .
Every seven seconds , your cell phone automatically scans for the nearest cell tower which can pinpoint your location as accurately as within 50 meters .
A GPS chip in your phone can reveal your location within a few yards .
In just one year , Sprint Nextel provided law enforcement agencies with the specific whereabouts of an unknown number of customers more than 8 million times .
They required law enforcement to provide neither a warrant nor probable cause to access this information .
Sprint even set up a website for law enforcement agents so they could access these records from the comfort of their desks .
" The tool has just really caught on fire with law enforcement , " said Sprint ’s “ manager of electronic surveillance . ”
I bet it has .
Law enforcement agents have been using location information to surveil Americans since the 1990 ’s , but we still have no consistent legal standard for when they can gain access to this information .
The government has sought access to records through sealed ( secret ) court proceedings , and chooses not to appeal decisions that might give higher courts an opportunity to establish a warrant standard for accessing location records .
On Thursday , the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties held a hearing to discuss an update to the Electronic Communication Privacy Act ( ECPA ) , the law that is meant to maintain American ’s privacy online .
Most Members in attendance agreed that advances in technology demand an update to ECPA .
Rep. Jerry Nadler ( D - N.Y. ) acknowledged that ECPA was passed when the only options for location information were road atlases and gas stations .
Rep. John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) , chairman of the committee , explained that the courts are in “ disarray and understandably so ” due to the lack of clarity in the current law .
Almost every American carries a cell phone , yet few think about the information these devices are collecting and storing .
Whether you are visiting a therapist or liquor store , a church or a gun range , your location is available either in real time or months later .
The ACLU is asking Congress to require government officials to obtain a warrant before access is granted to any of those electronic records , just as they have always had to do for similarly sensitive personal information .
For Americans to maintain the robust privacy protections they expect offline , Congress must act to update ECPA .

( NewsTarget ) Viruses that cause winter colds also cause summer colds .
Though summer colds are less common , warm weather factors increase the risk of infection .
Even though there are no known cures , natural remedies treat summer colds by reducing the severity and even the duration of cold symptoms .
Causes of Summer ColdsSummer colds can be caused by air conditioners because they decrease the humidity in the air .
The dry air makes dry nasal passages allowing viruses to flourish .
The increased air travel in summer months contributes to summer colds , as travelers become exposed to new , unfamiliar viruses .
Those who experience summer hay fever find their nasal passages sensitized and more reactive to other pathogens , leading to more severe symptoms of colds during the summer .
Salt and Turmeric Gargle for Summer ColdsSalt and Turmeric gargle moisturizes the lining of the throat and speeds recovery of a summer cold .
This is especially important as summer weather and air condition contribute to drying of these mucous membranes .
A teaspoon of salt , with or without a teaspoon of turmeric , added to eight ounces of warm water can be gargled every three to four hours .
A turmeric gargle without salt is utilized in the same way but can be swallowed .
Vitamin C Reduces Summer ColdsVitamin
C reduces the incidence and severity of the common cold .
Dosage of most research has been 1000 mg a day ; however , because vitamin C is depleted quickly from the body , dividing the dose to 300 mg three times a day is recommended .
Humans do not make their own vitamin C , and this vital nutrient is an important anti-oxidant , helping destroy free radicals .
High doses of vitamin C can also be helpful for summer colds , up to 5,000 mg a day .
Echinacea Stimulates Natural Cold ImmunityEchinacea has been shown to increase immune response .
Echinacea was used in Native American healing and then spread to European settlers .
The plant is a member of the daisy family , and it has now become the best selling health food store product in the United States .
Ginger Treats a Summer ColdGinger cures summer colds because is a natural antiviral .
Ginger tea can be made from fresh or dried garlic .
Ginger extract can be added to warm water and sipped to clear sinuses and help reduce inflammation of tissues .

Chinese - American actor , martial artist
This article is about the martial artist and actor .
For other uses , see Bruce Lee ( disambiguation )
Not to be confused with Bruce Li
Lee Jun-fan ( Chinese : 李振藩 ; November 27 , 1940 – July 20 , 1973 ) , commonly known as Bruce Lee ( Chinese : 李小龍 ) , was a Chinese , Hong Kong American actor , director , martial artist , martial arts instructor and philosopher .
[ 3 ]
He was the founder of Jeet Kune Do , a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts ( MMA ) .
Lee is considered by commentators , critics , media , and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time and a pop culture icon of the 20th century , who bridged the gap between East and West .
He is credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films . [ 4 ]
The son of Cantonese opera star Lee Hoi-chuen , Lee was born in the Chinatown area of San Francisco , California , on November 27 , 1940 , to parents from Hong Kong , and was raised with his family in Kowloon , Hong Kong . [ 5 ]
He was introduced to the film industry by his father and appeared in several films as a child actor .
Lee moved to the United States at the age of 18 to receive his higher education at the University of Washington in Seattle , [ 6 ] and it was during this time that he began teaching martial arts .
His Hong Kong and Hollywood - produced films elevated the traditional martial arts film to a new level of popularity and acclaim , sparking a surge of interest in the Chinese nation and Chinese martial arts in the West in the 1970s .
The direction and tone of his films dramatically changed and influenced martial arts and martial arts films in the world . [ 7 ]
He is noted for his roles in five feature - length martial arts films in the early 1970s : Lo Wei's The Big Boss ( 1971 ) and Fist of Fury ( 1972 ) ; Golden Harvest 's Way of the Dragon ( 1972 ) , directed and written by Lee ; Golden Harvest and Warner Brothers ' Enter the Dragon ( 1973 ) and The Game of Death ( 1978 ) , both directed by Robert Clouse . [ 8 ]
Lee became an iconic figure known throughout the world , particularly among the Chinese , based upon his portrayal of Chinese nationalism in his films [ 9 ] and among Asian Americans for defying stereotypes associated with the emasculated Asian male . [ 10 ]
He trained in the art of Wing Chun and later combined his other influences from various sources into the spirit of his personal martial arts philosophy , which he dubbed Jeet Kune Do ( The Way of the Intercepting Fist ) .
Lee had residences in Hong Kong and Seattle . [ 11 ]
Lee died on July 20 , 1973 at the age of 32 .
There was no visible external injury ; however , according to autopsy reports , Lee 's brain had swollen considerably .
The autopsy found Equagesic in his system .
When the doctors announced Lee 's death , it was officially ruled a " death by misadventure " .
Since his death , Lee has continued to be a prominent influence on modern combat sport , including judo , karate , mixed martial arts , and boxing .
Time named Lee one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century .
Early life
Bruce Lee as a baby with his parents , Grace Ho and Lee Hoi-chuen
Bruce Lee was born on November 27 , 1940 , at the Chinese Hospital in Chinatown , San Francisco .
According to the Chinese zodiac , Lee was born in both the hour and the year of the Dragon , which according to tradition is a strong and fortuitous omen . [ 12 ]
Lee and his parents returned to Hong Kong when he was three months old . [ 13 ]
Bruce 's father , Lee Hoi-chuen , was Han Chinese , and his mother , Grace Ho ( 何愛瑜 ) , was of Eurasian ancestry . [ 14 ]
Career and education
1940 to 1958 : Early roles , schooling and martial arts initiation
Lee 's father Lee Hoi-chuen was a famous Cantonese opera star .
Because of this , Lee was introduced into films at a very young age and appeared in several films as a child .
Lee had his first role as a baby who was carried onto the stage in the film Golden Gate Girl . [ 15 ]
As a nine - year - old , he would co-star with his father in The Kid in 1950 , which was based on a comic book character and was his first leading role . [ 16 ]
By the time he was 18 , he had appeared in twenty films . [ 12 ]
After Lee was involved in several street fights , his parents decided that he needed to be trained in the martial arts .
Lee 's first introduction to martial arts was through his father , from whom he learned the fundamentals of Wu-style t'ai chi ch'uan . [ 17 ]
Lee and Yip Man
The largest influence on Lee 's martial arts development was his study of Wing Chun . [ 18 ]
Lee began training in Wing Chun when he was 16 years old under the Wing Chun teacher Yip Man in between late 1956 and 1957 , after losing to rival gang members .
Yip 's regular classes generally consisted of the forms practice , chi sao ( sticking hands ) drills , wooden dummy techniques , and free - sparring . [ 19 ]
There was no set pattern to the classes . [ 19 ]
Yip tried to keep his students from fighting in the street gangs of Hong Kong by encouraging them to fight in organized competitions . [ 20 ]
After a year into his Wing Chun training , most of Yip Man 's other students refused to train with Lee when they had learned of his mixed ancestry , as the Chinese were generally against teaching their martial arts techniques to non-Asians .
Lee 's sparring partner , Hawkins Cheung , states , " Probably fewer than six people in the whole Wing Chun clan were personally taught , or even partly taught , by Yip Man " . [ 23 ]
However , Lee showed a keen interest in Wing Chun and continued to train privately with Yip Man , William Cheun and Wong Shun Leung .
Wan Kam Leung , a student of Wong 's , witnessed a sparring bout between Wong and Lee and noted the speed and precision with which Lee was able to deliver his kicks . [ 25 ]
Lee continued to train with Wong Shun Leung after returning to Hong Kong from America .
After attending Tak Sun School ( 德信學校 ; several blocks from his home at 218 Nathan Road , Kowloon ) , Lee entered the primary school division of the Catholic La Salle College at the age of 12 . [ 26 ]
In 1956 , due to poor academic performance and possibly poor conduct , he was transferred to St. Francis Xavier 's College , where he would be mentored by Brother Edward , a teacher and coach of the school boxing team .
In 1958 , Bruce won the Hong Kong schools boxing tournament , knocking out the previous champion in the final . [ 27 ]
He was also a cha-cha dancer , winning Hong Kong 's Crown Colony Cha -Cha Championship in 1958 . [ 28 ]
1959 to 1964 : Continuous studies and martial arts breakthrough
In the spring of 1959 , Lee got into another street fight , and the police were called . [ 29 ]
Until his late teens , Lee 's street fights became more frequent and included beating the son of a feared triad family . [ 30 ]
Eventually , Lee 's father decided his son should leave Hong Kong to pursue a safer and healthier life in the United States .
His parents confirmed the police 's fear that this time Lee 's opponent had an organized crime background and that there was the possibility that a contract was out for his life .[ citation needed ]
The police detective came and he says " Excuse me Mr. Lee , your son is really fighting bad in school .
If he gets into just one more fight I might have to put him in jail " .
Robert Lee [ 31 ]
In April 1959 , Lee 's parents decided to send him to the United States to stay with his older sister , Agnes Lee ( 李秋鳳 ) , who was already living with family friends in San Francisco .
After several months , he moved to Seattle in 1959 to continue his high school education , where he also worked for Ruby Chow as a live - in waiter at her restaurant .
Chow 's husband was a co-worker and friend of Lee 's father .
Lee 's elder brother Peter Lee ( 李忠琛 ) would also join him in Seattle for a short stay before moving on to Minnesota to attend college .
That year Lee also started to teach martial arts .
He called what he taught Jun Fan Gung Fu ( literally Bruce Lee's Kung Fu ) .
It was basically his approach to Wing Chun . [ 32 ]
Lee taught friends he met in Seattle , starting with Judo practitioner Jesse Glover , who continued to teach some of Lee 's early techniques .
Taky Kimura became Lee 's first Assistant Instructor and continued to teach his art and philosophy after Lee 's death . [ 33 ]
Lee opened his first martial arts school , named the Lee Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute , in Seattle .
In December 1960 , Lee completed his high school education and received his diploma from Edison Technical School on Capitol Hill in Seattle .[ citation needed ]
In March 1961 , Lee enrolled at the University of Washington and studied dramatic arts , philosophy , psychology , and various other subjects . [ 34 ] [ 35 ]
Despite what Lee himself and many others have stated , Lee 's official major was drama rather than philosophy according to a 1999 article in the university 's alumni publication . [ 36 ]
Lee dropped out of college in early 1964 and moved to Oakland to live with James Yimm Lee.
James
Lee was twenty years senior to Bruce Lee and a well - known Chinese martial artist in the area .
Together , they founded the second Jun Fan martial arts studio in Oakland .
James
Lee was also responsible for introducing Bruce Lee to Ed Parker , an American martial artist .
At the invitation of Parker , Lee appeared in the 1964 Long Beach International Karate Championships and performed repetitions of two - finger push - ups ( using the thumb and the index finger of one hand ) with feet at approximately shoulder - width apart .
In the same Long Beach event he also performed the " one inch punch . " [ 37 ]
Lee stood upright , his right foot forward with knees bent slightly , in front of a standing , stationary partner .
Lee 's right arm was partly extended and his right fist approximately one inch ( 2.5 cm ) away from the partner 's chest .
Without retracting his right arm , Lee then forcibly delivered the punch to volunteer Bob Baker while largely maintaining his posture , sending Baker backwards and falling into a chair said to be placed behind Baker to prevent injury , though Baker 's momentum soon caused him to fall to the floor .
Baker recalled , " I told Bruce not to do this type of demonstration again .
When he punched me that last time , I had to stay home from work because the pain in my chest was unbearable " . [ 38 ]
It was at the 1964 championships that Lee first met Taekwondo master Jhoon Goo Rhee .
The two developed a friendship — a relationship from which they benefited as martial artists .
Rhee taught Lee the side kick in detail , and Lee taught Rhee the " non-telegraphic " punch . [ 39 ]
Rhee learned what he calls the " accupunch " from Lee and incorporated it into American taekwondo .
The " accupunch " is a rapid fast punch that is very difficult to block , based on human reaction time — " the idea is to finish the execution of the punch before the opponent can complete the brain - to - wrist communication . " [ 40 ]
In Oakland 's Chinatown in 1964 , Lee had a controversial private match with Wong Jack Man , a direct student of Ma Kin Fung , known for his mastery of Xingyiquan , Northern Shaolin , and T'ai chi ch'uan .
According to Lee , the Chinese community issued an ultimatum to him to stop teaching non-Chinese people .
When he refused to comply , he was challenged to a combat match with Wong .
The arrangement was that if Lee lost , he would have to shut down his school , while if he won , he would be free to teach white people , or anyone else . [ 41 ]
Wong denied this , stating that he requested to fight Lee after Lee boasted during one of his demonstrations at a Chinatown theatre that he could beat anyone in San Francisco , and that Wong himself did not discriminate against Whites or other non-Chinese people . [ 42 ]
Lee commented , " That paper had all the names of the sifu from Chinatown , but they do n't scare me " . [ 43 ]
Individuals known to have witnessed the match include Cadwell , James Lee ( Bruce Lee 's associate , no relation ) , and William Chen , a teacher of T'ai chi ch'uan .
Wong and William Chen stated that the fight lasted an unusually long 20 – 25 minutes . [ 42 ] [ 44 ]
Wong claims that although he had originally expected a serious but polite bout , Lee aggressively attacked him with intent to kill .
When Wong presented the traditional handshake , Lee appeared to accept the greeting , but instead , Lee allegedly thrust his hand as a spear aimed at Wong 's eyes .
Forced to defend his life , Wong nonetheless asserted that he refrained from striking Lee with killing force when the opportunity presented itself because it could have earned him a prison sentence , but used illegal cufflings under his sleeves .
The fight ended due to Lee 's " unusually winded " condition , as opposed to a decisive blow by either fighter . [ 42 ]
By contrast , according to Bruce Lee , Linda Lee Cadwell , and James Yimm Lee , the fight lasted a mere 3 minutes with a decisive victory for Lee .
In Cadwell 's account , " The fight ensued , it was a no -holds - barred fight , it took three minutes .
Bruce got this guy down to the ground and said ' Do you give up ? ' and the man said he gave up " . [ 41 ]
A couple of weeks after the bout , Lee gave an interview claiming that he had defeated an unnamed challenger , which Wong says was an obvious reference to him . [ 42 ] [ 44 ]
In response , Wong published his own account of the fight in the Chinese Pacific Weekly , a Chinese - language newspaper in San Francisco , with an invitation to a public rematch if Lee was not satisfied with the account .
Lee did not respond to the invitation despite his reputation for violently responding to every provocation , [ 42 ] and there were no further public announcements by either , though Lee continued to teach white people .
Lee had abandoned thoughts of a film career in favour of pursuing martial arts .
However , a martial arts exhibition on Long Beach in 1964 eventually led to the invitation by television producer William Dozier for an audition for a role in the pilot for " Number One Son " about Lee Chan , the son of Charlie Chan .
The show never materialized , but Dozier saw potential in Lee . [ 45 ]
1966 to 1970 : American roles and creating Jeet Kune Do
The Green Hornet Publicity photo of Williams and Lee for
From 1966 to 1967 , Lee played the role of Kato alongside the title character played by Van Williams in the TV series produced and narrated by William Dozier [ 46 ] titled The Green Hornet , based on the radio show by the same name . [ 47 ] [ 45 ]
The show lasted only one season ( 26 episodes ) , from September 1966 to March 1967 .
Lee and Williams also appeared as their characters in three crossover episodes of Batman , another William Dozier - produced television series . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ]
The Green Hornet introduced the adult Bruce Lee to an American audience , and became the first popular American show presenting Asian - style martial arts .
The show 's director wanted Lee to fight in the typical American style using fists and punches .
As a professional martial artist , Lee refused , insisting that he should fight in the style of his expertise .
At first , Lee moved so fast that his movements could not be caught on film , so he had to slow them down . [ 51 ]
After the show was cancelled in 1967 , Lee wrote to Dozier thanking him for starting " my career in show business . " [ 51 ]
In 1967 , Lee played a role in one episode of Ironside .
[ 52 ]
The Jeet Kune Do emblem is a registered trademark held by the Bruce Lee Estate .
The Chinese characters around the Taijitu symbol read : " Using no way as way " and " Having no limitation as limitation "
The arrows represent the endless interaction between yang and yin .
Jeet Kune Do originated in 1967 .
After filming one season of The Green Hornet , Lee found himself out of work and opened The Jun Fan Gung Fu Institute .
The controversial match with Wong Jack Man influenced Lee 's philosophy about martial arts .
Lee concluded that the fight had lasted too long and that he had failed to live up to his potential using his Wing Chun techniques .
He took the view that traditional martial arts techniques were too rigid and formalized to be practical in scenarios of chaotic street fighting .
Lee decided to develop a system with an emphasis on " practicality , flexibility , speed , and efficiency " .
He started to use different methods of training such as weight training for strength , running for endurance , stretching for flexibility , and many others which he constantly adapted , including fencing and basic boxing techniques .[ citation needed ]
Lee was influenced by heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali , whose footwork he studied and incorporated into his own style . [ 53 ]
Lee emphasized what he called " the style of no style " .
This consisted of getting rid of the formalized approach which Lee claimed was indicative of traditional styles .
Lee felt that even the system he now called Jun Fan Gung
Fu was too restrictive , and it eventually evolved into a philosophy and martial art he would come to call Jeet Kune Do or the Way of the Intercepting Fist .
It is a term he would later regret , because Jeet Kune
Do implied specific parameters that styles connote , whereas the idea of his martial art was to exist outside of parameters and limitations . [ 54 ]
At the time , two of Lee 's martial arts students were Hollywood script writer Stirling Silliphant and actor James Coburn .
In 1969 the three worked on a script for a film called The Silent Flute , and went together on a location hunt to India .
The project was not realised at the time , but the 1978 film Circle of Iron , starring David Carradine , was based on the same plot .
In 2010 , producer Paul Maslansky was reported to have planned and received funding for a film based on the original script for The Silent Flute . [ 55 ]
In 1969 , Lee made a brief appearance in the Silliphant - penned film Marlowe , where he played a hoodlum hired to intimidate private detective Philip Marlowe , ( played by James Garner ) , who uses his martial arts abilities to commit acts of vandalization to intimidate Marlowe . [ 56 ] [ 57 ]
The same year he was credited as the karate advisor in The Wrecking Crew , the fourth instalment of the Matt Helm comedy spy - fi film starring Dean Martin . [ 58 ]
Also that year , Lee acted in one episode of Here Come the Brides and Blondie . [ 59 ] [ 60 ]
In 1970 , he was responsible for fight choreography for A Walk in the Spring Rain starring Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn , again written by Silliphant . [ 61 ] [ 62 ]
1971 to 1973 : Hong Kong films and Hollywood breakthrough
In 1971 , Lee appeared in four episodes of the television series Longstreet , written by Silliphant .
Lee played Li Tsung the martial arts instructor of the title character Mike Longstreet ( played by James Franciscus ) , and important aspects of his martial arts philosophy were written into the script . [ 63 ] [ 64 ]
According to statements made by Lee , and also by Linda Lee Cadwell after Lee 's death , in 1971 Lee pitched a television series of his own tentatively titled The Warrior , discussions of which were also confirmed by Warner Bros .
During a December 9 , 1971 television interview on The Pierre Berton Show , Lee stated that both Paramount and Warner Brothers wanted him " to be in a modernized type of a thing , and that they think the Western idea is out , whereas I want to do the Western " . [ 65 ]
According to Cadwell , however , Lee 's concept was retooled and renamed Kung Fu , but Warner Bros. gave Lee no credit . [ 66 ]
Warner Brothers states that they had for some time been developing an identical concept , [ 67 ] created by two writers and producers , Ed Spielman and Howard Friedlander .
According to these sources , the reason Lee was not cast was in part because of his ethnicity , but more so because he had a thick accent . [ 68 ]
The role of the Shaolin monk in the Wild West was eventually awarded to then - non- martial - artist David Carradine .
In The Pierre Berton Show interview , Lee stated he understood Warner Brothers ' attitudes towards casting in the series : " They think that business - wise it is a risk .
I do n't blame them .
If the situation were reversed , and an American star were to come to Hong Kong , and I was the man with the money , I would have my own concerns as to whether the acceptance would be there " . [ 69 ]
Producer Fred Weintraub had advised Lee to return to Hong Kong and make a feature film which he could showcase to executives in Hollywood . [ 70 ]
Not happy with his supporting roles in the US , Lee returned to Hong Kong .
Unaware that The Green Hornet had been played to success in Hong Kong and was unofficially referred to as " The Kato Show " , he was surprised to be recognized as the star of the show . [ 71 ]
After negotiating with both Shaw Brothers Studio and Golden Harvest , Lee signed a film contract to star in two films produced by Golden Harvest .
Lee played his first leading role in The Big Boss ( 1971 ) , which proved to be an enormous box office success across Asia and catapulted him to stardom .
He soon followed up with Fist of Fury ( 1972 ) , which broke the box office records set previously by The Big Boss .
Having finished his initial two - year contract , Lee negotiated a new deal with Golden Harvest .
Lee later formed his own company , Concord Production Inc. , with Chow .
For his third film , Way of the Dragon ( 1972 ) , he was given complete control of the film 's production as the writer , director , star , and choreographer of the fight scenes .
In 1964 , at a demonstration in Long Beach , California , Lee had met karate champion Chuck Norris .
In Way of the Dragon Lee introduced Norris to moviegoers as his opponent , their showdown has been characterized as " one of the best fight scenes in martial arts and film history " . [ 72 ] [ 73 ]
The role had originally been offered to American karate champion Joe Lewis . [ 74 ]
Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon went on to gross an estimated US $ 100 million and US $ 130 million worldwide , respectively . [ 75 ]
From August to October 1972 , Lee began work on his fourth Golden Harvest Film , Game of Death .
He began filming some scenes , including his fight sequence with 7 ft 2 in ( 218 cm ) American basketball star Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , a former student .
Production stopped in November 1972 when Warner Brothers offered Lee the opportunity to star in Enter the Dragon , the first film to be produced jointly by Concord , Golden Harvest , and Warner Bros .
Filming began in Hong Kong in February 1973 and was completed in April 1973 . [ 76 ]
One month into the filming , another production company , Starseas Motion Pictures , promoted Bruce Lee as a leading actor in Fist of Unicorn , although he had merely agreed to choreograph the fight sequences in the film as a favour to his long - time friend Unicorn Chan .
Lee planned to sue the production company , but retained his friendship with Chan . [ 77 ]
However , only a few months after the completion of Enter the Dragon , and six days before its July 26 , 1973 release , Lee died .
Enter the Dragon would go on to become one of the year 's highest - grossing films and cement Lee as a martial arts legend .
It was made for US $ 850,000 in 1973 ( equivalent to $ 4 million adjusted for inflation as of 2007 ) . [ 78 ]
Enter the Dragon went on to gross an estimated $ 350 million worldwide . [ 79 ] [ 80 ]
The film sparked a brief fad in martial arts , epitomised in songs such as " Kung Fu Fighting " and TV shows like Kung Fu ( in Enter The Dragon , Lee was a Shaolin Kung Fu master , similar to the role of David Carradine as Kwai Chang Caine ) .
1978 to 2019 : Posthumous work
Robert Clouse , the director of Enter the Dragon , together with Golden Harvest , revived Lee 's unfinished film Game of Death .
Lee had shot over 100 minutes of footage , including out - takes , for Game of Death before shooting was stopped to allow him to work on Enter the Dragon .
In addition to Abdul - Jabbar , George Lazenby , Hapkido master Ji Han -Jae , and another of Lee 's students , Dan Inosanto , were also to appear in the film , which was to culminate in Lee 's character , Hai Tien ( clad in the now - famous yellow track suit [ 81 ] [ 82 ] ) taking on a series of different challengers on each floor as they make their way through a five - level pagoda .
In a controversial move , Robert Clouse finished the film using a look - alike and archive footage of Lee from his other films with a new storyline and cast , which was released in 1978 .
However , the cobbled - together film contained only fifteen minutes of actual footage of Lee ( he had printed many unsuccessful takes ) [ 83 ] while the rest had a Lee look - alike , Kim Tai Chung , and Yuen Biao as stunt double .
The unused footage Lee had filmed was recovered 22 years later and included in the documentary Bruce Lee : A Warrior 's Journey .
Apart from Game of Death , other future film projects were planned to feature Lee at the time .
In 1972 , after the success of The Big Boss and Fist of Fury , a third film was planned by Raymond Chow at Golden Harvest to be directed by Lo Wei , titled Yellow - Faced Tiger .
However , at the time , Lee decided to direct and produce his own script for Way of the Dragon instead .
Although Lee had formed a production company with Raymond Chow , a period film was also planned from September–November 1973 with the competing Shaw Brothers Studio , to be directed by either Chor Yuen or Cheng Kang , and written by Yi Kang and Chang Cheh , titled The Seven Sons of the Jade Dragon . [ 84 ]
Lee had also worked on several scripts himself .
A tape containing a recording of Lee narrating the basic storyline to a film tentatively titled Southern Fist / Northern Leg exists , showing some similarities with the canned script for The Silent Flute ( Circle of Iron ) . [ 85 ]
Another script had the title Green Bamboo Warrior , set in San Francisco , planned to co-star Bolo Yeung and to be produced by Andrew Vajna who later went on to produce First Blood . [ 77 ]
Photoshoot costume tests were also organized for some of these planned film projects .
In 2015 , Perfect Storm Entertainment and Bruce Lee 's daughter , Shannon Lee announced that the series " The Warrior " would be produced and would air on the Cinemax and the filmmaker Justin Lin was chosen to direct the series . [ 86 ]
Production began on October 22 , 2017 in Cape Town , South Africa .
The first season will contain 10 episodes . [ 87 ]
In April 2019 , Cinemax renewed the series for a second season . [ 88 ]
Artistry
Philosophy
While best known as a martial artist , Lee also studied drama and Asian and Western philosophy starting while a student at the University of Washington .
He was well - read and had an extensive library dominated by martial arts subjects and philosophical texts . [ 89 ]
His own books on martial arts and fighting philosophy are known for their philosophical assertions , both inside and outside of martial arts circles .
His eclectic philosophy often mirrored his fighting beliefs , though he was quick to claim that his martial arts were solely a metaphor for such teachings .
He believed that any knowledge ultimately led to self - knowledge , and said that his chosen method of self - expression was martial arts . [ 90 ]
His influences include Taoism , Jiddu Krishnamurti , and Buddhism . [ 91 ]
Lee 's philosophy was very much in opposition to the conservative worldview advocated by Confucianism . [ 92 ]
John Little states that Lee was an atheist .
When asked in 1972 about his religious affiliation , he replied , " none whatsoever " , [ 93 ] and when asked if he believed in God , he said , " To be perfectly frank , I really do not . " [ 90 ]
Poetry
Aside from martial arts and philosophy , which focus on the physical aspect and self - consciousness for truths and principles , [ 94 ]
Lee also wrote poetry that reflected his emotion and a stage in his life collectively . [ 95 ]
Many forms of art remain concordant with the artist creating them .
Lee 's principle of self - expression was applied to his poetry as well .
His daughter Shannon Lee said , " He did write poetry ; he was really the consummate artist . " [ 96 ]
His poetic works were originally handwritten on paper , then later on edited and published , with John Little being the major author ( editor ) , for Bruce Lee 's works .
Linda Lee Cadwell ( Bruce Lee 's wife ) shared her husband 's notes , poems , and experiences with followers .
She mentioned " Lee 's poems are , by American standards , rather dark — reflecting the deeper , less exposed recesses of the human psyche " . [ 97 ]
Most of Bruce Lee 's poems are categorized as anti-poetry or fall into a paradox .
The mood in his poems shows the side of the man that can be compared with other poets such as Robert Frost , one of many well - known poets expressing himself with dark poetic works .
The paradox taken from the Yin and Yang symbol in martial arts was also integrated into his poetry .
His martial arts and philosophy contribute a great part to his poetry .
The free verse form of Lee 's poetry reflects his famous quote " Be formless ... shapeless , like water . " [ 98 ]
Death
On May 10 , 1973 , Lee collapsed during an automated dialogue replacement session for Enter the Dragon at Golden Harvest in Hong Kong .
Suffering from seizures and headaches , he was immediately rushed to Hong Kong Baptist Hospital , where doctors diagnosed cerebral edema .
They were able to reduce the swelling through the administration of mannitol .
The headache and cerebral edema that occurred in his first collapse were later repeated on the day of his death . [ 99 ]
On July 20 , 1973 , Lee was in Hong Kong to have dinner with actor George Lazenby , with whom he intended to make a film .
According to Lee 's wife Linda , Lee met producer Raymond Chow at 2 p.m. at home to discuss the making of the film Game of Death .
They worked until 4 p.m. and then drove together to the home of Lee 's colleague Betty Ting Pei , a Taiwanese actress .
The three went over the script at Ting 's home , and then Chow left to attend a dinner meeting .
[ 100 ] [ 101 ]
Later , Lee complained of a headache , and Ting gave him the painkiller Equagesic , which contained both aspirin and the tranquilizer meprobamate .
Around 7:30 p.m. , he went to lie down for a nap .
When Lee did not come for dinner , Chow came to the apartment , but he was unable to wake Lee up .
A doctor was summoned , and spent ten minutes attempting to revive Lee before sending him by ambulance to Queen Elizabeth Hospital .
Lee was declared dead on arrival , at the age of 32 . [ 102 ]
There was no visible external injury ; however , according to autopsy reports , Lee 's brain had swollen considerably , from 1,400 to 1,575 grams ( a 13 percent increase ) .
The autopsy found Equagesic in his system .
On October 15 , 2005 , Chow stated in an interview that Lee died from an allergic reaction to the tranquilizer meprobamate , the main ingredient in Equagesic , which Chow described as an ingredient commonly used in painkillers .
When the doctors announced Lee 's death , it was officially ruled a " death by misadventure " .
[ 103 ] [ 104 ]
Lee 's wife Linda returned to her hometown of Seattle , and had Lee 's body buried in Lake View Cemetery in Seattle . [ 105 ] [ 106 ]
Pallbearers at Lee 's funeral on July 25 , 1973 , included Taky Kimura , Steve McQueen , James Coburn , Dan Inosanto , Peter Chin , and Lee 's brother Robert . [ 107 ]
Around the time of Lee 's death , numerous rumors appeared in the media .
[ 108 ]
Lee 's iconic status and untimely death fed many wild rumors and theories .
These included murder involving the triads and a supposed curse on him and his family , rumors that persist to the present day . [ 109 ]
Donald Teare , a forensic scientist , recommended by Scotland Yard , who had overseen over 1,000 autopsies , was assigned to the Lee case .
His conclusion was " death by misadventure " caused by cerebral edema due to a reaction to compounds present in the combination medication Equagesic .
[ 110 ]
Although there was initial speculation that cannabis found in Lee 's stomach may have contributed to his death , Teare refuted this , stating that it would " be both ' irresponsible and irrational ' to say that [ cannabis ] might have triggered either the events of Bruce 's collapse on May 10 or his death on July 20 " . [ 110 ] Dr. R. R. Lycette , the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital , reported at the coroner hearing that the death could not have been caused by cannabis . [ 110 ]
At the 1975 San Diego Comic - Con convention , Lee 's friend Chuck Norris attributed his death to a reaction to the combination of the muscle - relaxant medication he had been taking since 1968 for a ruptured disc in his back and an " antibiotic " he was given for his headache on the night of his death .
[ 111 ]
In a 2017 episode of the Reelz TV series Autopsy : The Last Hours of ... , forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter theorized that Lee died of adrenal crisis brought on by the overuse of cortisone , which Lee had been taking since injuring his back in a 1970 weightlifting mishap . [ 112 ]
Hunter believes that Lee 's exceptionally strong " drive and ambition " played a fundamental role in the martial artist 's ultimate demise . [ 112 ]
In a 2018 biography , author Matthew Polly consulted with medical experts and theorized that Lee died from cerebral edema caused by over - exertion and heat stroke ; and heat stroke was not considered at the time because it was then a poorly - understood condition .
Furthermore , Lee had his underarm sweat glands removed in late 1972 , in the apparent belief that underarm sweat was unphotogenic on film . [ 112 ]
Polly further theorized that this caused Lee 's body to overheat while practicing in hot temperatures on May 10 and July 20 , 1973 , resulting in heat stroke that in turn exacerbated the cerebral edema that led to his death .
Legacy
Jeet Kune
Do , a hybrid martial arts philosophy drawing from different combat disciplines that was founded by Lee , is often credited with paving the way for modern mixed martial arts ( MMA ) . [ 114 ] [ 115 ]
Lee is considered by commentators , critics , media , and other martial artists to be the most influential martial artist of all time [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] and a pop culture icon of the 20th century , who bridged the gap between East and West . [ 119 ] [ 120 ]
He is credited with helping to change the way Asians were presented in American films [ 4 ] and was largely responsible for launching the " kung fu craze " of the 1970s . [ 121 ] [ 122 ]
He initially introduced kung fu to the West with American television shows such as The Green Hornet and Kung Fu , [ 122 ] before the " kung fu craze " began with the dominance of Hong Kong martial arts films in 1973 .
[ 121 ]
Lee 's success subsequently inspired a wave of Western martial arts films and television shows throughout the 1970s –1990s ( launching the careers of Western martial arts stars such as Jean - Claude Van Damme , Steven Seagal and Chuck Norris ) , as well as the more general integration of Asian martial arts into Western action films and television shows during the 1980s –1990s . [ 122 ]
Enter the Dragon has been cited as one of the most influential action films of all time .
Sascha Matuszak of Vice said Enter the Dragon " is referenced in all manner of media , the plot line and characters continue to influence storytellers today , and the impact was particularly felt in the revolutionizing way the film portrayed African - Americans , Asians and traditional martial arts . " [ 123 ] Kuan - Hsing Chen and Beng Huat Chua cited fight scenes in Lee films such as Enter the Dragon as being influential for the way they pitched " an elemental story of good against evil in such a spectacle - saturated way " . [ 124 ]
The concept of mixed martial arts was popularized in the West by Bruce Lee via his system of Jeet Kune Do . Lee believed that " the best fighter is not a Boxer , Karate or Judo man .
The best fighter is someone who can adapt to any style , to be formless , to adopt an individual 's own style and not following the system of styles . "
In 2004 , Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) founder Dana White called Lee the " father of mixed martial arts " and stated : " If you look at the way Bruce Lee trained , the way he fought , and many of the things he wrote , he said the perfect style was no style .
You take a little something from everything .
You take the good things from every different discipline , use what works , and you throw the rest away " .
[ 125 ]
Numerous fighters in combat sports were inspired by Lee .
For example , boxing champion Sugar Ray Leonard said he perfected his jab by watching Lee , boxing champion Manny Pacquiao compared his fighting style to Lee , and UFC champion Conor McGregor also compared himself to Lee and said that he believes
Lee would 've been a champion in UFC if he were to compete in the present day . [ 126 ]
American taekwondo pioneer Jhoon Goo Rhee learnt from Lee what he calls the " accupunch " , which he incorporated into American taekwondo ;
Rhee later coached heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali and taught him the " accupunch " , which Ali used to knockout Richard Dunn in 1975 .[ 40 ] UFC pound - for - pound champion Jon Jones also cited Lee as inspiration , [ 127 ] with Jones known for frequently using the oblique kick to the knee , a technique that was popularized by Lee . [ 128 ]
Numerous other UFC fighters have cited Lee as their inspiration , with several referring to him as a " godfather " or " grandfather " of MMA . [ 129 ]
In Japan , the manga and anime franchises Fist of the North Star ( 1983 –1988 ) and Dragon Ball ( 1984–1995 ) were inspired by Lee films such as Enter the Dragon . [ 130 ] [ 131 ]
In turn , Fist of the North Star and especially Dragon Ball are credited with setting the trends for popular shōnen manga and anime from the 1980s onwards .
[ 132 ] [ 133 ]
Similarly in India , Lee films had an influence on Bollywood masala films ; [ 134 ] after the success of Lee films such as Enter the Dragon in India , [ 135 ] Deewaar ( 1975 ) and later Bollywood films incorporated fight scenes inspired by 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films up until the 1990s . [ 136 ]
Bruce Lee films such as Game of Death and Enter the Dragon were also the foundation for video game genres such as beat 'em up action games and fighting games .
[ 137 ] [ 138 ]
The early beat 'em up game Kung - Fu Master ( 1984 ) was originally based on Bruce Lee 's Game of Death . [ 139 ]
The Street Fighter video game franchise ( 1987 debut ) was inspired by Enter the Dragon , with the gameplay centered around an international fighting tournament , and each character having a unique combination of ethnicity , nationality and fighting style ; Street Fighter went on to set the template for all fighting games that followed .
[ 140 ]
In April 2014 , Lee was named a featured character in the combat sports video game EA Sports UFC , and is playable in multiple weight classes . [ 141 ]
Honors
Lee was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century .
[ 4 ]
In April 2013 , he was posthumously awarded the prestigious Founders Award at The Asian Awards . [ 142 ]
A theme park dedicated to Lee was built in Jun'an , Guangdong .
Mainland Chinese only started watching Bruce Lee films in the 1980s , when videos of classic movies like The Chinese Connection became available .
Films like Enter the Dragon and Fists of Fury were banned by Mao as spiritual pollution and rightist sentimentality . [ 143 ]
On January 6 , 2009 , it was announced that Lee 's Hong Kong home ( 41 Cumberland Road , Kowloon , Hong Kong ) would be preserved and transformed into a tourist site by Yu Pang - lin . [ 144 ] [ 145 ]
Yu died in 2015 and this plan did not materialize . [ 146 ]
In 2018 , Yu's grandson , Pang Chi-ping , said : " We will convert the mansion into a centre for Chinese studies next year , which provides courses like Mandarin and Chinese music for children . " [ 147 ]
Statues
Martial arts lineage
[ relevant ? – discuss ]
Lee was trained in Wu Tai Chi Chuan ( also known as Ng - ga ) and Jing Mo Tam Tui for the twelve sets .
Lee was trained in the martial arts Choy Li Fut , Western Boxing , Épée fencing , Judo , Praying Mantis kung fu , Hsing - I , and Jujitsu .
" When Bruce arrived in the US he ( already ) had training in Wu Style Tai Chi , sometimes in Hong Kong called Ng - ga .

Danny Inosanto [ 151 ]
Certified instructors
Bruce Lee personally certified only three instructors : Taky Kimura , James Yimm Lee , and Dan Inosanto .
Taky Kimura holds a 5th rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. James Yimm Lee held a 3rd rank in Jun Fan Gung Fu. Inosanto holds the 3rd rank ( Instructor ) directly from Bruce Lee in Jeet Kune Do , Jun Fan Gung Fu , and Bruce Lee 's Tao of Chinese Gung Fu. Other Jeet Kune
Do instructors since Lee 's death have been certified directly by Dan Inosanto , some with remaining Bruce Lee- signed certificates .
James Yimm Lee , a close friend of Lee , certified a few students including Gary Dill , who studied Jeet Kune Do under James and received permission via a personal letter from him in 1972 to pass on his learning of Jun Fan Gung Fu to others .
Taky Kimura , to date , has certified only one person in Jun Fan Gung Fu : his son Andy Kimura .
Dan Inosanto continued to teach and certify select students in Jeet Kune
Do for over 30 years , making it possible for thousands of martial arts practitioners to trace their training lineage back to Bruce Lee .
Prior to his death , Lee told his then only two living instructors Kimura and Inosanto ( James Yimm Lee had died in 1972 ) to dismantle his schools .
Both Taky Kimura and Dan Inosanto were allowed to teach small classes thereafter , under the guideline " keep the numbers low , but the quality high " .
Bruce also instructed several World Karate Champions including Chuck Norris , Joe Lewis , and Mike Stone .
Between the three of them , during their training with Bruce , they won every karate championship in the United States . [ 152 ]
In Japan , Junichi Okada is a certified Japanese instructor in Jeet Kune Do. [ 153 ]
Fitness and nutrition
At 172 cm ( 5 ft 8 in ) and weighing 64 kg ( 141 lb ) at the time , [ 154 ]
Lee was renowned for his physical fitness and vigor , achieved by using a dedicated fitness regimen to become as strong as possible .
After his match with Wong Jack Man in 1965 , Lee changed his approach toward martial arts training .
Lee felt that many martial artists of his time did not spend enough time on physical conditioning .
Lee included all elements of total fitness — muscular strength , muscular endurance , cardiovascular endurance , and flexibility .
He used traditional bodybuilding techniques to build some muscle mass , though not overdone , as that could decrease speed or flexibility .
At the same time , with respect to balance , Lee maintained that mental and spiritual preparation are fundamental to the success of physical training in martial arts skills .
In Tao of Jeet Kune
Do he wrote :
Training is one of the most neglected phases of athletics .
Too much time is given to the development of skill and too little to the development of the individual for participation .
... JKD , ultimately is not a matter of petty techniques but of highly developed spirituality and physique . [ 155 ]
According to Linda Lee Cadwell , soon after he moved to the United States , Lee started to take nutrition seriously and developed an interest in health foods , high - protein drinks , and vitamin and mineral supplements .
He later concluded that achieving a high - performance body was akin to maintaining the engine of a high - performance automobile .
Allegorically , as one could not keep a car running on low - octane fuels , one could not sustain one 's body with a steady diet of junk food , and with " the wrong fuel " , one 's body would perform sluggishly or sloppily . [ 156 ]
Lee also avoided baked goods and refined flour , describing them as providing empty calories that did nothing for his body . [ 157 ]
He was known for being a fan of Asian cuisine for its variety , and often ate meals with a combination of vegetables , rice , and fish .
Lee had a dislike for dairy products and as a result , used powdered milk in his diet . [ 158 ]
Personal
Names
Lee 's Cantonese birth name was Lee Jun-fan ( 李振藩 ) . [ 159 ]
The name homophonically means " return again " , and was given to Lee by his mother , who felt he would return to the United States once he came of age . [ 160 ]
Because of his mother 's superstitious nature , she had originally named him Sai - fon ( 細鳳 ) , which is a feminine name meaning " small phoenix " . [ 31 ]
The English name " Bruce " is thought to have been given by the hospital attending physician , Dr. Mary Glover . [ 161 ]
Lee had three other Chinese names : Lee Yuen - cham ( 李源鑫 ) , a family / clan name ; Lee Yuen - kam ( 李元鑒 ) , which he used as a student name while he was attending La Salle College , and his Chinese screen name Lee Siu-lung ( 李小龍 ; Siu-lung means " little dragon " ) .[ citation needed ]
Lee 's given name Jun-fan was originally written in Chinese as 震藩 ; however , the Jun ( 震 ) Chinese character was identical to part of his grandfather 's name , Lee Jun-biu ( 李震彪 ) . [ citation needed ]
Hence , the Chinese character for Jun in Lee 's name was changed to the homonym 振 instead , to avoid naming taboo in Chinese tradition .[ citation needed ]
Family
Lee and his family
Lee 's father , Lee Hoi-chuen , was one of the leading Cantonese opera and film actors at the time and was embarking on a year - long opera tour with his family on the eve of the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong .
Lee Hoi-chuen had been touring the United States for many years and performing in numerous Chinese communities there .
Although many of his peers decided to stay in the US , Lee Hoi-chuen returned to Hong Kong after Bruce 's birth .
Within months , Hong Kong was invaded and the Lees lived for three years and eight months under Japanese occupation .
After the war ended , Lee Hoi-chuen resumed his acting career and became a more popular actor during Hong Kong 's rebuilding years .
Lee 's mother , Grace Ho , was from one of the wealthiest and most powerful clans in Hong Kong , the Ho-tungs .
She was the half - niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung , [ 162 ] [ 163 ] the Eurasian patriarch of the clan .
As such , the young Bruce Lee grew up in an affluent and privileged environment .
Despite the advantage of his family 's status , the neighborhood in which Lee grew up became overcrowded , dangerous , and full of gang rivalries due to an influx of refugees fleeing communist China for Hong Kong , at that time a British Crown Colony . [ 31 ]
Grace
Ho is reported as either the adopted or biological daughter of Ho Kom - tong ( Ho Gumtong , 何甘棠 ) and the half - niece of Sir Robert Ho-tung , both notable Hong Kong businessmen and philanthropists . [ 162 ]
Bruce was the fourth of five children : Phoebe Lee ( 李秋源 ) , Agnes Lee ( 李秋鳳 ) , Peter Lee , and Robert Lee .
Grace 's parentage remains unclear .
Linda Lee , in her 1989 biography The Bruce Lee Story , suggests that Grace had a German father and was a Catholic . [ 72 ]
Bruce Thomas , in his influential 1994 biography Bruce Lee : Fighting Spirit , suggests that Grace had a Chinese mother and a German father . [ 164 ]
Lee 's relative Eric Peter Ho , in his 2010 book Tracing My Children 's Lineage , suggests that Grace was born in Shanghai to a Eurasian woman named Cheung King - sin . [ 164 ]
Eric Peter
Ho said that Grace Lee was the daughter of a mixed race Shanghainese woman and her father was Ho Kom Tong .
Grace Lee said her mother was English and her father was Chinese . [ 165 ] Fredda Dudley Balling said Grace Lee was three - quarters Chinese and one - quarter British . [ 166 ]
In the 2018 biography Bruce Lee : A Life , Matthew Polly identifies Lee 's maternal grandfather as Ho Kom - tong , who had often been reported as his adoptive grandfather .
Ho 's father , Mozes Hartog Bosman , was a Dutch Jewish businessman from Rotterdam .
He moved to Hong Kong with the Dutch East India Company and served as the Dutch consul to Hong Kong at one time .
He had a Chinese concubine named Sze Tai with whom he had six children , including Ho Kom Tong .
Bosman subsequently abandoned his family and immigrated to California .
Ho Kom Tong became a wealthy businessman with a wife , 13 concubines , and a British mistress who gave birth to Grace Ho. [ 170 ] [ 171 ]
His younger brother Robert Lee Jun-fai is a notable musician and singer , his group The Thunderbirds were famous in Hong Kong . [ 172 ] [ 173 ] [ 174 ]

This gave Brandon the desire to act and went on to study the craft .
As a young adult , Brandon Lee found some success acting in action orientated pictures such as Legacy of Rage ( 1986 ) , Showdown in Little Tokyo ( 1991 ) , and Rapid Fire ( 1992 ) .
In 1993 , at the age of 28 , Brandon Lee died after being accidentally shot by prop gun on the set of The Crow .
Lee died when his daughter Shannon was four .
In her youth she studied Jeet Kune Do , under Richard Bustillo , one of her father 's students .
However , her serious studies did not begin until the late 1990s .
To train for parts in action movies , she studied Jeet Kune Do with Ted Wong . [ 178 ]

The coming GOP attack on Kagan and guns
Greg Sargent is right about this -- Republicans are going to look closely at any decisions or suggestions Elena Kagan made about gun rights during her work in Bill Clinton 's administration .

This is a fairly new development in SCOTUS fights , but an important one .
It was n't until the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor last year that the NRA ever took a stand on high court nominees , telling senators it would count votes for her nomination against them on their NRA records .
After the vote , Curt Levey of the Committee for Justice -- which did a lot of work rounding up pro-2nd Amendment groups in this cause , interpreted it this way .
The Republican leadership reminded them that if they do n't care about judges , they should .
For 130 years , the NRA could be effective by focusing on legislation , but now , after last year 's Supreme Court decision in Heller , this issue is in the courts — pretty much like abortion was after Roe v. Wade .
So definitely expect to hear this again .
Republicans feel they they 've opened up a new front , and they have the high ground .
PARIS —
It was as if menswear designers had used a scalpel instead of pencil .
Off with the coat sleeves !
Cut away the collar !
Snip at pants until they morph into shorts !
Split the seams and close them with zippers !
Radical surgery on regular menswear was the message of the Paris summer 2011 season that ended Monday .
There was even a hospital vibe about streamlined tunics , shorn of any details , and worn with drop - crotch pants , which are entering the mainstream .
The big fashion picture included the return of high - button , double - breasted jackets ; a vogue for silk , whether giving a sheen to cashmere or puckered into seersucker ; and flashes of color , bright and muted , like orange , grass green , turquoise and lavender .
The leading fashion surgeon is Raf Simons , who celebrated 15 years in menswear by going back to his roots and making the sleeveless tunic / jacket and wide - legged pants look fresh .
His early inspiration from a fellow Belgian designer , Martin Margiela , was absorbed into a show that had less of the precise tailoring that has dominated the designer ’s recent collections .
Instead , anything from a suit jacket to sportswear was sliced by a bright zipper at the back , covered by a free - flying patterned necktie .
Image caption Ms Persad - Bissessar is a devout Hindu
Barely 24 hours after she was sworn in as the first woman prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago , Kamla Persad - Bissessar donned a life jacket and waded into the flood waters to tour areas affected by torrential rains sweeping across the Caribbean .
A devout Hindu , she swore on the Bhagavad Gita - the Hindu holy book - to do her duty to her people .
Even as congratulations poured in from around the world , she remained focused on " dealing with the people 's business " .
It was the most important task at hand , she told her 1.3 m citizens during the live televised address of her historic swearing - in ceremony .
A descendant of Indian indentured labourers who came to Trinidad to work the sugar plantations from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between 1845 and 1917 , Ms Persad - Bissessar grew up with traditional Indian values and strong religious ties .
' No novice '
The landslide victory of the coalition led by her United National Congress ( UNC ) party in last month 's election has brought a sense of euphoria and feeling of hope to this incredibly wealthy republic .
Trinidad and Tobago has sailed smoothly through the global recession , cushioned by a sea of oil and natural gas .
Image caption Ms Persad - Bissessar ran a high - profile election campaign
The squandering of billions of dollars by the former government and alleged corruption helped bring this 58 - year - old grandmother - of - two into power .
She unseated former PM Patrick Manning whose People 's National Movement ( PNM ) party had governed the country for 42 of the 48 years since its independence from the UK .
An attorney by profession , Ms Persad - Bissessar is no novice to politics having been the MP for her area Siparia , a rural town in the south of the island , since 1995 .
In the last 15 years she has weathered many political storms , even as she broke gender barriers .
Former Prime Minister Basdeo Panday ( 1995 - 2001 ) appointed her attorney general and education minister during the UNC 's first stint in office , and she even acted as PM .
But in 2007 , in the lead - up to a general election , when it was clear that she was the best person to lead the party , Mr Panday refused to resign .
Ms Persad - Bissessar , who is married to a doctor and has a son , swallowed the humiliation , even giving a famous speech to the theme of Bob Marley 's No Woman No Cry , in which she declared her undying support for her political guru .
But all that changed last December .
As then Prime Minister Manning became increasingly unpopular , Ms Persad - Bissessar saw a golden opportunity for the opposition forces to unite to topple the ruling People 's National Movement .
' Smear campaign '
But as she launched her bid to take over the UNC , Mr Panday unleashed an attack on her reputation , suggesting that she was an alcoholic .
Ms Persad - Bissessar called the accusation " total falsehood " .
Image caption Ms Persad - Bissessar is of Indian origin
" It is a smear campaign of lies , half - truths and innuendoes .
Smear campaigns do not win elections .
Sticks and stones may break my bones but words cannot hurt me . "
Indeed , they did not .
On 24 January , Ms Persad - Bissessar became leader of the UNC with a landslide victory .
When Mr Panday refused to step down as leader of the opposition , she dealt with that too - persuading his loyal MPs to cross over to her side .
After she was appointed leader of the opposition , she hired the strategist who worked on Barack Obama 's presidential campaign to assist her .
After a blistering , hugely expensive campaign that used high - tech , slick advertisement in all the media , including the internet , Ms Persad - Bissessar and her coalition emerged victorious .
And on 24 May she became prime minister .
Ms Persad - Bissessar has shown admirable political savvy in the last few weeks , openly courting the media and reacting swiftly to public opinion .
In her 30 May Indian Arrival Day speech she touched on " soft " issues such as race , gender and class inequality .
" As a child in the rural district of Penal I remember sharing meals from the same pot with neighbours of different racial , ethnic , social and economic backgrounds , " she said .
" We all managed .
If one had , then all had .
Because then we were intuitively and instinctively our brother 's keepers .
On her terms
" Time and circumstances have allowed many factors , including the divisiveness of some politicians , to keep us apart .
But to go forward , we must go back .
" We need to rekindle those values , those strengths as a nation and as a people …
And we must do so as one people with one goal . "
Image caption Ms Persad - Bissessar unseated former PM Patrick Manning
She is intensely aware of the chance she has to make and change history on these islands .
She has already shown that she will be a prime minister on her own terms .
She declined the opportunity to meet US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton because parliament had not yet been convened .
She graced the catwalk at Trinidad and Tobago 's annual fashion week at the end of May .
And she also made an appearance with local chutney musicians at a show .
Ms Persad - Bissessar , who graduated top of her class from law school , also confronted the delicate issue of gender tensions .
" Looking towards the future , one of the most important issues the national community must face is the widening gap between the liberated , modern , independent women and our traditional men who are being left behind , " she said .
" Women are outperforming men in almost every sphere of life in our society and the women of east Indian ancestry are no exception to this rule .
They have broken the cultural mould , " she said .
No - one as much as her .

When Rothbardian economists propose that the United States needs a Federal Reserve about as much as it needs a federal car company , it 's not surprising that Keynesians ridicule the notion .
What is surprising is that otherwise laissez - faire economists , particularly of the Chicago School variety , think that the market economy is good at producing goods and services except when it comes to money .
Specifically , these lukewarm free - marketeers think that , in a pure capitalist system , wages are " sticky . "
This observation supposedly proves the necessity of a central bank willing to inject whatever inflation is necessary to kick start the economy out of a deep recession .
As we 'll see , this analysis is incorrect .
Much of the alleged " stickiness " of wages is due to government policies , and the focus on macroeconomic aggregates overlooks the distortions among sectors that massive inflation causes .
Economists who support the free market in other areas should bite the bullet and join the call to end the Fed .
The Alleged Problem of Sticky Wages
In his response to my earlier critique of his call for inflation , Greg Mankiw laid out the mainstream case .
After quoting my argument that falling prices could restore equilibrium even if the economy needed " negative real interest rates , " Mankiw wrote ,
I think this analysis is correct , under the maintained assumption that prices ( including wages ) are completely and instantaneously flexible .
But if prices are sticky , then the immediate deflation and concurrent increase in expected inflation wo n't occur painlessly .
Instead , it would take a while for the price level to fall , and as we wait , the economy would suffer through a period of depressed economic activity .
According to conventional new Keynesian analysis , sticky prices are the ultimate market imperfection that makes aggregate demand matter .
If you deny that prices are sticky and assume they can instantaneously jump downward to new equilibrium levels , many macroeconomic problems become much easier to solve .
Indeed , you do n't need to solve them at all , as the market would do it .
I wish we lived in the world that Mr Murphy describes , but my reading of the evidence is that we do n't .
( emphasis in original )
Mankiw is not alone in his view .
For example , I recently debated a Fed economist who agreed with me on just about every major economic issue .
But he thought that in periods when the demand to hold money increases sharply — such as in the early 1930s — that it is the job of the Federal Reserve to print new money to quench the thirst .
Because the Fed did not do so , it meant the exchange value of dollar bills had to rise , which is the same thing as saying that prices ( quoted in dollars ) had to fall .
This led to massive unemployment , because workers ' wages allegedly were much stickier than the prices of other products , meaning that businesses saw labor getting more and more expensive as the Depression intensified .
Finally , we have the case of Scott Sumner , a " right - wing " economist who is quite libertarian on most points .
But Scott 's claim to fame is that he thinks Bernanke was too timid during the crisis of 2008 , and did n't create enough new money in the midst of the global financial panic .
As a result , Scott thinks the United States suffered through an unnecessarily sharp recession , which a healthy dose of inflation could have greatly mitigated .
The Government Itself Makes Wages Sticky
As so often happens , the proponents of government intervention are pointing to a problem that is greatly exacerbated by the government itself .
Recall that the trouble stems from workers not being willing to take pay cuts .
When the demand from employers drops , at the old wage rate there is now surplus labor — a.k.a. unemployment .
Only when market wages drop to a lower level , so that demand once again matches supply , will equilibrium be restored in the labor market .
Now we have to ask , why do workers hold out for so long without jobs , insisting on wages that no one is willing to pay ?
After all , the other goods and services in the economy see their prices fall in a speedy fashion even though the sellers of these items depend on them for their livelihood .
So if a street vendor knows enough to slash his hot dog prices when demand collapses , why do n't hairdressers accept pay cuts when the same happens to their industry ?
" After the 1929 crash , Herbert Hoover gathered the nation 's leading businessmen for a conference in Washington and urged them to allow profits and dividends to take the hit , but to spare workers ' paychecks . "
In the case of the Great Depression , the answer is simple enough : the federal government did n't allow wages to fall .
After the 1929 crash , Herbert Hoover gathered the nation 's leading businessmen for a conference in Washington and urged them to allow profits and dividends to take the hit , but to spare workers ' paychecks .
Rather than cut wages , businesses were supposed to implement spread - the - work schemes where workers would cut back their hours .
The rationale for Hoover 's high - wage policy was that the worker supposedly needed to be paid " enough to buy back the product . "
Hoover had bought into the trendy new economic theory blaming depressions on underconsumption .
The idea was that wage cuts would just cause workers to cut their spending , which would in turn lead to another round of wage cuts in a vicious downward spiral .
Because of the uncertainty and actual reduction in the stock of money ( an accident of the fractional reserve banking system when people withdraw their cash from banks ) , prices in the economy fell drastically in the early years of the Depression .
But because of pressure from the government , businesses allowed wage rates to fall very slowly .
As a result , real wages ( i.e. , paychecks adjusted for price deflation ) actually rose more quickly during the early years of the Depression than they had during the Roaring Twenties !
Because labor got more and more expensive , unemployment surged to an unprecedented 25 percent by 1933 .
In our times , the extension of unemployment benefits is the most obvious example of a government intervention that prolongs job searches .
Rather than accepting a job for lower pay than they are accustomed to , laid - off workers can continue their quest for much longer than would be the case in a free market .
( Incidentally , Chicago School economists agree , and so does Mankiw . )
To see that wages can adjust on a relatively free market , even in the face of massive shocks to the economy , consider the 1920 – 1921 depression .
From its peak in June 1920 , the Consumer Price Index fell 15.8 percent over the next 12 months — a one - year price deflation that was half again more severe than any one - year drop during the Great Depression .
Even so , the economy quickly bounced back and entered the prosperous 1920s .
The answer was n't a massive injection of Fed money , either ; in fact the Fed had jacked rates up to record high levels .
On the contrary , the reason the US economy quickly adjusted in the face of massive price deflation was that wages fell quickly too , dropping about 20 percent in a single year .
There 's More to an Economy than Aggregate Price Levels
In the above section we saw that the argument that a free market has " sticky wages " and therefore requires massive doses of inflation simply does n't hold up empirically .
Ever since the 1930s , there have been systematic government ( and labor union ) efforts to prop up wages during economic downturns .
In the relatively laissez - faire year 1920 , wages fell quite rapidly to eliminate unemployment in the face of a collapse in prices .
But let 's put all that aside , and tackle the issue head - on : Suppose that even on a relatively free market for some reason the demand to hold cash suddenly spikes .
If the central bank stands by and does nothing , the increased demand for cash balances ( with a constant stock of money ) would lead to a general fall in the prices of goods and services .
As businesses saw the demand for their products plummet , they would lay off workers .
In principle , it could take years for wage rates to fall as much as other prices , meaning the economy would be operating below capacity for a long time .
" By dumping gobs of new money into a few access points of the economy , the central bank overlays the market 's nuanced signals with a huge amount of interference . "
In our hypothetical scenario , could n't the central bank alleviate the misery by printing up wads of new cash early on ?
That way , the demand to hold more money would be satisfied by an increase in the number of dollar bills rather than by a wrenching fall in prices .
To see why this suggested remedy is quite dangerous , let 's forget about the sudden demand to hold more cash .
Suppose we had an economy with a stable demand for cash , and all of a sudden the central bank doubled the money supply .
What would happen ?
Of course , in the long run , prices in general would rise , perhaps doubling .
But in the interim , there would be other effects .
In practice , when the central bank increases the money supply , it does n't magically augment every single person 's cash balance by the same percentage .
No , some lucky recipients get the new money first .
These people then have the ability to spend the newly created dollars at the old prices .
They would therefore become relatively richer .
On the other hand , the people who were last in line to receive ( or spend ) the new money , would see prices rising at the store while their incomes were stuck at the old levels .
These latecomers to the party would become relatively poorer .
Beyond the one - shot redistributive effects , there is also the damage caused by the existence of an inflationary central bank in the first place .
Knowing that the bank had the ability to inject massive doses of new money into the market , investors and businesspeople would have less faith in the long - run purchasing power of the money unit .
They would spend time and devote resources to hedging themselves against erratic central banking decisions , rather than focusing exclusively on the " fundamentals . "
All of these problems hold true in a scenario starting with a sudden demand to hold more cash .
In reality , it 's not the case that every single person suddenly wants to increase his cash holdings by x percent , or that the central bank can instantly endow every person in the economy with the exact amount of new cash that he wishes to accumulate .
( And even if it could , who would n't then say , " In that case , I 'd like some more hundred dollar bills , please " ? )
When people become fearful of the future in times of economic uncertainty , they naturally aim to bolster their liquid assets , especially their holding of money .
But each person will cut back on his " normal spending " in a unique way .
One person might cut out his weekly visit to his favorite restaurant , while another will sell some of his old baseball cards .
In order for these subtle differences to be communicated through the economy , entrepreneurs need to see the changes in relative prices .
In our example , workers need to leave the restaurant industry , while speculators may want to attend baseball card shows looking for bargains .
By dumping gobs of new money into a few access points of the economy , the central bank overlays these nuanced signals with a huge amount of interference .
Only in simplistic macro models , which contain a few variables like M and P , does the " shock " of the increase in demand for money become perfectly offset by the increase in M .
In reality , these two different disturbances do n't cancel each other out .
The economy is in fact left to deal with the real events that fueled the panic in the first place — people do n't suddenly decide to hold a bunch of cash for no good reason — as well as the huge injection of money into the hands of politically connected bankers .
Conclusion
The argument of sticky wages does not justify the existence of a central bank .
Market prices , including wages , are flexible enough to smooth out macroeconomic disturbances .
To the extent that workers hold out for a better job , rather than take a pay cut , this too reflects a legitimate outcome on a free market .
Only in a simplistic macro model , with ad hoc assumptions about wages and prices , can the central bank improve the economy .
Winding up a historic trial over same - sex marriage in California , the lawyer for Proposition 8's sponsors told a federal judge Wednesday that allowing only a man and a woman to wed promotes responsible sex and child rearing , and ultimately ensures the future of humanity .
During more than two hours of intense and sometimes skeptical questioning by Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker , attorney Charles Cooper maintained that society is entitled to reserve its approval of marriage for those who can naturally conceive children .
" The marital relationship is fundamental to the existence and survival of the race , " Cooper said in closing arguments before a packed San Francisco courtroom .
The reason the state regulates marriage , he said , is to steer " procreative sexual relationships " into a stable family environment so that children can be raised by their biological parents .
Other federal courts have relied on that argument to uphold measures such as Prop.
8 , a November 2008 initiative that prohibited same - sex marriages in California less than six months after the state Supreme Court had legalized them .
Judge skeptical
But Walker , who presided over the nation 's first federal trial on the issue , sounded dubious .
He noted that the state allows couples unable or unwilling to have children to marry , suggesting that the institution has a broader purpose that same - sex partners might equally fulfill .
" Marriage is a right which extends fundamentally to all persons , whether they 're capable of producing children , incarcerated or behind in their child - support payments , " Walker said , citing Supreme Court rulings that allow people in all those situations to marry .
People marry not to benefit the state , but because they believe that " I 'm going to get a life partner , who I 'm going to share my life with and maybe have children , " the judge said .
" Why do n't those same values apply to gay couples and lesbian couples loving one another ? "
Cooper replied that same - sex couples are incapable of " irresponsible procreation , " which he said marriage laws are designed to discourage .
Bias would be OK
He also said California has provided equal treatment for all couples in its domestic - partner laws .
But even a discriminatory marriage law would be valid , Cooper said , because the U.S. Constitution offers no special protection to gays and lesbians and " we do n't have to submit evidence " to justify treating them differently .
Theodore Olson , lawyer for two same - sex couples who sued for the right to marry , responded indignantly .
Prop. 8 , he said , " takes a group of people who have been victims of discrimination " historically and prevents them from " participating in the most fundamental relationship in life . "
Gays and lesbians , Olson said , seek to wed for the same reasons as everyone else , to be in a committed , socially accepted family relationship with the one they love .
" Tell me how it helps the rest of the citizens of California to keep them out of the club , " he said .
Walker did not say when he would rule .
His decision is certain to be appealed and could reach the Supreme Court within two years .
Evolving institution
The arguments followed 12 days of testimony in January , almost entirely on the plaintiffs ' side - from the gay and lesbian couples , who spoke of their longing for full acceptance , and from eight academic witnesses who described marriage as an evolving institution that once contained racial restrictions and would be strengthened if it became more inclusive .
The only witnesses for Prop. 8 's sponsors were political scientist Kenneth Miller , who said gays and lesbians can protect their political interests without judicial protection , and David Blankenhorn , an author and advocate who said allowing same - sex marriages could lead to more divorces and fewer weddings for men and women .
At Wednesday 's hearing , Walker asked Cooper whether Blankenhorn , who heads the Institute for American Values but lacks academic credentials , qualified as an expert witness .
Cooper said Blankenhorn was a recognized expert in his field , and Olson hastened to endorse him , saying Blankenhorn 's testimony helped to discredit Prop .
8 .
He cited Blankenhorn 's statements that marriage would benefit gay and lesbian couples and their children , and that " we would be more American on the day we permitted same - sex marriage than we were the day before . "
' Slur ' on voters
But Cooper said the male - female definition of marriage has been accepted " across cultures , across time " and that the plaintiffs ' claim that Prop.
8 was rooted in prejudice is " a slur on 7 million Californians " who voted for the measure .
The plaintiffs were joined by the city of San Francisco , which argued that Prop. 8 promotes discrimination that leads to higher municipal health and welfare costs .
Therese Stewart , the chief deputy city attorney , also told Walker that the ban on same - sex marriage reduces the city 's revenue from tourism .
" It 's long been the city of love , where people leave their hearts , " she said - drawing a broad smile from Mayor Gavin Newsom in the front row .
Reports are flying in from across the internet -- and by that we mean the xda-developers and Google Code forums -- that the EVO 4G might have something of a framerate issue .
It seems that the device is " locked in " at 30 frames per second both in 2D ( Canvas ) and 3D ( openGL ) modes , while anecdotally , a phone like the Hero hits 54 fps on average and has " smoother scrolling " in the menus .
This apparently is visible both with the standard Sense UI installed and with the Froyo preview build , although in the latter case the Nexus One bootup video is 60 fps before halving upon reaching the home screen .
So , wherein lies the culprit ?
For Google 's part , Android framework engineer " Romain Guy " responded to one thread reasserting the platform team 's " target was , is and will be 60 fps . "
We can't imagine it 's related to the hardware given the EVO 's impressive specs .
Some fingers , ergo , are being pointed towards firmware .
This would n't be the first time HTC 's handsets have come under scrutiny for troubling graphical performance -- 2008 was not the company 's finest year in that department .
Whatever the reason is , we just want a quick resolve -- after all , it 's just not fair when our Hero - carrying buddies are scoring better benchmarks .
Are you a Wall Street banker , a captain of industry , a financier ?
If not , then maybe you 've thought once or twice about buying a credit default swap or a collateralized debt obligation .
No ?
Well , maybe you 've asked a private equity company to help you hedge your risks through ...
Okay , Okay , we 'll stop now .
If you do n't fit into any of the above categories , there 's only one piece of the massive financial reform bill Congress is considering that would directly affect you -- the proposed consumer protection bureau .
It 's supposed to help consumers make sense of their mortgages , credit cards and other financial matters , so big companies can't overwhelm them with pages of fine - print agreements .
After that , the bill goes into the deep weeds of esoteric high finance .
More than a year and a half after the height of the financial crisis , Congress is trying to pass some regulations to prevent a repeat of the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression .
What 's in the Dodd bill
For the purposes of this factsheet , we 're focusing on the legislation put forward by Democrats in the Senate , shepherded by Sen.
Christopher Dodd , D - Conn .
It 's 1,400 pages of new rules that change the way the financial system is regulated .
The House passed its version of financial reform in December 2009 that differs on some details .
But because the Senate is slow - moving and prone to requiring 60 votes for action , it seems likely the Senate bill will be a baseline for negotiations .
Keep in mind this bill is a moving target .
It will be amended before passage , and the Senate and House will then have to negotiate their differences before a final vote .
Here are the bill 's main components :
• Consumer protection .
This bureau 's mission would be to help people looking for mortgages , credit cards and other financial products to avoid unfair , deceptive or abusive practices .
In the Senate version , the new consumer protection bureau would be housed within the Federal Reserve , though it would have its own budget .
The House version of the bill creates a standalone agency .
• Policing " systemic " threats .
The bill creates a Financial Stability Oversight Council to look for overarching threats to the financial system and to recommend specific steps to rein in large financial companies when necessary .
The Federal Reserve would be given new powers to regulate nonbank financial companies .
A new Office of Financial Research within the Treasury Department would collect financial data and conduct research and analysis .
• " Orderly liquidation authority . "
This part of the bill sets up a panel of three bankruptcy judges who convene and decide , within 24 hours , if a large financial company is insolvent .
If a big firm is teetering on collapse , the Treasury Department , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve would have to agree to liquidate it , using a special fund created with payments from the largest financial firms .
The legislative language says the fund must be used to dissolve failing firms .
To pay for the shutdowns , the FDIC would set fees on the financial companies based on their size , raising $ 50 billion .
The fund has become a point of controversy in recent weeks .
Opponents have said it means guaranteed bailouts , a claim we ruled False , and some Republicans want the fund removed from the final bill .
• The " Volcker Rule . "
This rule would prohibit banks from engaging in proprietary trading , which is trading the bank 's money to turn a profit .
Advocates for this rule say these kinds of trades tend to put banks into a conflict of interest with their customers .
The rules also would limit banks ' relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds .
Nonbank financial institutions also would see new restrictions .
• Derivatives .
Most but not all derivatives would be traded on an exchange .
A derivative is an investment usually based on some outside event .
Here 's an example of a good derivative : Southwest Airlines has to buy jet fuel over the coming year to run its planes .
If oil prices skyrocket , Southwest loses money .
So the airline invests money in something that will pay out if oil prices increase , lowering its potential for losses .
But derivatives have a dark side : During the financial crisis , derivatives exacerbated losses , especially in the housing market , and investors were n't sure who was taking the biggest losses .
The new regulations are aimed at making clear who is trading in derivatives .
A version of derivatives legislation sponsored by Sen. Blanche Lincoln , D - Ark. , is considered particularly strict .
• Hedge funds .
Generally speaking , hedge funds are investment vehicles for selected groups of elite investors .
The name comes from hedge funds ' tendency to be very careful about managing , or hedging , risk .
This means they often buy derivatives or other unusual types of investments .
Under the new regulations , large hedge funds would have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and report their activities .
Some exemptions are provided for venture capital funds and private equity fund advisers .
• " Say on pay . "
Shareholders of publicly traded companies get to vote on executive pay , though the vote is nonbinding .
Translation : The company can choose to disregard the shareholders ' vote .
( Yes , this does n't seem like much of a say to us .
But experts tell us it 's actually progress in the longstanding fight to give shareholders more of a voice in corporate governance . )
• Credit ratings agencies .
The credit ratings agencies are the people who said , before the financial crisis hit , that securities built from subprime mortgages could be great investments .
Wrong , wrong , wrong .
The bill creates an Office of Credit Rating Agencies and puts in place rules for internal controls , independence , transparency and penalties for poor performance .
Concerns and criticisms
Here are some of the main points of concern raised about the proposal :
• " Too big to fail is too big to exist . "
Some economists argue that the idea of resolution authority for large firms is misguided .
The large financial firms that pose " systemic " risk cannot be shut down without harming the broader economy , they say , and the big players should be broken up .
This issue divides experts who otherwise agree on the need for increased regulation .
People like Paul Volcker , the former head of the Federal Reserve , and Simon Johnson , former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund , urge measures that would limit the size of the biggest banks .
Democratic senators Ted Kaufman of Delaware and Sherrod Brown of Ohio also support limits .
Meanwhile , people like Dodd , and Paul Krugman , the Nobel Prize - winning New York Times columnist , say that breaking up the banks is n't necessary to avert the next meltdown .
• " To be determined " regulations .
Some important restrictions are not detailed in the bill .
Instead , the bill says that officials will study and develop regulations on a particular issue .
That creates a lot of unknowns about how effective the bill will be .
The rules on credit rating agencies are particularly vague .
Lawrence
White , a professor of economics at New York University , says he is concerned that the yet - to - be - determined rules could discourage new firms from getting into the credit ratings business .
" The grand irony of this approach is that we will end up making the current incumbents more important , not less important , " he says .
• The autonomy and authority of the consumer protection agency .
Republicans have voiced concerns that the consumer protection agency will be too intrusive , regulating everyday companies that are n't really part of the financial industry .
Democrats , meanwhile , are debating how much independence to give the new agency .
Consumer advocates say a stand - alone entity , as proposed by the House , would have more teeth .
• Fannie and Freddie ?
Fannie and Freddie who ?
Please tell us you have n't forgotten about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
These are the two government - created companies that back many mortgages .
They were supposedly private companies but often thought of as public .
Then the financial crisis happened , and the Federal Housing Finance Agency placed them in conservatorship because they were out of money .
The federal government now is likely on the hook for huge losses sustained by Fannie and Freddie when the housing bubble popped .
The current bill does n't address Fannie and Freddie 's losses in any significant way .
Experts we spoke with say losses could be anywhere from $ 200 billion to $ 400 billion , and the government will have to make good on that eventually .
A Republican alternative makes a case for a special inspector general and limits on bailouts .
New Stephen Hawking Book Coming Out in September
Stephen Hawking has a new book coming out in September .
It is first book since The Universe in a Nutshell was published in 2001 .
Stephen Hawking 's new book , The Grand Design , is co-written by California Institue of Technology physicist Leonard Mlodinow .
The book examines the idea of a " unified theory " that can explain all the forces of nature .
Stephen Hawking believes we are very close to an understanding , not just of the workings of our universe , but of its very beginnings .
Drawing on forty years of Hawking 's own research and a recent series of extraordinary astronomical observations and theoretical breakthroughs , Hawking and Mlodinow examine the evidence for the existence of a ' unified theory ' - - a single theory that can describe and explain all the forces of nature .

In case you needed any more evidence that Samsung 's Epic 4G for Sprint is probably going to be awesome , you might take a gander at the competitive analysis they 've prepared against the iPhone 4 Droid Incredible , and Droid X as an ego - boosting checklist for reps prepping to sell the phone in the coming weeks .
The DLNA support trumpeted , but HDMI 's notably missing -- something its EVO 4G sibling has -- and it'll be up to customers to decide whether 4 - inch Super AMOLED is better than 4.3 - inch LCD .
Unsurprisingly , the Epic will " feature " the same $ 10 data surcharge that the EVO has , something that we 're guessing is going to end up being phased in over Sprint 's entire smartphone lineup over time -- you know , kind of like those delivery service " fuel surcharges " that end up becoming permanent after a while .
Anyhow , the Epic looks killer on paper , but if anything , the chart only underscores how incredibly stiff its competition is going to be .
Choice is good , is it not ?
Image caption Mr Vanunu shouted ' Shame on you , Israel ' before being led away
Mordechai Vanunu , the technician who revealed that Israel had nuclear weapons , has begun a three - month jail term for violating the terms of his release in 2004 .
Mr Vanunu was convicted by an Israeli court in December 2009 and sentenced to six months ' community service .
He refused , saying he would be in danger of being assaulted by a member of the Israeli public .
The court then returned him to jail instead .
Mr Vanunu spent 18 years in jail for revealing the existence of the clandestine Israeli nuclear programme .
Before being led away he shouted " You did n't get anything from me in 18 years ; you wo n't get anything in 3 months .
Shame on you , Israel . "
He was arrested on suspicion that he met foreigners , violating conditions of his 2004 release from jail .
His lawyer said his arrest was because of his relationship with his Norwegian girlfriend , not for revealing secrets .
After his release from prison in 2004 , the Israeli authorities banned Mr Vanunu from speaking to foreign media and travelling abroad .
In 2007 , Mr Vanunu was sentenced to six months in prison for breaking the conditions of his parole .
Image caption Bobby Fischer died in Iceland at the age of 64
The remains of chess champion Bobby Fischer are to be exhumed in order to settle a paternity claim , an Icelandic court has ruled .
The Supreme Court in Reykjavik said a tissue sample was needed to prove whether nine - year - old Jinky Young was Fischer 's daughter .
Fischer , who died in Iceland in 2008 , left no will .
His estate , estimated to be worth $ 2 million ( £ 1.4 m ) , has been at the heart of several inheritance claims .
Fischer 's former wife , relatives and the US government - which claims it is owed taxes - are also involved in the dispute .
Jinky , a Filipina , is the daughter of Marilyn Young , who had a relationship with Fischer .
' Unavoidable '
" In order to obtain such a sample it is unavoidable to exhume his body , " a court document said .
The verdict overturned a ruling by a district court , which said earlier this year that the grounds of the request were not strong enough .
Thordur Bogason , lawyer for Marilyn Young and her daughter , said the exhumation was a " last resort " , saying they had hoped that blood samples had been kept in an Icelandic hospital .
He said they had presented evidence that his clients had received regular payments from Fischer in the years before he died .
US - born Fischer became world famous in 1972 after winning against Boris Spassky , in what became known as the " chess match of the century " .
He was later accused by the US of violating international sanctions against Yugoslavia by playing a match there in 1992 .
He was granted citizenship in Iceland in 2005 .
He died aged 64 , and is buried in a church cemetery in southern Iceland , about 50 km ( 30 miles ) from Reykjavik .
BP says it has reinstalled a containment cap on its blown - out well in the Gulf of Mexico after an accident unleashed a torrent of oil .
BP was forced to remove the cap after an underwater robot bumped into the venting system .
Gas had risen through the vent that carried warm water down to prevent ice - like crystals from forming in the cap .
The cap has been partially containing the leaking oil and directing some of it to a surface ship .
The decision to remove the cap for repairs meant that oil was flowing unhindered into the ocean for about 10 hours on Wednesday .
Crude has been leaking at a rate of between 30,000 to 60,000 barrels per day , according to US scientists .
The cap has been collecting roughly 16,000 barrels every 24 hours , BP says .
In a separate development , two workers involved in the clean - up operation died , Coast Guard Adm Thad Allen said .
One death , he said , appeared to have been a swimming pool - related accident , while the second one was an apparent suicide .
It was not immediately known when the deaths had occurred and which company either of the two victims had been working for .
Rig blast
The spill was caused by an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , which killed 11 workers .
At a press briefing in Washington , Adm Allen said BP had removed the containing cap after the underwater robot bumped into the venting system on Wednesday .
The " top hat " cap , which works by trapping leaking oil and then sending it up to a container ship , was removed for inspection after crews detected gas , he said .
" They indicated the problem was a remotely - operated vehicle had bumped into one of the vents , " he said .
The slick has closed fishing grounds , killed hundreds of turtles and seabirds and dozens of dolphins and affected the coastlines of four US states .
Emergency workers and fishermen in Florida said the oil was now being washed ashore on Pensacola Beach .
" It 's just a line of black all the way down the beach as far as you can see in both directions .
It 's ruined , " said Pensacola fisherman Steve Anderson .
Safety rules governing flights in UK and Irish airspace have been eased following the Iceland volcano , the Civil Aviation Authority has announced .
It said it had cleared the way for more flights by lifting the 60 - mile no - fly buffer zone imposed around dense ash .
Passengers , meanwhile , have been facing more disruption as the ash forced parts of Spain , Portugal , Morocco and the Canary Islands to close their airspace .
UK airports remain open , but dozens of flights were cancelled and delayed .
A CAA spokesman said its decision to remove the buffer zone was taken with the Irish Aviation Authority after three weeks of evidence gathering .
He said : " Following in - depth and evidence based studies a larger amount of air space can now be allowed to remain open when there are very small amounts of volcanic ash at acceptable levels in the atmosphere .
Long delays
" This will reduce the impact of volcanic ash on airports , and ease some restrictions on flight operations , enabling more flights to resume . "
The CAA , the UK 's safety regulator , said its goal is to allow as much flying as safely possible .
But both Ryanair and Easyjet confirmed they had been forced to scrap flights to Europe as the problems from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano continued .
Airlines and airports urged passengers to check updated information before travelling .
London 's two main airports both reported a handful of cancellations - 19 arrivals and 17 departures at Gatwick , and seven arrivals and four departures at Heathrow .
A Gatwick spokesperson also said 20 arrivals and 25 departures out of the 688 flights scheduled on Tuesday had been delayed by the ash .
Ryanair said it had cancelled flights to and from the Canary Islands , Faro and Madrid .
Flights to and from Granada , Jerez , Malaga , Seville and Tangier have also been cancelled .
Easyjet spokesman Andrew McConnell said the " vast majority " of its flights were operating normally .
Passengers travelling to and from Madrid , Faro , Funchal , Marrakesh and Tenerife should check their flight status before travelling , he said .
British airports operator BAA has also warned of delays to transatlantic services and cancellations by airlines .
British Airways and Virgin Atlantic are among the carriers whose passengers suffered long delays on Tuesday .
Last month , ash from the Iceland volcano shut down airspace across Europe for five days .
British tourism operator TUI Travel estimated the travel chaos caused by the volcanic ash cloud had cost the group £ 90 m .
Gatwick said the impact on last month 's passenger figures was severe .
It said it handled a total of 2.05 m passengers in April , a drop of 586,000 - more than a fifth - on the same month the year before .
Teva has been equally fierce in defending its own branded turf .
In April , a judge upheld a patent on Seasonique , a Teva birth control brand , preventing a rival firm from making a generic alternative .
Since 1999 , Teva has acquired about a dozen drug ingredient and generic makers around the globe .
Now some generic and name - brand companies come to buy their drug components from Teva , giving the company insight into the competition .
Buying up generic makers in growth markets also keeps
Teva ’s competitors at bay .
“ They have been very successful at keeping out competition from India and China , ” says Tarun Khanna , a professor at the Harvard Business School and lead author of its
Teva case study .
“ I ’m not quite sure how they pulled that off .
They are just buying things up much faster . ”
AS recently as a decade ago , the pharmaceutical industry disparaged generics as “ copycat ” drugs that profit off the innovations and research of brand - name makers .
But lately , some of the biggest name - brand makers have been buying stakes in or doing distribution deals with generic makers , particularly in Brazil , India and other emerging markets .
But name - brand makers accustomed to wide margins may not be able to keep up with Teva , says Mr. Khanna .
“ If you are used to the fat margins of big pharma , it ’s hard to compete in the rough and tumble of price - cutting generics , ” he says .
Generic drugs saved the American health care system $ 734 billion between 1999 and 2008 , according to a study by IMS , the research firm .
That may be no consolation to name - brand drug makers whose profits Teva has helped erode , or to rival generic makers that lack Teva ’s resources .
But for patients , its ascent means that medicine has ultimately become much more affordable .
“ We are aggressive and not everybody likes us , ” Mr. Marth says .
“ But we are doing something every day that lowers health care costs and helps consumers . ”
MEXICO CITY  Guatemala ’s constitutional court has removed the nation ’s embattled attorney general , appearing to head off a growing political crisis in a country besieged by organized crime and corruption .
In its ruling on Thursday , the court did not directly address accusations that Attorney General Conrado Reyes had links to organized crime but said the ruling was necessary so that “ illegal groups ” could not “ harm the constitutional process ” that led to his selection .
Since he was appointed attorney general on May 25 , Mr. Reyes had faced questions over his past .
On Monday , the head of a United Nations panel charged with fighting corruption and impunity in Guatemala resigned in frustration , citing the appointment of Mr. Reyes , who he said had links to drug traffickers and illegal adoption rings .
Mr. Reyes has denied the charges but said Thursday that he would abide by the court ’s ruling .
President Álvaro Colom , who appointed Mr. Reyes and has been under pressure to find a way to remove him , said he was “ satisfied ” with the ruling .
By James Kwak
Patrick McGeehan at the New York Times recently wrote about a New York Fed study finding that studying economics makes you a Republican .
The headline conclusion is that the more economics classes you take , the more likely you are to be a Republican .
Majoring in economics or business is also more likely to make you a Republican .
( See Table 2 in the original paper . )
The study is based on thousands of observations of undergraduates at four large universities over three decades , so it is focused on undergraduate - level economics .
Studying economics also affects your position on several public policy issues .
Of seven issues , economics courses were significantly associated with the five following positions ( Table 6 ) :
Tariffs are bad .
Trade deficits are not so bad .
The government should not cap oil prices in response to a supply shock .
Raising the minimum wage increase unemployment for low - wage workers .
Income distribution should not be more equal .
These are all pro-free market , anti-government intervention positions .
What I thought was particularly interesting , however , was that on some issues people who study undergraduate economics are more doctrinaire free marketers than professional economists .
Table 5 compares the undergraduates responses to those of a survey of people with a Ph.D. in economics .
The Ph.D. economists were more likely than economics majors to hold the textbook position on tariffs or the minimum wage .
However , they were also more likely than economics majors ( or , frankly , any majors ) to think that income inequality should be reduced and that government spending should not be reduced , and they were somewhat less worried about federal budget deficits .
This is something I ’ve mentioned in passing often .
I think that basic economics , the way it is taught today , tends to give people reflexive pro-free market , anti-government positions — positions that are not held by people with a deeper exposure to economic thinking .
When your understanding of government finances is based on reading the newspaper , it ’s somewhat eye - opening to come to college and learn that free markets lead to maximum societal welfare and taxes impose a deadweight loss on society — the pictures are so simple and compelling .
That ’s why a little bit of economics makes you more likely to be a Republican .
But when you learn more about principal - agent problems , information asymmetries , and so on , you learn that those simple pictures are simplistic to the point of being misleading .
That ’s why Joseph Stiglitz argues in Freefall that understanding economics is crucial to understanding why free markets often lead to suboptimal outcomes .
The problem is n’t knowledge per se ; it ’s a little bit of knowledge .
Ceremonies and celebrations took place in Portsmouth last week as the Royal Navy 's second billion - pound - plus Type 45 destroyer , HMS Dauntless , was formally commissioned into the Service .
Both Dauntless and her predecessor HMS Daring remain almost totally unarmed at the moment , following test failures which have meant that their primary armament cannot be accepted into service .
Sailors demonstrate some of the most potent weapons currently carried by HMS Dauntless .
Dauntless ' commanding officer , Captain Richard Powell , had this to say :
This is a great day for the Royal Navy and particularly for the crew who are all delighted to serve in this fantastic ship .
Sailing past the Round Tower and into the Naval Base onboard HMS Dauntless was one of the proudest moments of my career and I am sure that the ship will continue to bring pride to the Royal Navy throughout her lifetime .
The Type 45 Destroyers will form the backbone of the Royal Navy of the future .
The ships are hugely versatile and they utilise cutting - edge technology to provide a first - class air defence capability ...
Unfortunately Captain Powell 's ship does not as yet provide any significant air defence capability .
The main reason for having a Type 45 destroyer is in order to get the benefit of its Sea Viper missile system , composed of the partly - British * Sampson fire - control radar and PAAMS weaponry , which fires French - made Aster missiles at airborne targets .
Sea Viper is supposed to be able to defend against even the most dangerous aerial threats , such as the various widely - feared supersonic shipkiller missiles developed in Russia and since exported to China and India .
The Sampson radar is mounted at the destroyer 's masthead , allowing it to see as far over the horizon as is feasible from a surface ship - perhaps offering several tens of seconds ' warning of an inbound supersonic sea-skimmer **.
The Aster missiles of PAAMS are supposed to be able to launch exceptionally quickly , tip over extremely fast and accelerate to better than Mach 4 within 10 seconds .
As recently as five years ago it was expected that the first Type 45 would be ready for frontline duty in 2007 : that date subsequently slipped back to later this year , pushed by difficulties in development of Sea Viper .
However the " final " test of Sea Viper last December was a failure , meaning that it had failed in tests two out of four times , and in fact HMSs Daring and Dauntless remain almost unarmed .
All they have at the moment is a 4.5 " gun turret , mainly useful for bombarding coastal targets , and a pair of light 30 mm guns suitable for shooting up pirate dhows and the like .
Details on the Sea Viper test failure and way ahead have been scant , but The Register has made persistent enquiries over the last few months .
An MoD spokesperson has now supplied us with this statement :
Production weaknesses identified in some batches of Aster missile have been corrected through minor re-design work and a programme of further test firings is now underway to demonstrate that the problems have been rectified .
The MoD says it still expects to accept HMS Daring complete with Sea Viper into service at the current planned date , November this year , once ongoing test firings confirm that the Aster fix has been successful .
Officials declined to answer our other question :
Why is the MoD so confident that Sea Viper / Aster can defeat supersonic threats , as no test against a supersonic target has ever been announced ?
Given the official silence on this , it seems likely that the first time anyone finds out whether Sea Viper really can shoot down supersonic threats will be the first time a Type 45 finds itself under attack by BrahMos or Sunburn missiles .
One former Royal Navy destroyer captain , discussing such a hypothetical engagement by a Type 45 in future ( with its highly uncertain outcome ) has commented to The Reg that " it would be rather unwise to put yourself in a situation like that , would n't it ? "
With two hundred sailors ' lives and more than a billion pounds of taxpayers ' money at stake , you have to agree with him .
But if you are n't going to put the Type 45s in the way of supersonic missiles , you really have to wonder why you 'd have them at all . ®

One also notes that the ship 's command system runs Windows 2000 .
Once again , hugely expensive " European / UK " equipment turns out to be full of American technology .
** Though critics point out that its rotating scanners will tend to make it slower to recognise a threat .
Other major navies use fixed arrays pointing in all directions for constant 360 - degree coverage , though to be fair these are lower - mounted and thus unable to see as far as Sampson .
It took a few weeks , but actress Lindsay Lohan found herself in trouble again — this time over the alcohol - detection bracelet a judge ordered her to wear .
According to sources , the device ’s alarm sounded Sunday , the night Lohan was attending the MTV Movie Awards .
It ’s unclear why the device went off .
Typically , the alarm sounds when the bracelet is tampered with or if the person wearing it consumes alcohol .
But it was enough for a Beverly Hills judge to haul prosecutors and Lohan ’s attorneys into court Wednesday afternoon for a closed session .
Judge Marsha Revel issued an arrest warrant for Lohan , 23 .
To avoid being detained , Lohan posted $ 200,000 bail .
Revel did not provide any specifics other than to say Lohan violated a court order not to consume alcohol and to wear an alcohol - detection device .

According to sources close to the case , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the case was ongoing , the alcohol - monitoring device on Lohan ’s ankle sent a report indicating the presence of alcohol late Sunday or early Monday after the MTV Movie Awards .
Lohan attended the awards and an after - party , wearing pants to cover the device .
Her attorney , Shawn Chapman Holley , said in a statement that the monitoring device detected a small amount of alcohol , but that she could not verify its accuracy .
In court , however , the judge did not specify how Lohan violated the court order issued May 24 other than to say it was after she received an adverse report from the alcohol - detection ankle bracelet .
Lohan was not present in court .
She issued several denials on her Twitter account that she had done anything wrong , and said the bracelet , known as a SCRAM , or Secure Continuous Remote Alcohol Monitor , should have detected nothing .

“ My SCRAM was n’t set off —
It ’s physically impossible considering I ’ve ( done ) nothing for it to go off .
All of these false ( reports ) are absolutely wrong . ”
The ankle monitor issues an alert when it is tampered with or when the person wearing it drinks alcohol .
The SCRAM device checks for traces of alcohol in the air above the user ’s skin .
The device was fitted on Lohan ’s ankle at the Beverly Hills courthouse .
The judge ordered the device May 24 after Lohan the week before failed to show up for a mandatory progress review hearing on her probation .
Revel also ordered that Lohan weekly undergo random drug tests in Los Angeles and attend alcohol education classes .
Lohan claimed that she was stuck in Cannes , France , after her passport was stolen .

Of all the skillful writings of Thanissaro Bhikkhu , I think “ The Paradox of Becoming ” is probably his greatest , his magnum opus , though his “ Wings to Awakening ” certainly ranks right at the top as well .
( see : Wings to Awakening - An Anthology from the Pali Canon )
In this wonderful treatise , Thanissaro Bhikkhu has brings together all the Buddha ’s teachings in the Pali canon that address the issue of becoming — the process that perpetuates conditioned being .
The “ Paradox of Becoming ” shows , in the Buddha ’s own words , how to find the limitless freedom that comes unbinding and untangling ourselves from that which arises and falls , begins and ends , comes and goes , lives and dies .
This is a major scholarly work — some 163 pages — so I ’m only going to introduce it here , and then give a link for downloading a PDF of the full article .
Far from being dry and theoretical , I found this in - depth study to be one that I have returned to again and again when I have had questions about my meditation practice or found myself stuck on some important concept I want to understand .
For the student who really wants to dig deeper into the Buddha ’s teaching in order to practice more skillfully , “ The Paradox of Becoming ” is a treasure trove .
Here ’s in the introduction , from the Preface :
The topic of becoming , although it features one major paradox , contains other paradoxes as well .
Not the least of these is the fact that , although becoming is one of the most important concepts in the Buddha ’s teachings , there is no full ‐scale treatment of it in the English language .
This book is an attempt to fill that lack .
The importance of becoming is evident from the role it plays in the Four Noble Truths , particularly in the second : Suffering and stress are caused by any form of craving that leads to becoming .
Thus the end of suffering must involve the end of becoming .
The central paradox of becoming is also evident in the second Noble Truth , where one of the three forms of craving leading to becoming is craving for non ‐becoming — the ending of what has come to be .
This poses a practical challenge for any attempt to put an end to becoming .
Many writers have tried to resolve this paradox by defining non ‐becoming in such a way that the desire for Unbinding ( nibbana ) would not fall into that category .
However , the Buddha himself taught a strategic resolution to this paradox , in which the fourth Noble Truth — the path to the end of suffering — involves creating a type of becoming where the mind is so steady and alert that it can simply allow what has come into being to pass away of its own accord , thus avoiding the twin dangers of craving for becoming or for non‐becoming .﻿
My first inkling that the resolution of the paradox of becoming was strategic — and paradoxical itself — rather than simply linguistic came from reading the following passage in The Autobiography of Phra Ajaan Lee .
In this passage , Ajaan Lee is teaching meditation to a senior scholarly monk in Bangkok : One day the Somdet said [ to Ajaan Lee ] , … “ There ’s one thing I ’m still doubtful about .
To make the mind still and bring it down to its basic resting level ( bhavanga ) :
Is n’t this the essence of becoming and birth ? “
“ That ’s what concentration is , “ I told him , “ becoming and birth . ”
“ But the Dhamma we ’re taught to practice is for the sake of doing away with becoming and birth .
So what are we doing giving rise to more becoming and birth ? “
“ If you do n’t make the mind take on becoming , it wo n’t give rise to knowledge , because knowledge has to come from becoming if it ’s going to do away with becoming . ”
This book is essentially an attempt to explore in detail the ways in which the Buddha ’s own resolution of the paradox of becoming employs the very same strategy . ﻿
Here is the link for downloading the PDF :
The Paradox of Becoming
~♥~
Look at this world :
Beings , afflicted with thick ignorance ,
are unreleased
from delight in what has come to be .
All levels of becoming ,
anywhere ,
in any way ,
are inconstant , stressful , subject to change .
Seeing this — as it has come to be —
with right discernment ,
one abandons craving for becoming ,
without delighting in non ‐becoming .
From the total ending of craving
comes dispassion & cessation without remainder :
Unbinding .
For the monk unbound ,
through lack of clinging / sustenance ,
there is no renewed becoming .
He has conquered Mara ,
won the battle ,
gone beyond all becomings —
Such . — Ud 3:10 ﻿

The State Will Always Self - Justify
Rioting in Toronto involving anarchists resisting the G - 20 Summit has been condemned by many .
The real problem is that there are n’t currently enough anarchists to run the G - 20 out of business for good .
Some have said that the actions taken by black bloc protestors — donning masks and black clothing to smash windows and burn police vehicles — will be used by the state to justify the massive security apparatus surrounding the summit .
But the state will always find a reason to act as they do — whether it is assaulting peaceful protesters or filling streets with poison gas to deter those who fight back .
Whenever a non-resistant individual is attacked with a mobile torture device called a Taser , whenever a paramilitary raid on someone suspected of selling drugs results in death , whenever a city block is destroyed by government bombs , there will be people saying it was the right thing to do .
To move forward , those who value freedom should n’t encourage state - apologism .
Still , action should be strategically calculated .
The message sent by destruction needs to be kept in mind , and by message I do n’t mean a communiqué imitating poorly - translated foreign works .
Deeds will always be contextualized by words , so if anarchists do well at both , that will reduce the effectiveness of authoritarians ’ efforts to categorize actions as evil .
It should n’t be surprising that the image of masked , black - clad figures smashing things scares and angers people who do not believe in the reasons behind the destruction .
To encourage a productive response to anarchist action , anarchist ideas need to be made familiar .
Broken glass ( even if some belongs to people who did n’t deserve it ) and burning symbols of authority should not be scarier than fighter jets and assemblies of the most successful criminal gangs in the world .
It is the latter that destroys countless irreplaceable individual lives to further the interests of the powerful .
In Toronto , representatives of the world ’s most powerful governments met to discuss how they would dominate world economic affairs , and political dominance always means deprivation and death for those who get in the way .
Increasing the costs of such bloody business with some broken glass and burning police cars is simply a response to the crimes of politics .
CTA strikes again !
The company known for its unorthodox ( and rather silly ) game controllers is back with a plastic drawbar / foot pedal combo that is supposed to be " very similar to a rowing machine you would find at the gym , " although we highly doubt it .
Designed for games like Wii Sports Resort and Jillian Michaels ' Angry Sports Resort , this is something that would probably only enter your home as an ill - considered Christmas gift before gathering dust in the back of a closet , alongside your Bowling Ball and Football controllers .
But we must admit , even if the company 's products are dubious , its infomercials are an endless source of entertainment .
See for yourself after the break .
As for the rowing machine , it 's up for pre-order now at Amazon , as if you care .

Abstract
The goal of this project is to collect , preserve , and present source code , design documents , and other materials concerning the original LISP I /1.5 system , and as many of its follow - ons as possible .
LISP was one of the earliest high - level programming languages and introduced many ideas such as garbage collection , recursive functions , symbolic expressions , and dynamic type - checking ; it is still in use .
This is a project of the Computer History Museum 's Software Preservation Group .
The editor appreciates comments , suggestions , and donations of additional materials .
Contents
This project is dedicated to Professor Doctor Herbert Stoyan , who has dedicated many years to tracing the development of Lisp from its birth in John McCarthy 's project at M.I.T. through its world - wide diaspora , and who very generously donated his Lisp archives to the Computer History Museum : the Herbert Stoyan Collection on LISP Programming , Lot Number X5687.2010 .
Stoyan 's collection may be searched via the finding aid or the Museum 's catalog .

Dark matter and dark energy are two of the mostmind - boggling ingredients in the universe .
Ever since these concepts were firstproposed , some astronomers have worked feverishly to figure out what each thingis , while other astronomers have tried to prove they do n't exist , in hopes ofrestoring the universe to the more understandable place many would like it tobe .
A new look at the data from one of the telescopes used toestablish the existence of this strange stuff is causing some scientists toquestion whether they really exist at all .
Yet other experts are holding firmto the idea that , whether we like it or not , the " dark side " of theuniverse is here to stay .
Dark matter is a proposed form of matter that could make up22 percent of the universe 's mass - energy budget , vastly outweighing all thenormal matter , like stars and galaxies .
Astronomers can't observe dark matter directly , but they think it 's there because of the gravitational pull it seems to exerton everything else .
Without dark matter , the thinking goes , galaxies would flyapart .
As if that were n't weird enough , scientists think another 74 percent of the mass - energy budget could be made of some strange quantity calleddarkenergy .
This force is thought to be responsible for the accelerating paceof the expansion of the universe .
( For those keeping track , that would leaveonly a measly 4 percent of the universe composed of normal matter . )
Some cosmic background
One of the prime ways researchers tally how much thesecomponents contribute to the overall makeup of the universe is by measuring adim glow of light pervading space that is thought to be left over from the BigBang .
The most detailed measurements yet taken of this radiation , which iscalled the cosmicmicrowave background ( CMB ) , come from a spacecraft dubbed the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) .
" It 's such an important thing — the microwavebackground , " said astrophysicist Tom Shanks of Durham University inEngland .
" All the results in dark energy and dark matter in cosmology hangon it , and that ? s why I 'm interested in checking the results . "
Recently Shanks and his graduate student Utane Sawangwitwent back to examine the WMAP data and used a different method to calibrate howmuch smoothing , or blurring , the telescope was causing to its images .
Thissmoothing is an expected affect , akin to the way Earth 's atmosphere blursstars ' light so they twinkle .
Instead of using Jupiter as a calibration source , the waythe WMAP team did , Shanks and Sawangwit used distant astronomical objects inthe WMAP data itself that were emitting radio light .
" When we checked radio sources in the WMAP background , we found more smoothing than the WMAP team expected , " Shanks toldSPACE.com .
" That would have big implications for cosmology if we wereproven right . "
If this smoothing error is larger than thought , it couldindicate that fluctuations measured in the intensity of the CMB radiation areactually smaller than they originally appeared .
The size of these fluctuationsis a key parameter used to support the existence of dark matter and darkenergy .
With smaller ripples , there would be no need to invokeexotic concepts like dark matter and dark energy to explain the CMB observations , Shanks said .
The researchers will report their findings in an upcoming issue ofthe journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society .
Others not so sure
Yet other astronomers , particularly those who first analyzedthe WMAP results , remain unconvinced .
" The WMAP team has carried out extensive checks and weunequivocally stand by our results , " said WMAP principal investigatorCharles Bennett of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , Md .
The WMAP researchers take issue with Sawangwit and Shanks 'use of dim , far - away radio sources to calculate the telescope 's smoothingerror .
" These are weak sources , so many of them must beaveraged together to obtain useful measurements .
None of them move with respectto the CMB , " said WMAP team member Mark Halpern of the University of British Columbia .
" This method is inferior to our main approach . "
Plus , Halpern said he and his colleagues had identified anerror the other team made in failing to account for the confusing contributionof the CMB ripples themselves .
" We can obtain the Shanks result by omitting the stepthat properly accounts for the background confusion , but this step isnecessary , " Bennett explained .
Back in this corner ?
Yet Shanks said he 's aware of these objections and stands byhis calculations .
" We do n't think that 's an issue , " he said .
Ultimately , Shanks hopes future measurements of themicrowave background radiation from new telescopes will help clear up theissue .
The European Space Agency 's Planckspacecraft , launched into orbit in 2009 , is currently taking new , even moredetailed observations of the CMB .
" I 'm very interested to see what Planck gets in termsof its results , " Shanks said .
" And of course we will be there to tryand keep everybody as honest as possible .
We 're hoping we can use our methodsin the same way to check their beam profile that they ultimately come upwith . "
For those who thought the end of the Bush Administration spelled doomsday for the neoconservative movement , think again .
According to a May report ( pdf ) from the Brookings Institution , a Washington , DC think tank , neoconservatives associated with prominent figures like former Assistant Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz , Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol and pundit Richard Perle are still broadly active , despite policy failures associated with the 2003 invasion of Iraq .

Brookings Institution senior fellow Justin Vaisse , author of Neoconservatism : A Biography of a Movement , argues that because neocons never had the degree of influence that opponents credited them with , and also because of a general unawareness of their history , observers donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t fully understand the trajectory of the neoconservative movement that began long before the Iraq invasion and one continues today .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ Neoconservatism remains , to this day , a distinct and very significant voice of the Washington establishment , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Vaisse insists .
In May he published the report Why Neoconservativism Still Matters .
Stephen Walt , professor of international affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-author of The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , says that the most obvious place the neocons are still influential is in U.S. policy toward Iran , where the Obama administration is Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ continuing the Bush administrationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s basic approach , albeit with a Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœkinder , gentlerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ face .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
WaltÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s assessment squares with a number of recent op - eds in the pages of the Wall Street Journal by Richard Perle , Abram Shulsky , Douglas Feith and Danielle Pletka , the latter of whom also testified on Iran before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs earlier this month .
Walt calls attention to two major reports produced by the Bipartisan Policy Center on Iran , where neoconservative Michael Makovsky was staff director for the studies and Dennis Ross — whose role Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ in the administration remains something of a mystery , ” according to Walt — was directly involved .
The studies , Walt says , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ are quite hawkishÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and promote the use of force against Iran if diplomacy does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t work .
Walt also points out that Ross has argued that diplomacy is necessary in part to win international support for military action later .
ADVERTISEMENT
Following the neocon lead , says Walt , the Obama administrationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s insistence Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ that Iran give up its enrichment capability is simply a non-starter , and keeps us on the same road as BushÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s policy did . ”
Benjamin Balint , a fellow at the Hudson Institute and author of Running Commentary : The Contentious Magazine that Transformed the Jewish Left into the Neoconservative Right , says that even despite their overly rosy predictions surrounding Iraq , neoconservatives have remained steadfast .
They ’ve offered Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å “ not a heart - searching mea culpa , not a re-examination of first principles , but very nearly the opposite , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Balint says .
ADVERTISEMENT
In part , Brooking ’s Vaisse suggests , the continued influence of the neocons has to do with the organizing principles of the movement and the persistent concerns of U.S. foreign policymakers even under the Obama administration .
Among issues of importance during the Bush administration that have not subsided in the Obama years include : the role the U.S. plays in the world ; the U.S. as the sole superpower ; a tendency toward unilateralism ( whether intentional or by default ) ; the question of militarism ; and the exportation of democracy .
These issues provide an opening for neocons to assert their leverage .
ADVERTISEMENT
The three generations of currently - operating neoconservatives show Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ their substantial presence and political dynamism in Washington , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â making it Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ difficult to imagine that they will not play a significant role in the future of American foreign policy , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â according to Vaisse .
Numerous prominent neocons still active
The report indicates that there is still an active and influential older generation of neoconservatives , such as Norman Podhoretz , Elliott Abrams , Joshua Muravchik , Richard Perle , Paul Wolfowitz and James Woolsey .
The middle generation includes The Weekly Standard publisher Bill Kristol , Carnegie Endowment for International Peace scholar Robert Kagan , New York Times columnist David Brooks and AEI scholars Danielle Pletka , and Tom Donnelly .
Former AEI scholar David Frum is also counted among their ranks .

Vaisse says that there is also a younger group in their 40s , 30s and 20s Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ whose formative experience is not the Cold War , but the 1990s and , more to the point , 9/11 and the Bush administrationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s response .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
They include Max Boot , Dan Senor , Jamie Fly , Rachel Hoff , Abe Greenwald and Daniel Halper .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ In this sense , neoconservatism is regenerating itself and keeping a balanced age pyramid , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â writes Vaisse .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ After all , its idealistic , moralistic and patriotic appeal may be better suited to attract young thinkers than the prudent and reasonable calculations of realism .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
But Vaisse argues that itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not just the individuals who make the neoconservative movement .
Just as important — perhaps more so — are the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ institutions that support them and the publications that relay their views and shape the public debate , Ã¢â‚¬Â  and Vaisse offers the assessment that in this respect , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ neoconservatives are well positioned .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Citing the American Enterprise Institute , the Hudson Institute , Project for a New American Century , Commentary , and The Weekly Standard , Vaisse writes Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ These younger neoconservatives have generally received their first internships and jobs , and published their first articles in the old network of friendly think tanks and publications built by the older generation of neoconservatives .
Ã¢â‚¬Â

One of the more recent and robust institutions , according to the report , is the Foreign Policy Initiative ( FPI ) , created in the spring of 2009 .
Operating under the direction of Bill Kristol , Robert Kagan and Dan Senor , FPI is Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ animated by young operativesÃ¢â‚ ¬Â and according to Vaisse Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ is already making its mark on the Afghanistan and human rights debates , notably by sending public letters signed by neocons and non-neocons alike , Ã¢â‚ ¬
Â  a technique that is a hallmark of neocon action .
Financial support for these institutions , which comes from various conservative donors and foundations , such as the Scaife family , Bradley , Earhart , Castle Rock , and Smith Richardson foundations , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ shows no sign of abating , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â according to Vaisse .
Sustained financial , institutional and publication support has provided the platform necessary for neoconservatives to have influence long after they were broadly thought to have been run out of the White House .
The report refers to the 2007 Iraq troop surge as a specific , significant , recent development where neocons have had tremendous influence .
It was partly devised by Fred Kagan , senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , who is also an influential voice on the current counterinsurgency debates .
He was , for example , part of the team of civilian experts who advised General McChrystal on his Afghanistan review in July 2009 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Perhaps more important than the institutions and financial support is the modus operandi of the neoconservatives , according to Janine Wedel , professor in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University and author of Shadow Elite .
In particular , a small subset of neocons , a Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ neocon core , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â has been working together for more than 30 years Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ to remake American foreign policy according to their own vision .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
According to Wedel , this is done through the neocons ’ creation of alternative versions of official information and their ability to market those accounts as the more credible ones to audiences in the media , government and other political circles .
The neocons are able to achieve their goals , according to Wedel , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ by undermining the rules and standard processes of the government they supposedly serve and supplanting them with their own , all the while making public decisions backed by the power and resources of the state .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Because their undermining of these processes often goes undetected , it is likely many remain in place under the Obama administration .
While the report points out that ObamaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s foreign policy team is composed of liberals and realists Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ whose positions are far from the neocons , Ã¢â‚ ¬Â Vaisse also recognizes that Ã¢â‚ ¬ Å“ opposition is not total .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
On occasion , neoconservatives coordinate with liberal groups on human rights issues , or engage in conversations with senior administration officials , but they Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ lined up behind the administrationÃ¢â‚ ¬Â on the war effort in Afghanistan — this time against the liberal left and some realists in both parties , according to the report .
Earlier this month , when Egypt announced it was renewing its long - standing emergency law , which has been used as the basis for many of its human rights violations , a letter was sent to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by the Carnegie EndowmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Working Group on Egypt .
This group was composed of think tank scholars of various colors but was heavily populated with neoconservatives like Elliott Abrams , Robert Kagan and Ellen Bork .
The letter called on Clinton to use U.S. leverage as EgyptÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s major donor to Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ encourage them along a path toward reform .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â
The same day , the State Department released a statement from Secretary Clinton echoing the letter ’s sentiments .
ADVERTISEMENT
Vaisse also points out that just as important as the neocons ’ persistence and coordination with non-neocons is the fact that American foreign policy is cyclical and that frustration with the Obama administrationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ realist and pragmaticÃ¢â‚ ¬Â approach will Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ inevitably create a more congenial environment for the neocons .

There ’s More Marijuana Strain Names Out There Every Day
I used to not care what strains I smoked , so long as they were the super chronic .
‘ Call it what you want , I just want to get baked , ’ is what I would always say to people .
However , as dispensaries become more widespread , and people continue to get seeds from seed banks rather than get their strains from friends , consuming marijuana with a name is becoming more and more common place .
I remember when I smoked my first marijuana that had a name attached to it , ‘ The Project . ’
It was a pure sativa strain that originated in Hawaii once upon a time ( or so the folklore went , you never could be too sure back then ! ) .
A family friend was a top grower in my area , and he dedicated a small part of his garden to this new strain that he had recently acquired .
He always referred to it as his ‘ project . ’
Whatever the original name was back in Hawaii became totally irrelevant , because me and my friends always called it ‘ The Project . ’
The weed was so good that the name stuck , and I still get asked about once every two days if I can still get ‘ The Project . ’
Some strain names are offending people .
Colorado attorney Warren Edson was referred to in a Wall Street Journal article saying that “ he would like to throttle the anonymous marijuana breeder who named a potent strain of weed ‘ Green Crack . ’
He ’s not too fond , either , of those breeders who have given strains names like ‘ Jack the Ripper , ’ ‘ White Widow , ’ ‘ AK - 47 ’ and ‘ Trainwreck . ’ ”
According to the article , Mr. Edson is ‘ in the vanguard of an aggressive movement to make pot respectable–but decades of stoner culture keep dragging him down . ’
When I read complaints about marijuana strain names being too violent in nature , I always think about how people that are new to the marijuana culture do n’t realize the evolution in strain names .
Back in the day , most marijuana consumers called high grade marijuana ‘ kill bud . ’
I know hundreds of middle aged stoners here in Oregon that ONLY call high grade marijuana ‘ kill bud . ’
I could lay out 30 different strains in front of them , all of them top notch nugs yet completely different in origin , and they would all be ‘ kill bud ’ according to these folks .
It makes me laugh every time they say it , but I fully respect their perspective on things .
It is out of this slang that most new strains got their name .
What is more ‘ killer ’ than an ‘ AK - 47 , ’ or ‘ trainwreck , ’ or ‘ Jack the Ripper ? ’
The names are descriptive slang for an already established slang term for high grade marijuana .
It ’s just a theory of mine , but it makes sense to me .
How do TWB readers feel ?
I personally smoke some ‘ Jack the Ripper ’ and ‘ Trainwreck ’ every single day .
I ’ll tell you what , I LIKE THEM BOTH VERY MUCH !
I do n’t see anything wrong with the names Mr. Edson mentioned , as long as the marijuana is top notch .
In fact , I could n’t find anyone who was offended .
One guy on FB told me , ‘ Only narcs and yuppies would try to be classy stoners .
Real stoners have grown up with those names throughout their entire stoner evolution , and the only thing they care about is the bite in the bong hit they take . ’
I agree with you TC !
Since when did pot need to be fancy for people to enjoy it ?
Do n’t get me wrong , if people want to be politically correct then by all means , refer to your ‘ fill in the blank with marijuana term ’ any way you like .
Just remember that being a part of the marijuana culture , by definition , is politically incorrect .
So realize that you might not always get people to follow what you ’re puttin ’ out .
One of my hero ’s , Colorado attorney put it best .
“ Part of normalizing this is putting it in peoples ’ faces and saying , ‘ You ’ll get used to it … Maybe we could come up with holistic names that reflect the wellness idea ?
Like Harmony … I can tell you , ‘ Trainwreck ’ is n’t a great name for a medicine …
Or maybe it is I ’ve heard 75 - year - old grandmas say , ‘ I need more Trainwreck . ’ ” LOL .

I always joke with my friends that if there was a strain out there that made you crap your pants , like the ‘ Brown Bomber ’ off of the movie ‘ Grandmas Boy , ’ people in Oregon would smoke it .
As long as it was the super chronic , we would just sit on the toilet and ride the higher high .
I know that ’s a vivid illustration that you probably did n’t need , but it highlights the point of this article ; strain names do n’t really matter , it ’s the marijuana itself that counts .
I remember throughout the 90’s in my part of Oregon , if you had something that had a name , it better be top notch nugs or do n’t even bother .
If I had a dollar for every time someone had the G - 13 or AK - 47 , I would be richer than Scrooge McDuck .
On the flip side — if I had a dollar for every time it actually WAS the G - 13 or AK - 47 , I ’d still be too broke to buy a candy bar , if that tells you anything .
Whenever I helped out friends , I would always be as straight up as possible …’ you look at it , and make the educated decision for yourself . ’
The only time that I would pass along a name is if it came from some weird guy , and the nickname I had for him stuck with the product itself – such as the ‘ Steady Eddy . ’
The first step to great food is great knife skills .

What exactly is frenching ?
Well , when applied to meat , it 's all about appearances .
Stripping meat away from bones in order to give roasts and chops a more attractive presentation does n't really do much for its texture or flavor , but it sure makes it look pretty on the plate .
Think of it as a necktie for your roast .
Once you know a few of the tricks , the process itself is really quite simple , and can just as easily be applied to pork , venison , or beef .
In addition to the illustrated guide demonstrating each step , here are a few tips on how to shop for lamb racks this season .
Shopping Tips
Look for whole racks that are composed of at least eight rib sections .
Even if you plan on cooking the lamb in smaller portions , you 'll get more even portion sizes if you cut it yourself at home .
Even if you plan on cooking the lamb in smaller portions , you 'll get more even portion sizes if you cut it yourself at home .
Avoid pre-marinated or " herb - rubbed " vacuum - sealed lamb racks .
The seasoning often overwhelms the flavor of the meat .
Personally , I want my lamb to taste of lamb , not whatever Trader Joe ( if that 's even his real name ) thinks it should taste like .
You can always add herbs and seasonings yourself for a more subtle , fresher flavor .

You can always add herbs and seasonings yourself for a more subtle , fresher flavor .
Unless a recipe specifically calls for " loin chops , " you should be looking for " rib chops , " the ones with the long rib bone and single eye of meat , the equivalent of a rib - eye steak from a cow .
Loin chops come from further back on the animal and include part of both the loin , and the tenderloin , just like a Porterhouse or T - bone beef steak .
It 's cooking qualities are different , and thus will not substitute well in most rib chop recipes .

Frozen lamb is OK , as long as it's frozen in an air - tight vacuum - sealed bag and contains no ingredients besides lamb .
Allow the lamb to thaw complerely overnight in the fridge before using .
American vs. New Zealand / Australian
Political and environmental reasons aside , it 's largely a matter of personal taste .
American lamb , which retails at between $ 15 to 25 per pound is generally raised on a grain - based diet and slaughtered at 134 pounds of weight per animal .
The resultant cuts are large and well - marbled , but will have a mild , almost beef - like flavor .
In fact , cut away all the fat , and even an expert would be hard pressed to tell what animal it came from .
Some people refer to American lamb as " delicate " or " spring - like . "
I refer to it mostly as " meh . "
That said , there are a few great grass - fed American lamb farms that do produce some stunningly flavorful lamb , such as Jamison Farm in Latrobe , Pennsylvania , or Elysian Fields Farm in Waynesburg , Pennsylvania ( where Thomas Keller , among many other chefs , gets his lamb ) .
The Jamison farm can be ordered online .
New Zealand / Australian lamb , which is much cheaper , generally retailing for around $ 10 to 20 per pound is raised on the islands ' abundant grass .
Without grain to fatten it up , the meat tends to be a bit leaner , but the intense flavor imparted by the grass - based diet more than compensates for this loss — provided you do n't overcook the meat and dry it out .
Though slaughtered when only 84 pounds , what they lack in size , they make up for with deep , gamey flavor .
Most national chains , including Trader Joe 's and Whole Foods carry New Zealand lamb , but ask your butcher to make sure .
Now that you know what kind of lamb to buy , let 's get cutting .
Step 1 : Removing the Shoulder Blade
Sometimes , on large racks , the shoulder blade will be left intact .
Remove this bone with by lifting with your non-knife hand and cutting underneath it using a butcher 's knife or a paring knife .
Save bone for stock or pets if desired .
Step 2 : Removing Fat and Connective Tissue
Trim away the thick layer of fat covering the ribs by making a small incision where the shoulder rib was removed at the rib - tip end , and slowly peel away the layer with your non -knife hand .
The action is more pulling and separating than slicing .
Step 3 : Removing Fat and Connective Tissue
Continue peeling away the fat layer , using a series of small , short strokes to separate the fat , which should come of in a large swath , allowing your non-knife hand to do most of the work .
The fat should separate along natural fault lines , leaving a thin 1/8th - inch to 1/4th - inch layer next to the meat .
This will help flavor the meat and prevent its surface from drying out as it cooks .
Discard excess fat ( or save for rendering or sausage - making , if you are so inclined ) .
Step 4 : Fine - Trimming of Fat
If the fat remains too thick in some areas , hold your knife parallel to the meat and carefully shave off excess until an even layer remains .
Step 5 : Trimming Tendon
There is often a large tendon running right underneath the loin .
Trim this tendon off , along with some additional fat .
At this stage , your lamb rack is ready to cook .
However , if you 'd like to go the extra step for presentation and French the bones ( strip the ends of excess meat ) , start by flipping the rack over so that the ribs are exposed .
Step 6 : Scoring Membrane
Using the tip of your knife , score the membrane along the center of each bone by placing the tip of your knife against he bone starting about an inch and a half away from the cut end of the bones , and pulling your knife slowly and firmly down the bone to its end .
Your bone should trace a path right down the center of each bone , not in between the bones .
Step 7 : Peeling Membrane
Using a dish towel to grip the slippery fat , pull fat and membrane away from between each rib slowly and firmly .
It should pull cleanly away from the bones .
Continue working away from the bones until about two inches are exposed ( more or less , depending on the size of the lamb and personal preference ) .
Step 8 : Trimming Fat and Membrane
Flip the rack over and use your knife to cut away the flap of fat and membrane .
Discard excess fat , or render if desired ( rendered lamb fat is great for roasting potatoes or playing practical jokes on your wife ) .
Step 9 : Cleaning Bones
If you 're really lucky , the fat and membrane will have come cleanly off the bones , leaving them bare and pearly white .
Most of the time , little bits of meat and fat will remain stuck to the bone , which all but the most OCD will not mind .
I consider myself amongst the most OCD , so I use the butt - end of my boning knife , next to the tang , to scrape every last scrap of connective tissue off the bones .
Step 10 : Cutting Chops
To divide rack into smaller racks or individual chops , stand it on end , and starting from the exposed rib end , cut between ribs with smooth , single strokes .
If you do n't get through in one stroke , pick up your knife , place it back in the seam , and pull it again — do not saw back and forth .
You 'll end up with jagged edges .
Step 11 : Finished
A Frenched lamb rack and four double - cut chops , ready for roasting or grilling .
Now was n't that much easier than you thought it'd be ?
Want to make it even easier ?
Next time , ask your butcher to do it for you .

Rand Paul ends ban on support from pro-TARP senators
During the GOP primary for U.S. Senate in Kentucky , way back in August 2009 , Rand Paul pledged to take no money from senators who backed the Troubled Asset Relief Program .
It was tough for his opponent , Trey Grayson , to meet him on that pledge , because Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky . ) backed TARP and supported Grayson .
But Paul 's Democratic opponent , Attorney General Jack Conway , is accusing him of breaking the pledge with an upcoming June 24 D.C. fundraiser .
Evidence for the breaking - the - pledge claim ( via the muckraking blog Barefoot and Progressive ) : the error you get when searching for it .
Paul campaign manager Jesse Benton confirmed that the pledge is no longer operative , and explained that it was meant for the primary , when Paul was drawing a bright line between himself and Trey Grayson .
" That contest is won , " said Benton .
" He won the primary and he did n't take money from senators who backed the bailout .
Now they 're coming to support him , and he 's not going to turn down support from Republicans .
They 're not looking for a seat at his table .
They 're supporting him because of his positions , and because of his steadfast commitment to principle . "
EVERY South Australian child will be tracked by the Education Department from birth until the age of eight using a data - sharing system to identify children in need and improve their development .
Individual children will be tracked by collating information from peri-natal statistics , emergency department records , school census data and dental and child health records .
The data will be used to compare how characteristics such as low birth weight , having a disability , growing up in a single - parent household or a low - income household , or using particular drugs , affects a child 's education and development .
Children will not be named but instead be known by a " unique identifier " - or a string of letters and numbers .
While the move is likely to raise privacy concerns , Education Minister Jay Weatherill said the collection of data would remain anonymous and that key safeguards had been put in place .
Mr Weatherill will present the new system , which is currently being rolled out in SA , at an education ministers ' conference in Perth today .
He will push for the system to be picked up nationally .
" The Education Department will be tracking individual children over time so that we can compare the relative effects of a whole range of factors in their lives , " Mr Weatherill said .
" Research shows that the majority of factors that influence children 's development and learning occur before or outside of school ( such as ) family circumstances , health issues , birth weight and a wide range of other considerations . "
Only public policy makers and researchers will have access to the data , in order to develop more targeted policies and programs to support children in need .
The tracking will stop after age eight , however the Education Department has not ruled out increasing the age level for future research projects .
Mr Weatherill said the new data system would give researchers immediate access to information rather than the time - consuming and costly exercise of gathering it themselves .
Currently , the Australian Early Development Index and national literacy and numeracy tests ( NAPLAN ) , provide data on children 's key developmental areas .
The data can only be broken down by location - identifying suburbs and schools in highest need , rather than specific types of children .
" But South Australia 's new system of data linkage will track individual children over time to get a more complete picture of all children and which ones need particular support for their future education , " Mr Weatherill said .
" From there we will be able to track the efficacy of programs , like our nurse home visits to mums and our school retention programs , and better target them on the basis of the development that we monitor in individual children .
We will be able to see which intervention has the best results . "
One of the first major applications of the new system will be a State Government research project on the effect of Ritalin use on educational results .
By tracking individual children using Ritalin , researchers will gain a clearer picture of the effect Ritalin has on educational results .
It follows concerns from child experts that the use of heavy stimulants , such as Ritalin and failed adult anti-depressant Strattera , could be masking the true psychological problems of children .
Melissa Stephenson of Para Hills
West gave birth to her third child , Emily , , at the Lyell McEwin Hospital on Tuesday .
She said she would not mind her daughter 's information being tracked from birth , as long as it remained anonymous .
" I'm a social worker and I have worked in child protection , so I think it 's an excellent initiative , " she said .
" For there to be improvements in services you need to weigh up the privacy ( issue ) .
" As long is there is anonymity , it 's a great idea . "

How do you trim a bill to provide unemployment benefits to laid - off workers in the millionaires ’ club of the U.S. Senate ?
First , you take food out of the mouths of the hungry by cutting food stamps by $ 6 billion .
Then you reduce health care for the poor by cutting state aid for Medicaid by $ 8 billion .
And finally you enforce the racial and rural digital divide by refusing funds for broadband projects to the tune of another $ 2 billion .
And still it is n’t enough for the Republican Party .
Sadly , negotiations broke down again Wednesday on the long - delayed effort to extend unemployment compensation .
Citing fears of increasing the deficit , GOP senators continue to say no to anything proposed by the Obama administration and the Democratic majority in Congress .
With a procedural vote scheduled for Thursday , supporters of working - class families seem two votes shy .
The Washington Post writes : “ Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid ( D - Nev. ) set the procedural wheels in motion for a climactic vote on the legislation as soon as Thursday .
Despite days of talks , a senior Democratic aide said Reid had been unable to persuade any Republicans to support the measure , leaving him at least two votes short of the 60 needed to overcome a GOP filibuster . ”
The AFL - CIO and civil rights groups have pushed for support of the bill .
The trade union federation said , “ It ’s time to tell Republican senators we ’ve had it with their jobless aid blockade .
So far this month , their refusal to extend unemployment insurance has caused nearly 1 million jobless workers to lose the little they have to survive on . ”
Labor is urging phone calls to 1-877-442-6801 to demand the Senate pass the bill .
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has also joined the fight .
It is urging the Senate to support the legislation and extend jobless benefits through the end of the year , stating that doing so “ will help the economy recover while providing badly needed assistance in today ’s historic economic crisis . ”
The civil rights leaders go on to point out that over 1.2 million workers have lost benefits by the end of last week .
Will the GOP listen ?
Only if forced to .
Frustrated by the ongoing stalemate in Congress , civil rights and labor groups have called for a national march for jobs and justice in Washington on Oct .
2 . The march will be held under the theme of One Nation , One Dream .
The march has the support of the NAACP , SEIU , the United Auto Workers and the AFL - CIO .
Commenting on the need for the march , George Gresham , president of 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East , told The New York Times , “ ” It ’s very annoying to see the tea party folks on television all the time as if they ’re speaking for working people , while all they ’re doing is divide working people and push our agenda back , both racially and economically . ”
The announcement of the march comes as a pleasant surprise .
Huge efforts are also being mounted by the very same democratic coalition to get out the vote and defeat Republicans this fall .
Rarely are such marches organized during an election year .
Conventional wisdom might suggest election struggles are best served by concentration of efforts .
Conventional wisdom in this case might be wrong .
One might recall the conventionalists doubted the electability of President Obama and pooh - poohed the notion that youth , Blacks and Latino first - time voters would show up at the ballot box .
Some even heaped scorn on the use of the Internet and social networking as an organizing tool , a technique that was at the center of the Obama election strategy .
The Obama election coalition , it appears , will seek to reenergize these same voters in the mid-term elections .
Novel organizing techniques , including rallies , sit-ins and marches , combined with social networking , may well make , and not break , Democratic chances this fall .

That ’s right , since Spanx released a new line of “ shapewear ” or “ profile - enhancing underwear ” for men in February , the “ body compressing ” tanks , crews and v-necks have become undeniable “ retail hit , ” as reported in the New York Times .
Thanks to Spanx , men can be cool , classic and contained .
But Spanx is n’t the only company tapping into men ’s growing insecurities about their midsections .
According to the New York Times article , Equmen , Sculptees and RiptFusion have also released popular products for men , including a sort of ( ssshh ) “ push - up bra ” for men .
While these expensive products are racking up sales , most guys keep this new line of roll squishing undies on the down - low .
In fact , online sales outweigh in - store sales .
Why all the hush - hush shopping for such these hot new retail products ?
Publicly fretting about your midsection is n’t “ manly . ”
That stuff is for girls and women .
While rates of muscle dysmorphia , the body image disorder most commonly associated with men , have been discussed for years the truth is that all manner of body obsessions commonly associated with women have come to increasingly impact men .
From increasing rates of eating disorders and plastic surgery to increased consumer sales of “ manly ” diet foods and men ’s workout boosters , it is clear that unhealthy body preoccupations are not just for girls and women anymore .
How could men not become targets in a consumer culture that profits from insecurity ?
After all , there is more money to be made off the other half of the population .
But how do you sell “ wimpy ” diet food or body compression garments to men when it is n’t seen as “ masculine ? ”
Just as it took time for men to embrace beauty rituals they considered effeminate — remember when moisturizing used to be a metrosexual thing ? — so has there been a learning curve for shapewear .
“ The biggest obstacle is to get a guy to understand it ’s a new category , and it ’s O.K. to wear it , ” Mr. Kleinmann said .
“ It is still a little taboo . ”
In essence , marketing .
Create campaigns that speak to men in stereotypical masculine fashion so that said sausage -y men seeking sleekness can retain their sense of manhood .
Some clever semantics may help .
Mr. Wooster of Neiman Marcus suggested that one way for men to think of a foundation garment ( as he called Spanx ) is that it is about “ problem solving , and another way of feeling secure and prepared for life . ”
Mr. Wooster understands gender 101 .
Rationality , control , reason and intellect are associated with masculinity .
RiptFusion advertises its line of compression shirts by stating :
RIPT FUSION is a classic men ’s undershirt injected with steroids .
Immediately , he will look and feel better in all of his clothes with a heightened sense of confidence .
Along with the brand name , their tag line “ get Ript ” and the super - hero guy on the home page say it all .
Spanx advertises : Man Spanx ( play on words , perhaps ? ) and the Spanx ’d out dude boldly proclaims “ Game On . ”
In other words , Spanx ai n’t for wimps .
Equmen plays up the whole “ _____ and get laid ” advertising approach ( wear this / drink this / eat this / whatever and get laid ) .
This trend in expensive , body sculpting underwear is part of the increasing focus on men ’s bodies and mounting male insecurity in a consumer driven , body - conscious , instant gratification society .
While we see men being targeted and impacted by body standards , body image and beauty is still gendered feminine and associated with girls and women .
To sell products and services to men , advertising campaigns must convince men that they will be able to retain their masculinity in the same was corporations coined the term “ metrosexual ” in order to sell men beauty products and services without the fear of being labeled gay .
In the same way that dieting and body image insecurity is still labeled a woman ’s issue , men ’s rising insecurities and body image disorders are still issues too often swept under the rug .
After all , insecurity , self - doubt and self - loathing is still a “ chick ” thing .
That sentiment is a disservice to women and men
Most people do n’t really think about the widgets they use every day .
Instead , they just take them for granted .
The button is one of the most commonly used widgets that we use .
From the keys on our keyboards to the buttons on door locks , we find them everywhere .
They are even more prevalent in software where buttons can be practically any shape or size .
Some buttons do n’t even look like buttons !
In this article , we ’ll look at several buttons that wxPython provides for you and how to use them .
The Common wx .
Button Widget
The first button that most wxPython programmers will likely use is wx .
Button .
It wraps the native button control on the three major platforms and just looks “ right ” on each of them .
Here ’s a really simple example of how we would use one :
import wx class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Button Tutorial " ) panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx. ID_ANY ) button = wx .
Button ( panel , id=wx .
ID_ANY , label= " Press Me " ) button .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onButton ) # self .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onButton , button )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def onButton ( self , event ) : " " " This method is fired when its corresponding button is pressed " " " print " Button pressed ! " #
Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx .
App( False ) frame = MyForm ( ) frame .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
All the code above does is create a simple form with one button .
The button is bound to the onButton event handler .
Notice that there is another way to bind that is commented out .
Robin Dunn explains the difference between the two ways to bind an event on the wiki , so if you do n’t understand it , go check it out !
If you do n’t feel like getting the full explanation , here ’s my take :
self .
Bind will bind the event to the parent ( usually a wx . Frame ) via the button .
This means that the event may have to float up through several event layers before it reaches the parent .
If anywhere in those layers of handlers , the developer does not call event .
Skip ( ) , then the event stops .
widget .
Bind for all intents and purposes , binds the event to just that widget .
If you want , you can call event .
Skip ( ) here to pass the event onwards and upwards , although I ca n’t think of a time when I ’ve needed to do that with a button event .
Binding Multiple Widgets to the Same Handler
It ’s fairly common practice to need to bind multiple widgets to just one handler and then differentiate between the calling widgets from within the handler .
There are several ways to get the required information .
We ’ll look at a couple of the most popular ways to actually get the widget itself :
import wx class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Button Tutorial " ) panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx. ID_ANY ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) buttonOne = wx.
Button ( panel , id=wx .
ID_ANY , label = " One " , name = " one " ) buttonTwo = wx .
Button ( panel , id=wx .
ID_ANY , label = " Two " , name = " two " ) buttonThree = wx. Button ( panel , id=wx .
ID_ANY , label = " Three " , name = " three " ) buttons = [ buttonOne , buttonTwo , button Three ] for button in buttons : self.buildButtons( button , sizer ) panel.SetSizer( sizer )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def buildButtons ( self , btn , sizer ) : " " " " " " btn.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onButton ) sizer .
Add( btn , 0 , wx .
ALL , 5 ) #---------------------------------------------------------------------- def onButton ( self , event ) : " " " This method is fired when its corresponding button is pressed " " " button = event .
GetEventObject ( ) print " The button you pressed was labeled : " + button .
GetLabel ( ) print
" The button 's name is " + button .
GetName ( ) button_id = event .
GetId( ) button_by_id = self .
FindWindowById( button_id ) print
" The button you pressed was labeled : " + button_by_id.GetLabel( ) print " The button 's name is " + button_by_id.GetName( ) #
Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx .
App( False ) frame = MyForm ( ) frame .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
Here we have three buttons , each bound to the onButton event handler .
There are two ways to get the button object :
event.GetEventObject ( ) self .
FindWindowById( button_id )
The first gets the widget directly in one fell swoop .
The second requires us to get the widget ID using event .
GetId .
Either way , once you have the button , you can call any of its methods .
In our example , we get the button ’s name and current label .
We can also change the button ’s label or other attributes by using the appropriate setter method ( i.e. SetLabel ) .
Now let ’s turn our attention to some of the other buttons available to us .
Toggle Buttons and Bitmap Buttons
The second most popular button is probably a toss - up between Toggle Buttons and Bitmap Buttons .
With wxPython , you have two choices for both types of buttons :
Use the native versions ( where possible ) or use one of the generic versions ( i.e. buttons written in pure Python rather than SWIGed ) .
Let ’s look at all four :
import wx import wx.lib.buttons as buttons class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Button Tutorial " ) panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx. ID_ANY ) # create a normal toggle button button = wx. ToggleButton ( panel , label= " Press Me " ) button .
Bind(wx.EVT_TOGGLEBUTTON , self.onToggle ) # create a generic toggle button gen_toggle_button = buttons .
GenToggleButton ( panel , - 1 , " Generic Toggle " ) gen_toggle_button.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onGenericToggle ) # create a normal bitmap button bmp = wx. Bitmap ( " agt_mp3.png " , wx .
BITMAP_TYPE_ANY ) bmapBtn = wx.BitmapButton ( panel , id=wx .ID_ANY , bitmap=bmp , size =( bmp.GetWidth( ) +10 , bmp.GetHeight ( ) +10 ) ) # create a generic bitmap button genBmapBtn = buttons .
GenBitmapButton ( panel , bitmap=bmp ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add( button , 0 , wx . ALL , 5 ) sizer .
Add(gen_toggle_button , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) sizer .
Add( bmapBtn , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) sizer .
Add(genBmapBtn , 0 , wx .ALL , 5 ) panel.SetSizer( sizer )
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def onGenericToggle ( self , eventq ) : " " " " " " print " Generic toggle button was pressed ! "
#---------------------------------------------------------------------- def onToggle ( self , event ) : " " " Print a message when toggled " " " print " Button toggled ! " #
Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx .
App( False ) frame = MyForm ( ) frame .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ( )
This code is pretty similar to what we ’ve already seen .
The new piece of information is how to get at the generic buttons .
We need to do a special import , like this : import wx.lib.buttons .
Now we have access to a bunch of generic buttons including a normal button , a toggle , a bitmap , a bitmap with text and flat buttons .
There are even a couple of themed buttons that look almost like the native buttons !
Let ’s take note of a couple idiosyncrasies in the code above .
First , there ’s the strange sizing we do with the wx .
BitmapButton widget .
We do it this way to make sure that there ’s some “ white ” space around the bitmap .
This makes it easier to tell that the widget is a button .
The generic version seems to do this automatically .
The other odd thing that is that when you toggle the wx .
ToggleButton button and keep the mouse pointer above the button , it does n’t look toggled .
If you mouse off the button , then it does ( I noticed this on Windows XP … it may not be an issue on other platforms ) .
According to Robin Dunn ( creator of wxPython ) , the 2.9 series of wxPython will have an updated wx .
Button control that can display a bitmap along with its text .
Now that ’s something to look forward to !
The PlateButton
The PlateButton is another generic widget .
It was created by Cody Precord , author of Editra .
There are tons of examples of his button in the wxPython demo .
We ’ll look at just a couple :
import wx import wx.lib.platebtn as platebtn class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Plate Button Tutorial " ) #
Add a panel so it looks the correct on all platforms panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx. ID_ANY ) ## btn = platebtn .
PlateButton ( panel , label = " Test " , style=platebtn.PB_STYLE_DEFAULT ) btn = platebtn .
PlateButton ( panel , label= " Gradient " , style=platebtn.PB_STYLE_GRADIENT ) # Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx .
App( False ) frame = MyForm ( ) .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
The example above shows how to create a simple PlateButton .
Included are two examples that show two different button styles .
You ’ll need to uncomment one and comment out the other to see how they differ .
Now let ’s see how we can add a menu to our PlateButton :
import wx import wx.lib.platebtn as platebtn class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " Plate Button Tutorial " ) #
Add a panel so it looks the correct on all platforms panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx. ID_ANY ) menu = wx . Menu( ) for url in [ ' http://wxpython.org', ' http://slashdot.org', ' http://editra.org', ' http://xkcd.com']: menu.Append(wx.NewId( ) , url , " Open %s in your browser " % url ) btn = platebtn .
PlateButton ( panel , label= " Menu " , size =None , style=platebtn.PB_STYLE_DEFAULT ) btn.SetMenu(menu ) sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add( btn , 0 , wx .
ALL , 5 ) panel.SetSizer( sizer ) #
Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx.PySimpleApp( ) frame = MyForm ( ) .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
This sample is basically a stripped down example from the wxPython demo .
The idea here is to create a menu and then use the PlateButton ’s “ SetMenu ” method to attach it to the button .

Some of you might have already heard of Jamie Keiles .
The 18 - year - old high school senior from suburban Philadelphia has made a feminist splash with her blog The Seventeen Magazine Project .
Keiles ’s blog documents her 30 - day experiment to follow at least one piece of advice from the teenage girls ’ bible , Seventeen magazine .
What ’s remarkable about Keiles ’s experiment is , well , Keiles herself .
Instead of an A.J. Jacobsesque fumble through mindless observations , The Seventeen Magazine Project is a witty critique of teenage culture .
Keiles tackles everything from nail polish to prom to race , providing pie-charts and photographs to document and dissect her journey .
Along the way , Keiles points to the very problem of fashion magazines like Seventeen ; their pages are filled with a carefully constructed fantasy which is presented to young women as reality .
Keiles recently told me that was one of the reasons she picked Seventeen for her project rather than trendier magazines aimed at young women .
Keiles said ,
I read Seventeen .
My mom read Seventeen .
The magazine has been around for as long as the notion of teenage culture has been around .
I figured if I was going to choose a teen magazine to work with , it was best to go with the original .
Like Keiles , I too read Seventeen magazine and my subscription was a gift from my grandmother .
It was in the pages of Seventeen that I learned about what I should look like , act like , and expect of my high school experience .
And like Keiles , I too found reality to be far different than the magnificent hype of Seventeen ’s glossy pages .
Keiles wrote two blog posts about the ultimate teenage rite of passage — the prom .
In the first post , Keiles documents , “ the most labor intensive and expensive beauty process of my life thus far , ” getting ready .
Running with the mantra , “ make me look conventionally attractive , ” Keiles put in the time and money to look like a prom princess straight from the pages of Seventeen .
What did it take ?
A total of 4 hours and 45 minutes and $ 461.50 .
When I asked Keiles about the time and expense she said :
I think I definitely spent an average to low - average amount for my area .
I live in an upper - middle class suburb of Philadelphia .
There were definitely girls who spent upwards of $ 600 on their dresses , not even including hair and nails .
People took limos .
It ’s a privileged area , I ’m not going to make myself out to be representative of the average teenage girl .
There is no such thing .
We are a very diverse group , us teens , financial situations included .
But were the money and time worth it ?
I asked Keiles about her prom experience .
Was it as magical as Seventeen promised it would be ?
Keiles responded , “ Prom was fun , but I ’m not sure anyone would say it was magical , unless you define magical as dry chicken cutlets and sweaty kids dry humping to oldies . ”
That sounds like a pretty accurate description of my own prom festivities which , I remember leaving early even though , like Keiles , I had spent the requisite amount of time prepping to make the event magical .
But when have fashion magazines ever been about the reality of an experience rather than the ritualistic staging prior to an event ?
Reading The Seventeen Magazine Project surprises me at every turn , not only because of Keiles ’s maturity , but also because the construction of teenage femininity has n’t changed significantly in the thirteen years or so since I read Seventeen magazine .
It still depicts a teenage ideal as a white , heterosexual , young woman who can “ just look at my nails and feel peppy ! ” Keiles ’s response ?
“ This is bleak .
I wish Seventeen would suggest a hobby [ for this girl ] so she did n’t have to look to idle nail - gazing as her only source of joy . ”
So , while my surprise was the depressing stagnation of beauty magazines , Keiles , a decade - plus my junior said her biggest surprise was :
… how willing our society is to accept an image of teenagers as pretty , stupid , and shallow .
Considering the fact that my generation is the future of the world , you ’d think that the people controlling today ’s media would want to set the bar a little higher .

DETROIT --
It is rare for a general manager to remain with one organization for more than a dozen years and highly uncommon for a management team to stick together that long .
But the Detroit Red Wings have had remarkable continuity in their front office , a major factor for their success .
That foundation will remain in place for a while , as the club signed general manager Ken Holland and assistant GM Jim Nill to five - year contract extensions .
Holland , 54 , has been the GM since 1997 and has been in the organization for 27 years , as a player , scout and front - office executive .
Nill , 52 , has been at his current position since 1998 .
“ We have had good stability in the front office , ’’ Red Wings senior vice president Jimmy Devellano said .
“ They ’re people that started in our organization as players .
We got to know them , brought them in as scouts .
They were good workers , passionate about the Red Wings and the game .
“ Both had opportunities to go other places .
But we always tried to step up and do what we had to do to keep them .
They liked the environment , the family atmosphere .
It goes to show you how hard we worked to retain them . ’’
Each has one year remaining on his current deal , so their new pacts take effect in 2011 - 12 and run through the 2015 - 16 season .
As GM , Holland ’s teams have won more regular season games ( 588 ) and postseason games ( 99 ) than any other club in the NHL .
He has contributed to four Stanley Cup championships , three as a GM and one as an assistant GM .
“ I ’m very fortunate I work for incredible owners who have tremendous passion for the team , the city and the sport , ’’ Holland said .
“ They give the hockey department all the tools to be successful , makes your job all the more enjoyable .
“ We want to continue to build upon what ’s gone on here the last 10 - 15 years . ’’
Holland said the final year of his new deal is a team option that can be automatically triggered depending on team performance .
Nill ’s duties include directing Detroit ’s amateur scouting department and overseeing all selections made at the entry draft .
Prior to becoming the assistant GM , he served as Detroit ’s director of player development for four seasons .
He spent the final 2 1/ 2 seasons of his nine - year NHL career with the Red Wings .
“ We go way back , played junior hockey together , have a great friendship , ’’ Nill said of his relationship with Holland .
“ Continuity is so important .
That ’s a big part of our success .
The scouting staff has been together for 10 - 15 years .
The core of our team has been around a long time .
It ’s a unique environment . ’’
Nill earns a GM ’s salary and has much of the responsibilities .
His new deal gives him more flexibility to seek a GM job than his current contract , which prohibits him from speaking to other clubs .
The new pact contains a window of opportunity to speak to other teams starting in the third year ( 2013 - 14 ) .
“ I ’m very blessed , ’’ Nill said .
“ I work for one of the top sports organizations in the world .
From ownership to the management team of Ken Holland and Jimmy Devellano to the scouting staff led by Joe McDonnell and Hakan Andersson to Mike Babcock and the coaching staff , I ’m very lucky to work for one of the most unique franchises in the world . ’’
Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch , in a statement , said Holland and Nill have been the cornerstone to the franchise ’s success .
“ Marian ( Ilitch ) and I feel strongly that stability is key to success for any organization and having these new agreements in place with these two top - notch NHL executives is important to the Red Wings organization and its future , ’’ Ilitch said .
“ They are committed professionals and outstanding individuals , and we have great respect for their respective talents .
We ’re pleased they will continue to lead our hockey club for the next five years . ’’

We 'd never heard of Digital Media Professionals until this very moment , but we 'd guess the company wo n't have that problem in future -- according to a press release fresh off the Japanese wire , its Pica200 GPU is the one pushing pixels to Nintendo 's autostereoscopic screen .
While we do n't know exactly how the tiny graphics unit works or what CPU it might be paired with in a system - on - a- chip , the company claims it supports per-pixel lighting , procedural textures and antialiasing among a host of other effects , and generates 15.3 million polygons per second at its native 200MHz .
What 's more impressive is the video after the break -- reportedly rendered entirely on the chip -- and of course , the 3DS itself , but you 'll have to take our word on that .
Trainer Dawn Brancheau had 16 years ' experience A trainer at a US aquatic park was dragged to her death by a killer whale after her long hair drifted into the animal 's mouth , a police report says .
Trainer Dawn Brancheau was lying nose - to - nose with the orca in shallow water when the incident happened at the SeaWorld park in Florida .
She escaped to the surface briefly but the animal struck her twice more before she was dragged under again .
Ms Brancheau , 40 , was killed while performing with ' Tilikum ' in February .
The medical examiner ruled that she died from drowning and traumatic injuries .
SeaWorld employee Lynn Shaber , said the whale , Tilikum , was " a possessive animal " and she had therefore known
Ms Brancheau was in trouble when she saw her underwater , according to the Orange County Sheriff 's Office report .
" He normally keeps things that he has and will not release them , " the report quoted her as saying .
Rescue attempts Jan Topoleski , another trainer , sounded an alarm when he saw Ms Brancheau 's hair was caught in the orca 's mouth .
By the time he looked back , she was underwater .
She managed to free herself and made it to the surface but was hit again by Tilikum at least twice , the police report said .
Workers were quick to use nets to try to capture the whale but it took half an hour for them to succeed in freeing her body .
Employees used nets and threw food at the whale in an attempt to distract him but one worker said it only made the animal more agitated .
Moving from pool to pool in the complex , they eventually captured Tilikum and released Ms Brancheau 's body , before realising that the whale still had her arm .
Ms Brancheau , a trainer with 16 years ' experience , was attacked in front of an audience at the SeaWorld park on 24 February .
The killer whale was also reportedly involved in the death of a female trainer in Canada in 1991 .

If you care about the future of books , you need to understand the Google Book Settlement .
It 's a complicated legal document , but we 've talked to some of its architects , detractors , and defenders - and break it all down for you .
Advertisement
The Google Book Settlement could easily be the twenty - first century 's most important shift in how we deal with copyright in the world of publishing .
To understand it , you need a little back story on the previous giant shift in copyright law , which happened about twelve years ago .
Mickey Mouse Protection Act
In 1998 , copyright was turned on its head by a piece of legislation often called the " Mickey Mouse Protection Act . "
Known to policy - makers as the Copyright Extension Act , it was the result of intensive lobbying by the entertainment industry , led in part by Disney , to extend the copyright on any work created after 1923 .
Many of Disney 's classic pieces of content , like Mickey Mouse cartoons , were about to pass into the public domain .
So the company was naturally interested in keeping control of the Mouse as long as it could .

The Copyright Term Extension
Act was good for authors ' estates , and for corporations .
Under the new rules , copyright would become life of the author plus 70 years - and for works of corporate authorship , 120 years after creation .
( Previously , copyright had been life of the author plus 50 years , with 75 years for corporate works . )
The Act also gave birth to a loosely - organized but powerful movement of copyright reformists .
Led by activists , scientists , artists , and tech nerds , this movement has stretched from university campuses to the Supreme Court of the United States , where law professor Lawrence Lessig argued that the Copyright Extension Act was unconstitutional because it violated the First Amendment ( SCOTUS did n't buy it ) .
Over the past decade , many of these reformists migrated to jobs in Silicon Valley , where easily - copied digital media are constantly forcing the question of what copyright really means in the information age .

One might say that the Google Book Settlement ( GBS ) is the result of this migration .
One of the basic injunctions of copyright reform is " share your culture , " and the seeds of the GBS come from an admirable Google project aimed at sharing the knowledge from research libraries with the world .
Many years ago the search company began digitizing the books from several university libraries , pulling every single book from the shelves and making a digital copy .
The idea was to make hard - to - access texts available to anyone , not just people lucky enough to live near a major research school .
Via Google Book Search , people would be able to search for keywords in the full text of any book , then read one or two - sentence " snippet " excerpts from it .
The Mickey Mouse Protection
Act may have stalled the growth of the public domain , but the company 's Google Book Search project would broaden it .

The Settlement
The Google Book Search project was conceived as an online library , its texts fully searchable , and open to all .
Unfortunately , when you digitize everything in a library , a lot of books are swept up in the frenzy .
Among the rare and out - of - print works Google digitized were millions of copyrighted works .
When publishers and authors of those works got wind of Google 's project , some of them sued for infringement .
They did n't want any parts of their books available online for free - they wanted people to pay for them .
Advertisement
Sued by the Author 's Guild and representatives of the Association of American Publishers , Google decided to settle out of court .
And this produced the first Google Book Settlement in 2008 , out of which Google Books was born .
Google Books was a much expanded vision from Google Book Search , and with some exceptions it gave the company a retroactive license to digitize any book registered in the United States before 2009 , and any book published before 2009 in the UK , Australia , and Canada .
Yes , you read that right .
In exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars in settlement money , Google can now digitize pretty much any book published in the English - speaking world before 2009 .
Due to various complaints , a new version of the GBS was produced in 2009 ( often called GBS 2.0 ) , and that version adds a lot of interesting kinks to the situation .
That 's the version I 'll be talking about here .
It 's crucial to note that the GBS 2.0 has not yet been approved , and is currently being evaluated for fairness by a Manhattan judge after a lengthy hearing in February .
It could to be revised again in light of that hearing , especially because the Justice Department strongly objected to parts of GBS 2.0 .
Advertisement
That said , the GBS will ultimately " turn copyright on its head , " as critics like Ursula Le Guin have said .
And that will change the way you find and read books .
Here 's how .
Advertisement
1 . It may become harder to get information online about books from writers you love .
Authors from Ursula Le Guin to Michael Chabon have spoken out against the Google Book Settlement , decrying the way it seems to wrest control of books away from authors .
Both LeGuin and Chabon , along with thousands of other published authors ( you can view a complete list here [ PDF ] ) , opted out of the GBS .
Authors who opted out of the GBS do n't want their work included in that mega - group of " all works published in the U.S. " that Google has retroactively licensed .
In short , they do n't want to be part of Google 's digital library .
But why ?
Advertisement
Le Guin told io9 via e-mail :
Google is digitizing copyrighted books without getting , or even seeking , permission from the copyright holders .
How they persuaded several great libraries to allow them to do this is a question that needs answering , as libraries have always been careful about seeing that library users observe copyright law .
If we go on doing it [ Google 's ] way , we end up with a wholly - owned list of digitized books , many stolen from their owners , totally controlled , managed , opened and closed to public use , by a profit - making corporation interested in furthering its monopolistic control of information .
Advertisement
Like many other authors , LeGuin does not interpret the GBS as a blow struck for copyright reform .
She wants to control who digitizes her books , and how they do it .
In the short term , opting out of the GBS wo n't affect most writers very much .
But in the long term , as more people access books online , it 's possible that LeGuin 's books will become increasingly hard for people to learn about .
You will be able to buy them online , and access plot summaries .
But , unless LeGuin gives another company permission to do what she 's forbidden Google , nobody will be able to " leaf through " her books virtually , the way you might in a bookstore .
Advertisement
Ironically , many of LeGuin 's books are still available via Google Books .
If you search for them , as of this writing , you 'll find what Google calls a " snippet view " of the books in search results .
Advertisement
There 's a reason for this .
LeGuin 's opt - out does not prevent Google from digitizing her books , or from showing snippets of them online .
It just gives her the right to sue Google for copyright infringement ( if you do n't opt out , you ca n't sue because you 've settled out of court ) .
Ironically , the only way LeGuin could prevent Google from displaying her books would be to opt into the GBS , and then request that Google not display her books at all .
And here 's the irony icing on the irony cake : Let 's say LeGuin did opt in to the GBS , because she wanted her books to be available for people to sample .
If she did that , her publisher 's agreement with Google Books could override her wishes and keep her book unsearchable or only available in snippet view ( for a full , complicated account of this , see GBS Attachment A ) .
This is where many of the author protests of the GBS fall apart .
All publishers in the Association of American Publishers , including LeGuin's , have agreed by proxy to the GBS .
Roughly 30 thousand publishers in 100 countries have made deals with Google Books .
Generally , most publishing rights for in - print books are owned by publishers , not authors .
That means publishers may control how books are accessed via Google Books , whether the authors like it or not .
Advertisement
If authors like LeGuin really want to opt out of the GBS , she and her fellow in - print authors will ultimately have to take it up with their publishers and contract lawyers rather than Google .
Given how strongly these authors feel about the GBS , you may find that many of your favorite writers will start refusing to do business with their publishers .
Or they may refuse to sign contracts that give their publishers the right to distribute their work online .
This would obviously cut down even more on your ability to find the books you love in digital format .
Advertisement
2 . You will find yourself reading free books online , by authors who have disappeared .
And Google will make money when you do .
It may become harder to find books by your favorite authors , but you 'll also have access to many more books than you ever knew existed .
Advertisement
Out of the roughly 12 million books that Google has digitized , 2 million are in the public domain .
That means they were published before 1923 , and have fallen out of copyright .
But some are more recent books that have fallen through the cracks of the publishing world :
There are at least a million of these books , called " orphan works . "
That means they 're still under copyright , but they are out of print and nobody knows where the authors are .
Many of those books are science fiction and fantasy novels that were in print for just a few short years .
Now you can read large parts of those books for free - and for a subscription fee you can read them all .
Why can you access big chunks of copyrighted books for free ?
Google 's default mode for digitized books is what 's called a " partial view " that makes a random 20 percent of each book available for free , or full text for a fee , unless a copyright holder has specifically requested otherwise .
Because orphan works ' authors can't be found , Google uses the default mode .
Advertisement
Google is n't adopting all those orphans out of the goodness of its heart .
The GBS gives Google the right to sell them .
As soon as the GBS is approved , the company can immediately begin selling about 5 million copyrighted books .
How can that be ?
Google estimates that there are about 5 million copyrighted but out - of - print books in its library .
Of these so - called " unclaimed " books , a million are estimated to be true orphan works .
The other 4 million are books whose authors could be found .
But Google did n't attempt to track down the authors because - let 's be fair - it 's really hard to find the authors of 5 million books .
So they are relying on copyright holders to contact the company , claim their books , and let Google know what to do with them .
Advertisement
Let 's say I 'm an author who published a dozen science fiction books in the 1950s about lesbian aliens which quickly went out of print , but were digitized by Google last year .
Right now , my entire " Journey To My Tentacle Cave " series is available with free partial view online , plus Google is also selling the full text versions , and I 'm not thrilled about that .
How do I contact Google and let them know that these are not unclaimed works , and that I want to control how people read them online ?
First , I can go to Google Books and claim my books via this form .
Once I 've done that , I become eligible for a $ 60 licensing fee Google has agreed to pay authors in the GBS ( oh boy ) .
Then I have several options : I can continue making the default " partial view " available ; I can opt for the " snippet view " we saw with LeGuin 's book above ; I can opt for no view at all ( book is totally unsearchable ) ; I can opt to completely delete the book from Google 's servers ( the " remove " option ) ; and I can opt to let Google sell my book via a proposed partnership plan .
Advertisement
All of this sounds great , but there 's a problem .
Many authors may not realize that Google has digitized their books , so they wo n't be able to contact the company to remove them .
Others may discover their books online , but know nothing about the GBS and therefore be unable to find that form to fill out .
And even when authors do know about the form , they may find the whole process slow and frustrating .
What they will find most frustrating is the fact that even though they are only getting $ 60 per book out of the deal , Google will be making money forever by showing ads next to their books when people read them online .
Which brings me to my next point .

3 . Google will be competing with Apple and Amazon and everybody else to be your favorite online bookseller .
Advertisement
One of the weird things that the GBS does is create an industry organization - completely separate from Google - called the Book Rights Registry ( let 's call it the Registry ) .
The Registry 's main job will be to mediate between authors and Google .
But it will eventually turn into a license - management organization that authors can use to license their books to anyone who wants to make electronic copies .
So let 's say our imaginary author of the " Journey To My Tentacle Cave " series decides she wants to sell her books online .
She goes to the Registry and says , " Hey , Google has already made digital copies of my books and I want to sell them through Google . "
The Registry says , great .
That 's because they already have an agreement with Google to get 63 % of all revenues made from the Google Books library .
The Registry can choose how it wants to pay the author of the " Journey To My Tentacle Cave " series - it could pass along the full 63 % to her ( unlikely ) or a portion of it , minus the Registry 's fees .
So now our author just sits back and waits for the Registry to pay her based on what Google sells .
Advertisement
Here 's the cool part .
Our author can also use the Registry to sell licenses to other booksellers too .
Maybe alien lesbian books make a huge comeback and suddenly our author becomes internet famous .
Now Apple 's iBook store and Amazon want to sell her long - out - of - print books too .
Our author says , great - go to the Registry and you can license the rights from them .
Then Amazon and iBook can make their own digital copies and start selling them too .
And our author sits back and makes more cash .
( For music geeks : Yes , the Registry would be something like ASCAP and BMI are for the music industry . )
Our bard of alien lesbian epics is obviously in an ideal situation , which depends on many factors - not the least of which is a judge approving the fairness of GBS 2.0 .
Also we 're depending on the fair - mindedness of the board of this not - yet - created organization , the Registry , which will consist of people drawn from the leadership of the Author 's Guild and the American Association of Publishers ( the original plaintiffs in the suits that created the GBS ) .
Advertisement
Before the Google Books Store launches , this board will have a lot of work to do .
First , its job will be to allocate $ 45 million that Google owes to all the authors whose books it digitized without permission ( remember : authors who claim their books get $ 60 per book ) .
Then , its job will be to manage all the cash that Google is spraying at it :
They 've got to figure out what to do with that 63 % of revenues from Google Books - which comes ( mostly ) from Google AdSense as well as book sales of lesbian alien novels .
Some of the money goes to authors , but what about the money from all those unclaimed works ?
The BRR holds that money for 5 years , then will use a portion of it to track down the author in an effort to pay them .
After 10 years , they may give the money to nonprofits .
On top of all that stuff , the Registry 's job will be to mediate between authors and booksellers .
Advertisement
And then there is the little matter of how much control the Registry will have over books whose authors are no longer around to give an opinion .
Law professor Pam Samuelson , who has argued tirelessly for copyright reforms , is extremely pessimistic about this aspect of the Registry .
She wrote last year :
Copyright maximalists will almost certain dominate the BRR governing board . . .
The Authors Guild president , for example , recently complained about the " read aloud " feature of Kindle , denoting it a " swindle , " and a copyright infringement .
The AAP is supporting legislation to forbid the National Institutes of Health from promoting " open access " policies for articles written under NIH grants .
And of course , the Authors Guild and AAP characterized Google as a thief for scanning books from research libraries .
If asked , the authors of orphan books in major research libraries might well prefer for their books to be available under [ reformist ]
Creative Commons licenses or put in the public domain so that fellow researchers could have greater access to them .
The BRR will have an institutional bias against encouraging this or considering what terms of access most authors of books in the corpus would want .
Advertisement
Her point is a sharp retort to copyright reformists who think the GBS represents pushback against legislation like the Mickey Mouse Protection Act .
The GBS will give us more access to books at first , but eventually copyright maximalists on the Registry board could turn Google Books into a gated garden .
In addition , if you consider this situation from the perspective of online booksellers who hope to compete with Google , the GBS is a disaster .
Remember , Google now has the right to digitize any book published in the US before 2009 .
No other company has that right .
To sell e-books , Amazon and its ilk will have to license them book by book - either from the BRR or copyright holders .
The only way another company could ever hope to compete with Google at this point , as Samuelson points out , is to just start digitizing without permission and get sued so they can get a settlement as sweet as Google's .

4. Libraries and bookstores will be the same thing .
Ultimately what Google has done is transform libraries into bookstores .
They 've done this quite literally , by digitizing the contents of several libraries and turning them into revenue - generators .
They want to sell these books ; and failing that , to sell ads against them .
At the same time , they are already in the process of building a massive , free archive of rare and public domain books .
And they 're making them available to anyone with an internet connection .

That 's why the GBS has to be evaluated as a document that regulates libraries as well as a digital bookstore .
A library is , after all , a vast repository of research texts that tell us the ( hopefully balanced ) history of our culture .
There are things we demand of libraries that we do n't demand of bookstores .
We want libraries to be as complete as possible ; we want them maintained as a public good ; and perhaps most importantly we want them preserved as long as possible through changes in political regimes and fashions .
If you look at Google Books from that perspective , two basic issues emerge from the Settlement : privacy for readers , and protection against censorship ( i.e. , making politically unpopular books " disappear " ) .

Currently , the government mandates that libraries protect patron records from casual searches by law enforcement .
But the GBS does not require warrants for government agents to request records about who has been reading what , and when .
In fact , Google will keep far more detailed records about reader habits than a librarian ever could - right down to which sections of a book you read .
And there are other disturbing elements of the GBS , too .
It allows for censorship and alteration of books stored in the Google library .

Electronic Frontier Foundation staff attorney Fred Von Lohmann writes :
Even more troubling is the possibility of selective alterations of the texts of the books themselves .
In Section 3.10 ( c ) ( i ) , the settlement forbids Google " except as expressly authorized by the Registered Rightsholder " from altering the text of scanned books when displayed to users .
That 's certainly a good thing , as far as it goes - we should n't want Google to be able to go in and selectively edit books .
But Google is allowed to selectively edit if " authorized " by the copyright owner .
Why is this permitted ?
And if the rightsholder " authorizes " Google to make changes , can Google refuse to do so ?
Will the fact of alteration be publicly visible to the reader ?
The answer is not clear .
But clearly the better rule is a prohibition on anyone making editorial alterations in the text of scanned books ( again , no library would allow a copyright owner to selectively blackline books in the stacks ) .
Any other option creates the chilling prospect of " revising history " as imagined in Orwell 's 1984 .
The proposed settlement also gives Google a troubling degree of discretion when it comes to choosing which books will be publicly accessible .
For example , Section 3.7(e ) makes it clear that Google can exclude any scanned book it likes from public access " for editorial or non-editorial reasons . " . . .
It 's worth noting that governments will doubtless exploit the leeway that the settlement gives to both rightsholders and Google to pull books off the digital shelves of Google Books .
It 's all too easy to imagine foreign governments pressuring their citizens to " remove " books from public access on Google .
It 's also likely that foreign governments will pressure Google to omit books from Google Books .
If that comes to pass , neither Google nor the rightsholders will be able to say that they are legally constrained by the settlement from complying .

If we think of Google Books as a bookstore , the idea that people can withdraw or alter their books is n't particularly troubling .
But when you consider that millions of books will be in the library , many by authors who are dead or cannot be found , these clauses become censorship invitations .
They could be the legal loopholes that make it easy for governments to revise history .
One possible way to fix this problem would be to designate two Google Books collections , regulated differently : The Library ( public domain and unclaimed works ) , and the Store ( any book that has been claimed by a copyright owner who wants to sell it through Google ) .

5 . Pulp science fiction will make a comeback in ways you might not expect .
The GBS represents a new stage in the evolution of the publishing industry .
It offers a glimpse of what bookstores might become in the mature Information Age : A hybrid library / storefront whose job is to preserve and monetize books .
It will be difficult to balance the public good of libraries with the free market of the bookstore .
Will the store side win , turning the archive into an expensive gated garden ?
Or will the library side prevail , creating an amazing , open collection that can't be sustained because there 's no revenue stream for the booksellers or the authors ?
Advertisement
I think hope lies in the middle road , where the storefront sustains the library .
But to head down that road , we need to be sure we regulate how that library is treated .
Books by dead or missing authors , books we are trying to preserve , should not be as easy to " disappear " or alter as books whose copyright holders are still in charge of them .
Future library / bookstores need to be regulated by more than industry groups like the Registry - for the same reason that libraries today are governed by privacy laws and preservation mandates .
The good news for science fiction fans is that a merger of libraries and bookstores can only mean one thing :
More pulp fiction , or cheaply - produced and distributed novels .
We will have unprecedented access to pulps published in the first half of the twentieth century .
Many of those novels and stories were classics that deserve a wide readership today - but they 've been lost in the depths of libraries and archives .
Advertisement
More importantly , I think we could see a renaissance in contemporary pulp fiction .
We can once again have access to weird , unusual stories that are both awesome and not sustainable under publishing 's current blockbuster model .
Writers of small and midlist SF books could start making money on their writing again .
This is a good thing for authors and readers who love imaginative fiction .
I want to live in a future where I can find the lesbian alien " Journey To My Tentacle Cave " series on the shelves next to Stephenie Meyer 's latest celebration of vampire celibacy - and one click away from Ralph Ellison 's Invisible Man .
That is a future of economically - sustainable openness in the stacks .
And I think , with careful regulation , the GBS could be the first shaky step on the road that will take us there .

An Ottawa soccer league is enforcing a maximum five - goal victory to prevent blowout games among kids between five and 18 years old .
According to the rules , the winner becomes the loser if they beat their opponents by more than five goals .
The Gloucester Dragons say the rule helps promote participation for those who want to learn how to play the game .
However , others argue the cap on goals prevents kids from learning how to lose .
" I do n't think it 's a good policy .
I think you 're teaching kids not to be able to lose .
I think in life you win , you lose , you do n't win everything , you do n't lose all the time , but there is a balance , " soccer mom Dianne Panarella told CTV Ottawa .
Other parents agree : " I do n't think that would make me feel good about myself , and I do n't see how the kids are going to feel great about winning just because the other team did so well , " added soccer mom Cathy Hansen .
However , the chairman of the league argues there 's no value in squashing your opponents .
" It 's not meant to punish anybody .
It 's meant to give the coaches pause for thought when they 're getting to that three to four goal spread to say , ‘ OK , maybe I need to start thinking about re-adjusting the team to prevent this being a blowout , ' " said Sean Cale .
The Gloucester Dragons operate under the Gloucester Soccer Association , which is recognized by the Eastern Ontario District Soccer Association and the Ontario Soccer Association .

Frequently Asked Personal Injury Questions
How Long Do I Have to File a Claim ?
According to Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem .
Code section 16.003 the statute of limitations for personal injury cases in Texas is two years .
This means you have two years from the date of your injury to file a claim or you may lose your right to pursue compensation .
If your claim is against a government worker or entity , the time limit to file a claim is only 6 months .
Texas does recognize some exceptions to the statute of limitations , but your case must meet specific requirements .
An attorney from our firm will be able to let you know if you qualify for an exception to extend the statute of limitations !
What Damages Can I Recover ?
Damage is a legal term that refers to the different types of losses a defendant may be liable to pay out compensation for .
In personal injury suits , there are generally three main types of damages injury victims can seek restitution for economic damages , non-economic damages , and punitive damages .
Economic damages , also called special damages , compensate for the financial losses associated with an injury such as missed wages due to the inability to work and medical expenses .
Non-economic damages compensate for the more abstract losses an injury victim faces , such as pain and suffering and emotional distress .
Since non-economic damages compensate for such intangible losses they are also called general damages .
Both economic and non-economic damages are “ compensatory damages ” which means the main purpose of them is to compensate the injured party for a specific loss .
There is only one category of damages that is not compensatory and that is punitive damages .
The main purpose of punitive damages is to punish the defendant for their negligent behavior .
Since punitive damages can be quite harsh they are not often awarded in most personal injury cases .
Fair point , so I did a quick search for the amount of time taken to become a US citizen .
" Depending on where and when you choose to file your application , the period of time between sending in the completed application and the interview to become a U.S. Citizen can vary from five months to more than two years .
The swearing - in ceremony for receiving the naturalization certificate will then take place from 1 to 180 days after the interview , although in a few U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ( USCIS , formerly known as the INS ) district offices , it can take another one or two years .
The length of time for the entire process depends on the number of U.S. Citizenship applications the USCIS offices receive in each state .
Additionally , making a mistake on your application can cost you even more time .
However , by using our unique do - it - yourself service , you will be assisted throughout the entire process - helping you prevent costly mistakes to your application .

Believe it or not , we end up with a fair amount of leftover pizza at the Slice offices in SE World Headquarters .
While I enjoy the occasional cold slice , I usually prefer to warm up my pizza , as do most people .
But how to do this ?
Pizzerias reheat slices all the time , but their ovens are kept at scorching temperatures all day long .
Reheating pizza in the oven or in a toaster oven on the bake setting takes more time than I 'm willing to wait for a quick slice , especially since you need to use moderate heat to avoid burning the outside of a slice before the inside warms through .
By contrast , toasting , though fast , often fails to heat a slice all the way through , especially if it has a thick crust .
I 'm not even going to talk about the soggy mess that is microwaved leftover pizza .
So what 's my time - tested method ?
Find out , after the jump .
After years of extensive research , I 've hit on a solution : microwaving and then toasting .
Please , restrain yourselves — I already know this is probably the greatest discovery since pasteurization .
By microwaving a slice , you heat it through quickly .
By toasting it , you get a crisp crust in less than 5 minutes .
If the slice is substantial enough , you can even put it directly on the grates of the toaster oven .
We estimate that this post will save Slice 'rs approximately 2x10 ^7 pizza - minutes * per month .

CHICAGO – A federal jury here on Monday , June 28 , found former Chicago Police Commander Jon Burge guilty on all three counts of obstruction of justice and perjury for lying about torture in a civil lawsuit .
For decades Burge and his Area 2 detectives during the 1970s and 80s , referred to as the “ Midnight Crew , ” have been accused of police abuse on over 100 African American men who were beaten to sign confessions for crimes they say they did not commit .
All of the victims are African American males and their stories tell a consistent pattern of racial discrimination by Burge and his men .
Electric shock to the ears and / or genitals , burning , suffocation , and mock executions were some of the most brutal forms of torture .
Burge was eventually fired from the Police Department in 1993 for torturing a suspect .
A four - year investigation by Special Cook County prosecutors concluded in 2006 that the statue of limitations on the claims of abuse had long passed .
However in 2008 federal prosecutors went after Burge as part of a 2003 civil lawsuit filed by a former death row inmate where the commander said torture was never used , contrary to mounting evidence that proved such abuse was enforced .
In 2008 the City of Chicago agreed to a $ 20 million settlement with four former Death Row inmates who alleged that Burge had abused them .
The convictions made by the jury this week , which included just one African American , mean that Burge , 62 , faces up to 45 years in prison when he is sentenced on Nov. 5 .
“ This is a long , long time coming , but there ’s finally an official recognition of this sordid episode of Chicago history , ” said Rob Warden of Northwestern University ’s Innocence Project to the Chicago Sun -Times .
“ Justice was delayed , but , ultimately , not denied . ”
Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom Mark Clements , 45 , said he was incarcerated for nearly three decades after he was brutally forced to admit to a crime after police detectives beat and tortured a confession out of him .
He was sixteen at the time .
He said his life had been stolen from him and he prayed for this day to come .
“ Finally , the poor people won , ” said Clements to the Chicago Tribune .
“ Hopefully Jon Burge will receive an appropriate sentence and he will have time to think about the consequences of his actions . ”
Others say Burge should have been convicted for torture not perjury but say nonetheless the verdict was a good one .
Attorneys representing a number of Burge ’s alleged victims say they will continue to fight for new trials for their clients and hope the U.S. government will take swift action to charge the other detectives who were implicated in many of the torture cases .
Prosecutors have signaled they are investigating a number of detectives who worked for Burge at the time .
Meanwhile City Hall is rewriting Chicago ’s 28 - year - old handgun ban to tighten registration requirements after the U.S. Supreme Court ’s landmark ruling Monday that says cities and states must abide by the 2nd Amendment granting citizens nationwide the right to legally keep weapons in their home for protection .
Mayor Richard Daley , who has championed gun control said the ruling was a defeat and said the Supreme Court ’s 5 - 4 decision is out of touch with rampant violence due to guns on the street that cities across the nation face every day .
In dissent , Justice Stephen G. Breyer said firearms “ cause well over 60,000 deaths and injuries in the United States each year .
Gun regulation may save lives .
Some experts have calculated , for example , that Chicago ’s handgun ban has saved several hundred lives , perhaps close to 1,000 , since it was enacted in 1983 . ”
Community activists argue the ruling is a bad idea especially when there are too many young people dying every week due to the easy access of guns .
Having more access to such weapons will actually increase the violence , they say .
Rather more funding should be allocated toward violence prevention programs and outreach workers throughout the city including job - readiness services and long - term employment opportunities for young people , they add .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel rejected Sunday a proposal by U.N. Secretary - General Ban ki-Moon for an international investigation into its deadly raid on a Gaza - bound aid ship and said it had the right to launch its own inquiry .
Lebanese leftist activists and Palestinians shout slogans and carry flags during a protest near the U.S. embassy in Awkar , north of Beirut , June 6 , 2010 , against Israel 's storming of a Gaza - bound aid flotilla .

“ We are rejecting an international commission .
We are discussing with the Obama administration a way in which our inquiry will take place , ” Michael Oren , Israel ’s ambassador to Washington , said on the U.S. TV program “ Fox News Sunday . ”
The U.N. chief had suggested establishing a panel that would be headed by former New Zealand prime minister Geoffrey Palmer and include representatives from Turkey , Israel and the United States , an Israeli official said earlier in Jerusalem .
Netanyahu discussed the proposal for a multinational panel with Ban in a telephone call Saturday but told cabinet ministers from his right - wing Likud party Sunday that Israel was exploring other options , political sources said .
Nine Turks were killed Monday in the Israeli commando raid on the Mavi Marmara , part of a six - vessel convoy that set out to challenge an Israeli - led blockade of the Gaza Strip .
Israel has said its troops used lethal force in self - defense after they were set upon by pro-Palestinian activists wielding clubs and knives .
Israeli leaders have spoken publicly about setting up an internal investigation with foreign observers into the interception of the Turkish - flagged ship off the coast of Gaza ,
an enclave run by Hamas Islamists who oppose Western - backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ’s peace efforts with Israel .
“ Israel is a democratic nation .
Israel has the ability and the right to investigate itself , not to be investigated by any international board , ” Oren said .
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu , speaking on CNN , said Ankara would insist on an independent commission and suggested that Israel ’s rejection of an international inquiry showed it wanted to cover up the facts of the raid .
“ We want to know the facts .
If Israel rejects this , it means it is also another proof of their guilt .
They are not self - confident to face the facts , ” he said .
Turkey ’s relations with Israel , once a close ally , have soured badly since the deadly raid .
SECOND INTERCEPTION
Israel ’s navy boarded another ship carrying aid and pro-Palestinian activists to Gaza Saturday .
Its interception of the Irish - owned MV Rachel Corrie ended without violence following diplomatic efforts to avoid bloodshed .
“ I want to pay tribute to the crew of the Rachel Corrie for demonstrating in no uncertain terms their peaceful intentions , ” Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin told Irish public radio RTE .
“ We of course communicated that relentlessly to the Israeli authorities . ”
An Israeli official said Israel wanted to establish whether the Turkish government had sponsored the Mavi Marmara , where the strength of the resistance to the boarding party appeared to have caught the Israeli military off guard .
Israel has said seven of its troops were wounded .
Netanyahu said at the start of his weekly cabinet meeting that a smaller group of “ violent extremists ” had boarded the ship separately with the intention of clashing with troops .
Slideshow ( 6 images )
Photographs obtained by Reuters Sunday that were shot on board the Mavi Marmara showed bleeding and cowering Israeli troops surrounded by activists .
The photographs were taken by a member of the Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Aid , or IHH , which organized the convoy , said spokesman Salih Bilici .
Israeli authorities confiscated activists ’ cameras and erased the memory cards but the IHH was able to recover photos on one camera using special software , Bilici said .
There are no pictures of outright violence but many of the photographs show puddles of blood on the floor or streaks smeared across walls .
Israel has said it must prevent arms smuggling to Gaza , and French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said Sunday the European Union could help monitor traffic into the territory .
“ We can propose again that the European Union , European countries , monitor this passage in a very strict manner ...
We can very well monitor the cargoes of ships going to Gaza , ” he told reporters .
France and Britain offered to send warships to monitor and prevent arms smuggling to Gaza following Israel ’s 22 - day offensive in the Palestinian Hamas - ruled territory that ended in January last year .
Together with Egypt , Israel tightened its blockade on the Gaza Strip after Hamas Islamists took over the coastal territory in 2007 in fighting with forces loyal to Western - backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
World pressure has mounted on Israel to lift the blockade which the U.N. said has caused a humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and hampers efforts to rebuild homes and infrastructure destroyed in a 2009 war .
Israel says its frequent transfer of basic goods to the territory has staved off any such crisis .
The Census Bureau is monitoring the safety of its workers after 15 incidents of violence were reported against employees going door - to - door to finish up work on the once - in - a - decade head count .
More than 600,000 Census takers started canvassing neighborhoods across the country this month to follow up with residents at 48 million addresses who did not return their Census forms in full .
With so many workers on the street , the bureau says attacks are bound to happen .
But the recent incidents underscore the need for both Census workers and members of the public to be on guard .
In one case , a Tampa man was accused of going after a Census worker with a pickaxe .
In another , a northern California homeowner wielded a crossbow .
" They are rare , but certainly one incident is going to be too many .
So we 're always concerned , " Census spokesman Stephen Buckner told FoxNews.com .
The bureau is also aware of an incident in which a Census worker is accused of committing a crime .
In southern Indiana , a 39 - year - old Census worker allegedly broke into a home and attacked and raped a 21 - year - old mentally handicapped woman .
Buckner confirmed the suspect is a Census worker who underwent background checks before he was hired .
But most of the incidents this year have involved violence against Census workers .
According to the bureau , there have been 15 attacks or threatened attacks on employees since mid-March , with most of them happening in the last couple of weeks .
They include two armed carjackings , two sexual assaults and two incidents of weapons being fired at Census takers .
In addition , five Census employees have died in auto accidents .
Buckner said the bureau is giving Census workers safety training , urging them to report suspicious behavior , " immediately remove " themselves from an area when they feel unsafe and " remain calm if you encounter an agitated dog . "
Dog attacks are a common hazard for Census workers .
During the 2000 Census , 1,103 dog bites were reported -- and a 71 - year - old Census taker was killed by a pack of dogs in Indiana .
The bureau separately recorded 180 assaults on its employees during the canvassing period , which lasts until mid-July .
Nine Census workers were accused of crimes , though all but one of the cases were dismissed in court .
This Census is no less eventful .
Last month , an Idaho man reportedly fired a shotgun near a Census worker .
A Tampa man was arrested after he allegedly grabbed a large pickaxe out of his car and threatened a Census taker near his apartment , according to MyFox Tampa Bay .
The 65 - year - old man was charged with aggravated battery .
According to The Union newspaper , a homeowner in northern California over the weekend threatened two Census takers with a crossbow and a machine gun .
Employees in other lines of work that entail going door - to - door encounter similar hazards .
According to the United States Postal Service , 2,863 dog bites were reported by its 316,000 letter carriers last year .
The USPS does not track assaults on its employees .
UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said that while the UPS also does not track attacks on its workers , they are very rare .
She said UPS workers , with their brown uniforms and official trucks , are highly recognizable and usually well - received .
Buckner said attacks on Census workers could generally be because some people feel they do not have a right to be on their property .
In another disturbing incident in Houston , a man posing as a Census worker barged into a home Saturday with two other suspects and stabbed a city employee who lived there to death .
According to police , the three suspects ransacked the house , assaulted the other people in it and escaped in a pickup truck .
To raise the level of trust between residents and Census takers , Buckner said the bureau is telling the public to look for several factors to verify the identity of a Census worker .
Census workers will not ask to enter a home , will be carrying a white ID badge and will have a black satchel with the Census logo on it , he said .
If they do n't , Buckner said , " All of that stuff should be red flags . "
He said the Census also implemented new screening measures in the hiring process this year -- now requiring applicants for the part - time positions to go through an FBI fingerprint check as well as a general background check .
Britain 's biggest recording industry association , the BPI , has sent a cease - and - desist order to Google , asking the search engine to take down links to nine " one- click hosting " sites , each of which hosts thousands of illegal songs .
The BPI 's complaint cites 38 links " that are available via Google 's search engine , and [ requests these ] links be removed as soon a possible as they directly link to sound recordings owned by [ BPI ] members " .
The links point to songs , ranging from K'Naan 's Wavin ' Flag to Michael Bublé 's Have n't Met You Yet , plus tracks by Eminem and the cast of TV series Glee .
While Google does not operate any of the infringing websites , search queries lead users to illegal downloads at sites such as MegaUpload , SendSpace and UserShare .
To bolster its case , the BPI even cites the search queries that bring up the offending links .
As stated in the letter , searches for " dizzee rascal dirtee disco " and " k'naan wavin ' flag download " bring up free download sites in the first several pages of results .
This search tactic is one of downloading 's worst - kept secrets ; even three years ago , major blogs such as Lifehacker were explaining similar techniques .
Speaking to CNet , BPI spokesman Adam Liversage said Google is usually willing to remove links to copyrighted content .
" In most cases , Google takes down the links in question , following its own internal procedures . "
But although this is true of services like Blogger , where Google has deleted several music blogs , it 's not clear whether it has the same policies with its search index .
Last October , Google removed links to the Pirate Bay – one of the most notorious illegal BitTorrent trackers – from their search index .
But the link reappeared within days , and the California search gurus claimed the removal was a mistake .
Because Google only indexes sites , listing them in search results but not hosting files , it argues that its hands are clean .
Then again , filesharing services such as Napster and Limewire made similar arguments , asking the courts not to " blame the messengers " .
Those services were were annihilated in court .
Google is unlikely to concede to the same fate .
Before Sesame Street and The Muppet Show , Jim Henson made short films for Big Blue .
The tech may be archaic , but the entertainment is timeless .
IBM .
The Muppets .
Two venerable institutions - but not ones we tend to associate with each other .
Yet in the late 1960s , before most people had ever seen a computer in person or could identify a Muppet on sight , the two teamed up when IBM contracted with Jim Henson for a series of short films designed to help its sales staff .
Little known today , these remain fresh , funny , and surprisingly irreverent .
Henson would return to their gags and situations in his famous later works–and he plucked the Cookie Monster from one of them when assembling the Muppet cast for Sesame Street in 1969 .
Whose idea was this unique collaboration ?
Well , Henson had already established himself in the advertising field .
He was best known at the time for the Muppets ’ guest skits on variety shows and Rowlf the Dog ’s appearances on The Jimmy Dean Show .
But he was busier making a wide array of commercials and longer sales films for regional and national products from Esskay Meats to Marathon Gasoline .
For its own part , IBM was keenly aware that its products –including computers , electric typewriters , and very early word processors–had to be explained to both the public and IBM ’s own employees .
So it formed its own advertising group , including a film and television division .
An executive named David Lazer headed this division , overseeing the production of training and sales films .
According to Henson archivist Karen Falk , the IBM films were produced between 1966 and 1976 , but most of the only confirmed examples date to the 1960s , primarily 1967 .
Jim Henson was the primary puppeteer and director in these projects .
Assisting were the Muppets Inc./ Henson Inc. staffers : Frank Oz ( later to play Miss Piggy , Cookie Monster , and others ) , writer Jerry Juhl ( who co-wrote The Muppet Movie , worked on Fraggle Rock , and scripted classic Ernie and Bert sketches ) , and puppet builder Don Sahlin ( whose credits included George Pal ’s Time Machine ) , among others .
1967 was an interesting time for the team - up : two years before the Muppets ’ national prominence would rise thanks to Sesame Street , and two years after the introduction of IBM ’s Selectric typewriter , an electric device which was crucial in the transition from old Remington typewriters to the modern word processors which would soon make the Selectric look old - fashioned .
Short and Silly Films
The films Henson made for IBM fell into two basic classes .
The first were short comedic “ meeting films , ” which acted as icebreakers or to signal breaks in long corporate , sales , and training meetings .
The second category consisted of longer industrial films which explained IBM ’s products , service , and approach .
Though the industrials look like commercials , their purpose seems to have been to motivate IBM ’s sales team and / or to serve as a primer to potential corporate clients .
The meeting films were comedy bits which could have fit right in on The Muppet Show ( and in fact some would be reworked and repeated on the series ) .
Muppet trademarks , such as characters eating each other or spontaneous explosions , were already in force , as seen in a clip with two businessmen arguing .
Another features an early version of Kermit the Frog , one of only two star Muppets at the time , attempting to deliver a long speech on sales success while intimidated by a gruesome monster .
The third spot , “ Coffee Break Machine , ” is a quintessential Muppet comedy skit ( it was remade twice , for The Ed Sullivan Show and The Muppet Show ) .
It ’s also the first explicit link between the meeting films and IBM ’s products .
The premise is simple , as an elaborate talking computer device ( voiced by Jim Henson ) recites a laundry list of features and components all to produce a single cup of coffee .
A Muppet monster , instantly recognizable as a prototype of Cookie Monster ( but scruffier and with prominent teeth ) , enters and devours the machine piece by piece .
( The monster ’s voraciousness would remain when Cookie showed up on Sesame Street , but a modified toothless puppet would be used instead . )
This entertaining short displays an ambivalent attitude towards technology , showing it as complicated , seemingly pointless , and likely to self - destruct .
Not a message one would expect from IBM , but it shows that the company –despite its reputations as a pretty button - downed place –had a corporate ability to laugh at itself .
IBM Puts on the Dog
When it came to the actual selling of its technological products and services , IBM worked with Henson and crew to produce more sales - driven but still entertaining sales and industrial films .
In an entertaining untitled ten - minute short , Rowlf the Dog ( the other established star Muppet , thanks to his regular stint with Jimmy Dean ) appears as a newly hired IBM salescanine , proudly writing a letter to his mother about his exploits .
Rowlf displays an adeptness at the keyboard which would serve him well years later as The Muppet Show ‘s resident pianist .
Over the course of the film ( divided into parts , with typed out intertitles ) , Rowlf progresses from a standard typewriter to an electric IBM model to finally using a Selectric , complete with shots of the famous “ golf ball ” typing element , which he observes with keen interest .
Comedic bits include Rowlf accidentally breaking a bottle of mimeograph ink , struggling with stairs , and a running gag where the typewriter carriage backs up and knocks over objects .

Well since there is n't a SB Nation LA Galaxy blog , I figured I would find someone uniquely qualified to answer my 3 questions about LA this week .
None other than the # 1 overall pick in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft , the 2004 MLS Cup MVP , the guy it took new RSL head coach less than 3 weeks to trade for in 2007 , and one of the overall good guys to ever play in MLS Alecko Eskandarian .
First , let me thank you for taking some time to answer my 3 questions about the Los Angeles Galaxy , so lets start with the most obvious question :
1 ) LA was a quality side in 2009 finishing at the top of the Western Conference and advancing to the MLS Cup final , but nobody was thinking they would be undefeated after 12 matches of the 2010 season , how would you explain this exceptional start ?
Answer : I am not at all surprised by the great start for the Galaxy this year .
Bruce Arena has done an amazing job reassembling the roster and bringing in players that can contribute right away .
There are some veteran guys who have brought leadership and experience , mixed with younger players who are learning from the older players and getting better every day .
The team improves each day in practice and it pays off at the end of the day with the results they have been getting .
more after the jump :
2 ) Early in the season almost all the attention was on the hot start of Edson and Landon , but now with them gone for a couple weeks to me it seems like the best story of the year might be Michael Stephens , my leading Rookie of the year candidate , his goal and 6 assists have really helped out the team .
What can you tell us about this young rising player ?
Answer : I think Stephens is a very good example of a young player who has come in with a good attitude and taken advantage of the opportunity he was given .
To be honest , I 'm not sure he would have been in the lineup if not for injuries to Dema Kovalenko and some others .
But he stepped in and has really worked hard and made a positive impact in every game he has played .
Now it would be very difficult to see him out of the starting 11 .
Even though his stats look great , I think he has done a great job defensively as well which has earned him the respect of his teammates .
3 ) The Galaxy offense is the top scoring offense in the league , the defense is the stingiest in the league , you have been around MLS for a while now , have you ever seen a more complete team than the current Galaxy squad ?
Answer :
Well its been a great start , but its way too early to compare this team to other teams in MLS history .
I know Bruce and all the players wo n't be satisfied unless they are raising the MLS Cup at the end of the year so they wo n't let this early success get to their heads ..
My old coach Peter Nowak used to always say , " No one ever wins the MLS Cup in May or June " so there is a long way to go .
With that said , this team is very complete and deep , and reminds me of the 2006 DC United team I was on that locked up the Supporter 's Shield in August .
Lots of similarities with both teams having experienced veterans mixed with young talent .
Bonus question :
Who is your pick to win the World Cup ?
Answer : I pick Brazil to win the World Cup !
Thanks again to Alecko for taking time to help me out on this , if you never seen him play , you have missed watching one of the good ones .
I can thank him for one of my fondest MLS memories , it was the DC United match against the new re-branded Red Bulls :
Here are his recent thoughts on that celebration :
Thanks for always being entertaining on and off the pitch .

SENDER 48.000 DISKETTER
I ÅRET : Norske leger bruker utrangert datautstyr
Fastlegene bruker datadisketter som er gått ut av produsksjon .
DISKETT : Norske leger får fortsatt pasientlister på diskett .

Siden fastlegeordningen ble innført i 2001 har norske leger mottatt oppunder én halv million datadisketter .
Hver måned postlegges disketter med oppdaterte pasientlister til landets drøyt 4000 fastleger .
I løpet av et år utgjør det rundt 48.000 disketter .
Listene inneholder bytte , inn- og utmeldinger av fastlegeordningen .
Selv uten endringer sendes disketten ut .
Dyr og gammeldags
- For å være helt ærlig så vet jeg ikke hvorfor vi ikke har gått over til elektronisk utsendelse før , sier avdelingsdirektør i Helsedirektoratet , Steinar Mathisen , til E24 .
- Det koster myndighetene rundt 1,3 millioner kroner å sende ut diskettene hvert år .
- En dyr og gammeldags løsning , fortsetter han .
Mathisen forteller at direktoratet har utviklet en løsning for distribusjon av fastlegelister elektronisk over nett .
Programmet har vært klar til å testes mot legenes journalsystem siden høsten 2009 .

Lover ikke diskett kutt
- Helserefusjonsområdet ble overflyttet fra NAV til Helsedirektoratet 1 . januar 2009 og vi har etter denne overflyttingen prøvd å få fart i denne prosessen .
En elektronisk utsendelse har også vært etterspurt hos Legeforeningen , sier avdelingsdirektøren .

Mathisen venter nå på at leverandørene av legenes journalsystem skal gjøre plass i sine systemer for mottak av listene .
- Journalleverandørene gjør oppdateringer av sine systemer to ganger i året og vi håper på at dette skal komme på plass ved neste oppdatering i oktober .
Men jeg kan ikke gi noen garantier for at det kommer på plass da .
Det er opp til journalleverandørene , legger han til .
Har ventet lenge
Det er legene som betaler for journalsystemene på legekontorene .
Lederen i Allmennlegeforeningen er lite fornøyd med at myndighetene skyver fra seg ansvaret .
- Det er en større gevinst for avsender for enn for mottaker ved å få fortgang i dette .
For legene dreier dette seg om kapasitet og finansiering .
Vi har lenge ventet på en elektronisk løsning for oversendelse av oppdaterte pasientlister , sier leder for foreningen , Trond Egil Hansen , til E24 .
- Det er helt klart at en endring av systemet vil spare myndighetene for betydelige summer .
Allikevel så venter de at fastlengene skal dekke kostnadene forbundet med denne oppgraderingen .

Hansen bekrefter at legene siden 2001 har mottatt månedlige oppdateringer på diskett i posten .
Stopper produksjonen
Lederen i Allmennlegeforeningen forteller at elektronisk mottak av adresselister er bare noe av det som det forvetes at legene skal dekke .
Et annet eksempel er elektronisk resept .
- Det blir litt rart når NAV har et krav om å motta sykemelding og uføresøknader elektronisk , mens kommunikasjon fra dem sendes fortsatt på papir , sier Hansen .
I april kunne Sony melde at de stanser salget av det over 29 år gamle formatet .
Sony oppgir manglende etterspørsel som dødsårsak .

- Det sier seg selv .
Hvis produksjonen av disketter opphører haster det med å finne en løsning , sier Trond Egil Hansen , leder for Allmennlegeforeningen .

Once we had a story about some personal railway , no another Russian hero Leonid Murlyanchik has been building his metro alone since 1984 .
All materials are bought for his retired fee .
Construction is not over yet .
By the way Leonid has all necessary documents and permits for this metro .
An entry to the station .
Here the ceiling is high and the walls are plastered .
Homemade concrete mixer .
Apart from the transport function Leonid is going to plumb the metro and to make fireplugs .
When neighbors want to have metro too , through such niches in the walls the tunnel can be prolonged to them .
The tunnel carries the weight of 60 - tons ’ truck going above .
Backwall .
Soon here will be going full - automated cars , carrying 3 - 4 passengers .
The tunnel deepening for 1 meter takes one day .
Three days more – for concrete casting of the walls and the arch .
It ’s hard to believe that all this has been made by one person only !
A way to the main entry goes along the parallel tunnel .
Everything has been made in accord with safety measures .
And here is Leonid himself – a person who never gives up !
A total rewrite : costly , time - consuming , but worth it ?
Joel Spolsky wrote a famous blog post back in 2000 called " Things You Should Never Do , Part I " , where he wrote the following : " .. the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make :
They decided to rewrite the code from scratch . "
Back in 2005 we found ourselves in a situation where we had to decide the future of our content management system .
We had been developing content management systems since the company was founded in 2000 .
Our CMS was developed using Active Server Pages , and consisted of around 80,000 lines of VBScript code .
It was moderately successful , being one of the leading content management systems in Norway , and we had an international partner network with partners located on all continents .
The vast majority of our partners were located in Europe , US , Canada and Australia .
We landed some high profile clients , for example El - Al , the Israeli national airline , who ran their main website on our CMS for several years , with many million page views per month .
Technically , our solution was very advanced in many areas , but there were some fundamental problems that we struggled with :
The whole administration interface only worked in IE , and it used a lot of client side VBScript .
In 2005 , browser alternatives started to appear ( Firefox 1.0 was released in November 2004 ) .
Creating a standards compliant interface meant rewriting the whole interface .
Since the whole solution had to be easy to run on shared hosting , the whole application was basically a big script , without any external dependencies like COM objects , and far from an n-tier architecture .
So it was hard to maintain and extend .
SQL overload -
Since there was no central point of entry to the database , caching was very hard to do efficiently .
This meant that everything had to access the database on every request .
It was common that a single page view needed somewhere between 10 and 60 SQL , killing scalability .
This is something Drupal still struggles with today , even though they are moving in the right direction .
In addition to the pure technical problems , there were a few other factors that played a role in our eventual decision :
It was starting to become a problem to recruit developers to work on ASP based solutions .
And would we be able to keep the existing developers happy in the future continuing to use ASP ?
We saw a trend that websites were becoming more complex and in many situations more of a web application than a simple informational website .
We wanted a solution that would be flexible enough to be used for these applications , and enable regular CMS users to manage the content in these web applications in the same way they manage the content in the rest of the website .
While some of the ideas were based on technology we had in the existing solution , we took those ideas a lot further .
So in early 2005 we made the decision to reduce development on the old ASP based system to a minimum , and to focus on creating a completely new CMS based on Microsoft .
Net 2.0 , which had just been released as a beta version .
Before the decision , we did consider making the transition gradual , by rewriting the system in .
Net , module by module , and improving the architecture was we went along , but in the end we decided against it , mainly due to the messy nature of such a solution , and the fact that it would be harder to make innovative and breaking changes to the core system .
Some might argue that it 's insane to base such a monumental decision on how elegant a solution is , but remember that we were developing the core of a system that probably would be used for more than a decade .
Any technical debt in the core of the system is bound to come back and bite you - hard .
We started development of an early prototype of the core framework back in February / March 2005 .
Our original timeline was to test parts of the core framework in a project that was due to be launched in September 2005 , and release the first version of the full CMS in the summer of 2006 .
We delivered the project with the prototype framework as promised , but as we continued to develop the rest of the framework , we saw that it took a lot longer than anticipated .
There were several reasons for the delays , but the most important were :
Tight finances .
We 're a relatively small company with finite financial resources .
From the start of the project , the project was financed by profit from the consulting part of the company that implemented our CMS in different web projects , and international license revenue from partners around the world .
This limited progress in the project , but luckily we qualified for R&D grants from Innovation Norway , several years in a row , which helped quite a bit .
It gave us the required time to make the base framework very solid and well - thought out .
R&D is time consuming and difficult to estimate .
When we started the project , the goal was to create a new system that would fix the shortcomings in the old CMS , and be prepared for the changes in the marketplace that we anticipated .
How to do that , and exactly what had to be developed was n?t clearly specified .
We had some ideas on what the system had to be capable of , but it 's a long way from an idea to a complete and tested feature .
This resulted in a lot research of various technologies and writing quick prototypes to test various implementations .
Feature creep .
The lack of a clear specification also made it hard to limit feature creep .
Since we did n't have a clear picture on how the different features would be implemented , we often discovered that when we implemented one feature , it " forced " us to implement another feature .
We started the pilot project on the new CMS in October 2006 .
It was due to launch before Christmas 2006 .
In the end we launched it in March 2007 .
By that time , the framework was fairly stable , but the CMS user interface was very raw , and it missed a lot of functionality that we had in the old CMS .
Truth be told , it was also quite buggy .
But it was mainly the editors that noticed the rough state of the CMS .
It 's still online today , using a much improved version of our CMS .
Since the first project launched in 2007 , more than two hundred web projects using our new CMS have been completed in Norway .
During those projects , the system has gradually matured and grown .
The experience we gained from using the system for real projects from such an early stage has been invaluable in the later stages of development .
Looking back at all those projects , it has been a very difficult and challenging period , especially in the beginning , but we 're finally in a position where we 're very happy with our product .
During the last couple of years we 've seen that the difficult decisions we made back in 2005 and 2006 are starting to pay off .
Conclusion
Do we think Joel was correct that a rewrite is " the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make " ?
Not categorically , but we experienced a lot of the hardship and trouble that he talks about , so we can easily see how many companies could get into trouble during such a process .
If the board of directors had known in 2005 that we would n't be ready to re-launch in the international market until 2010 , I doubt we would have gotten the green light for the project .
But now we clearly see that the end result is so much better than if we had done a gradual transition .
That might not be true in all cases .
We had a clear idea on how we wanted to improve the existing solution .
If you ?re rewriting an application just to change platform , without any fundamental improvements that would be hard to do in your existing codebase , I agree totally with Joel .
This fits together with another quote from Joel :
" It 's important to remember that when you start from scratch there is absolutely no reason to believe that you are going to do a better job than you did the first time . "
If this is true , then a rewrite of an existing application will always be a huge mistake .
Joel is basically saying that developers do n't benefit from previous experience , a notion that I think is plainly wrong ...
All the good developers I 've ever worked with have been more than capable of seeing what works and what does n't work in a solution , and would have been able to do a better job on the second try .
In our case , the technological shift from VBScript to .
Net was also a major factor in making the end result much , much better than the old version .
There are also other examples of total rewrites that have been successful .
Apple 's transition to OS X is a very good example .
The classic Mac OS was an operating system with some good ideas , but the core architecture had a lot of problems .
Did Apple make a bad decision to start from scratch with OS X ?
I do n't think so .
They brought over and improved the best bits from OS 9 , and merged it with the solid Darwin core ( much like we did ) .
During and after the switch , they had a few rough years , but since the launch of OS X , they have been on a more or less constant upwards trend .
With the international launch of Webnodes.com behind us , I 'm confident we 'll follow the same trajectory .
What do you think ?
Did we make a mistake in rewriting the whole system ?
In the coming weeks we 'll go into more detail on the different features we 've developed in WAF ( Webnodes Adaptive Framework ) .
Eco-friendly and green living has become all the rage lately , and for good reason .
We only have one planet , and we need to look after it if our grandchildren and other generations are going to enjoy the same privileged lives we do today .
It does n’t matter if you own a web design agency or a small beauty salon – we all have a responsibility to make our offices as environmentally friendly as possible .
Luckily , there are numerous ways to do this , and I ’ve outlined a few of my favourites below .
Create Monthly Challenges
If your office is a friendly , laid back place , you could consider creating fun monthly challenges to encourage eco-friendly practices .
There are a few different ways to approach this , but the general idea is to make things fun so that your employees actually want to do their best .
One example that I particularly like is seeing who can produce the least waste over the course of a week or a month .
Give every employee their own waste bin , and encourage them to recycle wherever possible .
If you want , you could reward the winner with some sort of novelty price , such as being “ king of the office ” for a day .
Use Indoor Plants
The environment within the office is often stuffy and the air tends to be pretty stale , especially if you do n’t have decent ventilation .
Luckily , this is pretty easily solved by buying a few indoor plants , which will act as natural air filters , removing impurities and keeping your office fresh .

TOKYO – Prime Minister Kan Naoto in his first policy speech on June 13 stated that his new Cabinet will “ bring about a ‘ strong economy , ’ ‘ robust public finances ’ and a ‘ strong social security system ’ in an integrated manner . ”
We now see both Japan ’s economy and national finances in a weak condition , and the general public has the earnest desire to have the government strengthen them .
In the economy , public finances and social security , the LDP ( Liberal Democratic Party ) - Komei governments kept giving out wrong “ prescriptions , ” which made conditions increasingly worse .
What the new government should do now is , therefore , to provide new prescriptions and get rid of the cause of the disease that seriously damaged our country in these areas .
‘ A third way ’
In the policy speech , Kan emphasized he will pursue a “ third way ” that he said is different from the political direction of previous governments .
However , when he talks about a “ strong economy , ” “ robust public finances ” and a “ strong social security , ” it is only a higher consumption tax rate and lower corporate taxes that the Prime Minister is attempting to achieve .
This clearly indicates that the new DPJ ( Democratic Party of Japan ) - led government will keep the same course as that the previous DPJ - led government and the former LDP - Komei governments took .
In fact , while describing their “ growth strategy ” at a press conference on June 9 , Naoshima Masayuki , minister of economy , trade and industry , said , “ The corporate tax rate needs to be lowered about 15 percent .
To begin with , we will reduce it by five percent in the next fiscal year . ”
Hosono Goshi , acting secretary general of the DPJ , on June 11 also announced the party will include “ cutting corporate taxes ” as one of its campaign promises for the upcoming House of Councilors election .
In addition , Finance Minister Noda Yoshihiko on June 8 explained that the Prime Minister ’s pledge for a “ drastic reform of the country ’s tax system ” “ will obviously be applied to the consumption tax . ”
According to the policy speech , the government will pursue a growth strategy by curbing wasteful expenditures and stabilizing social services through a sound national finance resulting from tax system reform with the result of promising relief to those in need .
This scenario , however , seems to be a “ pie in the sky . ”
On the Futenma base issue for the U.S. forces , the government will increase the huge enormous military budget to construct a large military base at Henoko in Nago City at the U.S. request instead of reducing the military budget .
Far from correcting excessive tax breaks for large corporations and the very rich , the government is planning a further tax cut for large corporations .
The government is going to increase wasteful spending , and no sound finance and elimination of wastes are possible unless the military budget and tax cuts for large corporations and the rich are redressed .
The substance of the DPJ “ growth strategy ” looks just like that of the Liberal Democratic - Komei government : increasing the gap between the extremely rich and the rest of society .
The pension system that the DPJ is proposing as part of social services reform is thinly disguised a mechanism to shift the cost of pension premiums borne by large corporations to the general public by increasing the consumption tax rate .
The government is going to maintain the discriminatory medical service system for elderly people aged 75 and over for another three years , thus breaking the DPJ public promise to abolish the discriminatory system .
What is worse , the government is going to lower the age of applicability to 65 , thus expanding the scope of the system .
It is the quickest way to increase social unrest , not relief .
On June 8 , soon after the new DPJ leadership was established , Secretary General Edano Yukio and acting Secretary General Hosono Goshi paid a courtesy visit to the Japan Business Federation ( Nippon Keidanren ) .
Hosono stated that the DPJ is preparing a growth strategy in accordance with the demands of Nippon Keidanren .
Party that can speak for people against business circles
If “ strong economy , national finance , and social services ” mean a strong and reliable government representing the interests of business circles and large corporations , nothing good can be expected for the general public .
The DPJ government , just as the LDP - Komei government , gives priority to the interests of business circles and large corporations over the concerns of people ’s living conditions .
The key to defend people ’s livelihoods and gain a sound economic recovery is installing a government that can stand up to the self - centered interests of the United States and the Japanese business circles .

Deflating the universe
Warning :
This blogpost has been posted over two years ago .
That is a long time in development - world !
The story here may not be relevant , complete or secure .
Code might not be complete or obsoleted , and even my current vision might have ( completely ) changed on the subject .
So please do read further , but use it with caution .
Compression is used all around us every single day .
You ( or your girlfriend / wife most likely ) folds your clothes nicely so they all fit in your closet .
When recycling , you flatten the cardboard milkboxes so they take up less space and you probably even text your friends with messages like : “ hi , how r u ? w r u? cya , xxx ” .
Stuff like that .
In the computer world , compression probably plays even a more important factor .
When compressing data , it take less space and thus less time to send it over to somebody else through internet .
Years ago , you bought a 100 MB harddrive and use special software to increase the capacity to ( up to ) 200 MB ( doublespace , stackspace for those who can remember ) .
It all uses compression one way or the other .
Some compression methods can compress and decompress in such a way that the decoded output is exactly the same as the original .
For instance , gzip and deflate .
It ’s called lossless compression since no data is lost during the compression / decompression .
Other compression methods do n’t .
For instance , JPEG or MP3 compression creates smaller copies of the original but they can never be decompressed back to the original format .
Colors that are very similar ( but not quite the same ) are converted into 1 single color during JPEG compression .
Or inaudible sounds are removed from an audio file when compressing to an MP3 .
With JPEG or MP3 ’s , for most people this is not an issue .
The images are perfect enough for normal usage , and the audio quality of mp3’s are also good enough for the average use ( although I know a few persons who want to kill me for saying this :) ) .
In this article I will talk a bit about the deflate compression method .
A compression method used throughout the whole internet and probably the most used compression algorithm today .
Deflating GZIP
First about gzip .
GZIP itself is a file format , not a compression method .
It ’s used on many platforms and has many purposes .
It consists of a binary header and afterwards the actual compressed data .
The compression used in GZIP is the deflate compression algorithm so when talking about gzip , you are actually talking about deflate but with some extra stuff added to it .
More on the gzip file format can be found on http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-gzip.html#file-format.
Deflate Deflate is used in many things .
For instance : PNG files are compressed with it and the webserver
you just received this page from , compresses this page prior to sending it to you ( the “ content - encoding : gzip ” ) .
It ’s also part of gzip as said which is used as de facto compression method for files on linux ( although bzip2 can compress even better ) .
The deflate algorithm can be found on http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1951, but it ’s a little complicated when you never have dealt with it .
It basically a mixture of two different compression techniques merged into one :
duplicate string elimination compression though huffman coding ( trees )
Duplicate string elimination , Duplicate string elimination
By duplicate string elimination we mean that when you have duplicate strings in the code ( for instance : AAAAA ) , you can also specify ( 5xA ) , which tells the decompression it has to print 5 x the A .
Sounds simple enough and this is a very good elimination when compression files like html files , source codes or human text since a lot of repetitions are bound to happen in those files .
Duplication elimination removes the duplicate content and replaces it with a sort of internal command : copy L times the bytes found D positions back .
( where L stands for length , and D stands for distance )
An example :
< html > < title > Test </ title > </html >
There are 2 repetitions here : html > and title > .
The software can detect this and tells on the second line to use a length of 6 bytes in a distance of 12 bytes .
Test </[ 6;12]</ strong >
12 bytes back , we are on the ‘ t ’ of
.
We copy the next 6 bytes et voila , we have : Test :)
The [ 6; 12 ] part is probably encoded in less space ( say : 1 byte ) , so in the end we just have saved 5 bytes by eliminating strings ( the same goes for the duplicate ‘ html > ’ string ) .
How this is incorporated into deflate we will see later on .
Huffman trees
Deflate uses the huffman coding for compression .
It basically boils down to this : the characters most used in the original file , gets the least amount of bits inside the compressed file .
How many bits a certain character gets , is stored in a lookup table called the alphabet ( or huffman tree , the same thing ) .
Since each file is different , we use different alphabets for different files ( we could even have different alphabets in the same file ! ) .
So , before we can do any decoding , we must read the alphabet ( there are actually 2 of them ) .
To make matters a bit more complex ( we are dealing with a serious stuff here of course ) , the alphabet itself is stored compressed , using ANOTHER alphabet .
This alphabet is luckely known since it ’s always the same alphabet ( and must be hardcoded in the ( de ) compression routines ) .
Let ’s start with a simple example :
Suppose we have to following alphabet , taken from the input string ‘ DEADBEEFFE ’ ( how we have made this alphabet is not important for now ) :
D 2 bits : 01 A 4 bits : 0010 F 4 bits : 0001 B 4 bits : 0011 E 1 bit : 1
This alphabet consists out of 5 characters ( from A to F , without the C ) .
As you can see , the E is used the most time , and thus has gotten the least amount of bits .
the D comes in second ( with 2 bits ) .
The reason we do n’t use 3 bits for the ‘ F ’ for instance , is that we get an overlap .
Suppose the F would be encoded like ‘ 001 ’ .
How would we know if we either have found an ‘ F’ OR if it ’s part of the A or B ( because both start with ‘ 001 ’ as well .
The encoder must make sure the bits do n’t “ overlap ” like this and the best way is to see the alphabet as a tree - structure ( hence : an huffman tree )
As long as a node has a branch , it cannot contain a character .
It ’s up to the encoder to make sure the alphabet is created correctly .
Now , with this alphabet the encoding and decoding of the string is easy .
For encoding : read a byte , seek it in the tree while adding the bits to the output .
For decoding : get bits from the compressed file , follow it down the tree until you hit a character and there place that character in the output .
With this tree , you can compress the ‘ DEADBEEFFE ’ string into this
D: 01 E : 1 A : 0010 D : 01 B : 0011 E : 1 E : 1 F : 0001 F : 0001 E : 1
Which gives use the bit string of :
01 1 0010 01 0011 1 1 0001 0001 1
and grouped into bytes :
0110 0100 | 1001 1110 | 0010 0011 6 4 9 E 2 3 ( hex code )
We just compressed a 10 byte string into 3 bytes !
The string “ DEADBEEFFE ” is the same as 0x64 0x9E and 0x23 !
Decompressing is also relative simple .
Just read a bit from the bitstream and follow down the tree until you hit a character ( or until the tree ends , in that case you have a incorrect file ! )
First bit : 0
since bit 0 on the top of the tree has 2 branches , read the next bit
next read : 1
That branch does not have any other branches and just contains the value D. Output the ‘ D ’ and start over :
first bit : 1
There is one possibility : the E. output the ‘ E ’ and start over ..
at the end , we get our string DEADBEEFFE back !
Compression is not really that hard after all ! :)
Deflating blocks
The deflate format compresses data into blocks .
Each block has it ’s own method of compression .
There are 3 different ones , so your decompressor needs to be ready for all three of them .
Each block has a 3 bit header which tells you if it ’s the last block ( most of the time , there is only one block inside the file , so it ’s automatically the last block .
That got me debugging the thing for a while until I figured that one out ) .
The next 2 bits tells you which compression method is used .
Allthough a maximum of 4 are possible , 1 is reserved so only 3 are left :
This block is literal data .
It ’s not compressed
This block is compressed with a STATIC huffman tree .
This block is compressed with a DYNAMIC huffman tree .
reserved .
You should not encounter this .
Method 1 is the easiest to decompress .
The next 2 bytes holds the length of the uncompressed data so the input can be passed directly to the output .
Useful for encoding blocks that are already encoded .
Method 4 should never happen .
If this is the case , you might have stumbled onto either a new kind of deflate format or an error in the file .
Either way , you cannot decode it so return with an error .
Methods 2 and 3 are the actual meat of the compression .
The huffman coding .
The only difference between method 2 and 3 is that method 2 uses a static huffman tree .
This means the alphabets that are needed to decode the file are not present in the encoded file , but a general one is used .
This one can be found in the RFC .
This saves a lot of room since we do n’t have to incorporate the alphabet , but it might give us a less than optimal compression .
It ’s up to the compressor to decide whether or not it ’s viable to compress with the fixed tree or not .
The dynamic huffman compression means we first have to get the alphabets that are used to compress the block .
These alphabets are stored before the data BUT are in itself encoded ( to save room obviously ) .
The alphabet used to encode this data is fixed ( but is not the same as the one used for fixed huffman compression ) and can be found in the RFC ( it ’s an easy one actually ) .
Now ..
As seen above , an alphabet can have a number nodes .
A binary file consists of bytes ranging from 0 to 255 , so we need at least 256 nodes in our tree .
However , here are more : 288 in total to be exactly .
This is because the first alphabet is a mixture of 2 different alphabets :
The literal alphabet and a length alphabet ( we look at that later ) .
The first 256 characters are literals .
The rest from the characters are lenghts .
When your decompressor decodes a character between 0 and 255 , it means that this is a literal character from the original file .
You can place this directly into the output buffer .
A character 256 means this is the end of the block .
the block is done when you hit this character .
The characters 286 and 287 are reserved and you should not encounter them .
All characters between 257 and 285 are “ length ” characters and here is where the “ string duplication ” comes into play .
Decompressing lengths and distances
When character 257 or higher is found , it means the character is not a literal but a “ length ” .
Namely the length of the string we need to duplicate .
character 257 means the length is 3 characters , 258 means the length is 4 characters .
From character 265 and up things get special again .
This character means : use the length of 11 PLUS the next bit .
This bit can either be 0 or 1 , and you have to add it to the length .
So character 265 + the next bit 0 means a length of 11 , the character 265 + next bit 1 means use length 12 .
Further down the line the bits we need to read extra gets higher and thus the length range gets higher as well : character 282 has to read 5 extra bits and can createa a length of between 163 and 194 .
These distances can be found on http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/RFC-1951#codes
Notice that the maximum length can be 258 bytes ( when using character 285 ) .
This means , when the compressor has to duplicate a string of 300 bytes , it must either use character 285 ( no extra bits ) for the first 258 bytes and character273 plus 3 ‘ 1 ’ - bits so it knows it has to use length 42 , OR it can use the codes for 2 x 150 , or 3 x 100 , etc .. depending on what the compressor thinks ( or knows ) is shorter , that one will be used ) .
We now know the length we need to duplicate , not WHERE the string is we need to duplicate .
This can be found in the other alphabet we have decoded earlier called the distance alphabet .
This is also a fixed alphabet when we use the fixed huffman encoding .
The distance alphabet works the same way as the length alphabet .
There are 32 characters ( ranging from 0 to 29 plus 2 reserved entries ) .
Character 0 means the distance is 1 byte .
Character 3 means the distance is 4 bytes .
From character 4 to 29 , we have to read more bits again to decide how big the distance is .
For instance , character 26 is followed by 12 bytes and it can hold a distance from 8193 to 12288 .
The maximum distance we can have is 32768 bytes back .
Which means 2 things :
Make sure you keep a record of the last 32768 bytes outputted ( since you might have to read them back ) .
2 . Duplicating contents further away than 32768 bytes in the original fill will not be compressed by string duplication elimination .
There can not be 2 “ distances ” right after each other , just like you can with the “ length ” characters .
Know your alphabet
It ’s not necessary for the encoder to send over ALL characters in an alphabet .
When some characters are not used the node is left empty and used by something else .
Either way , the alphabet gets smaller .
So it can happen that the literal alphabet is only 16 chars long instead of 256 .
This happens when you have only 16 distinct character in your file .
Same goes for the lenght and distance alphabets .
This all again in the sake of sending as few bits over as possible .
The alphabets are prefixed with some info about how many characters ( literals , lenghts , distances etc ) are inside the alphabets .
Encoding through deflate means knowing how to find the correct alphabet .
This can be done statistically ( the ‘ E ’ is more used then the ‘ Q ’ in english , so the ‘ E ’ gets less bits ) , or by actually reading the file and creating percentages for all characters .
Since the latter will take time but creates a better compression , you can specify the amount of work the encoder will do when creating the alphabets .
This is the ‘ - 1 ’ to ‘ - 9 ’ parameter you sometimes see when using gzip ( ie : gzip - 9 myfile. txt ) .
The - 9 means : do the most amount of work to get the best alphabet .
As you can deduce : the amount of work spend on ENCODING a file , does not necessarily means that the amount of work DECODING the file will also be higher .
It ’s still an alphabet , only better equiped for the current job .
Conclusion
Compression algorithms are hard in general .
The main effort is to save as much space as possible and normally a tradeoff will be that more has to be done by the processor to compute the original values .
There are a lot of libraries out there capable of handling gzip / deflate data like libz , and even php has it ’s gzip_decode ( ) functionality .
The reason I ’ve dived into deflate / huffman coding was not only for fun and gaining knowledge , but also for my own hobby OS project that can load a gzipped kernel .
By reading the RFC ’s for gzip and deflate , you gain a lot of information but I found that the best way of getting to KNOW huffman and deflate is by viewing the source of David Madore www.madore.org/~david/programs/selfrep/selfunc.c
so a big thanks goes out to him .
Please , since I do not know everything about deflate / huffman yet , chances are somebody will probably spot an error or 2 .
Please mail me or leave a comment .
I received my gift today ... after a long boring day at work it was a welcome surprise .
It 's a Portable Camp fire complete with Grill .
The grill came as an object that looked like a flute and after opening and setting it up I could now light a fire and roast hot dogs ...
The portability of it is awesome because I can throw it in the glove box of our Side - by - Side and always be able to grab a hot bite when were out playin ' in the dirt .
Thank you for the thoughtful gift , I will be the envy of my Muddin ' Crew .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N , the largest U.S. home funding companies , will delist their shares on the New York Stock Exchange after Fannie Mae fell below and Freddie Mac held near minimum price requirements , the companies ' regulator said on Wednesday .
The companies , each taken under government control in September 2008 , said they no longer met NYSE listing standards and that shares would trade in the over - the - counter market .
The regulator , the Federal Housing Finance Agency , directed the companies to delist common and preferred stock from the NYSE and any other national securities exchange .
It said the delisting order was not taken due to the companies ’ performance .
“ FHFA ’s determination to direct each company to delist does not constitute any reflection on either Enterprise ’s current performance or future direction , nor does delisting imply any other findings or determination on the part of FHFA as regulator or conservator , ” FHFA Acting Director Edward DeMarco said in a statement .
Stock exchange requirements for maintaining price levels and curing deficiencies were the driving force for moving to delist , he said .
Common shares of each company have hovered near the NYSE required minimum average closing price of $ 1 for more than 30 trading days and for most months since the conservatorships began in September 2008 .
Fannie
Mae ’s closing stock price has recently been below the required average price , which would mean either delisting or a “ cure ” to restore the price .
Curing would not assure maintaining the minimum or avoiding loss of shareholder value , according to the regulator .
Freddie Mac ’s shares had been holding just above the minimum .
“ A voluntary delisting at this time simply makes sense and fits with the goal of a conservatorship to preserve and conserve assets , ” said DeMarco .
In NYSE trading in late morning on Wednesday , Fannie Mae ’s shares traded around 45 cents , down 51 percent , and Freddie ’s shares were quoted at about 61 cents , down 50 percent .
“ If you run the numbers there is no value for shareholders , ” said Malcolm Polley , president and chief investment officer at Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana , Pennsylvania , which does not own shares in either company .
“ For them to even be trading on an exchange I think is ludicrous . ”
The two companies have tapped more than $ 145 billion combined in federal aid , and have an open credit line with the Treasury Department through 2012 .
The government is relying heavily on them to stabilize the U.S. housing market after the worst crash since the Great Depression .
But record foreclosures and defaults ate away at the companies ’ capital , leading them into conservatorship .
The long - term fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is in question , as Congress next year is expected to begin overhauling the entire U.S. housing finance system .
That process could take years to play out .
“ I think this is a technical action rather than a meaningful action , ” said Michael Youngblood , principal , Five Bridges Capital LLC in Bethesda , Maryland .
“ There is no consensus within the ( Obama ) Administration on the future of the agencies . ”
The OTC trading is expected to start around July 8 .
Fannie
Mae said in a statement that the switch should not affect its ability to provide liquidity and stability to the mortgage market , or its focus on foreclosure - prevention and refinancing under the Making Home Affordable Program .
Freddie Mac said it expects its shares will be quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board “ so long as market makers demonstrate an interest ” in trading the securities .
“ The stocks are traded by appointment only .
I ca n’t see this will meaningfully affect the holders of their stocks , ” Youngblood said .
Both companies said they will still file periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission .
It ’s commonly thought that a market - liberal political economy is best for the rich while a social - democratic one is best for the poor .
Some recent research suggests reason to question this .
Analyses by Willem Adema of the OECD , by Adema and Maxime Ladaique , and by Price Fishback conclude that the quantity of social expenditures in the United States is similar to or greater than in Denmark and Sweden , two nations long considered large - welfare - state exemplars . *
How so ?
Government social transfers account for a much larger share of GDP in Sweden and Denmark .
But the U.S. government distributes more benefits in the form of tax breaks rather than transfers than do the two Nordic countries ; Denmark and Sweden tax back a larger portion of public transfers than the United States does ; private social expenditures , such as those on employment - based health insurance and pensions , are greater in the U.S. ; and America ’s per capita GDP is larger .
The standard indicator of social policy effort is gross public social expenditures as a percentage of GDP .
Denmark and Sweden are much higher than the United States on this measure .
Now shift to net ( rather than gross ) public and private ( rather than public alone ) expenditures per person ( rather than as a percentage of GDP , with purchasing power parities used to convert Danish and Swedish kroner into U.S. dollars ) .
According to the calculations by Adema and Ladaique ( Fishback ’s are similar ) , we get a very different picture .
By this measure the U.S. is the biggest spender .
This looks like good news for the poor in the United States .
Is it ?
Unfortunately , no .
These adjustments change the story with respect to the aggregate quantity of resources spent on social protection in the three countries , but they have limited bearing on redistribution and on the living standards of the poor .
Begin with tax breaks .
Researchers count as “ social ” those designed to provide support in circumstances that adversely affect people ’s well - being .
In the United States these disproportionately go to the affluent and the middle class .
The chief ones are tax advantages for employer and employee contributions to private health insurance and private pensions .
These do little to help people at the low end of the distribution , who often work for employers that do n’t provide health or retirement benefits .
One valuable tax benefit for low - income households is the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , but it is already included in the standard OECD data on government social expenditures .
Another is the child tax credit , but it is non-refundable and so of limited value to low - income households , many of whom do n’t owe any federal income tax .
Next consider tax “ clawbacks ” in the Nordic countries .
Public transfer programs in Denmark and Sweden tend to be “ universal ” in design : a large share of the population is eligible for the benefit .
This is thought to boost public support for such programs .
But it renders them very expensive .
To make them more affordable , the government claws back some of the benefit by taxing it as though it were regular income .
All countries do this , including the United States , but the Nordic countries do it more extensively .
Does that hurt their poor ?
Very little .
The tax rates tend to increase with household income , so much of the tax clawback hits middle - and upper - income households .
What ’s the impact of private social spending ?
In the U.S. this accounts for roughly two - fifths of all social expenditures .
It consists mainly of employer contributions to health insurance and employment - based pension benefits .
Here too the picture changes a great deal on average , but not much for the poor .
Employer - based health insurance and pension plans reach few low - income households .
So how well - off are the poor in the United States , with its “ hidden welfare state , ” compared to social - democratic Denmark and Sweden ?
One measure is average posttransfer - posttax ( “ disposable ” ) income among households in the bottom decile of the income distribution .
Here are my calculations using the best available comparative data , from the Luxembourg Income Study ( LIS ) .
( The numbers are adjusted for household size .
They refer to a household with a single adult .
For a family of four , multiply by two . )
This is a pretty big difference , not in America ’s favor .
In his paper , Fishback cites similar numbers from the OECD .
He cautions , though , that “ One advantage the poor Americans would have had in spending their disposable income is that they face consumption tax rates in the 4 to 7 percent range , while consumption taxes in the Nordic countries are above 20 percent . ”
Actually , consumption tax rates are incorporated in the purchasing power parities ( PPPs ) used to convert incomes to a common currency , so these income figures already adjust for differences in consumption taxes .
What ’s the source of this cross-country difference in the incomes of low - end households ?
It ’s entirely a function of government transfers .
Again using the LIS data , I ’ve calculated mid-2000s averages for households in the bottom income decile for the three chief sources of household income : earnings , net government transfers ( transfers received minus taxes paid ) , and “ other ” income ( money from family or friends , alimony , etc. ) .
Average earnings are virtually identical across the three countries , at about $ 2,500 .
The same is true for “ other ” income , which averages around $ 500 in each of the three .
Where bottom - decile Danish and Swedish households fare much better than their American counterparts is in net government transfers :
Fishback rightly points to one other key difference between these countries : “ Public services not counted in disposable income , like health care and education , likely are better for the very poor in the Nordic countries than in the United States . ”
It ’s difficult to measure the impact of services on living standards with any precision .
One indirect way to assess their effect is to switch from income to material deprivation .
Two OECD researchers , Romina Boarini and Marco Mira d’Ercole , have compiled material deprivation data from surveys in various rich nations as of the mid-2000s .
Each of the surveys asked identical or very similar questions about seven indicators of material hardship : inability to adequately heat one ’s home , constrained food choices , overcrowding , poor environmental conditions ( e.g. , noise , pollution ) , arrears in payment of utility bills , arrears in mortgage or rent payment , and difficulty in making ends meet .
Boarini and Mira d’Ercole create a summary measure of deprivation by averaging , for each country , the shares of the population reporting deprivation on questions in each of these seven areas .
Government services — medical care , child care , housing , transportation , and so on — reduce material hardship directly .
They also free up income to be spent on other needs .
The comparative data , though by no means perfect , are consistent with the hypothesis that public services help the poor more in the Nordic countries than in the United States .
The gap between the countries in material deprivation is larger than in low - end incomes .
Helping the poor is not , of course , the only thing we want from social spending .
But it surely is one thing .
The United States spends more money on social protection than is often thought , yet that spending does n’t do nearly as much to help America ’s poor as we might like .
For those interested , I ’m finishing up a book manuscript that looks at this issue and related ones in more detail .

The spill is the worst environmental disaster in US history
A BP document has revealed the company estimated that 100,000 barrels of oil a day could , in theory , flow from the ruptured Gulf of Mexico well .
That amount , included in an undated internal document released by US Congressman Ed Markey , is nearly twice the current US estimate of the leak .
BP says the 100,000 figure is not relevant as it is not based on reality .
US lawmakers have repeatedly accused BP of not being straightforward about the true size of the spill .
Mr Markey - a senior Democrat and chairman of one of the committees investigating the Gulf spill - said the document raised troubling questions about what BP knew about the size of the spill and when they knew it .
" First they said it was only 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels , now we 're up to 100,000 barrels , " he told NBC's Meet the Press programme .
Mr Markey , who has been one of BP 's fiercest critics over its handling of the crisis , said the figures indicated the firm was " either lying or grossly incompetent " .
A BP spokesman said the claims were " misrepresenting " what the oil giant had said about the leak - the worst environmental disaster in US history .
BP says the worst - case scenario figure of 100,000 barrels a day was irrelevant because it was based on what might happen if the well 's blowout preventer was removed , which the company had no plans to do .
Oil has been gushing into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded off the US coast on 20 April , killing 11 people .
BP has agreed to put aside $ 20 bn ( £ 13.5 bn ) to compensate victims of the oil spill .
It has also fitted a containment cap and another device to the well head , which are capturing an estimated 25,000 barrels of oil a day
‘ True Blood ’ Opener Brings In Huge Ratings
HBO vampire drama True Blood brought in 6.4 million total viewers for its season 3 premiere — up 38 percent from last season ’s average .
Obviously the show ’s presence is much greater now than it was a year ago , thanks in part to cast and crew working the convention circuits , which no doubt adds invaluable buzz for geekier fiction shows as demonstrated in the past .
But it ’s also due to an increased attention to all vampire fiction caused by Twilight — the set of books by Stephanie Meyers turned movies .
While True Blood is definitely much more mature , it seems like the producers are well aware of this new female audience and aim to keep them interested well through the end of the season .
[ NOTE : Light spoilers ahead for anyone who wishes to avoid them . ]
But before you dispel my claim consider those lingering shots of Bon Temps Vampire Sheriff Eric ’s naked man-ass , which were a tad ( ok , extremely ) unnecessary otherwise .
And , what about Sam Merlotte ’s ( Sam Trammell ) dream - sequence where Bill Compton ( Stephen Moyer ) invites him into the shower just as the two men are about to kiss .
There ’s also the whole sensitive male characters not being able to satisfy horny attractive out - of - town women because they ’re too emotional ?
And least I forget , the introduction of werewolves .
But all that aside , pretty much everything in the first episode of the season was applicable to advance the story forward .
The show is still capable of being entertaining on par with last year .
Still , I ’m thinking Sunday ’s ratings are just a taste of what ’s to come .

( CNN ) --
Some of the first accounts emerged Tuesday from eyewitnesses who were aboard several boats stormed by Israeli forces as they approached Gaza the day before .
Hanin Zoabi , a member of the Israeli parliament , was on board the Miva Marmara , the ship that was the scene of a confrontation between activists and Israeli soldiers .
That clash left at least nine people dead .
The Israeli Navy fired on the ships five minutes before commandos descended from ropes that dangled from helicopters , Zoabi said during a press conference in Nazareth , Israel .
She said passengers on board the ship were unarmed .
Were you there ?
Send us your story , images , video
Israel has said its forces found several weapons among the passengers on the Miva Marmara .
Israel also has said that its forces started shooting after passengers on the Miva Marmara assaulted them .
Zoabi said the military operation lasted about an hour and that she saw five dead bodies in that time .
She urged Israeli authorities to investigate and to let the news media interview passengers who have been detained .
Zoabi said she believes Israel has video footage of how the ten passengers were killed , and she called on Israeli authorities to release that footage .
Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has said that of the six ships in the flotilla , the people prepared an ambush on one , a reference to the Turkish ship .
But on the other five , " the people got off without a scratch . "
Huwaida Arraf , one of the Free Gaza Movement organizers , told CNN Israeli troops roughed her up when they responded aggressively to her ship , a smaller one in the flotilla that was near the Turkish vessel where the casualties occurred .
" They started coming after our ship , " she told CNN , " so we took off and they charged us also .
Eventually , they overtook our ship and they used concussion grenades , sound bombs and pellets . "
She said the people on her ship tried to keep them off .
She said they were told the vessel was American and the people aboard were unarmed .
But , she said " they started beating people .
My head was smashed against the ground and they stepped on my head .
They later cuffed me and put a bag over my head .
They did that to everybody . "
Her account could not be independently verified .

I was recently talking to my girlfriend about if we ever moved and needed to find jobs , where the most likely place would be to find work as an electrical engineer .
It was interesting talking out cities that may or may not sync up with places she could find a job .
Now , I do n’t have much interest in leaving my current job , and while I hope to work on my own some day , I ’m still quite dependent on employers for my livelihood .
So I did the fast / easy thing and went to Indeed.com and checked available positions under “ electrical engineer ” .
Simple enough .
So where are the technical jobs these days ?
( obviously this data is meant to change over time )
San Diego , CA ( 1059 ) Houston , TX ( 970 ) San Jose , CA ( 723 ) New York , NY ( 670 ) Santa Clara , CA ( 571 ) Phoenix , AZ ( 564 ) Washington , DC ( 543 ) Austin , TX ( 539 ) Sunnyvale , CA ( 529 ) Chicago , IL ( 472 ) Dallas , TX ( 471 ) Fort Meade , MD ( 424 ) Atlanta , GA ( 384 ) Los Angeles , CA ( 377 )
The number in the parentheses are the number of positions listed online .
It ’s fair to assume some significant number of those are repeats ( Indeed.com is a scraper , not some manual entry site ) , but we can assume that all the cities listed have a proportionate number of repeat listings .
It ’s also interesting – but not surprising –to note that certain areas are dense enough with jobs and location ( i.e. silicon valley ) that three of those cities ( 3 , 5 , 9 ) only show up as one tag .
Now , this is n’t to say these are the best jobs or the easiest to fill nor does it even point out how varied the positions can be !
For example , an embedded developer and an analog system engineer might all be under the title “ electrical engineer “ .
If you have experience working on electronics on an oil rig you ’re much more likely to get a job in Houston than Fort Meade , regardless of how many jobs are available in either location .
But these numbers do point out where there is a considerable enough chunk of industry to have this many job listings .
So I ask you to respond in the shiny new comments section : are these really the only areas employers are hiring these days ?
Is there a significant long tail that I ’m not seeing on Indeed ? ( i.e. 30 more cities with 250 listings each ? )
Are there any obviously booming spots that are left off the map ?
What about outside the good ol ’ U S of A ?
I know there are a couple of readers , writers and witty commenters from outside my home country .
Looking forward to your responses !
Image caption Alfalfa is mostly used for cattle feed
The bio -tech company Monsanto can sell genetically modified seeds before safety tests on them are completed , the US Supreme Court has ruled .
A lower court had barred the sale of the modified alfalfa seeds until an environmental impact study could be carried out .
But seven of the nine Supreme Court Justices decided that ruling was unconstitutional .
The seed is modified to be resistant to Monsanto 's brand of weedkiller .
The US is the world 's largest producer of alfalfa , a grass - like plant used as animal feed .
It is the fourth most valuable crop grown in the country .
Environmentalists had argued that there might be a risk of cross-pollination between genetically modified plants and neighbouring crops .
They also argued over -use of the company 's weedkiller Roundup , the chemical treatment the alfalfa is modified to be resistant to , could cause pollution of ground water and lead to resistant " super - weeds " .
But Monsanto says claims its products were dangerous amounted to " bad science fiction with no support on the record " .
During a visit to Cyprus at the end of last week , the Pope said the alleged murder was " certainly not a political or religious murder but rather a personal affair . "
Global Warming is caused by several factors such as the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
One solution to the problem is to capture the carbon dioxide before it enters the atmosphere , and instead , deposit the CO2 into the ground .
However , up to this point , scientists have been unable to effectively track how it might move underground .
The desire is to get the CO2 in place and not have it move elsewhere and potentially cause problems .
Now , with the advent of Electrical Resistivity Tomography ( ERT ) , developed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ( LLNL ) , tested by the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership ( SECARB ) , and funded by the Department of Energyâ€™s National Energy Technology Laboratory , sequestration of greenhouse gases may expand .
! ADVERTISEMENT !
ERT technology is similar to computer tomography scan .
It takes images of soil resistivity which allows scientists to determine the soil 's properties , such as temperature , saturation , and soil type .
Tomography is imaging by sectioning through the use of energy waves .
It can be applied to other fields such as radiology , archaeology , oceanography , and astrophysics .
SECARB conducted its ERT experiment at the Cranfield Oilfield near Natchez , Mississippi .
The project will test over one million tons of CO2 in underground formations at a depth of 10,000 feet , the deepest application of ERT technology to date .
ERT uses vertical electrode arrays set up in a cross - well arrangement .
Four - electrode measurements are taken to monitor changes in the distribution of electrical resistance within the underground formation .
Since the CO2 at the Cranfield site has resistivity five times greater than its surroundings , the ERT system can determine where the CO2 is , and in what speed and trajectory it is moving .
" We can image the CO2 plume as the fluid is injected , " said geophysicist Charles Carrigan , the LLNL lead on the ERT project .
" What we 've seen is a movement of the plume outward from the injection well into the geologic formation used for storage . "
Scientists have constructed two monitoring wells of more than 10,000 feet in depth at the Cranfield site .
The ERT system installed is capable of withstanding over 250 degrees Fahrenheit and 5,000 psi of pressure .
It takes 10,000 measurements per day which Carrigan and his team can access remotely .
At this point , the ERT system seems to be performing its job well to capture images of the underground CO2 plume .
However , human intelligence is still required to analyze the findings .
This can be a difficult task , even with the proper equipment .
Uncertainties in reservoir structure and unknown multiphase fluid processes are not easy factors to incorporate .
The goal in the end is to ensure that the underground storage of CO2 is operating properly .
What good is it to capture the carbon only to find it leaking out of the ground in two years ?
According to Carrigan , the hope is to start applying ERT systems to commercial CO2 underground storage sites .
This type of technology is vital for the future of carbon sequestration .
Power companies will be employing these systems as they look to reduce their carbon footprint .

FORT MORGAN , Ala . --
A two - inch layer of submerged oil hugged portions of the Gulf seafloor off the Bon Secour National Wildlife Refuge on Friday , a week after a smothering layer of floating crude washed ashore there .
Collecting in pockets and troughs in waist - deep water , the underwater oil was looser and stickier than the tarballs spread liberally along the beach .
The consistency was more like a thick liquid , albeit one made up of thousands of small globs .
Unlike tarballs , which can often be picked up out of the water without staining the fingers , the submerged oil stained everything that it touched .
A hand passed through the material emerged covered in oily smears .
A hunk of fabric hovering near the bottom was completely covered in oil .
The Press - Register found a number of patches of submerged oil 40 to 100 feet off the beach , apparently collecting along rip currents and sandbars .
The carcasses of sand fleas , speckled crabs , ghost crabs and leopard crabs were spread throughout the oil , a thick layer of the material caking the bodies of the larger crabs .
Their claws looked as if they been turned into clubs made of oil .
Thumb - size sand fleas burrow in the sand where the waves wash onto the beach .
It appeared that they had suffocated .
Other burrowing creatures , such as the small and colorful coquina clams , seemed unaffected .
Unlike sand fleas , the clams are able to close their shells for extended periods , an ability that would offer a measure of protection as oil washed across the sand above them .
Dark patches seen in deeper water Friday might also have been oil , but exceptional numbers of large sharks meant diving down to investigate was not an option .
Hammerhead , bull and other sharks were schooling around a boat anchored in 6 feet of water just outside the breaking waves .
Most of the sharks in the deeper water were 6 feet long or more .
Smaller sharks could be seen inside the first sandbar , in one case in a school 27 strong .
Huge schools of bait hugged the seashore , attracting large numbers of birds .
King mackerel , Spanish mackerel , mullet , ladyfish , speckled trout and other fish schooled in unusually large numbers amid the sharks .
Dead fish seen onshore seemed to have collected in the areas closest to the underwater oil .
It was unclear if the fish died because of exposure to the oil .
The Dauphin Island Sea Lab measured large areas of low oxygen water just off the beach at Fort Morgan last week , beginning in water around 20 feet deep .
Monty Graham , a University of South Alabama scientist , theorized that the population of oil - consuming microbes had swelled , and those tiny animals consumed lots of oxygen .
Sea life begins to die if oxygen levels drop below 2 parts per million .

" We saw some very low oxygen levels , some below 1 , " said Graham , of testing he conducted aboard a Dauphin Island Sea Lab research vessel .
He said that the layer of low - oxygen water closest to shore off Fort Morgan began at the bottom and rose up 30 feet .
Graham said he believed that the low oxygen levels were responsible for reports of strange behavior among fish .
" The low oxygen explains things we 've been hearing , like reports of flounder swimming on the surface , " Graham said .
The low oxygen levels offshore may also explain the dense aggregations of fish seen in the surf zone .
The turbulent area near shore is naturally high in oxygen due to the influence of the breaking waves .
The Press - Register has heard numerous reports that suggest oil is moving beneath the surface in Alabama waters .
State officials conducting shrimp trawls in the Mississippi Sound two weeks ago found oil on their nets when they pulled them .
More recently , BP contractors working around Dauphin Island reported oil coming up on their anchors .
BANGKOK — The Thai government struck a combative tone on Saturday , saying it would continue its efforts to cut off antigovernment protesters from the rest of the city despite a rising death toll and determined resistance from the demonstrators .
Throughout the day and into the night , gunfire and explosions shook neighborhoods in central Bangkok that ring the one - mile area where the protesters have camped for weeks in an attempt to bring down the government .
The government reported that 8 people were killed Saturday , bringing the death toll from three days of clashes to 24 , with 198 people injured .
“ The government cannot turn back , ” Abhisit Vejjajiva , the prime minister , said in a nationally televised address on Saturday night .
“ Ending the rally is the only way to prevent calamity . ”
Shortly before the prime minister spoke , leaders of the country ’s powerful military appeared on television in what may have been a deliberate show of unity for an army notorious for its divisions and intrigue .
Unlike last month , when the government withdrew after a failed crackdown that left 25 people dead , the military said losses were unavoidable , and began calling in reinforcements , adding to the thousands of troops already here .

Middle East Women 's activists oppose revival of ' pleasure marriage ' tradition NAJAF , Iraq --
She is a 49 - year - old divorced mother of seven children .
He is a well - off farmer , with his own wife and children .
Theirs is a secret betrothal , with perfunctory vows exchanged alone in a bedroom for an ephemeral union .
'' Mutaa , " a 1,400 - year - old tradition alternately known as pleasure marriage and temporary marriage , is regaining popularity among Iraq 's majority Shi'ite Muslim population after decades of being outlawed by the Sunni regime of Saddam Hussein .
According to Shi'ite religious law , unmarried women may enter into pleasure marriages with men ( married or not ) for periods as brief as a few minutes or as long as a lifetime .
Dowries , too , range from virtually nothing to millions of Iraqi dinars .
Shi'ite clerics , including Iraq 's highest religious authority , Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , have sanctioned mutaa despite the social stigma attached to the marriages .
Women 's activists in Iraq last year fought an effort by constitution drafters to endorse some form of Sharia , or Islamic law , in matters of marriage and family .
The new national charter includes an article that allows Iraqis to choose their marital status according to their beliefs , and reinforces the primacy of civil authority in family law .
Whatever the religious legalities involved , people who participate in mutaa , especially women , risk their reputations and prospects for permanent marriage .
The divorcee , a resident of this Shi'ite - dominated southern city who asked that her name not be used for fear of being stigmatized , said she had few options after her husband left her in 1991 without financial support .
She found her mutaa spouse shortly after the divorce , she said , and they have been together since .
'' He lives with his own family , so he would come to me for visits only .
And he takes care of my children 's expenses without his family 's knowledge , " she said .
'' This mutaa marriage is something between me and him .
Only God knows of it . "
Shi'ite and Sunni sects disagree on the lawfulness of mutaa .
Shi'ite clerics generally consider it to be in accordance with Islamic law , whereas many Sunni authorities regard it as a sexual relationship outside religious behavior .
Some Shi'ite scholars say the prophet Mohammed sanctioned mutaa marriages for his companions during their wars and campaigns to spread Islam in present - day Saudi Arabia .
Other historians argue that the practice existed in pre-Islamic societies and was later permitted by Mohammed .
Even though the practice quietly persisted during the Hussein regime , temporary marriages have experienced a resurgence in Iraq since the 2003 US - led invasion , say women 's advocates , social workers and mutaa spouses .
They see that as a sign of rising Shi'ite influence in political and religious affairs and the explosion of cross - border traffic between Iraq and the Shi'ite theocratic state of Iran , where mutaa is even more popular .
Critics of the practice also blame Iraq 's dire economic straits and the lack of opportunities for unmarried women .
Many of the poorest people in Iraq are widows and divorced women with children .
On any given day , women in black '' abayas , " often with children in tow , can be seen threading their way through traffic jams , begging for money .
Women 's rights activists call mutaa an exploitative arrangement .
Aida Nasser Hussein Mosawi , who runs a Najaf - based women 's rights center , said many women entered into the marriages not for pleasure but for financial reasons .
She said many mutaa brides had no other means of support .
Mosawi criticized the Iraqi government for failing to fund women's aid programs and for ceding authority over marriage and family law to Shi'ite religious authorities under the newly ratified charter .
'' The clerics issue fatwas condoning this practice that allows men to treat women like prostitutes .
They take her for a short time and then he leaves her -- it 's all up to him , " she said .
'' If men want to marry women , they should come through the door , not the window , and if women really felt like they were half of our society , they would not sell themselves so cheap . "
Sheik Adel Amir Tureihi , a Shi'ite cleric in Najaf , said mutaa marriages were consensual and preceded by a mutually agreed - upon dowry and duration , although men can end the relationship any time they like .
Witnesses are required , but Iraqis say some couples dispense with that rule .
Tureihi said the practice was designed to provide Muslims with a lawful outlet for natural sexual desires .
'' People need sex just like they need food , " he said .
'' Islam is a natural , organic religion . "
But Azhar Tureihi , a Najaf - based gynecologist not directly related to the sheik , said pleasure marriages carried serious societal consequences , regardless of how readily religious authorities accepted the practice .
She said she knew of a woman who became pregnant during a temporary marriage and was the victim of an ' ' honor killing " by her brother .
'' This kind of killing is called ' shame washing ' -- the brother went to the police and confessed , " the physician said .
'' The sentence for this type of killing is normally only 10 months . "
Near the shrine of Imam Ali in downtown Najaf , a 35 - year - old shopkeeper who gave his name only as Hussein said he hoped his temporary wife would agree to be his second permanent wife .
'' I saw her at my shop .
She was buying things with her mother , and I started talking to them , " he said .
'' I knew that her husband died in the [ 1991 Persian Gulf war ] in Umm Qasr -- she 's 30 . " © Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company .

For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
At 5:39 a.m. on Friday , after a 20 - hour negotiating marathon , top House and Senate lawmakers put the final touches on Congress ’ 2,000 - plus - page bill responding to one of the worst financial meltdowns in US history .
The bill , more than a year in the making , would create a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , seek to end taxpayer bailouts , and illuminate the opaque and risk - laden $ 600 trillion derivatives market .
The legislation was the target of fierce lobbying by groups on all sides of the debate , and some clear winners and losers emerged as the House and Senate merged their bills into one .
Here are some of the biggest in each category :
WINNERS
Too - Big - to - Fail Banks :
They were at the heart of the financial crisis , and their fate was likewise at the center of the grueling financial reform debate .
In the end , however , it looks like systemically risky banks and non-banking institutions will escape any major crackdowns .
Sure , JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Bank of America , and their ilk will see some dips in profitability due to new derivatives reforms and a ban on proprietary trading ( when banks trade for their own profit ) .
But as Simon Johnson , former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund , told Mother Jones in an email , “ the legislation will not reign in [ too - big - to - fail ] banks and they will be at the heart of what happens next . ”
One proposal that would ’ve broken up the biggest banks and capped their leverage ( the debt they amass to amplify their financial bets ) , the Brown - Kaufman Amendment , was opposed by the Obama administration and killed in the Senate .
That amendment posed a major threat to banks not only by limiting their financial size and risk - taking abilities , but also by scaling back their political clout and outsized influence over regulators due to their economy - tumbling size .
Now , all that ’s left in the financial reform bill addressing too - big - and too - interconnected - to - fail banks is a council of regulators to keep an eye on big banks and a plan to recoup the cost of a bank ’s unwinding after its collapse to ensure taxpayers are n’t on the hook for it .
That ’s little consolation to reformers like Sen.
Russ Feingold ( D - Wisc. ) , who fear mega - banks could cause the next financial meltdown .
Auto Dealers :
After months of lobbying , auto dealers and their influence peddlers on Capitol Hill succeeded in winning an exemption from oversight under a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .
Dealers , who make almost 80 percent of all auto loans , bilk consumers out of an estimated $ 20 billion annually through shady practices like inflating a car ’s actual retail price by tacking on unnecessary products and services .
Dealers had already prevailed in the House ’s version of the bill , passed in December , but lost out on the Senate side , which voted to include them under the Bureau ’s purview .
During the conference process , dealers pushed hard and managed to win an exemption from Bureau oversight , a loophole sure to appear in the final bill .
The auto dealer lobby spent lavishly to avoid new regulation .
In the last three months of 2009 and first three months of 2010 , the National Automobile Dealers Association , the industry ’s main lobbying group , spent nearly $ 1.5 million lobbying Washington lawmakers and bureaucrats on issues like the dealer exemption .
Consumer Protection Advocates : On Wednesday , bailout watchdog Elizabeth Warren gave her imprimatur , albeit hesitantly , to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau agreed upon by the House and Senate .
The idea was largely Warren ’s brainchild , and the Harvard professor said she still supports the new independent Bureau , which would be housed in the Federal Reserve , funded by an independent budget , and led by a presidentially appointed candidate .
Warren had previously pushed for a standalone Consumer Financial Protection Agency , resembling the EPA , but once that idea was deemed politically toxic due to Republican opposition , Warren threw her support behind a Fed - housed bureau so long as the Fed does n’t meddle with its activities .
Warren has said she ’s disappointed by the carve - outs in the Bureau ’s oversight , including the exemption of car dealers under its mandate .
But , as she told Huffington Post ‘s Ryan Grim , “ right now the bureau has the authority and the independence it needs to fix the broken credit market .
I keep waiting for an incoming missile that means the banks have won their fight to destroy this consumer agency , but that has n’t happened so far — and I do n’t think it will . ”
Sen. Scott Brown ( R - Mass . ) : Despite joining Democrats to vote for the Senate ’s reform bill in May , the junior senator ’s vote is in play on the Senate ’s final vote on the bill , which is expected next week .
But before voting with Democrats again , Brown demanded changes to the bill ’s “ Volcker Rule ” provision , which would limit banks ’ investments in riskier entities like hedge funds and private equity funds .
Brown pushed for a loophole in the Volcker language , allowing banks to invest a small percentage of their money in these funds — a change sought by major investment firms in Brown ’s home state , like State Street , a Boston - based investment company .
In the end , Brown got his loophole , which was opposed by Democrats and former Fed chairman Paul Volcker himself .
Now , we ’ll see if Brown again votes in favor of financial reform .
If he does , he will , in other words , have had his cake and eaten it , too : his big bank constituents will get their loophole , and Brown will get to look like a reformer .
Derivatives Industry : For months , Arkansas Sen .
Blanche Lincoln stood firm in defending her tough derivatives provisions that would ’ve forced banks to spin - off all of their swaps trading operations .
Her reforms , better known as “ Section 716 , ” were anathema to Wall Street and its lobbyists , opposed by the White House , but backed by a chorus of experts , like economists Joseph Stiglitz , Nouriel Roubini , and James K. Galbraith .
At the 11th hour , however , the derivatives industry won : to ensure the bill ’s passage , Lincoln ’s proposal was watered down so that banks need only spin off their riskiest swap trades in areas like agriculture , metals , and energy .
Trades of interest - rate swaps , foreign exchange swaps , and gold and silver swaps will be allowed to stay in - house at the big banks .
Here ’s why that ’s a major win for the industry :
In December 2009 , the swaps trades exempted from the spin - off rule now in the bill accounted for almost $ 500 trillion in notional value , according to the Bank for International Settlements ( pdf ) ; for some context , the total over - the - counter market at time was valued at $ 614 trillion .
Now , all those trades were n’t executed by American banks , but it shows how diluted Lincoln ’s proposals became .
With Congress allowing banks to make the kinds of swaps trades that account for more than 80 percent of the market , Wall Street and its lobbyists won a loophole that all but defeats the spin - off provision entirely .
LOSERS
The Credit Card Industry :
The big credit card companies face billions in losses each year from a ban on interchange , or “ swipe , ” fees , pushed by Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , in the final bill .
Swipe fees comprise around 1 to 3 percent of credit or debit card purchases .
That amount , paid by store operators , flows into the coffers of companies like Visa and Mastercard as well as the banks ( Chase and Bank of America , for instance ) that issue cards to consumers .
According to The Nilson Report , swipe fees totaled $ 62 billion in 2009 from almost $ 4 trillion in US purchases .
Despite intense lobbying from the credit card industry , top House lawmakers agreed on Tuesday to incorporate a major portion of Durbin ’s swipe - fees ban into the merged financial reform text .
Once the bill goes into effect , credit and debit card companies are set to lose a significant source of income .
Office of Thrift Supervision :
The beleaguered financial regulator , which oversees federal banks as well as institutions like mortgage lenders , will be no more under the bill .
Criticized by many as the weakest of all federal regulators , the OTS is set to be merged into the Office of the Comprotroller of the Currency and its duties would be split among existing bank regulators , the Federal Reserve , and the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .
Main Street Investors :
For years , securities regulators have pushed to end a glaring conflict of interest among a particular breed of financial advisers called broker - dealers .
Broker - dealers , such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , both advise investors and sell them financial products , as well as trade for their own benefit .
A particularly egregious ( and potentially illegal ) example is the transaction for which Goldman Sachs is currently under investigation by the SEC , which allegedly entailed peddling to its investors a product that was rigged to fail and which Goldman itself was betting against .
Unlike investment advisers , who by law must put their clients ’ interests first , broker - dealers do n’t have a “ fiduciary duty . ”
That ’s right — they can screw over their clients if they want and do n’t have to disclose conflicts of interest in financial deals .
The House ’s bill featured a provision that would ’ve immediately made broker - dealers adhere to a fiduciary duty .
In the merging of the House and Senate bills , however , lawmakers agreed Thursday to require a six - month study by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the need for this measure — even though a 2008 RAND Corporation report , commissioned by the SEC , concluded that customers have trouble differentiating between broker - dealers and investment advisers , and that a fiduciary duty would beneficial .
“ We saw this as the strongest investor protection provision in the whole package , ” says Bob Webster , communications director with North American Securities Administrators Association .
Now , he adds , “ we really have no idea what the fiduciary standard will look like . ”
A Tennessee Valley Authority for the Gulf Coast ?
Created : June 11 , 2010 15:00 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Via Crooks and Liars , Doug Brinkley , the historian , author and Washington - type , told Anderson Cooper on CNN that administration sources told him there would be a Gulf recovery bill , possibly one including the redirection of the Mississippi River to restore coastal wetlands , in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
I ’ve cleaned the transcript up a bit :
BRINKLEY : ** There are three things … going on .
One is close that well … capture as much oil as you can , keep the pressure on BP on the relief wells .
Second is immediate cleanup .
And I think more can be done by the Obama administration …
But I think the big third piece is coming , when President Obama comes to Florida and Alabama and Mississippi , and that is holding BP responsible for the Natural Resource Damage Act , for the Oil Spill Response Act .
And , by that , I mean BP is going to end up paying somewhere from $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion , maybe even $ 20 billion , because they ’re going — one of the only ways to save the Louisiana wetlands is going to be — you know , the Mississippi River has been channelized for navigation .**
Well , now the Mississippi River has to be redirected .
It ’s going to have to be flooded and sediment pumped into these marshlands to save it .
I think the Obama administration …
( CROSSTALK )
COOPER : So , no , wait .
No , wait .
Doug , is this just a hope on your part ?
BRINKLEY : No .
COOPER : Or — I mean , I know you have been talking to sources .
Do you believe this is actually going to happen ?
BRINKLEY : Yes .
Yes .**
It ’s one of the reasons why the president is not talking to Tony Hayward .
And they are going to come out with a large Gulf recovery act , because the oil and gas industry has been dredging .
We have disappearing barrier islands .
For 40 years down there , it ’s abused the wetlands .**
This is a turning point .
There is an appetite on Capitol Hill for Gulf recovery act .
The Mississippi River is going to have to be redirected into the marshlands .
And BP and Transocean and other , you know , operations , Cameron , other companies are going to have to pay up to $ 10 billion and $ 15 billion for breaking national acts .
In addition , for offshore drilling in the Gulf , Anderson , there will be a conservation excise tax that , yes , there will be offshore drilling , but Louisianians will start getting some of the revenue to stay in state .
[...]
Congress is going to go after BP , and they have now broken , as I said , National Resource Damage Act , Oil Spill Response Act .
And in order to save the wetlands , which BP is responsible to , it ’s going to be — the Army Corps of Engineers has directed — if you fly over , it ’s like a bird ’s foot .
There are three channels .
We ’re now going to have to redirect Mississippi River sediment and flood the marshlands to try to save them .
That will occur after this — the well gets capped , the relief wells are built .
But , in the next year or two , this will be , for President Obama administration , I think something of a Tennessee Valley Authority or a Saint Lawrence Seaway under Dwight Eisenhower , a major public works act .
I take this with a grain of salt , as it is the first I have heard of it .
But if it is true , and the administration or Hill figures are considering such a major public works project , it sounds like good news on numerous fronts .
First , the wetlands and the environment need this sort of intensive attention .
Second , the country could use the stimulus : the thousands of jobs and billions of dollars this would bring .
Third , it could be coupled with a serious tax on dirty energies , to pay for this restoration plus the expected costs of future cleanups .

With a flooded Tennessee becoming the latest disaster to strike the United States , the Federal Emergency Management Agency is confronting its own emergency as its relief funds run perilously low .
Last month , FEMA Director W. Craig Fugate wrote a letter to Congress warning that its relief fund had fallen to $ 693 million as of April 7 but the agency owed $ 645 million to 47 states for past disasters .
That does n't include the $ 1.7 billion settlement the agency owes to the Gulf Coast state and city governments for Hurricane Katrina .
Now FEMA is handing out money to the residents of Tennessee after deadly floods ravaged the region last weekend .
FEMA has already approved $ 4.1 million in individual assistance and more than 16,200 Tennesseans had registered with FEMA for disaster assistance by Saturday morning with 650 inspections complete .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Friday that FEMA will probably need a shot of supplemental funding .
The administration is seeking $ 5.1 billion in emergency funding from Congress .
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano toured the area Saturday and found residents already repairing their homes and business owners pushing to re-open .
" DHS and the entire federal government will do everything possible to support the people of Tennessee and across the Southeast in getting back on their feet quickly -- coordinated every step of the way with our state and local partners , " Napolitano said .
The outlook for the devastated areas of Tennessee , Mississippi and Kentucky remained grim Saturday as the death toll climbed to 31 with the discovery of a missing kayaker 's body in Kentucky .
Twenty died in Tennessee alone .
Nashville Mayor Karl Dean raised the damage estimate for his city to $ 1.5 billion Friday , with 17 percent of Davidson County still to be checked .
Already officials know 9,300 properties have been damaged and almost 2,000 of those are residences .
Dean said the damage total will go up because it does n't include damage to roads , bridges or the contents of the buildings .
" While the numbers seem daunting , and they truly are large , Nashville is in the process of recovering , " Dean said .
But some analysts believe FEMA was never meant to be -- and should n't be -- the disaster response agency for the nation .
" From an operational standpoint , disaster response should be driven by state and local governments , as they are the owners of most of the response resources and they are the first on the scene when disaster strikes , " Jena Baker McNeill and Matt Mayer of the Heritage Foundation said in a report published last month .
" Supplanting this funding encourages state and local governments to not be prepared , knowing that the federal government will bail them out . "
The report found that the yearly average of FEMA declarations has tripled from 43 under the first President Bush to 89 under President Clinton to 130 under the second President Bush .
President Obama issued 108 declarations in his first year in office – the 12th highest in FEMA history – without the occurrence of one hurricane or other major disaster , the report said .
In the first three months of 2010 , Obama has issued 32 declarations , putting him on pace for 128 declarations for the year – the sixth most in FEMA history , according to the report .
The report says the reason behind the increase is governors , as their state budgets decline , are more likely to seek emergency declarations from FEMA that requires the federal government pay up to 100 percent of the disaster response bill .
" Truly catastrophic disasters that overwhelm state and local governments are a welcome forum for FEMA intervention ; that is , after all , the very purpose of FEMA declarations , " the report reads .
" However , all too often disaster politics , rather than effective policy , drive decisions on disaster response .
Washington policymakers simply do not know how to say ' no ' to spending more on disasters .
Consequently , FEMA can no longer meet its financial commitments . "

Too much , too young ( Image : Danny Joint / PYMCA / Rex Features )
Post - mortems of binge - drinking adolescent monkeys have produced the best evidence yet that heavy drinking at an early age can do lasting damage to the brain .
The worst damage was to stem cells destined to become neurons in the hippocampus , the brain area responsible for memory and spatial awareness .
Monkey and human brains develop in the same way , so the finding suggests that similar effects may occur in human teenagers .
It thus reinforces the rationale for anti-alcohol policies in the US and elsewhere which aim to raise the age at with people start to drink .

Starting young
Chitra Mandyam of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla , California , and colleagues gave four rhesus macaque monkeys citrus - flavoured alcoholic drinks for an hour a day over a period of 11 months .
Two months later the animals were killed , and their brains were compared with those of monkeys that had not consumed alcohol .
The bingeing monkeys had 50 to 90 per cent fewer stem cells in their hippocampus compared with the controls .
“ We saw a profound decrease in vital cells , ” Mandyam says .
“ What is important for the public to know is that this type of drinking can kill off stem cells . ”
This loss could result in damage to memory and spatial skills , she adds .
Lasting effects
Mandyam thinks that this degeneration could have long - term effects and provide a mechanism for why bingeing teens are more likely to develop alcohol dependence as adults .
A new policy to combat under - age drinking was launched earlier this month by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) .
It is based on results from earlier studies which showed that 41 per cent of children who start drinking regularly at 12 years of age develop lifelong dependency , compared to 11 per cent of people who start drinking at 18 .
“ The findings support the US Surgeon General ’s efforts to delay drinking initiation among young people , ” says Ellen Witt of the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda , Maryland .
“ It ’s also important to recognize that binge drinking may produce adverse consequences on the brain regardless of age . ”

ANALYSIS / OPINION :
Sexual morality is over .
That ’s the conclusion of one of the smartest men in Washington , the estimable columnist George Will .
On ABC ’s “ This Week ” on May 30 , Mr. Will agreed with colleague Matthew Dowd that apart from a few glitches , homosexuality will soon be a nonissue in the military .
They are wrong , but let ’s look at their argument .
The men cited young folks ’ liberal attitudes and recent polls as evidence that morality is no longer a factor .
Mr. Dowd : “ It ’s long been decided in the public ’s mind .
I think the Republicans are so far out of step on this … ”
Mr. Will : “ For people of Matt ’s son ’s generation , being gay is like being left - handed . …
The Supreme Court has a famous phrase it used in some opinion , the evolving standards of decency that mark a maturing society .
Clearly these are evolving , and the case is over , basically . ”
This plunge into moral relativism could mean that Sodom and Gomorrah had evolved into a more “ maturing society ” than , say , Jerusalem under King David .
Or America under Abraham Lincoln .
Not to be outdone , ABC correspondent Jake Tapper chimed in : “ The case is over .
But why is there such a fight by Republican officeholders ?
If you look at polling … the public is overwhelmingly supportive of lifting the ban .
Conservatives support it .
Republicans support it .
White evangelicals support it .
What ’s going on with the Republicans in Congress ? ”
This is based on loaded polls by liberal media .
But let ’s go back to George Will , who gives the answer : “ They ’re not being very intelligent . ”
Ah , that ’s it .
Those of us who believe that God created male and female and that sex outside marriage - adultery , fornication and homosexuality - is wrong and harmful , are just not being intelligent .
It ’s apparently not enough to love friends and family who are into homosexuality ; we have to love the behavior that threatens their bodies and souls .
The four Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 1,163 retired generals and admirals who warn against lifting the ban are similarly not intelligent .
Nor are the majority in the armed forces who oppose the change and will be guinea pigs for this experiment in sexual anarchy .
And what about the Creator of the Universe ?
It is God ’s moral code that has undergirded Western society for more than 3,500 years .
God ’s intelligent design - marriage - is the glue that holds it together .
Even Chinese philosopher Confucius called marriage “ the foundation of civilization . ”
What a moron .
If only he could have lived in our day and evolved .
What we are witnessing among the intelligentsia is a catastrophic case of groupthink :
Because they all repeat the same thing , it must be true .
They ignore biology , morality , history , common sense and grim health statistics because they are smarter than anyone .
Charles Krauthammer , who has written some of the best critiques of Obamacare and the rest of the left ’s assault on America , is also aboard the gay express .
He ’s smarter than God .
So , too , are Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Chapman , Weekly Standard columnist Stephen Hayes , Fox News analyst Margaret Hoover and American Spectator columnist Phillip Klein , all of whom have called for repealing the military ban .
Mr. Klein called it a “ no - brainer . ”
No arguing with that .
The silence of other talking heads is deafening while Democrats ram through their immoral assault on our military .
So I have a couple of questions for these pundits :
First , given that you ’ve warned us repeatedly about many dangers of the left , why are you embracing the centerpiece of their war on American values ?
Homosexual activism is the spear point of the larger cultural blitzkrieg .
Without Judeo - Christian morals , liberty and freedom cannot thrive , as observers from Tocqueville to Adam Smith to George Washington have warned .
Or just visit any inner city where socialist sexual values have prevailed .
Socialists have been at war with sexual morality since the French Revolution .
It ’s at the heart of their strategy to destabilize society in order to foment political revolution .
So why is this totem of the left untouchable ?
Is Barney Frank wrong when he orchestrates bigger government but right when he promotes sexual immorality ?
It creates even more victims for a growing government .
Second , this one goes to Mr. Will .
You have bravely stood in the gap on The Washington Post ’s Op - Ed page against the global warming mob .
You did so even before Climategate .
You insisted we scrutinize their data before acting rashly .
Why , then , are n’t you exhibiting similar caution when confronted with the claims of homosexual activists ?
They have ridden a boatload of junk science for the past 60 years , beginning with the fraudulent Kinsey sex studies , from which they manufactured the false claim that 10 percent of the population is homosexual .
They went on to misrepresent the studies of UCLA psychologist Evelyn Hooker to “ prove ” that homosexuality was not a disorder , and threatened violence against the major psychological guilds until the American Psychiatric Association cried uncle and rewrote the diagnostic manual in 1973 .
They persuaded the media to highlight some studies “ proving ” there was a “ gay gene . ”
Each of these studies has been refuted or has been unreplicated , but the myth persists that science has established that people are “ born gay . ”
Meanwhile , the media ignore the testimonies of many former homosexuals .
Given that this junk science makes global warming data look solid by comparison , why do n’t Mr. Will , Mr. Krauthammer and others question the presumptions drawn from it ?
Perhaps the answer lies in the Book that they now find quaint : “ Professing to be wise , they became fools … who exchanged the truth of God for a lie . ” ( Romans 1:22 , 25 )
Someday , the smartest folks in America will wonder how they could have been so foolish .

Six would - be cosmonauts have entered a sealed facility where they will spend 18 months with no windows and only e-mail contact with the outside world .
The men are taking part in the Mars500 project , which aims to simulate a mission to Mars .
They entered the craft , located at a medical institute in Moscow , just before 1100 BST on Thursday .
Scientists say the study will help them understand how humans would cope on a long journey to another world .
During a press conference on Thursday morning , the six men - three Russians , two Europeans and a Chinese man - all described what motivated them to take part in the experiment .
When the very first human steps on Mars , I will be able to say , ' yeah , I helped do that '
Diego Urbina , European Mars500 participant
Twenty - six year old Wang Yue from China , the youngest of the volunteers , said he was excited to be involved in a project that he felt would be " excellent for science and for all of humankind " .
French volunteer Romain Charles acknowledged that it would be a " difficult " mission and said that he would miss his family and " the Sun and fresh air " .
Space on Earth
The project has been designed to be as realistic as possible even though some elements - such as the weightless conditions of spaceflight - cannot be recreated here on Earth .
" They will have to cope with limited consumables , for example , " said Dr Martin Zell from the European Space Agency , a key partner in the project .
" That means everything will be onboard at the start .
There will be no re-load , re-supply whatsoever .
It will be like a real mission . "
THE LAYOUT OF THE MARS500 ' SPACESHIP ' MEDICAL MODULE : The 12 m - long cylinder acts as the laboratory .
Should a crewmember become ill , he can be isolated and treated here
HABITABLE MODULE :
The main living quarters .
The 20 m - long module has beds , a galley , a social area .
It also acts as the main control room
LANDING MODULE :
This will only be used during the 30 - day landing operation .
Three crewmembers will visit the " surface "
STORAGE MODULE : The 24 m - long module is divided into four compartments , to store food and other supplies , to house a greenhouse , a gym a refrigeration unit
SURFACE MODULE :
To walk across the soil and rocks of Mars , crewmembers must put on Orlan spacesuits and pass through an airlock
The craft is based at Moscow 's Institute of Biomedical Problems and comprises a series of interconnected steel canisters .
The total interior volume is about 550 cubic metres .
Image caption Near a hundred experiments will be performed during the " journey "
Four of the tubes provide the living and working environment on the " journey " to and from Mars .
Their interior has been decorated with wood panelling to give the cylinders a more homely feel .
A fifth module is a mock - up of the Red Planet itself , an enclosed room with a floor covered in rocks and sand .
About half - way through the mission , three of the crew will have to " land " on this " surface " and walk about on it while dressed in heavy space suits .
The " cosmonauts " will be commanded by 38 - year - old marine engineer and astronaut trainer Alexey Sitev , who has only recently been married .
His compatriots - Sukhrob Kamolov ( 32 ) and Alexander Smoleevskiy ( 33 ) - have medical backgrounds .
The two Europeans in the group - Diego Urbina ( 27 ) and Romain Charles ( 31 ) - are engineers by training .

Yue has a " day job " training Chinese astronauts .
Colombian - Italian Diego Urbina said his motivation came from his desire to work in space research .

The experiment even simulates surface operations at the Red Planet
" I'm also very interested in being a part of the story of getting humans to Mars , " he told BBC News .
" When the very first human steps on Mars , I will be able to say , ' yeah , I helped do that '.
That will make me feel very proud . "
Scientific investigations during the experiment will assess the effect that isolation has on various psychological and physiological aspects such as stress , hormone levels , sleep quality , mood and the benefits of dietary supplements .
Dr Berna van Baarsen , from the Free University Medical Center , Amsterdam , Holland , is a principal investigator on Mars500 .
" We expect Mars500 to have Earth applications , in understanding group dynamics connected to isolation and loneliness , for example , " she said .
" I hope it will also help us understand better some groups , such as those elderly people who are isolated in their homes .
It should tell us about coping behaviours . "
The spaceship itself will come under scrutiny , also , as the crew monitor their surroundings to see which types of bacteria take hold and thrive in the enclosed space .
All of the results of these investigations will have to be emailed to " mission control " as the organisers of the project intend to introduce a 20 - minute , one - way time - delay in communications to mirror the real lag in sending messages over the vast distance between Mars and Earth .
" Everything will be done in a telemedicine environment , where the crew has to do the analysis and we receive the data by telemetry , " said Dr Zell , who heads up Europe 's space station utilisation programme .
This 520 - day mock mission with its 30 days of " surface operations " is the final phase of the three - part Mars500 project .
There have already been two smaller studies , one lasting 14 days and another taking 105 days to complete .
Space agencies describe Mars as the " ultimate destination " for human explorers .
However , they do not possess the technology to complete such an endeavour and are unlikely have it for many years yet .

The Obama Administrations continued refusal to criticize Israel for its ruthless killing of aid workers off the coast of Gaza highlights a fundamental problem with the way in which the Israeli / Palestinian conflict in America is portrayed .
The premise upon which the debate is based on is fundamentally flawed , and in some cases overtly racist .
The American media and the intellectual classes operate within the logic that Israel is the victim of Arab aggression and is simply defending itself from hostile neighbors - the Muslim countries are anti semitic and hell bent on the destruction of Israel and cannot ever be negotiated with .
Israel , the story goes , is a democracy and an ally of the United States , and therefore justified in anything it does to protect itself .

There is one inconvenient truth that shoots a deadly arrow in this narrative , and it is n't an easy one to swallow .
The truth is that the creation of the Jewish state was based on the theft of land from an indigenous people .
While Jews would prefer to believe that their country is a ' miracle in the desert ' , for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians , it is an everlasting nightmare .

The pro Israel narrative continues with its portrayal of Arab aggression , noting the wars in 1948 , 1967 and 1973 as proof that the country was under perpetual attack .
While it is true that the Arab nations attacked Israel after it declared itself a nation in 1948 , it must be remembered that if Mexican immigrants declared a state of Mexico in Arizona , it is unlikely the U.S government would not see it as an act of aggression and take immediate military action .
The wars in 1967 and 1973 were started by Egypt and Syria , not the Palestinians , and the Israelis used it as an excuse to annex more Palestinian land ( Gaza , the Sinai Peninsula , the Golan Heights and the West Bank ) , an act illegal under international law .
The Palestinians , as always , suffered the consequences of competing empires .
The continued occupation of the Palestinian people and the relentless expansion of the Israeli state is a text book definition of colonization .
The Palestinians have a right to resist this occupation , and the onus is on Israel to stop it so that peace talks can resume .
The use of terrorism against civilians is , in my opinion , never justified .
The Palestinians should find more productive ways of promoting their cause and take the moral high ground .
But to continue the ridiculous story that Israel is the victim prevents serious dialogue from happening and destroys any real chance of peace .
While Israel will never disappear , it can and must live in harmony with its neighbors .
If it continues to ignore its own history and the pain and suffering it has inflicted on a largely defenseless people , it will continue to be the target of terrorism and hate .
As a Jew , I am ashamed that the enormous suffering of our people has led to the victimization and brutalization of another .
The truth about Israel was not an easy one for me to accept .
I grew up believing in its virtue and superiority over its heathen neighbors , but the reality I discovered , was not so black and white .
The Palestinians are not blameless in this unfortunate episode in history , but they are most certainly the victims .
The Palestinians did not kill 6 million Jews or subject them to thousands of years of persecution .
The Europeans and Russians did that , and the Palestinians are paying a price for it .
It is n't right , and it must end .
And the Jewish people must speak out about it because they are the only ones who can stop it .
I originally got a TracFone to get access to the Verizon network as that 's all there was around my folks ' place in Maine .
( BTW , TF sells both CDMA and GSM phones - but will only offer a CDMA one if you 're in a CDMA - only area , or at least if you give them a zip code to one of those places .
hint : Oquossoc , ME is one of those places . )
Rather than get folks to track yet another number for me , I just told everyone about my new single number to call ( GrandCentral at the time ) .
I * still * have n't gotten everyone over to that number - but that 's how switching numbers goes .
I signed up for Gizmo at the same time , hooked that to a Linksys SPA2102 SIP / analog phone adapter at home ( shows as a second line on our phones ) which I * mostly * use for GV calls when I 'm home .
It 's all been working fine .
My only issue is that , to add a phone number to your GV phone list , you need to simultaneously have access to that phone and the internet .
My folks have a phone that I 'd love to direct GV calls to when I 'm there ( yes , there 's CDMA , but it 's not good reception ) but there 's no data , other then a modem , which makes receiving calls problematic .
There has n’t been much focus upon Denmark in the build - up to the World Cup , but many of those who watched this team in qualification suggest that this is the strongest Danish team since they won the European Championships in 1992 .
The lack of attention is strange when you consider they won probably the toughest group in the UEFA qualifying section , finishing ahead of both Portugal and Sweden .
Denmark have never failed to get past the group stage on the three occasions they ’ve qualified for the tournament , and whilst their opening game against the Netherlands is a tricky start , they certainly have the ability to progress .
A good defence
Few sides can count on a central defensive partnership as strong as Daniel Agger and Simon Kjaer , although they only started two qualification games together .
Not only are they good defenders , both are composed on the ball .
It ’s common to see either pick up the ball , move forward 15 yards and if there is not a key pass available , knock it to the other , and the process starts again .
They build from the back , but do so slowly and methodically .
The full - back places are still up for grabs , based upon the sides Morten Olsen has fielded in his three pre-World Cup friendlies .
Left - back Simon Poulsen can expect to start – he is a former winger who was moved back into defence by Louis van Gaal at AZ , and retains his attacking tendencies .
On the opposite side will probably be Lars Jacobsen , who offers a solid , positionally - aware presence – although he faces competition from William Kvist , a more dynamic player who can also operate in midfield .
The full - backs play relatively narrow when not in possession , looking to cover for the two centre - backs , both of whom like to move forward and attack the ball .
Injury worries further forward
Ahead of that , Denmark are currently suffering from injury problems , and the side is slightly difficult to predict for that reason .
Nicklas Bentder will lead the line if fit , but he has been struggling with a groin problem and has been forced to train alone , missing all Denmark ’s friendlies .
His replacement depends upon Denmark ’s formation – if they play 4 - 3 - 3 the natural replacement is Jon Dahl Tomasson , but if Morten Olsen opts for a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 shape , Tomasson is more suited to the central role in the attacking trio , and top goalscorer in qualifying Soren Larsen will play upfront .
Whichever system Olsen goes for , two out - and - out wingers will be used , with the Danes possessing four wingers capable of playing on either side – Wolfsburg ’s Thomas Kahlenberg , another injury doubt , and three veterans who all made their debut for the national side a decade or more ago ; Martin Jorgensen , Dennis Rommedahl and Jesper Gronkjaer .
All have slowed , and Rommedahl and Gronkjaer remain infuritating with their end product .
Rommedahl on the right and Kahlenberg on the left looks likely if everyone is available ; Gronkjaer may be an impact sub , whilst Jorgensen can play almost anywhere aside from centre - forward and centre - back , so could feature in a variety of roles .
The central midfield positions also depend on the formation .
We may see two Poulsens in the midfield ( and three in the team ) – Christian is a limited defensive midfielder at club level , but has a more all - round role for the national side , where he dovetails well with his namesake Jakob , who is naturally a more attacking player .
In a three , they might be joined by Daniel Jensen , though he often features as a substitute .
The joker in the pack may be Christian Eriksen – the youngest player in the tournament at 18 , in an ageing squad .
The diminutive playmaker has started just 15 league games in his career ( all for Ajax ) but has already attracted the attention of various major European clubs .
Olsen is generally a conservative manager in terms of team selection , and seeing Eriksen from the start in group games would be a big surprise , but cameo substitute appearances will be expected – and the fact that he could ( in theory ) fit into either the 4 - 3 - 3 or the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 may help his cause .
Conclusion
The Danes are a difficult side to categorize – they are defensive but not unattractive , and yet they do n’t really play on the counter - attack .
They like to retain the ball , but are happy knocking it across the backline without feeling pressured to find a forward pass – this is probably as a result of their centre - backs ’ ability to hit accurate long passes , especially to the wingers .
As they ’ve done for the past decade , Denmark ’s play depends upon getting the ball to the wide players , but with them declining in terms of pace and overall ability , the impact of Eriksen in a more central position might be crucial .
Attacking their full - backs will be the way to get at them .
They should progress , and would then face a team from the weakest group in the tournament ( Group F ) , so Denmark could have a bigger impact than people are expecting .

California ’s governor has proposed closing the state ’s $ 20 billion budget gap with a drastic cuts - only approach , slashing funding for vital human services without working to increase revenue .
Yet one state program seems to be immune from these cuts : the death penalty .
We think the time has come to CUT THIS .
California spends vast amounts of money prosecuting death penalty cases and supporting death row .
To avoid executing an innocent person , the death penalty process is long , complicated , and expensive .
Each prosecution seeking death costs approximately $ 1.1 million more than a trial seeking permanent imprisonment , and with more than 700 inmates , California ’s death row is by far the largest and most costly in the nation .
In total , California ’s death penalty system costs taxpayers $ 137 million per year .
Contrast that with just $ 11 million per year if we replace the death penalty with permanent imprisonment .
Top that off with $ 400 million saved if we do n’t build a new death row , needed because the existing one is so old and overcrowded .
Today , if Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger were to convert the sentences of all those on death row to permanent imprisonment , the state would save $ 1 billion over the next five years without releasing a single prisoner .
But the death penalty is not on the chopping block .
Rather than cutting the death penalty , the governor has focused on cutting the “ rehabilitation ” side of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation .
Programs emphasizing education , rehabilitation , and addiction treatment have all seen cuts to their budgets , while death penalty prosecutions continue statewide .
Meanwhile , efforts to get California ’s budget under control are threatening the safety of the state ’s most vulnerable residents : seniors and people with disabilities who rely on in - home supportive care , working moms and their children surviving round after round of cuts to child care and CalWORKs , and children who depend on the Healthy Families program for insurance coverage .
They all have faced dangerous erosions in access to health care and social services .
Yet funding for death penalty prosecutions continues unabated .
Even victims of violent crime have felt the sting of the state budget cuts .
Last year , the legislature and the governor took $ 50 million from the Victims ’ Compensation Fund , cutting money used to pay for funeral services , counseling , and medical care for crime victims and their families .
Now the fund is running out of money because the state has prioritized execution above victims ’ services .
In addition , local law enforcement is also under threat .
Los Angeles is currently unable to afford overtime pay for homicide investigations , and Oakland is about to lay off 80 police officers .
Already , more than half of the murders from the last 10 years remain unsolved in Los Angeles County and Alameda County , where Oakland is located .
Statewide , 45 percent of murders were not solved from 1999 to 2008 .
That means up to 10,000 killers walk the streets because we are not spending the time and money needed to catch them .
California must re-evaluate its budget priorities .
Cuts to social services and effective public safety programs that protect communities and reduce crime threaten California families .
Permanent imprisonment is a safe and cost - effective alternative to the death penalty , providing swift and certain justice , real public safety , and massive budget savings that can be passed on to taxpayers .
Every day more and more Californians are calling on Gov. Schwarzenegger to CUT THIS .
End the death penalty and save $ 1 billion in five years .

Florida State Senator Mike Bennett is anti-abortion .
And yet , during a floor debate on a bill requiring abortion seekers to pay for an ultrasound , the cameras caught him looking at topless pics on his laptop .

Debate over the bill — which has no exceptions for rape , incest , or endangerment of a woman 's life — has been heated , but it failed to hold Bennett 's attention .
Just as Senator Dan Gelber , a Democrat , was saying , " I 'm against this bill , because it disrespects too many women in the state of Florida , " Sunshine State News service 's cameras caught Sen .
Bennett looking at a photo of topless girls , and then watching a video of a dog shaking itself dry .
Per the same source :
Bennett defended his actions , telling Sunshine State News it was an email sent to him by a woman " who happens to be a former court administrator . "
" I was just sitting there , bored as they were debating the abortion bill , " Bennett said .

As hypocrisy gotchas go , this is a good one .
But it 's actually significantly more disturbing , if unsurprising , how little interest Bennett took in a crucial bill in which presumably he'd vote the party line .
( Update :
To be fair , we should note that while he is usually a reliable anti-choice vote , Bennett opposes pre-abortion ultrasound requirements — but his web - browsing preferences are what they are . )
Then again , perhaps he thinks the only choice a woman should exert over her body is taking off her bikini top .

Second Update : Bennett has threatened the reporter , Lane Wright , who exposed him :
" What kind of man are you ? " he asked , then ascribed other attributes to my character such as " pathetic " and " voyeuristic " .
" What kind of man sneaks over people 's shoulders like that ? "
Bennett questioned .

He also said , by the way , " I will do everything in my power , everything — I do n't know what that is exactly — but I will do everything I can to make sure your days at the Capitol and reporting are over . "
As TrueSlant contributor Joseph Childers put it , " If you 're going to threaten someone , do n't hesitate mid-threat to ponder your ability to carry it out . "

I ’d like to thank some people
You know , running a brewery is hard work .
Of course it ’s made easier by beers at noon when friends stop by for no good reason .
Other times at best it ’s a jumbled mess of legal , legislative and enforcement woes .
This was one such week beset by head spinning agencies and local code enforcements .
On Tuesday , we were surprised inspected by the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health .
The two inspectors were sent out to visit our facilities ( and other breweries in San Diego ) as a patron had lodged a complaint about local tasting rooms .
So I ’d like to take a moment to thank that one person who felt it was important to lodge a complaint about brewery tasting rooms all over San Diego .
Apparently they were concerned that we did n’t have a GIANT BLUE “ A ” on our cold boxes !
Thank you from the bottom of my heart .
You see , my fellow brewers and brewery owners are now having our hands forced ( in the name of public safety ) to go through the plan check and approval phase so that all of us can earn Health Permits for our tasting rooms .
What ’s even better and the reason we ’re all so thankful for your efforts today is that Port Brewing and The Lost Abbey has been issued a cease and desist for the sampling of beer in our tasting room .
Because , as we all know , beer is a public nuisance laced with nasty things that can kill you !
I personally want to extend my gratitude to that consumer who felt this industry needed more regulatory agencies knocking on our doors .
( The Health Department has never been interested in us before this call ) Muchas Gracias Amigo ( or Amiga ) wherever you might be .
There are breweries all over the City of San Diego who are now going to have to spend thousands of dollars on repairs that at best are “ marginally justified . ”
And while I ’m at it , a shout out to my bookkeeper Alicia Kelly who will be working extra hours to ensure the payments and checks we need to facilitate this spending spree are cut and signed .
I suppose the plumbers , electricians and restaurant supply companies would like to take a moment to thank that one person who lodged the complaint .
I ’m sure the plumber wo n’t mind firing up the concrete saw as he makes a number of cuts in our floor so that we can install new floor drains .
The electricians will have fun working to move junction boxes and installing more electrical outlets enabling us to relocate our new computer terminals because someone at a desk thinks they ’re too close to the dishwasher .
The restaurant supply company will gladly order all of the necessary stainless steel sinks and drain boards we need to be compliant .
My flooring guy is looking at a nice fat check for the installation of washable tile flooring since the concrete we ’re currently using is n’t up to code .
I doubt any of them will complain as each will be getting paid for their assistance .
Yet , I am thankful that I know that I know them because without them , we ’d be running around like chickens without heads .
And as long as we ’re thanking people , I would like to thank the two ladies from the County Office who were incredibly nice as they asked me to sign away my rights to sampling our patrons on a beverage that cannot make them ill .
Most assuredly , they could feel my pain .
As we have been sampling our faithful for 4 years , it was hard to convey the sense of dismay and shock of being told we have no recourse in this matter .
On the plus side , they did agree with me that retail sales of bottled beer and growlers should not be affected by this directive ( see below ) .
I know that we ’ll become great friends as we ’re now scheduled to see each other at least twice a year .
I ’m looking forward to hearing all about their children and how little Johnny played at second base last week during his little league game !
Having heard from all sorts of local government employees this week , I am sure they would love to personally extend their gratitude to that person who just created more work for them even though every other Friday they are being furloughed .
They all seemed “ genuinely ” concerned that someone would get sick from drinking beer at a tasting room as they rolled their eyes at us .
Did you know that Wineries and Brandy producers who operate tasting rooms in California are exempt from inspections ?
I did n’t either until Tuesday .
I ’m seriously considering going Jesus on the world and turning water ( and grapes ) into wine enabling us to get an exemption as well .
Lastly , my employees would like to thank that person who lobbed that phone call .
Normally I do n’t have a reason to swear and yell at anyone around here .
I ’m pretty even keel .
But this week , all bets were off .
I think I yelled at a guy for actually doing a great job .
I would n’t know because since Tuesday , I ’ve been thanking everyone under the sun for everything and nothing at all .
I figured if I thanked enough people , I might find the person who I really needed to .
As it ’s Friday and I ’m still not sure I have thanked that person who acted in the interest of public health , I thought I would take a few more minutes to do so .
To the person who lobbed the complaint to the County Department of Environmental Health , I ’d like to take one last moment to Thank You on behalf of all the brewers and brewery owners in San Diego County .
Thank
You for adding more work to our already busy schedules .
Thank
You for adding more stress to our already stressed out lives .
Thank
You for adding another agency we must pay fees and submit to inspections for .
Thank
You for adding taking dollars out of our bank account so governments have things to inspect .
Thank
You for giving me another reason to drink my World Class Kick Ass Handcrafted American
Beer because even though I ’m staring at a pile of paperwork I did n’t need , I ’ll be doing it with one of our non life threatening beers in hand !

King loves the boost in business that the world ’s biggest soccer tournament brings to his bar , especially early in the morning when World Cup fans order $ 2 Budweiser beers with their steak - and - egg breakfasts .

While no one is saying World Cup soccer will bump the National Football League from its perch as the most popular U.S. spectator sport , bars from New York to Houston to San Francisco enjoyed the early - morning crowds that boosted business this week .
“ We would n’t have a single person here because we would n’t even be open yet , ” said King , general manager of the Claddagh Irish Pub outside Detroit where about 100 fans clad in red , white and blue drank beer at 10 a.m. and cheered for the U.S. team playing against Slovenia on Friday .
King , wearing a red shirt touting his bar ’s status as an official sponsor of U.S. Soccer , said business was up as much as 15 percent in the first week and dinner business has not suffered .
At a Claddagh in Columbus , Ohio , the first U.S. game against England drew thousands of fans .
Soccer is a growing sport in the United States and the World Cup , being played in South Africa , will help if TV audiences are any indication .
The U.S. soccer team ’s game versus England drew almost 17 million viewers between Walt Disney Co’s ABC network and Spanish - language Univision , making it the country ’s most - viewed first - round World Cup match ever .
The first five matches of the tournament drew around double the audience that tuned in four years ago .
Many fans are heading to their neighborhood bars to catch the action and knock back $ 5 mimosas or a Guinness beer or two .
“ It is definitely helping business , ” said Ariel Williams , manager of Dave ’s Tavern in Manhattan .
“ A lot of soccer fans love the beer . ”
In Houston , David Perez , general manager of Kelly ’s Wet Spot , said it has “ absolutely ” been worth it to open the bar early .
“ We ’ve seen about a 20 percent increase in our weekday business , ” he said .

PURE AMATEURS
At Steff ’s Sports Bar near San Francisco ’s financial district , lunchtime viewers of the France - Mexico match on Thursday spilled out on to 2nd Street .
The bartender said business had been good all week .
Not everyone was happy about that .
Sitting at the bar , Peter Younger , a shipping executive and passionate fan of the sport , said he did n’t think the Steff ’s crowd compared to those that turned out to watch Champions League matches from Europe .
“ A lot of these people do n’t really know the game , whereas people watching the Champions League do , ” he said .
And the crowds can ebb and flow depending on who ’s playing , with U.S. games or neighborhood favorites drawing big crowds .
“ There have been some days when it ’s been just a couple of my friends and some days when there has been 30 or 40 people , ” said Nick Menage , general manager of Little Woodrow ’s in midtown Houston , which opens at 6:30 to show games .
Even those benefiting said sports like college basketball ’s season - ending “ March Madness ” tournament do better .
“ It ’s not like the NCAA tournament , ” said Kris Samiec , bartender at Mrs. Murphy & Sons Irish Bistro in Chicago .
Some complained that Americans prefer the comforts of home to hitting the bars .
“ Big TV not make a difference , ” said Nestor Sarmiento , who owns the Carchiofini bar and restaurant in the Corona neighborhood of Queens , where a 60 - inch high - definition plasma screen was showing the action .
“ People prefer to watch games at home on Latin American channels seen via satellite , ” he added as three people including a reporter watched the Greece and Nigeria game .
“ Everybody has the dish .
Eight years ago was better . ”
And apathy appeared when the U.S. team was not playing .
At the Ready Penny Inn , an Irish redoubt in a mainly South Asian area of Jackson Heights , Queens , business dropped off after the U.S. - England game , said owner Eddie Beglane .
Patrons at the bar on Thursday were more focused on lottery numbers than the Greece - Nigeria game .
A federal nutrition panel wants to change the way Americans eat .
The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee , composed of 13 nutrition experts , is charged with coming up with recommendations that will figure in the government 's planned update of the iconic food pyramid .
Its findings : People should consume more vegetables and whole grains , and less fatty meats , salt and sugar .
The report aims to tackle what is widely seen as a national epidemic of obesity .

This week 's annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Morocco is already its most controversial since its implementation of the 1986 moratorium on the hunting of great whales .
At stake is the future of the blue whale , the fin whale , the humpback , the sperm whale and the minke .
In the 20th century , 750,000 of these marine mammals were killed in the world 's oceans .
Yet they are still dying , at the hands of Norwegian , Icelandic and Japanese whalers who exploit loopholes in the 1986 agreement ( a voluntary and temporary one , at best ) .
Pro-whalers claim there is no difference between killing cetaceans and domestic animals for food .
This would be nonsense even if whales were n't highly evolved creatures , capable – as the latest studies show – of complex communication , abstract thought and matrilineal culture .
It is impossible to guarantee the quick death of a whale at sea .
Many die in agony , dragged backwards by boats to drown them .
We would never countenance such treatment of agricultural livestock .
Why allow it to happen to sentient marine mammals ?
After three decades of increasing strain between the anti-whaling and whaling nations , it has become clear that this state of affairs cannot continue .
The proposal before the IWC this week , sponsored by the US , is to allow a 10 - year period of open commercial whaling , in return for Japan 's agreement to reduce its take in the Southern Ocean , with a view to eventual cessation .
But Japan remains intransigent , refusing to accept this compromise .
They are in a position of strength – not least because they have been trading overseas aid in return for votes from IWC - registered delegates with little or no interest in whaling .
Representatives from the Marshall Islands , Cambodia and even the landlocked Laos and Mongolia – are wandering the corridors , their support bought by Japan .
As a result , Japan is close to gaining control of the organisation , and insiders report that the weekend 's scientific talks have come close to total collapse .
It is a question of the purists versus the pragmatists .
Organisations such as the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society ( which has just released a visceral anti-whaling video narrated by Christopher Eccleston to a soundtrack by The Horrors ) are lobbying vehemently against the US proposal .
But delegates from countries such as New Zealand , who support the compromise , are equally determined .
" More whales will die if this proposal is n't accepted , " said one adviser .
He offers the nightmare scenario of Japan simply walking away from the negotiations " and killing as many humpback and fin whales as they like " .
With the NGOs unable to agree among themselves ( the WWF and Greenpeace support the proposal ) , the UK , Australia and , perhaps surprisingly , Brazil , stand accused of deliberately trying to wreck the US solution by refusing to give way .
Meanwhile , Iceland has declared a self - imposed quota of 200 fin whales – 90 % of which will find their way to Japan as whale meat .
It is precisely this situation that the proposal seeks to stop .
But as this crucial week gets under way , we may well face the doomsday scenario .
By Friday , when the IWC meeting concludes , no one will have won , and the greatest losers will be the whales , once again .
Where are the leaders ?
It 's a question I hear from people more and more .

Tyee Reporter Katie Hyslop Celebrates 10 - Year Tyeeversary
She ’s covered education , youth and housing issues for a decade now , and we ’re lucky to have her .
People are looking for inspiration , hope , some sense that someone at least has some ideas of where the country should go -- not go this afternoon or tomorrow or next week but in the next 20 years or 50 .
Someone who is at least partly a visionary and not just a strategist and tactician .
Canadians , I think , are desperately looking for someone who can demonstrate that they have done some serious and thoughtful thinking about what kind of country we want to build .
But political leadership of that kind seems to be a thing of the past .
They do n't make Tommy Douglases any more or even Pierre Trudeaus .
Why ?
Governing as business
The source of the problem goes back to the 1990s , the first decade of enhanced corporate rights ( so - called free trade ) where the mantra was " We have to run government like a business . "
People should be careful what they ask for because the decline of democratic governance and the dilution of the ideals of leadership flow directly from that corporate imperative .
Until we recognize it and reverse it we are unlikely to find our way out of the dilemma .
Stephen Harper does run the country like a business -- with a ruthless disregard for any interests other than the fiduciary interests of those who want to see humanist , activist government dismantled .
No other prime minister in Canadian history has shown such casual contempt for democracy , its ideals and its institutions .
UBC psychology professor Robert Hare has written about what he describes as the sub-criminal psychopath .
When such people rise to the top , they serve the needs of a profit - driven organization ruthlessly well .
Is it a stretch to say that , in that mode , Stephen Harper has become the quintessential , post - industrial corporate manager ?
That 's what passes today for leadership .
What do our leaders stand for ?
But it is interesting to note that Harper comes out on top in the leadership stakes because for many people the political culture has led them to conclude that at least Harper believes in something .
It 's the Ronald Reagan syndrome -- Reagan , too , was ruthless and right - wing and most Americans disliked his policies .
But the Democrats were shameless opportunists , political chameleons people had come to mistrust .
It 's not by chance that Jack Layton comes next in the leadership polling or that Ignatieff is dead last .
The numbers are directly proportional to how Canadians see their capacity to reflect the values they themselves hold and to their assessment of how genuine they are in what they say they believe in .
Voters do n't have a clue what Ignatieff stands for and get the feeling he does n't either .
But everyone comes up short in this era of managing .
Do n't manage , envision !
The cultural context in which this quest for leadership credibility takes place reveals why there is such a desire for real leaders .
Peopled are tired of being managed .
They want some big ideas .
The new imperative of the 1990s did not encourage people to imagine just what they might get with a government run like a business .
For example , just what business are we talking about ?
Enron ?
WorldCom ?
Goldman Sachs ?
BP ?
These were the model corporations , the ones worshipped by those declaring the imperative .
All of the values they demonstrated were fatally hostile to those underpinning democracy .
I remember interviewing the head of the New Zealand Business Roundtable ( the BCNI equivalent ) while preparing a documentary for CBC Ideas in the early '90s .
He got angry just thinking about government and democracy .
He was , of course , totally supportive of the free market revolution brought in by Sir Roger Douglas in 1984 .
He railed against the notion of politics " interfering " in the economy -- as if the economy was somehow completely separate from society and from the governance of society .
These were parallel universes and in the economy only those who had skin in the game were qualified to comment , let alone act .
Dreams we can't discuss
It was about this time , particularly evident with the coming to power of finance minister Paul Martin , that we quit hearing the phrase full employment .
It had been something that all governments paid at least lip service to -- it was a goal integral to the notion of democratic governance .
But when the economy is wrenched away from society , hived off as a separate self - regulating , universe full employment has no place .
It becomes a policy orphan .
It was replaced in the government - like - a- business world with a new imperative : inflation .
This was the principal concern of the corporations and the wealthy as they had the most to lose .
The economy -- a euphemism for the most powerful corporations -- took on more gravitas than society or democracy .
Indeed , politicians began referring to their countries not as nations but as economies .
Nations need leaders , economies need managers .
It helps explain why Harper , as authoritarian as he is , leads the leadership stakes .
When the economy is front of mind , managers win .
He has no policies to interfere in the economy .
The full employment goal implied that the economy was there to serve those who worked in it -- it was supposed to function in such a way as to actually produce jobs for everyone who wanted them .
But in the new inflation - centred world the question became " Ask not what your economy can do for you but what can you do for your economy . "
How many times have you heard the phrase it 's not good for the economy ?
The economy replaced the nation in the new globalized world .
Paul Martin deliberately kept unemployment at close to nine per cent throughout the 1990s with high interest rates aimed at keeping inflation at an artificial level of just over one per cent .
The logic ?
Labour flexibility -- the driving down of wages and salaries ( and workers ' power ) -- in the interest of the " economy . "
Full employment went from being a national goal to being an economic threat .
And Canada ended up having the second highest percentage of low - paying jobs in the OECD .
The interests of workers , their families and the nation were disappeared in this new Orwellian paradigm .
EI was slashed because it was a " disincentive " to participate in the economy .
Ditto social assistance .
Labour standards are no longer enforced ( unless you belong to a union ) .
Framed
The language by which we understood ourselves was reframed by the agencies of big business -- the media , think tanks , complicit politicians , and senior bureaucrats .
In an economy we are not citizens but taxpayers ; not citizens or families but clients or customers .
Schools and hospitals now offer products .
Principals and hospital administrators are CEOs .
Then there arose the crisis in the global economy caused by greed , lawlessness and arrogance and suddenly government returned .
Many hailed its return as an important institution , hoping that its long exile would be over .
But the massive intervention was done , in the U.S. most dramatically , not on behalf of the nation or democracy or citizens but on behalf of the economy -- that handy short - form for giant corporations , the banks , insurance companies and other financial institutions that have become synonymous with the economy .
The bailouts were so huge they now threaten the nations that implemented them .
This was management , not leadership .
There was a hint of national policy in the stimulus program , forced on Harper by the NDP and Liberals .
But Harper 's bank policy has driven millions of Canadians into unsustainable debt in the interests of the economy .
Canadian and Western political culture has been twisted out of shape by placing the abstract economy on a pedestal so that big ideas -- pharmacare , robust tax revenue , a genuinely green economy , prosperity without growth , public ownership of resources , curbs on advertising , a shorter work week , free university education -- cannot be talked about because they would be seen as interfering in the economy .
That puts us a long way from nation - building .
The managers are killing us .
Bring on the leaders .

Unlike the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan , the media is taking an active interest in BP ’s oily invasion of the Gulf Coast and various news outlets have dispatched reporters across the region .
But there has been one consistently frustrating obstacle hampering their efforts : access .
Numerous reports have surfaced of BP - hired security firms and local law enforcement , refusing to allow journalists into certain areas , for one ridiculous reason or other .
But it was the Cajun Boy , writing under his government name , who managed to squeeze the following line of bullshit out of a BP spokesperson :
“ There have been restrictions placed on photography in the wildlife area because we ’ve been told that it could do harm . ”
And the last thing BP wants to do is harm the wildlife !

Ra'anana , Israel , 30 June 2010 - Further to the management statement dated 18
June 2010 , Emblaze is hereby providing the following updates :
ELSE Mobile
In October 2007 , the Company announced that its subsidiary , ELSE Ltd. ( formerly
Emblaze Mobile ) , partnered with ACCESS CO .
LTD and Sharp Corporation , embarked
on an ambitious project targeted to introduce an innovative approach to mobile
experience .
In November 2009 , ELSE first unveiled the First ELSE # mobile device , which was
designed to showcase the capabilities and advantages of ELSE Intuition# , its
new Linux based mobile platform .
ELSE 's products attracted excitement and
interest from potential partners , as well as the media and mobile analysts , for
its unique innovation and user experience .
ELSE ' management have since invested considerable time and effort to secure a
partnership for the sale of the First ELSE mobile devices .
While there was
encouraging interest in the device by potential partners , management was not
able to confirm a deal on terms acceptable to Emblaze to proceed to the
production of the device .
Due to critical delays in deliveries and the current status of the project , the
board has now decided to cease any further investment towards manufacturing of
the First ELSE mobile device and to concentrate efforts only on licensing the
ELSE Intuition platform and technology in order to realize its potential
upside .
This decision will drastically reduce the Company 's operational and development
costs and will positively contribute to its route to profitability .
The Company 's management believes that this decision aligns well with the
Group 's overall core competency and skills in the software arena , which
includes the following :
Formula Systems
Formula Systems , through its subsidiaries , is engaged in the development ,
production and marketing of information technology solution and services .
Its
appealing offerings coupled with aggressive cost - saving measures have made
Formula resilient to the recession and enabled its constant growth in revenue
and net income .
For the period ending 31 March 2010 , Formula reported
significant improvement in profitability with net income attributable to
Formula of $ 4.8 million , an increase of 41 % compared to $ 3.4 million in first
quarter of 2009 .
Going forward , Formula will continue to focus on profitability as well as
accretive acquisitions .
Emoze Ltd .
Emoze Ltd. is providing transparent , synchronized mobile push - messaging
solutions that include email , PIM ( contacts and calendar ) and a push content
platform for consumers , mobile operators , manufacturers and enterprises .
Emoze
eliminates the need for mobile devices to check or poll servers , allowing for
real - time messaging on a far wider range of mobile devices .
Emoze can actually transform most low - end mobile devices into BlackBerry - like
devices , providing the same push mail , PIM and content service .
Thanks to its
novel and efficient technology , Emoze is able to provide the ideal low - cost
push solution for the mass market .
ZONE-IP
ZONE -IP Ltd. of which Emblaze holds 71 % , is engaged , through its subsidiary
Emblaze VCON Ltd. , in the development and deployment of high - performance ,
end - to - end videoconferencing solutions over IP and ISDN networks for
enterprises of all sizes , focusing on desk top solutions .
The Company would like to use this opportunity to provide update on additional
ongoing matters as follows :
Patent infringement :
In December 2009 the Company informed the market that it has notified Apple2
Inc. that the HTTP Live Streaming Application announced by Apple and its use in
Apple 's iPhone and iPod2 touch ( and recently in the iPad ) devices , infringes
Emblaze 's patents for media streaming technology .
In February 2010 , the Company
also notified Microsoft Corporation that its Smooth Streaming system infringes
on Emblaze 's patents for media streaming technology .
The Company is currently engaged in discussions with both Apple and Microsoft
with the aim to reach an amicable resolution by licensing said IP .
The Company
will evaluate its course of action pending the results of such discussions and
will provide an update to the market when it is appropriate to do so .
HM Revenue Customs
As reported by the Company in April 2007 , the Company 's UK subsidiary , Emblaze
Mobility Solutions Limited , is involved in a dispute with the HM Revenue
Customs ( " HMRC " ) regarding a decision made by the HMRC to withhold VAT
reclaims and raise an assessment relating to VAT return in the sum of
approximately Â£ 8.8 millions .
The legal proceedings in this matter are still
ongoing and it is expected that the closing submissions will be scheduled for
July 2010 .
Further update will be provided following developments in this
matter .
Malam claim
On 7 March 2001 , Malam Systems Ltd. filed a claim against Geo Interactive Media
Group Ltd. ( now Emblaze Ltd. ) and against its founding directors claiming for
approximately 29 % of the Company 's issued share capital .
The Company 's legal
advisors as well as its founding directors were ( and still are ) of the opinion
that there are no merits to the claim .
Nevertheless , the Company 's board of
directors decided to settle this claim by payment of US $ 1 million by the
Company as the legal costs alone were expected to reach such an amount .
The
Company expects to recover part of its payment from its insurers .
Yes , I had realised the enormity of the sitation .
God has a plan so we do not need to worry .
Your figures are inaccurate .
Now you mention it , it does seem like a really big problem .
I do n't believe that there is an issue .
You are making a fuss about nothing .
I had not really thought about it .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - North Korea has sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council rejecting accusations from South Korea that it was behind the sinking of one of its neighbor ’s navy ships , saying it was the victim of a U.S. - led conspiracy .
Military rescuers search for possible survivors of missing crew members of the Navy corvette Cheonan that sank on March 26 , off Baengnyeongdo , an island near the maritime border with North Korea April 3 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Korea Pool
The letter , addressed to the U.N. Security Council president from the North ’s permanent representative to the body , followed the filing of a complaint by the South last week demanding action by the international community to deter further aggression .
A team of international investigators led by South Korea ’s military said in May that a North Korean submarine torpedoed the corvette Cheonan on March 26 , snapping the vessel in half in a blast and killing 46 sailors .
North Korea , through its official media , has already rejected the charge , saying it was a ploy by the South ’s President Lee Myung - bak aimed at political gains for his conservative government .
“ With time it is becoming clearer through military and scientific analysis that the ‘ investigation findings ’ by the U.S. and the South , which had been from their announcement subject to doubts and criticism , is nothing more than a conspiracy aimed at achieving U.S. political and military goals , ” said the letter , signed by the North ’s permanent representative to the U.N. Sin Son-ho and carried by the official KCNA news agency .
“ If the Security Council goes ahead with discussions on the ‘ investigation findings ’ ... no one will be able to guarantee there wo n’t be grave consequences to peace and stability on the Korean peninsula . ”
North Korea has driven tensions to new heights in recent weeks by threatening war if Seoul imposes sanctions .
The mounting antagonism between the two Koreas has unnerved investors , worried about armed conflict breaking out in the region .
Many analysts say neither side is ready to go to war , but see the possibility of more skirmishes in a disputed sea border off the west coast or along their heavily armed border .
Despite the tense confrontation , the South said on Wednesday it had approved the shipments of baby formula for North Korean infants as a rare exception to the ban on trade , travel and movement of goods across their border .
The United States , the South ’s biggest ally , said Seoul may not seek a full Security Council resolution because of rising tensions after the sinking of the Cheonan .
Seoul said it would hold discussions with its allies to ensure action was taken .
Western diplomats say China , North Korea only real ally , will not tolerate new sanctions , while Seoul appears determined to have the council at least agree on some form of rebuke .
Cron Job Script Calculator
This calculator requires the use of Javascript enabled and capable browsers .
This is designed to assist you in generating the syntax for creating a CRON job on your UNIX , Linux or other ' NIX system .
Most often , they are Internet servers .
CRON is a UNIX / Linux function that will allow you to execute a command or job at a designated specific time automatically .
CRON is somewhat like a system task scheduler on any operating system .
All have task schedulers , some are simple to set up and use and others , like CRON are a little unfriendly .
All times that are set for execution are based on the systems time clock .
If used as an Internet server , that may be in a different time zone .
You may want to see some of our time based calculators to assist you in determining the difference in time .
You might also need to know that UNIX and other ' NIX systems use timestamping to mark and calculate time differences .
Our To and From timestamping calculators may be of help to you .
If you determine that you do NOT have the ability to run CRON on your ' NIX system and need to have the functionality of it , we have written a CRON emulator script called MUL8CRON that allows the same thing to happen without CRON .
Contact us about it .
Here are some examples of the CRON command line .
Our defaults in the calculator are set so that any entered job will run every hour .
To run a program , script or job every hour , select ' 0 ' in the minute box , our default , and leave the rest blank .
To run a job every night at 9:30 , you would select ' 30 ' in the minute box , ' 21 ' in the hour box and leave the rest set to the asterisk defaults .
( You can find more on commands here . )
Once you have established the time , enter the full path to your program , script or job in the ' Execute This Path And Script ' box .
Click on Calculate and the resulting job command line will be displayed for you .
You may cut and paste it if you like .

Oh my goodness , all you students working your butts off in universities around the world to bring the planet fabulous industrial design , you are amazing .
In this post we ’ve got a group of just such fabulous hardworking students with three fantastic projects .
All of the projects in this post are furniture related , and they ’ve all got wild names .
And what ’s best ?
They ’re all so amazing I ’d be daft not to want them sitting in my very own gigantic lake or oceanside home .
I do n’t have an oceanside or lakeside home yet , but someday !
Right now I ’ve probably got enough room for about one of these monstrously cool amalgamations .
All are must peek .
1. Atar ( the black and white ribbons chairs ) Designers : Christian Andrés Parra Sánchez , Juliana Andrea Mosquera .
Concept : Gravitational Illusion .
A fantasy of optically excellent proportions .
These chairs float between naturalistic and industrial on a bed of impossibility .
2. Chair 1 + 1 = 1 ( clippers ) Designer : : Lily Assicie Muñoz .
Concept : Opposed Complementaries .
A step by step sort of process sheet made three dimensional with different pieces of chairness .
“ 1 + 1 = 1 means that unities do not make two things but one component . ”
3. Inqui ( three legged red black white seats ) Designers : Demetrio Collazos .
Weird , strange , odd beings with a zipper underneath to insert or take out the padding that makes the whole thing work .
The greatest excellence in aesthetics here is the zipper color accent .
Totally fabulous .

Despite its mobile prowess , Apple sucks at the internet .
But surprisingly it 's Microsoft – not Google – that 's best positioned for Our Future in the Cloud .
Here 's why .
It 's common for writers to trot out the Google / Apple binary .
It 's not entirely invalid :
Yes , following spectacular success with the iPhone and the App Store , Apple has let its online ambitions – Mobile Me and the like – wither .
And Google , inexperienced in hardware and consumer software as it may be , is an internet company , so you 'd expect it to be ahead of the curve when it comes to , well , using the internet .
But consider Microsoft , the lumbering giant , the sprawling monster .
This is a company with more experience online than the other two companies combined ; which could , if it wanted to , brings people 's lives — their media , their documents , their photos , their everything — online in a way that its competitors only dream of .
The Sacrificial Kin — — — —— —-
I did n't give the Kin , Microsoft 's new social network -y , teenage - aimed handsets much credit as phones , or as products .
( They 're seriously flawed , and fatally overpriced . )
Yet the one unequivocally great feature is a web service called Studio .
The concept is simple : Each Kin phone automatically and transparently uploads virtually everything created with the phone to Microsoft 's servers , from photos and videos to text messages and social media updates .
Everything can later be accessed through a single web interface .
It 's no surprise that the Kin came from the same team that had designed the Sidekick years earlier .
It 's a stupidly simple system , but for some reason the effect is stunning .
Here 's my stuff , on my phone .
Here 's my stuff , on my computer .
Here 's my stuff , on another computer .
Why does n't every phone work like this ?
Kin Studio bears all the hallmarks of a pilot program , with a limited scope of ambition — there 's no outgoing e-mail or SMS component , nor is it particularly powerful as a photo management tool — as well as a severely limited deployment .
If the Kin sells at all , it 'll be to a narrow slice of the population .
A sample group , basically .
This sample group will glimpse the future of Microsoft , and without knowing it , the future of how we use gadgets .
A Clear Path , for Once — — — — —— —-
The Kin is Microsoft 's polished vanguard — considering its likely failure in the market , perhaps more like a feint — but it's also indicative of what Big M could be moving toward .
Microsoft has been open about its ambitions to merge the Kin and the forthcoming Windows Phone 7 , albeit well down the road .
Before launch , Microsoft 's Aaron Woodman said as much :
He would n't confirm anything , but did say that a few years from now , we should n't be surprised to see a point where the two platforms are more interrelated .
That may sound like a typical Microsoft " mañana , mañana " promise , but given the rate at which Microsoft cooked up both Windows Phone 7 and Kin , adjustments to either roadmap probably would n't be that difficult .
For the Kin , this means apps .
For Windows
Phone 7 , one hopes , this means Studio , or something like it .
But in many ways , what Microsoft is telling us here is painfully obvious :
In the future , their mobile OSes will necessarily combine , because our phones will be mere extensions of our online epicenters ; bulging hubs of data from which we conduct our computing , and our lives .
Of course Kin and Windows Phone will share more DNA in the future — they 're powered by the same conglomeration of servers .
They live in the same cloud .
Whether or not this is a good thing is a different discussion entirely , because it 's well on its way to happening .
Google , Apple and Microsoft are all run by people who understand , to varying degrees , that our data is moving online , and all of the companies want to be there when this finally happens , dutifully archiving , re-purposing and serving all of your information .
Microsoft is just two steps ahead .
Microsoft's Dormant Army — — — — — — ——
All this talk about Kin , Windows Phone 7 and Studio is interesting not so much for what these products are , but for what they mean .
They are healthy evolutions of existing products , with some great new features .
They mean that Microsoft is serious about the cloud , and that it's ( hopefully ) ready to wield its massive stable of online services to dominate cloud services .
To name a few :
• Live :
They might not have the same user base as a lot of Google 's services ( though some aspects are actually wildly popular , and have been for years ) but , Microsoft 's spread of Live services is massive .
There 's ( Hot ) Mail , Calendar , Messenger and contacts .
There are photo galleries , folder sharing and bookmark syncing .
And of course , there 's the Live ID , a single login for all of them .
• Live Office : Like Google Docs , except created by the company that inspired Google Docs .
Officially , and in name , this is simply part of Live .
• Xbox Live :
There are two ways to view Xbox Live :
As a part of the individual Xbox experience , or as a staggeringly massive social network , which could be leveraged onto other devices , and into other products .
( Guess which one Microsoft sees ? )
• Live for Mobile : Aside from mobile versions of Live services , Microsoft 's got Mobile backup , and mobile messaging .
• Zune : Anyone with a Zune Pass has experienced a very particular aspect of the cloud :
The prospect of unlimited , on - tap music , streamed from faraway servers .
• Skydrive :
This is perhaps the most silent of Microsoft 's web services ( Do you use it ?
Did n't think so . ) but easily one of its most formidable .
It 's a web drive , well - integrated with Microsoft 's existing web services , and fairly well integrated with Windows .
( Though not so much with OS X. )
It 's a bit like Dropbox , except for one tremendous difference :
For signing up , you get 25 GB of space .
25 GB .
Free .
In other words , Microsoft already has in its possession all the pieces it needs to embarrass Apple 's meager online efforts , and even enough to dominate over Google , with vastly more developed music and gaming tech .
In other words , Microsoft is ready to own our online lives — almost .
What Microsoft Needs to Do — — — — — —
——
–
For all the promise we see in Kin Studio , and all the potential power we see in Microsoft 's sprawling empire of cloud - ish services , it wo n't amount to anything if Microsoft does n't force it together .
Microsoft 's various continents are prone to drifting apart if left unchecked .
It 's an trivial feature , technically speaking , but Google 's Dashboard will blow you away .
It 's a one - stop interface , showing you just how much of your information Google holds , where it is , and how you can access it .
Google 's always been smart about this :
Every service of theirs you use has the same ID , the same login , and links conspicuously to its stablemates .
And the brand is inherent .
Google .
Now , imagine if Microsoft did this with their services , if the process of using Microsoft Office Live , Hotmail , Xbox Live , Windows Messenger and Zune was this integrated , and this unified .
Microsoft has feinted toward this goal a few times , and yeah , your Live ID will get you past a lot of the checkpoints in Microsoft 's online world .
( The Live.com homepage is a relatively comprehensive Dashboard as - is . )
But they need to take this principal so much further : I 'm talking about merging Xbox , Zune and Live into a single mega-service .
Letting our Windows Phones upload their photos , videos and text data , Kin style , not just into a cordoned - off site , but into a main hub .
Letting the same account that you pay into for Xbox credits accept payments for Zune .
Mingling the friends I met gaming with the friends I met in real life .
What Microsoft Is Already Doing — — — — — — — —— —-
This is what they need , and according to Microsoft 's Brian Hall , the General Manager of Live :
If someone wants to access their stuff , their files , their devices , they should be able to go to one place to do that .
Microsoft seems to understand that the feeling of control is important to consumers , and that the ability to administrate via some kind of dashboard , to feel as though you 're operating within a coherent ecosystem is important , but their approach so far , and going forward , is more subtle :
I absolutely think there should be one place to [ manage your online presence ] .
At the same time , I think that the way people will interact with their people , their stuff , their information , will be much more within the context of an application .
I will email with people through my email , I will share photos and view photos through my photo application , I will play games with people through my gaming system .
I think we have to do both really well if we 're going to give people not only the experience they want , but the control that they need .
We 're definitely investing , and focused , on doing that .
This — this — is Microsoft 's secret weapon : depth .
If Microsoft rolls out an online service , it does n't just join a stable of other , complementary online services , it has the potential to reach every corner of Ballmer 's empire , from cellphones and music players to PCs and gaming systems .
A company like Google has to convince its users to jump onboard .
Microsoft , via its tremendous software and hardware user base , already has them — and through Windows , Xbox , Zune and the like , has a direct line through which to feed its online services .
They have the means , and according to Hall , the will .
All that 's left is to see if they can execute .
How They Could Blow It — — — — —— —-
What 's left is for Microsoft to sell a vision , subtly but convincingly , to the masses .
This is no small feat for a company that can be maddeningly unfocused .
But just as grave as the threat that the vision would hold together is that the actual ecosystem could fall apart .
Just last week Microsoft saw Robbie Bach , President of Entertainment and Devices ( Zune , Xbox , Media Center , Kin , WinPho , Courier ) outed , with his subordinates now answering directly to Steve Ballmer himself .
This could draw the various far - flung limbs of Microsoft together , which would make everything we 've talked about here more plausible .
Also possible :
It could throw what remains of the E&D structure into chaos , and sabotage all that potential — the potentially massive unification of Xbox , Zune , Windows Phone and Live — that Microsoft 's depth has given it .
Last week 's news should n't change too much , in theory .
But the instability is worrying .
It 's staggering to think how close Microsoft is to realizing the inevitable future of computing , especially when you contrast that with how out of touch they sometimes appear to be .
But truly , Microsoft 's engineers have already done the legwork , and with a little guidance , and little clarity , it could be Microsoft — not Google or Apple — that 'll accept all the data that we 're so willing to give .

Wildlife experts are concerned BP 's environmental disaster in the Gulf could affect Minnesota 's state bird .
Department of Natural Resource wildlife specialist Pam Perry says young loons from Minnesota reside in the Gulf for about three years before they 're mature enough to migrate to Minnesota .
Mature loons in Minnesota will migrate to the Gulf Coast in late October and early November .
Perry says if the loon 's feathers become coated with oil from the BP spill , it could weigh them down , causing them to drown .
Perry tells the St. Paul Pioneer
Press that there have been discussions about putting satellite - tracking devices on some loons in Minnesota this year , perhaps in a joint effort with Wisconsin .

THE Federal Government is considering forcing internet providers like Telstra and Optus to keep records of what their customers do online .
The records could include people 's web browsing history and emails and be held for several years , according to technology website ZDNet .
At the moment a warrant is needed before an internet service provider can begin logging a user 's web browsing history .
The Attorney - General 's Department said it was considering adopting a data retention scheme similar to one introduced in Europe after the Madrid train bombings .
Under that directive , passed by the European Union in 2006 , telephone and internet companies are forced to log details of communications for up to two years .
Only details about the date and time of each phone call , or each time a user connects to the internet , are collected .
The content of each communication is not stored .
However industry sources told ZDNet the scheme being considered by the Australian Government would be more far - reaching and could include tracking each website visited by users .

Queen Elizabeth
II may feel a little alienated when she arrives in Canada later this month , on the heel of news that the majority of Canadians believe the country should sever its ties to the monarchy once her reign ends .
Two in three Canadians agree the Royal Family should not have any formal role in Canadian society , according to the results of an Ipsos Reid poll conducted for Canada.com and released Wednesday .
But according to one expert on the monarchy , the sentiment is simply a product of Canadians being " woefully misinformed " about our institutions .
" Canada has always been a monarchy , " said Matthew Rowe , a spokesman for the Monarchist League of Canada .
" It 's part of who we are as a nation .
We did n't spring from the Earth fully formed .
We 're part of an institution . "
Canada 's association to European crowns dates back through centuries .
Now , as a sovereign nation , Canada is a constitutional monarchy , meaning the powers of the monarchy in Canada are limited by the Constitution .
According to the poll and not surprisingly , the strongest voices favouring abolishment of the monarchy in Canada come from Quebec , where eight in 10 people believe ties to the monarchy should be cut when the Queen 's reign ends , but 53 per cent think she has done a good job in her role as monarch .
On a national level , the Queen 's approval rating is at 73 per cent .
" Find me a politician who has that approval rating , " Rowe quipped .
As for what would replace the Queen , a majority of Canadians surveyed in the poll said they would prefer a republic system where the Governor General would become the elected head of state .
" Right now , our Governor General can't act as the constitutional referee , " said Tom Freda , director of Citizens for a Canadian Republic , pointing to the fact the Michaelle Jean approved both of Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's requests to prorogue Parliament .
" It 's not appropriate to have the prime minister appoint our head of state — and she does act as our head of state . . .
Some dinosaurs in Ottawa and the Monarchist League are inhibiting the democratic evolution of the country . "
But ridding Canada of the monarchy and reconstructing the government would be enormously difficult , Rowe argued .
" This would be something on a scale unheard of .
It would be completely rethinking the basis of our legal system , the basis of our government structures .
It would be a fundamental shift , " he said .
" And I do n't think there 's an appetite in Canada for that kind of shift in constitutional discussion . "
The poll of 1,017 adults was conducted June 10 - 14 , and has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points 19 times out of 20 .

One year ago today , the King of Pop passed away .
And while you might be scratching your head , wondering how Michael Jackson and his death could be connected to self storage , check this out .
According to various news organizations , including NBC and popular radio syndicate KSFM , a Toronto man recently discovered what prize was held inside his recently bought self - storage warehouse .
After Joseph Jackson , father of Michael Jackson , failed to pay a bill on a storage unit , the unit went up for auction .
Blindly , Howard Mann bought it .
Inside were over 273 unreleased tracks , including a duet with Tina Turner during Jackson 's hiatus between Motown and Epic records .
Because Mann bought the warehouse and what was inside , he believes he has sole rights to the newly - found memorabilia .
However , he has agreed to work with Katherine Jackson exclusively over the contents of the unit .
So next time you use self storage to house your prized pieces , whether they be personal artifacts or prized possessions , make sure you pay the bill on time .

Yesterday , a friend of mine showed me some pictures of her new grandson .
( Who is , in turn , the son of another friend — I ’m usually friends with my friends parents .
Friend . )
I politely oohed and ahhed over them and was struck in particular by one image of the baby , only a few hours old , resting on his father ’s torso .
The father ’s expression is one of awe , delight , and joy — pure and unabashed on his face .
It was wondrous .
I have a sense that the child will end up independent and stubborn like his father , and will grow into a thoughtful and beautiful man as well .
I was honored that she shared the images , which she had just gotten in the mail , with me , and I said as much .
And it got me thinking about an aspect of the childfree movement which actually really bothers me .
Because here ’s the thing .
I do n’t like children , and I do n’t want them .
It ’s just not my thing , and that ’s why I identify as childfree .
I also do n’t like the special privileges parents get , and I am supportive of the movement by childfree individuals to demand equal vacation time and other things that parents get by default .
I may not be saddled with a child but I also have needs and a personal life which suffer at the hands of coworkers with children , who always play the “ childcare ” card when they want to get out of working .
So much , in fact , that when a parent has a genuine child related emergency I often have difficulty believing it since there have been four such “ emergencies ” already that month .
Many parents abuse their position in society , and this is something that angers me .
I think that all members of a society should have equal rights , regardless as to their marital status , age , sex , race , or number of children .
Preferential treatment should never be encouraged .
However , I also have a lot of respect for parents and the challenges of raising children .
I would n’t say I have respect for all parents , but I think a lot of them are working hard to raise excellent humans and should be given respect for that .
This does n’t mean I want their children on the same aircraft as me , running around my neighborhood , or seated next to my table at a restaurant .
But it does mean that a friend can show me baby pictures and I can say “ what a beautiful child , ” or “ you must be so proud . ”
It means that I can be excited for ( and intrigued by ) my pregnant friends , and while I am shy about touching their bellies * or oogling ultrasound pictures , I feel honored to be included in the pre-baby festivities .
It means that I can respect parents and their children as fellow human beings , and I can treat them with dignity .
There are a lot of problems and issues bound up in parenting for me , and that ’s a topic for another post .
A lot of people in the child free movement apparently feel differently than me , however .
Most childfree sites , for example , are simply collections of vile vitriol aimed at children and their caregivers .
Childfree people who use terms like “ breeder ” and “ rugrat ” are undermining their entire movement — t’s fine to say “ I ’m childfree by choice , and I in turn respect your choices , ” but I do n’t think it ’s acceptable to denigrate those who are making different choices .
This is at the core of a choice - centered movement .
Should we have support groups and meetings of like minded people ?
Yes , just as surely as parents do .
But I do n’t think our choice gives us a right to be assholes , sanctimonious in our childfree existence .
It amazes me to see the childfree saying things like “ it angers us when people pressure us to have children , ” or “ I feel like a freak because of the choice I have made , ” when these individuals are turning around and maligning parents .
Ca n’t we all make our own choices , as fully cognizant human beings , and leave it at that ?
I ’m just as excited for my friend due in August as I am for a childfree friend who is about to embark on a two year world tour ( which , needless to say , could n’t be accomplished if she was saddled with children ) .
Both of them are going to have amazing , frustrating , and excellent experiences in the years to come , and I know I ’ll be hearing about them .
I imagine that having a baby and raising a child must be an awesome experience , it ’s just not one I ’m interested in .
I ’m puzzled by why we always feel the need to force our own choices and activities on others .
Recently I was talking with a friend about hang gliding , and how amazing it was and how if he was interested , I could have a another friend take him up tandem some time .
Instead of saying “ oh , no thank you , hang gliding sounds awesome but it ’s not for me , ” he spent the next forty five minutes trying to dissuade me from ever hang gliding again , declaring it dangerous and reckless and so on .
We humans seem to have a passionate need for all those around us to be the same , and to hold the same ideas — goodness , how boring that would get .
The joy in life for me is arguing over the pizza toppings , is jumping off mountains with an oversized kite strapped to my body , is not having children .
For me , children would be an albatross , but for others , I know , they are an empowering , liberating , wonderful , and awesome experience .
I can respect that , just as I can respect a woman ’s right to choose , or a personal preference not to hang glide .
Movements on both the right and the left are guilty of wearing blinders , and I would greatly appreciate it if the left would start examining its motives more carefully , since it always touts itself as the voice of reason .
Otherwise we ’re just as bad as the other side .
* So maybe you all are experienced pregnant belly touchers , but let me tell you I felt my first one very recently and it was a surreal experience .
It ’s firm , for starters , which I have understood to be the case .
But the being inside pressed out against me , shoving a fist ( or maybe a foot ) into my hand .
It was extremely creepy , but at the same time very cool , the sense that there was something alive and vital under there .

How Did Escher Do It ? Posted June 2010 .
How did M. C. Escher draw his Circle Limit figures ...

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction How did M. C. Escher draw his Circle Limit figures ?
( You can find a good exhibition of these at the web site Math and the Art of Escher . )
The interesting part of this question is that the mathematics involved is not at all trivial .
and the execution of the figures must have been extremely difficult .
There is much literature on the topic , but most of it seems to be mostly concerned with linking the matter to other topics of higher mathematics .
I am more interested in figuring out the details of how Escher might have proceeded .
There is apparently only one place - a recent article in the January 2001 issue of the American Mathematical Monthly by Chaim Goodman - Strauss - that comes close to answering this question at the low level I am interested in , but it seems not to provide a completely satisfactory analysis .
Escher worked in the days long before computers made this sort of work relatively simple , so what 's involved here is an elementary mathematical question :
How can one construct tesselations of the non-Euclidean plane , conceived of as a certain geometry on the unit disc in the model attributed to Henri Poincaré , with ruler and compass ?
A tesselation is a covering by repeated patterns all in some sense the same .
Familiar examples of a different , simpler type are tilings of a floor , invariant under certain translations , rather than of the unit disk .
Much of Escher 's early work involved these Euclidean tilings .
I begin with an account of how he came to those related to non-Euclidean geometry .
For this , I follow the two articles [ Schattschneider : 2006 ] and [ Schattschneider : 2010 ] .
In writing this , I have been helped much by correspondence with Doris Schattschneider .
Coxeter and Escher In 1954 the International Congress of Mathematicians ( an event held in different locations every 4 years , with hundreds or even thousands of mathematicians attending ) was located in Amsterdam , and associated with the Congress was a display of Escher 's work .
Much of this involved artistic rendering of familiar symmetries of the Euclidean plane .
It was with this exhibition that the well known geometer H. S. M. Coxeter first became acquainted with Escher 's art .
Three years later Coxeter gave an address on symmetry to the Royal Society of Canada , and he asked Escher if he could include some of his pictures as somewhat unconventional illustrations of symmetry .
The published account of this in the Transactions of the Society was apparently the first mathematical publication to contain an Escher tesselation .
Coxeter sent Escher a reprint of the lecture .
It happened that Figure 7 of the article ( a redrawn version is just below ) resonated strongly with one of Escher 's own interests , the problem of producing an infinitely repeating pattern in a finite figure .
To a mathematician , Coxeter 's figure represents a non-Euclidean analogue of a periodic tiling of the Euclidean plane , but I am going to largely ignore this , and just ask , how did Escher see it ?
I cannot answer this , but only offer a few suggestions .
We do have some record of Escher 's reaction .
First of all , in the Gemeente Museum in the Hague is Escher 's copy of Coxeter 's reprint ( this is MAP N82 in the Museum ) .
What is interesting about it is that Escher has annotated it with some of his own drawing , presumably because he was trying to figure out the geometric rules by which it was constructed .
It does give some insight into what he was thinking .
At any rate , Escher wrote back to Coxeter , saying that he had been " shocked " by Figure 7 .
He had tried to reproduce the figure by hand , and included a hand - drawn sketch illustrating his attempt .
He had only partly succeeded , and the sketch showed how far he had gotten .
He also asked Coxeter for advice on how to proceed .
For reasons that we shall see later , Coxeter added some marks to Escher 's sketch and returned it .
( This sketch is now to be found as MAP N80 in the Escher Archives in the Haags Gemeentemuseum .
Doris Schattschneider has reproduced her redrawn versions of both these diagrams in a June / July 2010 NOTICES article , one based on a slide she made many years ago and the other on a photocopy of Escher 's sketch . )
I am going to attempt to follow him in doing this , through the following sequence of pictures .
I should point out at the beginning that the problem is completely specified by the following conditions : ( 1 ) The disk being partitioned is the unit disk with radius 1 ;
; ( 2 ) the arcs bounding all of the curved `triangles ' intersect the unit circle orthogonally ;
( 3 ) at each triangular vertex there are either n=4 , 8 , or 12 uniformly distributed triangles ;
, , or uniformly distributed triangles ; ( 4 ) at the origin n = 12 .
The problem at hand is to draw the bounding arcs for arbitrarily small triangles in the tesselation .
This means finding their centers and radii .
In practice , once the centers are known finding the radii is immediate .
I shall first simply describe how one finds the centers , for the most part without mathematical justification .
This is probably what Escher did , since he seems to have thought of mathematics as an empirical science .
It is not a view of the subject to be despised , especially in light of Escher 's own substantial if informal mathematical talent .
First determine the central triangles .
The only hard part is to determine the circular arc bounding one side .
It seems to be of radius 1 .
This is confirmed , and the distance of its center from the origin also found , by constructing an inscribed square and taking symmetry into account .
Then apply rotational symmetry .
This gives us all the triangles in the first layer .
The centers of the next group of arcs lie half - way between those of the previous group .
The next group of centers split segments between the previous group in thirds .
Similar observations give another three groups of arcs by interpolating halves and thirds .
This is exactly as far as Escher got , and this is essentially what he wrote to Coxeter .
But he did n't see what to do next .
In fact , the simple process of interpolating halves and thirds comes to an end at this point .
In his letter , Escher asked Coxeter what he should do in order to continue indefinitely , and I 'll come back to this question in a moment .
It is not a trivial problem .
But first I want to summarize what one might deduce from what has occurred so far .
In the figures above , groups of centers occur often on line segments exterior to the unit circle .
What characterizes these groups ?
A group of arc centers lie on a single line if the arcs all pass through a common point .
For example :
For us this is an empirical observation , but in fact it is a general principle : Theorem .
Given a point in the interior of the unit disk , the centers of all the circles that pass through it and are also orthogonal to the unit circle lie on a straight line outside the disk .
This principle is all one needs to justify every bit of the construction so far .
It is simple to state , but it is not so simple to explain why it is valid - it is already not immediately apparent why the figure above is not deceptive .
I 'll say something later about why this principle is true , but for the moment I 'll just take it for granted .
It is in fact one of two fundamental , if somewhat subtle , mathematical principles involved in constructing figures like Coxeter's .
Whether or not Escher had formulated this principle explicitly is not clear .
As we shall see , Coxeter did n't think he had .
I have said that Escher sent Coxeter a diagram he had drawn with compass and straight - edge more or less equivalent to what we have seen so far .
He asked Coxeter what he should do to continue .
Coxeter 's response to this ( which I quote from Doris Schattschneider 's article ) was to make some marks on the sketch Escher had sent him , and to send it back with the comment I am ... interested that you succeeded in reconstructing so much of the surrounding " skeleton " which serves to locate the centers of the circles .
This can be continued in the same manner .
For instance , the point that I have marked on your drawing ( with a red o on the back of the page ) lies on three of your circles ...
These centers therefore lie on a straight line ( which I have drawn faintly in red ) and the fourth circle through the red point must have its center on this same red line .
Coxeter had added the point and the line in the following figure ; I have also shown in red the circle he was referring to .
All that Coxeter had done was to make explicit to Escher the principle formulated above .
It was not sufficient to determine the center of that fourth circle on the line he had drawn .
It is not easy to understand what was going on in Coxeter 's mind .
He must have known he had given only an incomplete answer .
In [ Coxeter : 1997 ] he later wrote about the process of constructing tesselations that whereas usually each new center arises as the common point of lines associated to interior points by the principle enunciated above , occasionally one had to do something a bit trickier .
Even later on , when writing for mathematicians , he did not specify exactly how to carry out the trickier step .
What it is easy to do is to imagine the frustration Escher felt with this reply .
In a letter to his son he wrote " I am so often at cross- purposes with those theoretical mathematicians ... it seems very difficult for Coxeter to write intelligibly to a layman . "
( [ Schattschneider : 2006 ] )
The second principle
So we ask , what is missing from Coxeter 's response ?
What does it take to locate the center of the red circle in the last figure ?
There are several possible answers to this .
One is given by Chaim Goodman - Strauss ' article , where in effect he suggests intersecting a certain rotated line with Coxeter 's red line .
This is equivalent to observing that the missing center is on a tangent to the large circle passing through Coxeter 's red point .
Maybe this option explains why Coxeter thought he had explained enough .
But drawing tangent lines with ruler and compass is delicate , and a method of doing this implicit in Goodman - Strauss 's article is more complicated than one would wish to carry out over and over again many times .
Of course the one evident fact is that someone knew how to make these figures .
The history begins apparently sometime in the 19th century .
Many of Felix Klein 's works contain such figures , most famously the book with Robert Fricke .
Here is one of those early ones with with Klein 's own annotation ( discovered by accident not so long ago in a drawer in the Mathematics Department of Göttingen University ) :
The natural question to ask is , how were all of these produced ?
For that matter , how was Coxeter 's Figure 7 drawn ?
I do not know of any record of the methods used , nor even do I know who produced Coxeter 's figure .
It is very unlikely to have been Coxeter , who usually got others to make figures for him .
A hint about at least a few can be found in a slightly different version of Figure 7 published in [ Coxeter : 1979 ] .
In this version , one can see not only the exterior lines we already know about , but also some other exterior lines proceeding from some of the exterior arc centers to the endpoints of some of the arcs .
( These are called secants to the unit circle , as opposed to tangents . )
Also in [ Coxeter : 1997 ]
Coxeter says of such lines , " ... those lines which are secants should not have been drawn . "
But this leads one to wonder , why were they drawn ?
It turns out that almost certainly they give away the secret we are looking for - that the arc centers we are looking for will be intersections of the lines we already know about with certain secants .
Here is the second basic principle for constructing non-Euclidean tesselations : Theorem .
Given two intersecting circles , the centers of all circles intersecting both of these orthogonally lie on the straight line passing through their intersection .
At any rate , this tells us how to find the missing center :
Turning things inside out I now want to give some idea of why the two principles stated above are valid .
The mathematical tool that explains the two principles I have stated is inversion .
An inversion associated to any circle in the plane is a map from the plane to itself that turns the circle inside out , swapping points on the inside with points on the outside .
If the circle has center O and radius R , it takes a point at distance r from O to a point on the same ray out from O at distance R2/r .
There is a problem if r=0 ( when the point is O itself ) , in which case inversion moves it out to infinity ( and moves infinity in to O ) .
Points on the circle are mapped to themselves .
There are a small number of important facts about inversions that we 'll need to know :
Any circle that does not go through O is mapped to some other circle .
A circle that goes through O is mapped to a line not through O whose direction is that of the tangent to the circle at O .
A line through O is mapped to itself .
An inversion preserves angles .
That is to say , if two curves intersect at an angle A , their images under inversion intersect at the same angle .
These are proved in just about any college textbook on elementary geometry , for example Coxeter 's Introduction to Geometry .
Let 's see now how they help us .
First comes a simple corollary of these facts .
If D is a circle orthogonal to C then inversion in C maps D to itself .
The points of intersection are mapped to themselves .
Because inversion preserves angles , it maps D into another circle orthogonal to C .
But there is only one circle with given intersection with C orthogonal to it .
Theorem .
Given a point in the interior of the unit disk , the centers of all the circles that pass through it and are also orthogonal to the unit circle lie on a straight line .
Suppose P to be a point in the interior of the unit disk , Q its image with respect to inversion in the unit circle .
Any circle through P orthogonal to the unit circle is taken to itself by inversion , and must therefore pass through Q .
The center of this circle must lie on the straight line perpendicular to PQ and halfway in between .
Theorem .
Given two intersecting circles , the centers of all circles intersecting both of these orthogonally lie on the straight line passing through their intersection .
I use the following elementary observation : a straight line intersects a circle orthogonally if and only if it is a diameter , which is to say passes through its center .
Suppose given circles C and D intersecting each other at P and Q. Suppose E is a third circle orthogonal to both C and D. According to the observation , it must be shown that any circle intersecting both circles orthogonally intersects the straight line through P and Q at an angle of 90o .
Let Γ be the circle with center Q passing through P. Inversion in Γ maps Q to infinity .
Inversion in Γ takes C and D into a pair of lines through P .
It takes E into a circle intersecting these lines orthogonally , which implies ( again by the observation ) that it has center P .
Hence the set of all circles intersecting both C and D orthogonally is mapped to the set of all circles with center P .
The line through P and Q is mapped to a line through P , All the circles with center P cut it orthogonally , which implies that the same is true of the original circles .
But this means they all have centers on that line .
PostScript I have not in fact answered the original question , how did Escher produce his Circle limit series ?
To tell the truth , probably by trial and error , although they exhibit extraordinary skill .
All of them are woodcuts , which do not encourage mathematical precision .

Overview Sendtools is a collections of classes for efficiently consuming iterators into one or more data structures .
It compliments the itertools module and the other excellent facilities python offers for iteration .
Sendtools is useful when :
Your source iterator is too big to fit in memory
Your data source is I /O - bound so you do n’t want to make more than one pass
You want to collect data into two or more lists ( or other collections )
You want to group , filter , transform or otherwise aggregate the data
Such situations occur when you ’re analysing query - sets from large databases or datafiles ( HDF5 - files , for example ) .
Sendtools is written using Cython to produce a 100 % compiled module , for maximum performance .
Ideas and further discussion on sendtools can be posted to http://groups.google.com/group/python-sendtools
Requirements
There are no dependencies outside of python to compile and install sendtools ( although you will need a compiler obviously ) .
If you want to hack on the Cython code , you ’ll need Cython - 0.12.1 or later .
Installation Sendtools is installed from source using distutils in the usual way - run : # python setup.py install to install it site - wide
If you have Cython installed , you can also import the sendtools .
pyx file directly using the pyximport module ( part of Cython ) .
This is handy for development , as used in the unittest script .
Usage Sendtools is built on the concept of “ Consumer ” objects .
These were inspired by python ’s generators ( an early version of sendtools was implemented in python using generators ) .
Consumer objects can have data “ sent ” into them .
Unlike generators , Consumers do not produce data iteratively ( no next method ) , but they do produce a result which can be accessed at any time using the .result ( ) method .
Data is typically sent into a Consumer using the sendtools. send ( ) function , which takes the form : output = send ( source , target ) where source is an iterator producing data .
target is a Consumer object into which the data is sent .
output is the Consumer ’s result , returned after the source has been fully consumed , or the Consumer indicates it ’s complete ( by raising StopIteration ) , whichever happens first .
Basically , the send function is a shortcut for writing a for - loop .
It ’s equivalent to ( but faster than ) : def send ( source , target ) : try : for item in source : target.send ( item ) except StopIteration : pass return target.
result ()
Note , StopIteration can be raised by target.send ( ... ) to exit the loop ( as well as by the source ) , so we handle it explicitly .
The target may be list or set , representing the data structure you want to collect the data into .
These are implicitly converted to Consumer objects by the send function .
The input list ( or set ) is returned by the send function having been filled with data .
target can also be a ( multiply nested ) tuple of consumers .
In this case the result will be a tuple which matches the structure of the target tuple , containing the results for each consumer .
In this way , data from a source iterator can be collected into multiple lists in a single iteration pass .
Sendtools defines many aggregation consumers .
These do not produce a list or other collection as their result , but a scalar value .

Rejects Judge Vic Rawl 's protest in 5 hour hearing with expert testimony on how ES&S voting system failed
Greene not at hearing , presented no case , evidence that election results were accurate ...
Brad Friedman Byon 6/17/2010 , 5:53 pm PT
The South Carolina Democratic Party Executive Board rejected Judge Vic Rawl 's official protest to the results of last week 's U.S. Senate primary , despite no evidence presented that the results were accurate , and despite Alvin Greene having not even shown up to the protest hearing .
Rawl had originally filed his protest based , in large part , on the " well - documented unreliability and unverifiability of the voting machines used in South Carolina . "
Greene 's election as the Democratic party nominee for the U.S. Senate , to run against incumbent Republican Sen. Jim DeMint , stands .
The vote of the Executive Board was 38.5 to 7.5 in favor of rejecting Rawl 's protest and upholding the results .
Not kidding .
The Rawl campaign presented an impressive five - hour case in Columbia today , including two computer scientists and security experts who both asserted that there was no reasonable explanation for election results other than some kind of voting system malfunction in either the hardware or software .
Voters testified that they had trouble selecting Rawl on the ES&S iVotronic touch - screen systems , and that their votes were flipped to Greene .
Campaign workers testified that they received calls all throughout Election Day concerning problems with the machines and reports that pollworkers were swapping out sensitive memory cartridges .
Despite the historical record of failure of the ES&S voting system , and numerous state - sponsored studies ( in state 's other than SC ) which all found that the systems are poorly coded and exceptionally vulnerable to malicious manipulation , Rawl 's team of computer scientists were not allowed access to the voting system hardware and software in order to examine it for bugs or tampering .
Rawl 's attorney instructed the Executive Board that they were required to vote on the protest on the basis of whether the evidence presented in the hearing demonstrated the results to be true and accurate or not .
No evidence was presented that the results were accurate , only that they were not .
Nonetheless , the SC Democratic Party 's Executive Board voted resoundingly to reject Rawl 's protest , which the candidate has said he will not appeal .
After the motion was rejected , and the meeting adjourned , Rawl quieted the crowd to say a few words ( the following is now transcribed directly from the audio ) ...
RAWL : Ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you , I 'm gonna take about two minutes of your time .
This is not about me .
This is not about Republicans .
This is not about blacks , it is not about whites .
It 's about the sanctity of our electorial process and the only thing that I can do here today in the time frame allowable , which is ten days --- this is a Democratic primary , this is absolutely not a general election --- we cannot seize , legally , the machines .
We do n't have the ability nor the power to go back through and look at everything as people would request us to do .
If this were a general election , perhaps we could have done that .
We were allowed ten days and ten days only .
What I would like to see the party do is to correct its rules to take this into consideration , since they 've had plenty of time to do so over the past ... I believe Mr. Frazier is now running his 15th or 16th term ... Uh , ladies and gentlemen , this is not about the Democratic Party .
This is about the opportunity to do something that is necessary in my opinion , and to look at , as an issue that has been around for a while , that the politics and the statehouse is not going to address , considering the make - up of who is there , and because of the rights and the power that they have .
This is the only opportunity that I had to bring it before a group of people who have the best interest of the Democratic Party and the state of South Carolina in their hearts and minds .
I appreciate the opportunity to present it .
I did present it to the best of my ability and the best ability of my staff .
I thank them profusely , from the bottom of my heart .
They have done absolutely magnificent things , with little time and little money .
Thank you very much .
REPORTER QUESTION :
Will you appeal this decision ?
RAWL : No !
I 'm not gonna talk any more .
Thank you very much .
[ applause ]
Wow .

Below is the LIVE streaming broadcast of the protest hearing being held right now in Columbia , SC , before the state 's Democratic Party executive board , concerning the bizarre results of last week 's Democratic U.S. Senate primary .
Judge Vic Rawl has filed a protest alleging " systemic software problems " within the state 's oft - failed , easily - manipulated 100 % unverifiable ES&S iVotronic e-vote system , leading to results that show the jobless , unknown Alvin Greene having defeated him by 59 % to 41 % ...

8:28 pm ET : BREAKING : SC Dem Party Exec Board rejects protest to Sen Election despite NO evidence presented that results were accurate !
Alvin Greene 's election upheld by SC Dem Party Exec Board 38.5 to 7.5 .
Not kidding .
8:24 pm ET : Mr. Fowler ( husband of Dem Party chair ) says " Rawl has performed great service for the Democratic Party " .
( Round of applause . )
8:22 pm ET : Chair says : " I believe votes were clearly in favor .
...
Was overwhelmingly ' for ' " ...
8:21 pm ET : There are 92 members of the SC Dem Party exec board , though many are not there .
Votes strongly in favor , so far , of REJECTING the protest and upholding the election of Alvin Greene , despite NO evidence presented that the election results were accurate ...
8:12 pm ET : Taking voice vote on whether to REJECT the protest , and thus to uphold the election results .
( Geez , could they be any more confusing about this ?!)
8:05 pm ET : Woman member : I could n't let only white folks speak up .
I believe what happened was deeply flawed .
If we react on emotion , and not based on the law , how does that make us any different than the Republicans ?
Depending on results of this motion , there may be more anger .
Suggest we make a decision , vote it up or down , and then focus on November , because that 's what 's important .
If we spend our time fighting about this in the courts .... we are all deeply conflicted .
But we 've got to move on .
As we continue to debate , the GOP continues to mount a fall campaign .
( She gets round of applause .
Seems to be in favor of REJECT Rawl 's motion . )
8:04 pm ET : Male board member ( did n't get name ) to speak against Rejecting motion :
What do we do if we make a decision that runs contrary to the election .
This thing is like a dog chewing it 's own tail .
Could go for a long time and we do n't have the time for that .
8:02 pm ET : Woman ( did not catch name )
It does come down to the machines .
In '08 SC League of Women Voters told commission : " You have flawed machines , seriously flawed machines . "
We have a candidate at this moment who has shown respect to the SC Dem Party .
( Implies Greene did n't show up at any party events , conventions , or even at hearing today . )
8:01 pm ET : " Mr. Fowler " : Against protest and overturning election .
Any fair understanding of how voters make decisions , one cannot likely conclude we would have gotten a result of 60/40 .
Despite of this , not enough evidence shown that election would be overturned by flaws .
( Carolyn Fowler is state party chair , do n't know if " Mr. Fowler " is related . )
7:57 pm ET : A member moves to deny , reject the protest and to urge Rawl to seek judicial relief instead .
Another member speaks in favor of protest :
This election is flawed , our system is flawed because there is no paper trail .
They have shown us with preponderance of evidence , that election can be rigged .
I say we deny motion , and uphold the protest .
7:55 pm ET : Now back in open session .
7:23 pm ET : Closed session will be to deliberate with lawyers , to determine legal standards of how to proceed .
Currently recessed during that closed Executive Session .
Vote will ( presumably ) occur on whether to accept or reject Rawl 's protest to the election results afterwords .
If so , will a new election be run ?
That 's what Rawl 's camp is asking for .
We wait ...
7:20 pm ET : Chair takes vote on whether to go into executive session ( presumably , a closed session ) .
Vote is very close on that !
Takes a recount !
Goes to voice vote to find out for sure .
Looks like closed session wins !
Recess for private Executive Session .
7:16 pm ET : Q : What is your request ?
Nettles : I request is you find this election invalid , and order a new primary for the U.S. Senate .
7:15 pm ET : Nettles :
We presented expert review of data and stats .
This is an anomaly , not right .
If someone else says results are inaccurate because of machines , they'd have to prove that it was the machine 's fault , as we did .
7:14 pm ET : Nettles : Does the SC Dem Party want Alvin Greene to run for U.S. Senate ?
7:12 pm ET : Nettles :
These thing happened across the country .
When you see these things , all the experts agree , something 's wrong , there 's a flaw in the program .
Whatever decision executive comm .
makes , it has to be based on the evidence in this case .
What evidence have you heard today that this was a true , valid election ?
None .
( That 's true also because Greene did n't even show up , nobody represented his side .
- BF )
7:10 pm ET : Nettles : Summarizes the expert testimony , and theories of what could have happened that were dismissed by statistical studies .
Focusing on only a problem with the machines left .
" When there is no paper trail , you can't have a recount .
You 're only going to get what was printed out the first time .
On absentee precincts , you can have a recount . "
7:09 pm ET : This is not a criminal standard .
We do n't have to prove what happened , just that something ruined results .
When you eliminate all other possibilities as to what went wrong , you are left with only one possible solution .
7:04 pm ET :
The standard is that if you find enough questions about validity of this election that could change the results of this election , that 's the standard .
7:03 pm ET : Nettles notes the only question is whether this election , not others on the ballots , should be thrown out .
If board grants request , it 'll be a two man race for Senate primary .
7:02 pm ET : Rawl atty Nettles begins closing argument by answering a few remaining questions from board .
6:58 pm ET : [ Notes during pause here :

6:46 pm ET : Prior to Rawl attny Nettles closing argument , a 10 minute recess now ongoing ...
6:44 pm ET : Q : Were the passwords stored on the machines accessible ?
Expert Buell :
We do n't know the answer .
The state elections commission would have the answer .
6:43 pm ET : Q : How does replacing memory cards in middle of race effect the process ?
Expert Abrams :
Have n't run experiments , but according to ES&S manual , you can't close machine if a different card than the one when it was opened .
If you do , you lose the data on the cards .
6:38 pm ET : Ludwig : I 've run state elections , I 've run local elections .
I 've never seen anything like this before .
Greene ran no campaign .
Rawl had a very aggressive campaign .
There 's never been anything like this , since running campaigns in SC since 1996 that compares .
6:34 pm ET : Cmpgn Mgr Ludwig :
We 've seen these same problems all over the country .
( See BRAD BLOG 's article on historical ES&S failures here - BF )
6:32 pm ET : Q : Is there a way to check for programming errors ?
Comp . Expert Buell :
Only way to check for programming errors is to conduct extensive tests .
Thousands of lines of codes .
Ballots are programmed differently for each election , so it 's a moving target .
6:30 pm ET : Comp Expert Buell : Actual data will be lost in next day or so , due to upcoming run -off election !
( GET COURT ORDER TO KEEP DATA !!! - BF )
6:29 pm ET : Is there more research that could be done if there were more time ?
Comp Expert Buell : Yes .
FL did a very narrow study after probs in '06 election .
CA SoS ordered a more thorough study .
OH did a study and decertified the machines .
One problem doing that research is that software and hard are considered proprietary .
6:27 pm ET : Chair Q : Did you personally test hardware and software of machines used in election ?
Comp Expert Abrams : I went to examine them , but officials refused to let me do so .
We had the technology , but were thwarted by the county .
6:26 pm ET : Rawl Cmpgn Mgr Ludwig :
If we had paper ballots , we could go back and count them .
But we do n't have that .
So we can't tell you what went wrong .
6:25 pm ET : Rawl Cmpgn Mgr Ludwig :
We 're not asserting they were hacked .
We do n't know what happened .
We know the results are wrong .
Do n't know it was malicious hack .
Could be a mistake , a hack .
These machines are incredibly frail .
We just know the results were wrong .
6:22 pm ET : Expert Abrams : 42 out of 46 counties have data on ballots prepared by SC Election Comm .
If there was a problem at that commission , then basically all the counties could have a problem because of that one problem --- due to malicious code or a mistake .
Expert Buell : Let me corroborate that .
A bug could propagate statewide if only one place sets up all the systems .
6:18 pm ET : Chair Q :
We all recognize computers and voting machines are subject to error .
Is it expected to get reasonable results in all races accept U.S. Sen race in Democratic primary ?
How can this be explained ?
Expert Buell :
In software with bugs , its not that uncommon that one particular flaw stands out .
I do n't find that to be an unusual kind of event .
If somebody were to tamper with machines , you 'd expect one change , and not the rest .
6:13 pm ET : Chair Q :
If vote tampering could have happened , what other evidence do we have other than results of this election ?
Expert Buell : I do n't think that we do .
Many of the studies have shown that the security is very very low .
Code can be tampered with a bug , and then self - erase itself on way out .
Virtually every study has shown how it can be done .
So it looks like original software was there when investigating after election .
6:10 pm ET : Chair Q : Could a hacker cause totals to simply be reversed ?
Answer from Abrams : Could be done in one of two ways .
Could have hacked into software that produces ballots , or it could be done on the tabulation software on the Unity computers were the votes were being computed .
If someone had hacked them , it would be a fairly easy job .
6:08 pm ET : Chair Q :
Any physical evidence that shows voting machines were connected to Internet on Election Day .
Answer from Abrams : I do n't know that voting machines were elected , but clearly Unity ( tabulator computers ) were connected .
6:06 pm ET : Chair :
If machines were flawed or corrupted , why was this the only race corrupted ?
Abrams :
Is possible that there was only a bug , or a hack on a single line on a ballot .
Assumption is there was a problem with just the Senate race .
6:02 pm ET : Chair asked if any witnesses were paid , and if so , how much .
Expert witness
Abrams says he was n't paid yet , but hourly rate is $ 100 / hour .
Estimates maybe 7 days , 4 hours a day for investigation , not for testimony .
No other witnesses raise hand to say they were paid .
6:01 pm ET : Someone asks if all this is true then ALL the machines in SC " are bad " .
Chair says only question here is whether protest should be accepted , and if so , what is remedy .
6:00 pm ET : During short pause , I 'll note that the Rawl campaign MUST get a court order to get all memory cards and machine chips quarantined immediately before they are scrubbed !
5:57 pm ET : Rawl attorney Nettles completes presentation .
Witnesses still in room for questioning from members of SC Dem Party exec board .
5:53 pm ET : Joan Weigel from Lexington Cty . Voted for Gov first , went to second race , hit Rawl 's name , it lit up , went to 3rd race and went to confirm and GREENE 's name had a check mark by it !
( This is a very familiar prob with ES&S iVotronic probs reported in the past ! )
5:52 pm ET : Voter ( a teacher , but I missed the name ) says Rawl was not on the ballot at all .
5:49 pm ET : Susan Turner , voter , college teacher : Tried to vote for Gov. , got a " grey screen " and then a vote for Alvin Greene , Senate lit up !
5:47 pm ET : Ann : Trouble with machines reported all day long .
Memory cards had to be changed in the middle of voting ( oy ! )
5:46 pm ET : Ann : Voters said they got D ballot when attempting to vote R and vice versa .
5:45 pm ET : Ann : Affidavits that Rawl was n't even on the ballot in some cases .
Did n't have reports of reverse happening ( attempts to vote for Greene , but Rawl lighted up ) .
5:44 pm ET : Abrams finishes .
Ann ???? , a campaign worker takes stand to testify to problems received from voters on Election Day .
Voters tried to " repeatedly press it " for Rawl " 4 to 6 times " and it would n't light up .
" They tried and pressed Greene and it did light up " .
5:41 pm ET : Abrams :
Some flash cards sent to Rice U. Found no individual ballots on flash cards .
One more link in the chain that we cannot verify .
5:40 pm ET : Abrams : I do n't believe results a " true accurate count of vote " and " no way to verify " whether it is .
5:39 pm ET : Abrams :
No independent paper record of vote totals .
Only software totals .
5:37 pm ET : Abrams : Berkley ( sic ? ) County " Unity " computers , the tabulators , were hooked to the Internet ( despite dangers of accessing these machines via Internet ) .
Would be possible for someone to alter the vote via Internet .
5:34 pm ET : Abrams :
Hired to look at software , flash cards .
Was n't allowed to .
( if I heard that correctly ) .
Would be very easy for a voter to tamper with computer in many different aspects .
5:30 pm ET : Computer forensic expert Steve Abrams of NYU takes stand .
Lots of impressive credentials .
5:28 pm ET : Buell :
These machines should be used with an enormous amount of skeptism .
It 's entirely reasonable to believe if we got a surprising result , that something went wrong with software .
None of the external reviews have found these machines acceptable .
5:23 pm ET : Buell : Federal testing authorities do no tests of software or counting of votes .
5:18 pm ET : Buell :
Has reviewed all academic reviews of e-voting machines .
Especially Ohio's EVEREST report and FSU 's study .
These machines are " exactly the type of programming a student should n't do ...
If password routines were done by a Senior student , we would n't give him a passing grade .
One password was stored in the software , and was same password used on every machine ... you absolutely do not store passwords in the sourcecode ! "
5:14 pm ET : Duncan Buell , computer science expert from U. of S.C. called to testify on ES&S iVotronic e-voting .
5:12 pm ET : Ludwig finishes : " Judge Rawl actually won , if all of the votes had counted correctly . "
5:09 pm ET : Ludwig still : " Vic Rawl campaign hard , compared to Mr. Greene who did not campaign at all .
...
It is n't that he was n't competitive , he was n't competing " .
Rawl had paper endorsements , campaigned across state , etc. Internal poll showed Rawl running against DeMint 50 - 43 .
Campaign did over 200k robo-calls , over 330k GOTV mailers .
5:02 pm ET : Racial preference does n't explain discrepancy either , according to more experts at FiveThirtyEight.com and SwingStateProject blog .
" No relationship between race and results in counties " .
5:01 pm ET : We did not start at " 50/50 " as some have said .
Rawl did actual campaigning , Greene did not .
Ballot order does not explain discrepancy , since Greene was first on absentee paper ballots too .
4:56 pm ET : Ludwig :
If inauditable Election Day totals were equal in percentage to absentee paper ballots , Rawl would have won .
4:53 pm ET : Ludwig : Paper - based absentee ballots had disparity with Election Day ES&S voting machine ballots in many counties .
Nothing even close occurred in any other race on the Dem ballot .
Rawl won in absentees , lost on Election Day .
4:50 pm ET : Ludwig believes results not true .
" Serious abnormalities " .
4:48 pm ET : Nettles calls Walter Ludwig , Rawl campaign chair to testify .
4:45 pm ET : Rawl attorney Truet Nettles ( sp ? ) begins case : " Results not true , do not reflect majority of votes .
...
Will show committee real math , real statistics and real explanations of what SC voters really wanted to do ...
Will have presentation from Professor Buell and Steve Abrams , forensic expert in computers , testimony from staff about what happened on Election Day and voters as to what happened when voters tried to vote for Rawl .
All the evidence today shows that is not a valid , true result of the way voters voted . "
4:41 pm ET : Greene NOT at protest , apparently .
Was given " every opportunity " to be in the room today .
Chair says she had folks tell him personally that the proceedings were important .
4:39 pm : ET : Back in session .
4:27 pm ET : Taking a five minute recess .
Rawl / Greene protest should take place after break .
4:25 pm ET : Motion passes , so they are voting on whether to REJECT the U.S.
House race protest ( Senate protest coming up next ) .
Motion to REJECT protest of U.S. House race , on grounds that there are not enough problems reported to change the results of the election .
4:24 pm ET : Now voting on whether they have enough members of the Exec Board present to vote on whether they can vote on changing results of an election .
That motion passes .
4:22 pm ET : Live stream is now back !!
4:12 pm ET : Rawl camp just told me : " There 's a protest in front of us --- will go up when ours starts . "
I recommended they get back on air now instead !
3:53 pm ET : I 've sent a note to the Rawl camp to let them know the feed is suddenly " off air " , if they do n't know .
Hopefully it 'll get back up shortly !
House race was still being protested , so I do n't think the Rawl / Greene Senate race protest has begun yet ...
3:45 pm ET : Live feed just stopped for some reason ...
3:33 pm ET : First up is a protest concerning a U.S. House race .
Rawl 's protest will come second today .
3:15 pm ET : State Dem Party chair Carolyn Fowler gives ground rules , counts to assure quorum , etc .

The gay couple in Malawi , who were spared a 14 - year prison sentence by a presidential pardon , said on Tuesday they have split nearly six months after the wedding that led to their sodomy convictions .
Steven Monjeza ( 26 ) and Tiwonge Chimbalanga ( 20 ) were arrested in December days after holding a wedding ceremony in conservative Malawi ’s commercial hub Blantyre .
Their arrest triggered
international protests over the country ’s anti-gay laws .
They were locked up for five months during their trial and after their conviction , until President Bingu wa Mutharika pardoned them on May 29 .
Less than two weeks after their release , they said they had broken off the relationship .
“ I am no longer in love with Tiwonge Chimbalanga .
I am in love with a woman called Dorothy Gulo , ” said Monjeza .
“ We are planning something for the future with Dorothy . ”
Chimbalanga said he read about Monjeza ’s decision in the local newspaper , but added : “ I am not disappointed about this . ”
He said his ex-partner was “ free to marry as I will also marry my man of my life .
There are lots of good men around .
I will remain a gay . ”
“ What you should know is that nobody forced him when we did our symbolic wedding in December . ”
Chimbalanga said Monjeza , who lives in Kameza village — 10 km outside Blantyre — has been “ pressurised by his uncle ” and relatives to leave him and instead seek a woman as a lover .
His uncle , Khuliwa Dennis Monjeza , said : “ I will make sure that Chimbalanga does not seek a reunion with Monjeza . ”
He said same - sex marriage was “ alien and unheard of in our culture ” , adding that their relatives had warned Chimbalanga “ not to set foot in the village …
They threatened they would deal with
him . ”
Monjeza said he had “ learnt his lesson from my prison experience and I do n’t want to do anything with homosexuality ” .
The couple ’s sentencing drew sharp criticism from Western donors who bankroll much of Malawi ’s budget , and prompted UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon to call for the reform of anti-gay laws around the world .

Details are still sketchy , but it ’s being reported that Faisal Shahzad has pled guilty to the charges against him in connection with the May 1st bombing attempt in Times Square :
The defendant in the Times Square bomb plot pleaded guilty to a 10 - count indictment on Monday , an abrupt and expedited end to a homegrown terror plot that extended into Pakistan and an Islamic militant group there .
The defendant , Faisal Shahzad , 30 , entered the courtroom just after 4:30 p.m. , his hands cuffed behind his back .
He sat at a table and drummed his fingers on the surface as his lawyer Philip Weinstein conferred with Judge Miriam Goldman Cederbaum and a prosecutor .
The judge asked Mr. Shahzad , who wore a dark blue short and a white skullcap , to stand .
The judge asked Mr. Shahzad to stand .
She told him that the first charge he faced was attempted use of weapon of mass destruction , count one .
“ How do you plead to that charge ? ” the judge asked .
“ I do plead guilty to that charge , ” Mr. Shahzad said .
The judge then said to Mr. Shahzad , “ I gather you want to plead guilty to all of them . ”
“ Yes , ” Mr. Shahzad said .
Mr. Shahzad ’s guilty plea was consistent with his behavior since his arrest on May 3 , when began cooperating with federal authorities for more than two weeks without counsel and waiving his Miranda rights .
The only question would be whether Mr. Shahzad would be seeking some sort of leniency in sentencing in return for his assistance , something his lawyers may be seeking .
But legal experts say that absent any sort of written agreement – and there may be none since he cooperated for so long without a lawyer — the government is under no obligation to push leniency for Mr. Shahzad , who faces a mandatory life sentence on two counts .

Common musk turtles have special abilities
One type of turtle possesses an extraordinary organ that allows it to breathe underwater and stay submerged for many months .
The common musk turtle has a tiny tongue lined with specialised buds , scientists have discovered .
Rather than use this tongue for eating , the turtles use it to exchange oxygen , solving a mystery of how these reptiles can remain submerged for so long .
Details are published in journal The Anatomical Record .
" I was very surprised , I really did n't expect that , " says zoologist Egon Heiss , who is studying for his PhD at the University of Vienna in Austria .
Mr Heiss and colleagues made the discovery while studying the feeding habits of the common musk turtle ( Sternotherus odoratus ) , a freshwater species that inhabits lakes and rivers in southern Canada and the eastern US .
Adults spend most of their lives underwater , but juveniles occasionally come onto land to search for food .
While filming these juveniles trying to feed , the researchers noticed something unusual : when the animals found food , they could only eat it after dragging it back into the water .
Out of land , they struggled to swallow their prey .
A closer examination of the turtle 's tongue revealed why .
The common musk turtle has a weak and tiny tongue covered with and surrounded by specialised bud - like cells called papillae .
Further tests revealed that the turtle uses these cells around its tongue to breathe , by drawing in oxygen from water that passes over them .
" We knew that an organ for aquatic respiration must be present somewhere but finally discovered it accidentally , " says Mr Heiss .
Hibernating underwater
Some turtles cannot breathe underwater at all .
All marine turtles , for example , must come to the surface at least every few hours to gulp air .
Of freshwater turtles , some cannot breathe underwater , while others do so via their skin .
Scanning electron micrograph showing tongue ( T ) and the respiratory lobe - like papillae ( indicated by arrows )
Other species , such as the side - necked turtles of Australia , cope by using specialised cavities in their rear , known as cloacal bursae , to draw in water and remove the oxygen .
Such turtles often need to spend long periods of time underwater , where they hibernate , remaining asleep and still , not feeding and slowing their metabolic rate down .
" Musk turtles , however , lack cloacal bursae and their skin is relatively thick and lacks a well developed capillary network , " Mr Heiss told the BBC .
So how these turtles can spend months underwater without coming to the surface has remained a mystery , as they cannot take in enough oxygen through their skin .
" We found the large papillae in the throat and were immediately fascinated , " says Mr Heiss .
He and his colleagues believe the musk turtle 's tongue is likely to be an ancient trait .
Turtles are among the longest surviving group of higher land vertebrates , known as amniotes , having persisted for 220 million years .
" I truly believe there 's still a lot to discover , " he continues .
" This study shows how plastic adaptations to certain environmental circumstances can be in turtles . "
Cell phones are one of the best inventions of all times and they have really changed the way we communicate pushing this process beyond the limits .
Tracing instant evolution of this hi-tech product we can state that it evolves extremely fast changing its technical performance along with the design .
And sometimes it is hard to say what is more important for the clients – design or performance attributes .
Modern cell phone is not that square piece of plastic with antenna and small screen , odd keyboard and acid - green micro-light .
Still that sweet nostalgia makes us remember our first cell and how much we ’ve loved that now - obsolete design .
1990 ’s were the epoch when phones have received bigger screens , abandoned aerials and antennas , became smaller and smarter .
Also we can state the fact that in 90 ’s marketers understood that original design can boost your market share even without any extra technical advantages .
Today we can easily say that the 90’s cell phones are vintage because they represent a stratum of design history that have established modern vision of mobile devices .
We gathered a collection of interesting designs that were popular back then and we are sure that some of these are familiar to you .
It is really interesting to observe how cell phones evolved fusing technical improvement with design innovations .
One more great thing about cells is that these gadgets have mixed and developed some dissimilar spheres like GSM networks , design singularities and software abilities .
We ’ve picked models that have interesting design or were important milestones ( on our opinion ) but of course it does n’t mean that our list ca n’t be updated with your suggestions – we are glad to hear what your favourite ones were in the comments section .

Washington ( CNN ) --
When the Obama administration unveils its National Security Strategy Thursday , it will be the first time a president explicitly recognizes the threat posed to the country by radicalized individuals at home .
" For the first time since 9/11 , the NSS integrates homeland security and national security , " according to highlights of the plan given to CNN by a senior administration official said .
The security strategy acts as a blueprint for how the White House intends to protect Americans .
In the past , it has focused mostly on international threats .
But National Security Adviser John Brennan explained Wednesday that a spate of terror - related plots in the United States recently prompted the Obama administration to include homegrown terrorism in the document .
" Such a strategy must begin with the recognition that a clear - eyed understanding of our strategic environment -- the world as it is today -- is necessary to shape the world that we seek , " according to a summary of the plan .
" Currently , the United States is focused on completing a responsible transition in Iraq , succeeding in Afghanistan , and defeating al Qaeda and its terrorist affiliates , while moving our economy from deep recession to enduring recovery .
Even as we confront these crises , our national strategy must take a longer view .
We must adapt and lead in a rapidly changing , interconnected world in which interests of nations and peoples are increasingly shared . "
Homegrown terrorism represents a new phase of the terrorist threat , officials said .
Earlier this month , Pakistani - American Faisal Shahzad was charged with trying to detonate a car bomb in New York 's bustling district of Times Square .
U.S. Army Major Nidal Malik Hasan is suspected of fatally shooting 13 people at Fort Hood in November .
Colorado resident Najibullah Zazi , an Afghan national , pleaded guilty in February for conspiring to detonate explosives in the New York subway system .
David Headley , an American citizen from Chicago , Illinois , is accused of providing surveillance in the Mumbai , India , terrorist attacks that killed 160 people .
" We 've seen an increasing number of individuals here in the United States become captivated by extremist ideology or causes , " Brennan said .
" We have seen individuals , including U.S. citizens armed with their U.S. passports , travel easily to extremist safe havens , return to America , their deadly plans disrupted by coordinated intelligence and law enforcement . "
Brennan , who made his comments at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , said that as the United States has strengthened its defenses against massive attacks like 9/11 , al Qaeda has shown itself to be a " resilient , resourceful and determined enemy . "
Brennan said al Qaeda is recruiting individuals with little training , attempting relatively unsophisticated attacks and seeking people living in the United States to launch such attacks .
" They are seeking foot soldiers who might slip through our defense , " Brennan said .
" As our enemy adapts and evolves their tactics , so must we constantly adapt and evolve ours . "
Brennan did not provide any specific details about the president 's strategy for combating al Qaeda and its affiliates , but said it " will require a broad , sustained and integrated campaign that harnesses every tool of American power , military and civilian , kinetic and diplomatic . "
The strategy is built around protecting " four enduring U.S. national interests -- security , prosperity , values , and international order . "
In order to achieve this , it must strengthen U.S. institutions , values , and infrastructure -- such as education , energy , science and technology , and health care .
It calls for strong diplomatic efforts internationally and galvanizing " collective action to address the share global challenges of our time . "
" Engagement begins with our friends and allies -- active partners in advancing common interests .
We will continue to deepen our partnerships with increasingly active centers of influence -- cooperating when we can , and differing when we must .
" With adversarial regimes , engagement provides us a means of testing intentions , giving governments the opportunity to change course , and mobilizing international coalitions . "
The strategy calls for updating " all of the tools of American power , and work with our allies and partners to do the same . "
" These tools include those in the fields of defense , diplomatic , development , homeland security , the rule of law , intelligence , and strategic communications , as well as support the participation of the American people and private sector .
We are working to strengthen each of these tools , but also to integrate them through coordinated planning and capacity building in key areas , " the strategy said .

Before A ’s pitcher Dallas Braden kicked off the chic new trend for 2010 , perfect games were something of a rarity .
Perfect games were baseball ’s Halley ’s Comet , a sight to be savored with the knowledge that it will be years before you see it again .
Between 1880 and 2009 , there were 18 perfect games .
But between this May 9 and June 2 , there were darn near three .
Halley ’s Comet keeps circling back .
Only a blown call by umpire Jim Joyce prevented the first season in baseball history with a trio of perfect games .
Joyce ruled incorrectly Wednesday that Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was late covering the bag , giving Jason Donald an infield single with two outs in the ninth .
Nevertheless , the officially recorded masterpieces by Braden ( May 9 ) and the Phillies ’ Roy Halladay ( May 29 ) give baseball two perfect games in a season for the first time since 1880 .
That ’s eighteen - eighty , Jamie Moyer ’s rookie season .
In a question akin to asking why the Loch Ness Monster keeps popping up or why the rash of UFO landings , here goes :
What ’s the deal with all these perfect games ?
“ How do I explain it ? ” Minnesota Twins manager Ron Gardenhire mused .
“ They ’re putting a magical moon dust on the ball this year , and it ’s taking all the hits out of the bats . ”
He smiled .
“ Anything else you need explained ? ”
Actually , Gardenhire ’s magical moon dust is as reasonable as some of the other explanations put forth .
Twins pitcher Carl Pavano argued , similarly , that it must have to do with the alignment of the stars and the planets .
Here ’s a look at some of the other theories :
It ’s A Coincidence , Silly :
The most common , and most boring , explanation for nearly having three perfect games in a month is that it ’s simply a freakish deviation in the baseball continuum .
Statisticians Sean Forman and Andrew Kamholz wrote a piece for the New York Times noting that between 1880 and 1968 , perfect games came about once every 11,500 games .
Since ’ 68 , they have come about once every 8,200 games .
“ That means the frequency of this exceptionally rare event has increased just a bit , ” they wrote .
“ If a couple of umpire calls or ball bounces go another way , the numbers could just as easily be reversed . ”
They found a slight change in this year ’s offensive output compared to peak years but added that in 2010 teams were still averaging 12 hits plus walks per game and concluded that “ this run of perfection on the mound is a random event rather than a result of some underlying change in the game . ”
Baseball Prospectus writer Jay Jaffe , responding to an e-mail from the Mercury News , said it ’s important to remember that there are roughly twice as many games in the 30 - team , 162 - game era as there were in the 16 - team , 154 - game era .
Perfect games happen about 0.005 percent of the time .
“ Looking at the results of a single year , there ’s really no sensible interpretation for the distribution of no-hitters and perfect games other than randomness , ” Jaffe wrote .
“ The standard deviation for the percentage of no-hitters is 0.056 percent , which means that about two - thirds of the time we should expect to see between 0.3 and 5.7 no-hitters per year . ”
The De- Juiced Theory : Former All - Star pitcher Bert Blyleven , whose 287 career victories included a no-hitter in 1977 , subscribes to the Coincidence Theory .
But if he had to put his finger on another factor , Blyleven said the crackdown on performance - enhancing substances seems to be having an effect .
“ Maybe the ball is n’t jumping off the bat like it did during the steroid era , ” he said .
Entering play Saturday , the American League was batting .260 , the NL .256 .
Both marks were each league ’s lowest since 1992 .
“ The game for the past few years , maybe longer , was all about the three - run home run , ” said Blyleven , now a Twins broadcaster .
“ Now , we ’re getting back to a time when it ’s all about small ball and getting that runner in from third , just like it was in the 1960s , ’70s and most of the ’ 80s . ”
Still , as Blyleven acknowledged , the math does n’t add up .
There were more perfect games during the muscled - up 1990s ( four ) than there were during any other decade .
Jaffe , the Baseball Prospectus writer , argued that the offensive potency of an era does n’t matter as much as people think .
“ If we check the correlation between scoring levels by decade and perfect game frequency , ” he wrote , “ we find that the relationship is essentially random . ”
The Give - Them - Some - Credit Theory : Braden , not surprisingly , thinks the guy throwing the ball has a little something to do with the recent perfect games .
“ There are some pretty good pitchers in this game right now , ” Braden said .
Braden is in such awe of Halladay , for example , that he did n’t want to bother him with a congratulatory message .
“ The guy ’s thrown more complete games than I ’ve got innings in the big leagues , ” he said recently .
Pavano , in his 12th season , agreed that the pitchers deserve credit .
He said Halladay “ has the stuff to do it every time out ” but said other pitchers , such as Braden , help themselves by working fast and throwing strikes .
“ I think you ’re seeing a better ball - strike ratio than you ’ve seen in some years past , ” Pavano said .
“ That ’s what Braden did .
He knows that a batter can make contact , just make sure ( the batter ) does n’t square it up . ”
Then again , pitching talent does n’t necessarily equate to perfect games .
Walter Johnson , Christy Mathewson , Greg Maddux , Roger Clemens , Steve Carlton and Tom Seaver combined for 2,139 career victories — and zero perfectos .
Of the 18 pitchers to throw perfect games before this season , five are in the Hall of Fame and another ( Randy Johnson ) will be .
But there are also four pitchers — Lee Richmond , Charlie Robertson , Don Larsen and Len Barker — who won fewer than 100 career games .
Larsen , for example , was 3 - 21 for the Baltimore Orioles in 1954 , just two years before he twirled the all - time classic in the World Series .
The High - Tech Positioning
Theory :
In Braden ’s masterpiece against the Tampa Bay Rays and Halladay ’s gem against the Florida Marlins , most of the batted balls were hit right at defensive players .
( Only in Galarraga ’s game was there a spectacular defensive play : Austin Jackson ’s over - the - shoulder catch in center field . )
Those balls being hit right at people are not always a matter of luck .
A’s manager Bob Geren noted that there is so “ much more information available now about how to pitch guys , how to position guys , than there was 10 years ago . ”
Detailed breakdowns and hit charts are available of where a batter is likely to strike the ball .
There are also DVDs opponents can study to see how a batter reacts to a particular pitch selection in a particular count .
Dizzy Dean never had it so good .
Gardenhire , however , maintains that trying to explain the perfect games is as futile as trying to hit Halladay with a chopstick .
“ I go back to something ( late Twins owner ) Carl Pohlad told me years ago : Baseball is a game of cycles , ” Gardenhire said .
“ That always stuck with me .
Right now , we ’re just in one of those cycles where ( perfect games ) are happening .
“ That ’s the best explanation : cycles .
That and magical moon dust . ”

I just played The Legend of Zelda : Skyward Sword , the 2011 Wii Motion Plus game for 10 minutes , until the E3 demo here in Los Angeles timed out on me .
Just when I was slicing up a giant scorpion boss !
But ...
Then I shot a two - minute video to show you the game in action .
Good stuff .
Sword controls were superb , and closer to 1:1 than I expected ( note the little leans of the sword when I tilt my hand ) .
Bowling bombs feels right .
Advertisement
I 'm a little worried that I had no camera control and I did n't like having the map option made inaccessible whenever I had an item in hand .
Otherwise , pretty good .
The whip is fun to use and overall you are using the angles of your gestures to fight more effectively .
That requires a little more dexterity than I 'm used to in a Zelda game , but not in an annoyingly complex way .
I felt capable and powerful as Link , not confused .
Advertisement
As you can see the graphics are okay , but not overwhelmingly impressive .
This style of quasi - realism does not look great on the aging Wii hardware .
So no complaints on controls , an almost - perfect button layout and a " decent " for graphics .
I enjoyed romping through the game 's demo and had the most fun at a boss .
This game 's probably going to be good .
No surprise , it 's a Zelda .

( Oh , let me tell you about that Scorpion boss :
It had two big claws that had , at the inside of their claw joints , weak points .
The claws would slowly open .
I would lock on with a press of the Nunchuk 's Z button .
And then I would swing the sword at the angle that would swing my sword through the opened claw .
Sometimes that meant I needed to do a horizontal strike , other times a diagonal or vertical .
That 's the kind of light - strategy / dexterity needed for combat in this new Zelda .
It 's just enough to make it feel more physically interesting than a standard Zelda .
I approve . )

A couple of months ago , we discussed a short paper by Matthews and Weaver on the ‘ climate change commitment ’ – how much change are we going to see purely because of previous emissions .
In my write up , I contrasted the results in M&W ( assuming zero CO 2 emissions from now on ) with a constant concentration scenario ( roughly equivalent to an immediate cut of 70 % in CO 2 emissions ) , however , as a few people pointed out in the comments , this exclusive focus on CO 2 is a little artificial .
I have elsewhere been a big advocate of paying attention to the multi-faceted nature of the anthropogenic emissions ( including aerosols and radiatively and chemically active short - lived species ) , both because that gives a more useful assessment of what it is that we are doing that drives climate change , and also because it is vital information for judging the effectiveness of any proposed policy for a suite of public issues ( climate , air pollution , public health etc . ) .
Thus , I should n’t have neglected to include these other factors in discussions of the climate change commitment .
Luckily , some estimates do exist in the literature of what happens if we ceased all human emissions of climatically important factors .
One such estimate is from Hare and Meinshausen ( 2006 ) , whose results are illustrated here :
The curve ( 1 ) is the result for zero emissions of all of the anthropogenic inputs ( in this case , CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O , CFCs , SO 2 , CO , VOCs and NOx ) .
The conclusion is that , in the absence of any human emissions , the expectation would be for quite a sharp warming with elevated temperatures lasting almost until 2050 .
The reason is that the reflective aerosols ( sulphates ) decrease in abundance very quickly and so their cooling effect is removed faster than the warming impact of the well - mixed GHGs disappears .
This calculation is done with a somewhat simplified model , and so it might be a little different with a more state - of - the - art ESM ( for instance , including more aerosol species like black carbon and a more complete interaction between the chemistry and aerosol species ) , but the basic result is likely to be robust .
Angry about not having high - speed Internet service , a group of rural Dane County residents have complained to the state Public Service Commission in a case that could set a precedent for other communities .
Some of those filing the complaint live on the edge of suburban Madison , one of the most Internet - wired cities in the Midwest , and they include attorneys , doctors , university professors and scientists .
In their complaint , filed this week with state regulators , they say a lack of broadband service has hindered their professional lives and lowered property values because some people wo n't buy homes in areas that lack high - speed Internet access .
It 's an issue that irks residents in the Town of Berry and some parts of Black Earth and other rural areas less than 20 miles from the state Capitol .
" This is a rural community , but it does n't mean we are Dogpatch or Hayseed , " said Chris Arenas , who lives in Black Earth and teaches online marketing classes at Madison Area Technical College .
The complaint includes the Town of Berry , a community of about 1,124 residents that has sought broadband service for years .
Some Berry residents may have to move if they can't get high - speed Internet access , according to town officials , because their employers require them to have the service for working from home .
" Parents have told us their children are at a disadvantage by not having high - speed connections , " Town Chairman Anthony Varda wrote in a recent letter to TDS Telecommunications , the town 's Madison - based telephone provider .
" It is critical to the success of rural students , people working from home , and residents serving on nonprofit boards , committees and local government , " wrote Varda , an attorney with DeWitt , Ross & Stevens .
In the complaint , residents say state regulations obligate TDS to provide " reasonably adequate service and facilities , " including high - speed Internet .
Not providing the service " has a profound adverse impact on the quality of life , economic development and individual efficiency and productivity in the Town of Berry , " the 50 - page document notes .
The residents want regulators to order TDS to provide broadband access , which they would pay for .
Currently , their only choices for high - speed Internet are satellite service or a cell - phone connection .
Some residents say they 're paying $ 200 a month for Internet service that charges 50 cents a minute for exceeding a monthly time limit and is not reliable .
" If a new family is going to move here , obviously they need broadband access , " said Arenas , one of the complainants .
TDS has 20 days to respond , according to state regulators .
It could be months before the agency makes a ruling .
TDS says it offers broadband to 94 % of its customers nationwide , including customers who live at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and in rural Dane County .
But it has not made the service available to the complaining residents because they live in a sparsely populated area where it would be too expensive to install the cable for such a small number of customers .
The company has offered them dial - up Internet access , which is much slower than broadband and can't handle heavy downloads of photos and graphics .
" I am tremendously sympathetic … but the unfortunate situation is they live in a very isolated pocket .
It is the most difficult conversation we have with customers , " said TDS spokesman Andrew Petersen .
About 80 % of Wisconsin residents have access to some type of broadband through cable television providers or telephone companies , according to industry figures .
But coverage gaps in rural areas are a problem as businesses and individuals routinely use the Internet .
The federal economic stimulus bill includes $ 7.2 billion in grants , loans and loan guarantees to extend broadband to underserved rural areas .
But locally , telecom providers say they have not had much success getting the money .
TDS was not able to get stimulus money for bringing broadband to the complaining Dane County residents because the Town of Berry was not considered rural enough .
It also was not eligible for help because 98 % of the residents in surrounding areas have access to broadband , according to TDS .
Normally , the Public Service Commission does not dictate where telephone companies must provide broadband .
Should the agency order TDS to provide the service to the complaining residents , it could set a precedent for other rural communities .
Legally , it 's a step the PSC may be hesitant to take , said Barry Orton , a telecommunications professor at University of Wisconsin - Madison .
" But it is an argument that is absolutely important to make .
The PSC can't just dismiss this out of hand , " Orton said .

Why not ?
TDS Telecommunications says the complaining residents live in a sparsely populated area where it would be too expensive to install the cable for such a small number of customers .
The deadline for comments to the Federal Communications Commission on the proposed merger of Comcast and NBC Universal has passed .
There are a slew of Web form statements against the marriage and a large number of short letters in favor .
Many of the latter come from local politicians or groups like The Boys and Girls Club of Cape Cod and Little Angels of Elgin , Illinois , beneficiaries of Comcast or NBC philanthropy .
But you 've got to give credit to the Public Knowledge group for slipping one of their favorite subjects into the debate .
The organization says that it does n't like the merger , but can see it moving forward under various conditions ... like network neutrality .
The Commission must impose strict non-discrimination rules that prevent the [ new ] entity from interfering with the distribution of non-affiliated content through filtering , blocking , or degrading distribution .
The growth of Internet distributed content should not be stifled simply because the newly formed entity would prefer consumers continue paying for its MVPD [ multi- channel video program distribution ] service .
That 's right .
PK says the union can go forward as long as Comcast agrees to the very net neutrality rules it got a Federal appeals court to overturn back in April .
De-prioritizing
The big antitrust question that everyone 's asking is how much of the pay TV market this merger will gobble up — that is , how big of a horizontal deal are we talking about here .
But a huge broadcasting network combining with a cable company represents a vertical merger as well .
And that 's what has PK worried .
" Comcast 's ability to control users ' access to content means that it can unfairly discriminate against non-NBCU content , " PK warns , " either by refusing to connect users to the online video content of established competitors , or , more likely , simply de-prioritizing or throttling the bandwidth available to these competitors versus NBCU content . "
But the group does n't just want " strict non-discrimination rules " attached to the new entity .
The government should also require it to provide wholesale broadband access to unaffiliated Internet Service Providers .
In other words , line - sharing , which cable companies have never been required to offer .
" Allowing unaffiliated ISPs to access the last mile networks of the newly merged entity and compete for Internet customers would impose a valuable check on any anticompetitive impulses , " the filing notes .
Public Knowledge wants the FCC to reverse its famous Cable Modem Order of 2002 , which let the big cable ISPs off the hook with wholesale access to competing ISPs .
That ruling defined cable Internet as an " information " rather than a " telecommunications " service .
The Supreme Court eventually approved the move in its 2005 Brand X decision .
Anyway , what the heck — no harm in asking , right ?
The FCC did impose net neutrality conditions on the AT&T / Bell South merger of late 2006 .
And the agency is now reconsidering that 2002 Cable Modem Order , of course , in its new " Third Way " net neutrality proceeding .
As for the future of this deal , the Congressional Research Service seems to think it will be approved ; before it does , both the FCC and the Department of Justice have to weigh in on the proposal .
Enlarge by Israel Leal , AP A tourist walks past empty cots on the beach in the resort city of Cancun , Mexico Saturday , June 26 , 2010 , as tropical storm Alex begins nearing the region .
The weather was deteriorating in Belize , Mexico , and along the Yucatan Peninsula , the national hurricane center said , noting that it is too soon to say if Alex would hit the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico .
( AP Photo / Israel leal ) MIAMI ( AP )  Forecasters say Alex has weakened to a tropical depression , but the cyclone is expected to regain strength in the coming days as it moves out over warmer waters in the Gulf of Mexico .
The U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami said Sunday that Alex could eventually become a hurricane .
Its current track has it making landfall again later in the week over Mexico , well away from the area in the Gulf of Mexico where BP PLC is trying to stop a massive oil leak .
On Saturday , Alex swept through the Yucatan Peninsula and Belize with torrential downpours .
Alex is centered about 85 miles ( 135 kilometers ) south of Campeche , Mexico , with maximum sustained winds of about 35 mph ( 55 kph ) .
THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE .
Check back soon for further information .
AP 's earlier story is below .
BELIZE CITY ( AP ) -- Tropical Storm Alex headed overland toward the Gulf of Mexico early Sunday , drenching Belize , northern Guatemala and Mexico 's Yucatan Peninsula with torrential rains .
Meteorologists project Alex , which made landfall on Belize 's coast late Saturday , will weaken as it passes over the Yucatan Peninsula but will regain strength once it emerges Sunday afternoon over the Gulf of Mexico , where warm waters could fuel its growth into a hurricane .
According to the most recent predictions ,
Alex is expected to make a second landfall midweek on the Mexican Gulf coast -- far south and west of the region where a deep - sea oil spill is slicking the U.S. coastline .
Hundreds of tourists and residents fled low - lying islands off Belize on Saturday as Alex swept in with torrential downpours .
Winds were at 60 mph ( 95 kph ) when the storm made landfall but had decreased to about 40 mph ( 65 kph ) by Sunday morning .
Many stocked up on gasoline , water , canned food and other emergency supplies .
Belize officials opened storm shelters in the island tourist resort of San Pedro , as some 1,400 people fled for the mainland by plane and by boat .
Along Mexico's resort - studded Caribbean coast , officials warned tourists to stay out of rough surf kicked up by the storm .
But there were no immediate reports of damage to popular beach destinations such as Cancun , Cozumel , Playa del Carmen or Tulum .
State Public Safety director Miguel Ramos Real said 25 fisherman were evacuated and 17 navy personnel were brought to the mainland from a base on Banco Chinchorro , an atoll off the Mexican coast .
Three shelters were opened , and ports were closed to small craft .
Now all eyes turn to the Gulf of Mexico .
When Alex became the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season , officials immediately worried what effect it could have on the millions of gallons of crude spilled in the Gulf -- and on efforts to clean up the slick and cap the leak deep below the waves .
A cap has been placed over the blown - out undersea well and it is carrying some of the oil to a surface ship where it is being collected .
Some of the oil is being brought to the surface and burned .
Other ships are drilling two relief wells , projected to be done by August , and are the best hope to stop the leak .
For the time being , the storm appears likely to miss the oil - slicked region and make landfall in Mexico , somewhere near the border of Tamaulipas and Veracruz states -- but meteorologists warned that a storm 's track can quickly change .
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said early Sunday that Alex was centered about 105 miles ( 170 kilometers ) west of Chetumal , Mexico .
It was speeding to the west - northwest at 12 mph ( 19 kph ) .
Meanwhile in the Pacific , two storms were far offshore late Saturday night and did not pose an immediate threat to land .
Once - powerful Celia weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 kph ) , the hurricane center said .
The storm should fall apart by Sunday .
Darby , which was also a powerful hurricane , has also weakened to a tropical storm .
Its center is about 310 miles ( 500 kilometers ) south - southwest of Zihuatanejo , Mexico .

Today in necessary and justified taserings : an Oklahoma man called 911 and asked for medical attention for his disabled , bedridden 86 year - old grandmother .
Did she somehow end up being tasered ?
I 'm surprised you even have to ask .
Instead of sending EMTs , El Reno , Oklahoma sent ten cops , because , safety first .
Granny told them to get out of her apartment .
Mouthing off to cops ?
That 's a tasering .
" Instead , the apparent leader of the police [ defendant Thomas Duran ] instructed another policeman to ' Taser her ! '
He stated in his report that the 86 year - old plaintiff ' took a more aggressive posture in her bed , ' and that he was fearful for his safety and the safety of others .
" Lonnie Tinsley told them , ' Do n't taze my Granny ! ' to which they responded that they would Taser him .
So of course they tasered granny twice and stepped on her oxygen tube and grabbed her out of bed and cuffed her and then , well , they had to call the ambulance .
But then they threw her in the psych ward for a week , so , game set and match , the police !
If only Lonnie Tinsley had exclaimed " Do n't taze my Granny , bro ! " he could have gotten a great pop culture meme started .
Missed opportunity .
[ You really should read this entire Courthouse News account .
Shout out to Ravi for the tip .
UPDATE : Here 's a version that says granny " pulled a kitchen knife and told officers ' she was in control of her life . ' "
That 's a tasering . ]

TORONTO - A city already on edge ahead of the G20 summit was given another jolt Thursday when police pulled over a suspicious car downtown and discovered a surprising cargo that included a crossbow .
The 53 - year - old driver was immediately arrested , the area sealed off as officers wearing hazardous material " moon suits " checked suspicious liquid in the vehicle .
Toronto police say Whitby resident Gary McCullough has been charged with one count of dangerous weapons .
" We have a crossbow , there 's a chainsaw , baseball bat , sledge hammers , " said Const .
Hugh Smith .
" There 's quite a various amount of items that , used by the wrong person at the wrong time , was enough that we made the arrest . "
Police were keeping a close eye on a noisy but otherwise peaceful labour demonstration outside a hotel when the man drove by at the lunch hour in his modified silver Hyundai Elantra .
The car immediately drew suspicion , and officers pulled it over .
" Some of the weaponry was openly exposed , " Smith said .
Police later said none of the items were illegal to have .
Also found were several jerry cans containing an unknown liquid .
Police cordoned off the area with yellow tape , and part of the scene with red tape as fully equipped hazardous - materials experts in green and red boots and carrying oxygen tanks checked the liquid taken from the vehicle .
They later concluded the liquid was nothing out of the ordinary .
Police said the man was taken to a processing centre and charges would be pending , but said it appeared the incident was not related to the G20 summit that runs this weekend .
" There 's no evidence to indicate or suggest that it 's G20 - related , " said police spokesman Tony Vella .
" The area is rendered safe -- it 's controlled now . "
As officers investigated the latest scare , two blue containers and at least three red gas cans could be seen on the road while the stash of other items were stacked on the sidewalk .
The car , which had a large storage box strapped to the roof and also contained a pickaxe , caught the attention of officers because it did n't appear to be roadworthy , police said .
Much of downtown Toronto is behind police fences and barricades for the G20 summit , and police have been out in force patrolling the city .
The incident occurred a few blocks east of the main security zone .
The arrest came as about 80 workers picketed the Novotel Toronto Centre after walking off the job early Thursday .

Drake is being sued for copyright infringement by Playboy Enterprises over allegations that his breakout smash " Best I Ever Had " samples a ' 70s hit owned by the company .
In a lawsuit filed June 24 , Playboy alleges that Drake 's mixtape hit contains Hamilton , Joe Frank & Reynolds ' 1975 soft - rock tune , " Fallin ' in Love . "
The suit names Drake -- whose real name is Aubrey Drake Graham -- as well as Cash Money Records and Universal Music Group .
Playboy lawyer Neville Johnson provided a copy of the lawsuit but declined to comment .
Drake 's record label did not immediately respond to request for comment .
The lawsuit , which includes allegations that have not been proven in court , asks that each defendant account for how much the song has earned in order to seek damages .
Drake 's debut album , " Thank Me Later , " topped the charts in the U.S. and Canada in its first week of release .
" Best I Ever Had , " which is n't included on the album but was featured on last year 's " So Far Gone " EP , is still the biggest hit the 23 - year - old Toronto has had .
The swooning love song went to No. 2 on the U.S. charts last summer .
The suit asserts that Playboy " has suffered , and will continue to suffer irreparable injury " from the alleged infringement .
The lawsuit demands that " all infringing works be recalled and destroyed . "
As part of its claim , Playboy also alleges that " each defendant either knew , or should have reasonably known , that the sound recording was protected by copyright . "

CALIFORNIA'S lame - duck governor , Arnold Schwarzenegger , has just scored a big victory .
On June 16th he struck a tentative agreement with four public - sector unions , representing 23,000 of the state 's 170,000 unionised state workers , over future pension benefits .
If confirmed , the deal would require newly hired public employees such as firefighters and traffic police to contribute more of their own salaries , and retire later , to collect their pensions .
The savings would be small .
But there is a chance that California 's other unions will follow with similar deals .
If they do , the effect would be historic .
This is because it would begin the undoing of a policy disaster dating back to 1999 .
That was when the Democratic legislature and the then governor , Gray Davis , a Democrat elected with union support , thanked the unions by giving state workers pension increases of between 20 % and 50 % .
Many highway - patrol officers , for example , were allowed to retire at 50 with 90 % of their final salary .
All told , California now has probably the most generous public - sector benefits in the country .
That , however , is not what outrages Mr Schwarzenegger , a Republican , or his brainy economic adviser David Crane , a Democrat .
Rather , it is that the pension plans — above all the California Public Employees ' Retirement System ( CalPERS ) , the largest such scheme in America — pretended that this generosity would not cost anything .
In 1999 the dotcom bubble was still inflating , and the plans ' actuaries predicted that their retirement funds would gain enough value to pay the increased pensions .
By implication , they assumed that the Dow Jones Industrial Average would reach 25,000 in 2009 and 28 m in 2099 .
It is currently at around 10,300 .
A few years ago Mr Crane tried , as a board member of the teachers ' pension plan ( CalSTERS ) , to make the assumptions more sane .
His fellow Democrats voted him off the board .
But since then the stockmarket has fallen sharply and California has tipped into budget crisis , exacerbated by the additional contributions that taxpayers are obliged to make to top up the public - sector pension funds .
On the same day that Mr Schwarzenegger struck his deal with the unions , for instance , CalPERS ordered the state to increase its annual pension payment to almost $ 4 billion .
Two studies estimate California 's unfunded pension liability at about half a trillion dollars , almost seven times its official debt .
Even some Democrats are starting to complain .
Bill Lockyer , the state treasurer , is one .
He warned the legislature that public - sector pensions will bankrupt the state and pointedly wondered whether the Democrats before him could fix the problem “ because of who elected you ” .
Voters are getting angry .
Many find it ironic that those Democrats who are wailing loudest over cuts to schools , universities and health care include people who voted for the pensions that are now crowding out those very programmes .
Most private - sector employees have defined - contribution plans , which determine how much employers and employees pay in but not how much pensioners will get out , and which have shrivelled with the stockmarket since 2008 .
They do not understand why they should now pay to maintain the more generous defined - benefit pensions of public - sector employees .
To Adam Summers of the Reason Foundation , a think - tank in Los Angeles , the solution is clear .
Public - sector pensions for new employees must become defined - contribution plans , as in the private sector .
That may be asking more than is politically feasible .
Mr Schwarzenegger is hoping merely to roll back public pensions to the formulas in use before 1999 .
Many union members are promising a fight .
Worse , it is an election year .
Neither the Democrat nor the Republican running to succeed the governor has dared offer specifics about California 's budget or pensions mess .
And the unions are preparing to spend oodles of money on the race .
Evo Morales says he wants to put wealth in the hands of Bolivians
Bolivian President Evo Morales has ordered the nationalisation of four private electricity companies .
Police moved into the offices of Corani , Valle Hermoso and Guaracachi firms , following Mr Morales ' decree .
Corani is half owned by a subsidiary of France 's GDF Suez .
Guaracachi's main partner is Britain 's Rurelec , while ELFEC and Valle Hermoso are local .
President Morales said that the government now controlled 80 % of electricity generation in the country .
Last year , Mr Morales announced the takeover of a subsidiary of British oil company BP , which supplied jet fuel across the Andean nation .
He has recently nationalised oil and gas reserves to redistribute wealth to Bolivia 's indigenous majority .
The four companies seized on Saturday account for more than half of Bolivia 's electricity market .
They emerged following the privatisation of the state National Electricity Company in the 1990s .
President Morales nationalised the gas and oil industry in 2006 and the national telephone company in 2008 .
Both those announcements also came on May Day , says the BBC's Andres Schipani in Bolivia .
Since then he has taken control of several utility and commodities companies .
It was early afternoon when the mob surged down an alley of neat rose bushes and halted outside Zarifa 's house .
The Kyrgyz men broke into her courtyard and sat Zarifa down next to a cherry tree .
They asked her a couple of questions .
After confirming she was an ethnic Uzbek , they stripped her , raped her and cut off her fingers .
After that they killed her and her small son , throwing their bodies into the street .
They then moved on to the next house .
" They were like beasts , " Zarifa 's neighbour , Bakhtir Irgayshon , said today , pointing to the gutted bedframe where she had been assaulted .
A few pots and pans remained ; the rest of the family home was a charred ruin .
Zarifa 's husband , Ilham , was missing , Irgayshon said , probably dead .
Only his mother , Adina , survived the Kyrgyz - instigated conflagration that engulfed the neighbourhood of Cheremushki last Friday .
The scale of the ethnic killing that took place in Osh – as well as in other towns and villages in southern Kyrgyzstan – was grimly obvious .
In the next street were the remains of another victim .
He burned to death in his bed .
Not much was left , only a jigsaw - like spine and hip .
Nearby , Uzbek survivors were retrieving the bodies of seven small children .
They had been incinerated , together with their mother , while cowering in a dark cellar .
Witnesses said the attacks by the Kyrgyz population on the Uzbek minority were attempted genocide .
The violence erupted in Osh last Thursday evening , possibly ignited by a row in a casino .
But much of it appeared co-ordinated and planned , Uzbeks said .
The attacks took the prosperous outlying Uzbek areas of town unawares .
" It started on Friday lunchtime , " said Rustam , an Uzbek lawyer .
" It came in three distinct waves .
The Kyrgyz entered Cheremushki district driving an armoured personnel carrier .
This paved the way .
Several of them were wearing army uniforms .
At first we felt relieved .
Someone had come to rescue us , we thought !
Then the BKR opened fire and started shooting people randomly .
" Behind them was the second wave .
This was a mob of about 300 Kyrgyz youths armed with automatic weapons .
Most were very young – between 15 and 20 years old .
The third wave was made up of looters and included women and young boys .
They stole everything of value , piling it into cars .
Then they set our houses on fire . "
According to Rustam the official toll from the riots – 178 dead and 1,800 injured – is a woeful underestimate .
In reality , around 2,000 Uzbeks were slaughtered , he said , as the pogroms quickly spread from Osh to Jalal - Abad , 25 miles away , and other Uzbek villages in the south .
Rustam said : " I carried 27 bodies myself .
They were just bones .
We are talking here about genocide . "
With the violence largely now spent , and only the occasional gunshot disturbing Osh 's evening curfew , survivors debated who was to blame .
Some suggested Kyrgyzstan 's ousted president , Kurmanbek Bakiyev , was behind them – describing the violence as a premeditated attempt by him to take revenge on the new leadership .
Bakiyev fled the country in April after bloody protests in the capital , Bishkek .
His supporters remain in control in much of the south .
They dominate Osh 's monoethnic Kyrgyz police and power structures , and also control the local mayor 's office .
Few believe the riots could have taken place without the local administration 's connivance .
But it is clear that other grievances are at play .
Ethnic Uzbeks make up 15 % of Kyrgyzstan 's 5.6 million population , and dominate the towns of Osh and Jalal - Abad .
These settlements near the Fergana valley ended up in Kyrgyzstan by accident – when Lenin dumped them there in 1924 .
" We 're hardworking people .
We were never nomadic like the Kyrgyz .
We never lived in yurts .
For the past 2,000 years we 've built stone houses , " Rustam said .
He acknowledged that the town 's Uzbeks were usually better off than their Kyrgyz neighbours .
" Since the Silk Road , we 've been involved in commerce and trade .
We are successful .
The Kyrgyz are jealous and resent this . "
In the centre of Osh , Uzbek enterprises were in ruins .
Shops marked with " KG " for Kyrgyz had been spared .
Oktam Ismailova managed to save her home from the flames by sloshing water on her roof .
A brick thrown through the window hit her father on the head .
He survived .
" We can't believe what happened .
We are in shock , " she said .
When the trouble started , thousands of Uzbeks fled to the Uzbekistan border , just three miles from Osh .
Not everyone made it : one witness described how two Uzbek youths drove into a Kyrgyz mob in the centre of town .
" They pulled the two Uzbek boys out of the car , and killed them in less than five minutes using sticks and knives .
Then they dumped them in the Ak - Bura river , " said Maya Tashbolotova , who watched , peering over the fence of her guesthouse .
So far , tens of thousands of refugees have crossed into Uzbekistan .
According to Unicef , 90 % of them are women , children and the elderly .
Today , Uzbek guards sealed the border , a 5ft barbed wire fence .
Nearby , Uzbek refugee children were washing in a stream while an old lady beaten in the face was being treated .
The mood was one of anger , disbelief and betrayal .
Many of the girls arriving at the border had been raped , witnesses said .
" Why did I train to be a surgeon ?
Was it for this ? " said a 35 - year - old Uzbek doctor , who declined to be named , crying quietly in the corner of his temporary surgery .
The doctor said that many victims had been shot in the face and head .
A nurse showed footage on a mobile phone of an Uzbek man who had been doused in kerosene and set alight .
His head and arms were blackened stumps .
He had no eyes .
But he lived for several days , dying two days ago in agony .
" We have been discriminated against for 20 years , " the doctor said , referring to the ethnic riots that took place near Osh in 1990 , just after the breakup of the Soviet Union .
Recently , he said , Kyrgyz chauvinism had grown , fuelled by the weakness of the government , and by a fear that the Uzbek minority was becoming too strong and was prone to secessionist - minded leaders .
There was not much sign of humanitarian relief today , with Kyrgyz drivers too scared to enter Uzbek neighbourhoods .
Uzbeks had demarcated their territory by felling maple trees and building makeshift barricades with burned - out cars .
Nearby , Kyrgyz soldiers had set up checkpoints in a post - facto show of strength .
Some Kyrgyz locals blamed the riots on Uzbek youths , who they said ransacked a local casino .
Back in Cheremushki , Rustam said the events of the last week heralded a return to barbarism in an age seemingly governed by international rules and institutions .
Asked who was to blame , he said : " It was the state against us .
It was the whole system .
It was everything . "
Dave Navarro wrote recently that worrying about what you ’re doing ( or not doing ) is the surest way to keep you poor and unsuccessful .
It ’s a cracking article with a heap of good points , one of them being that the key difference in the way successful people operate is that they see failure as an integral part of the process of achieving success .
That ’s true .
Unless you plan on spending all your time underneath your duvet , failure is in your destiny .
Trying to minimize or avoid failure will not help you be successful .
But here ’s the thing .
Trying to be successful will not help you actually become successful , either .
The problem with success
You ’re probably here because you want to be a successful person .
You want the material and emotional benefits that come with that .
That ’s awesome and I want it to happen for you .
But while there ’s nothing wrong with success , there are five important reasons why success for its own sake is the wrong focus :
1. Success is a moving target
Be honest , what ’s success for you ?
Is it about launching a product and having people buy it ?
Is it about having respect from your peers and mentors ?
Is it about doing what you love so you can care for your family ?
Too many people do n’t create their own definition of success .
They chase an idea they ’ve patched together from what they ’ve read , observed , or think they should be aiming for .
Do you know the feeling of not being wholly convinced that you ’re pursuing the right success for you , but you ’ve carried on regardless ?
That ’s not how real success is achieved .
Because even if you ’re outwardly successful , you ’ll feel disconnected from it .
Achieving the wrong kind of success will always feel hollow .
2. Success is the wrong motivator
It ’s too often based on extrinsic factors — the things you believe success can deliver .
Whether it ’s physical goods , the feeling that you ’ve “ made it , ” or thinking you ’ll be free of worry and stress , these are all externalized projections about what a successful lifestyle will bring you .
When you make decisions based on an external motivator , it ’s much easier to second - guess yourself .
Motivation that comes from within is much more grounded and more powerful .
3 . Success is n’t here , now
If you ’re working hard to make something happen , it ’s easy to dream about the moment you become successful .
We all tend to fantastize about that big pay - off for all our hard work .
That kind of success is always elusively around the next bend .
Just a few more weeks or months away .
Just a bit more work , and you ’ll finally be successful .
But what about now ?
What ’s stopping you from feeling like a success right now , this very moment ?
Waiting for success in the future takes you out of the game in the present .
4 . Success does not eliminate worry or fear
Being successful does not change how your brain works .
Success often increases worry and fear , as you question how you can repeat it or worry about losing it .
What eliminates worry and fear is shifting the patterns of thinking that result in self - doubt and second - guessing .
5 . Success is limited by confidence
Perhaps most important , any success you might experience is limited by your self - confidence .
If success is achieved by taking repeated , meaningful action , then what happens if you ’re not confident enough to take the actions that scare the crap out of you ?
What will you do when things go wrong ?
Without confidence , you ’ll be more inclined to retreat , beat yourself up , and reinforce a negative self - image .
Nasty .
Placing your efforts on being a “ successful person ” is putting energy into the wrong place .
It ’s allowing in the complications I ’ve listed above ( and there are more that I have n’t listed ) and ignoring how you ’re thinking about what you ’re doing and how you ’re doing it right now .
Instead , what I ’m suggesting is that you place your focus squarely on becoming a confident person , rather than a successful one .
To borrow from Dave ’s article :
Success is not a person .
It ’s an event .
Shift your thinking from being a successful person to a confident one , and you ’ll experience more success events and more failure events , both of which have abundant rewards .
Here ’s how to do it , right now .
Engage , today
I ’m always banging on about playing a game that matters , for the simple reason that it forces you to deeply engage with something that has personal meaning .
It aligns your efforts with what matters to you and ensures that you ’re intrinsically motivated to play to the best of your ability .
If you want to be the best tennis player you can be , it will only really happen if you get enjoyment from the act of playing tennis .
Start off with the aim of winning a shiny cup and you ’re setting yourself up for struggle and second - guessing .
Forget the rules , just play
Rolling around in your head are expectations about what you can and ca n’t do , should and should n’t do , must and must n’t do .
Then you add in all the expectations you have about other people .
And most brain - numbing of all , you have expectations about what other people expect of you .
Forget all of that and just play .
The best tennis players are n’t darting around the court thinking about how they should play the game .
They use natural ability and learned skills and strategies to play to their best level .
Take confident action
Confident action is about making deliberate choices .
Confident action is using your values , strengths , and talents to support your decisions and the actions that follow .
Confident action is trusting yourself to make the next decision , no matter how this one turns out .
Listen to the voices
Those voices in your head can be confusing , but you need to listen to them ( unless they ’re telling you to set fire to the town hall ) , because that ’s the only way to recognize what ’s real and what ’s imagined .
You do n’t want to let those voices control your thinking , or you ’ll be running in circles forever .
But you do want to start paying attention to them , noticing the difference between the voice of fear and one of your best assets , your intuiton .
It ’s by acknowledging what goes on in your head that you learn about what serves you well and what holds you back .
You learn the voice of imagined fear , you learn the voice of solid doubt ( and can take appropriate action in response to those risks ) , and you learn the still , quiet voice of intuition that will always tell you what you need to know .
Decide what ’s important
Do n’t shoot the messenger , but things will go wrong and you will screw up .
The good news is that you always get to choose how you think about what goes wrong .
A screw - up is only a big deal if you decide it is .
By looking at it in a different way , there ’s no need to retreat or beat yourself up .
Plus , simply because you ’re intrinsically motivated by playing a game that matters , the idea of “ failure ” has far less power than if you ’re extrinsically motivated , and sometimes the power of “ failure ” disappears completely .
You get to decide what ’s important .
The real difference that makes success happen
Do n’t think in terms of successful people or unsuccessul people .
We all experience success and failure throughout our lives — remember , success and failure are not people , they ’re events .
People experience success because they ’ve achieved a level of natural self - confidence that allows them to take meaningful action .
They ’ve achieved a level of natural self - confidence that allows them to trust their behavior , rather than focusing on the outcome of that behavior .
I want to know what you think .
How do you see confidence and success ?
Let us know in the comments .
With indications that Japan will resume their annual whale hunt , environment minister for Australia , Greg Hunt has appealed to Abe to reconsider his decision and respect international rulings on the issue .
In March this year the International Court of Justice had ordered Japan to withdraw hunting activities from the Arctic after the court found that the hunt was not for scientific purposes as argued by Japan .
While it remains unclear what Mr Abe ’s eventual decision will be in terms of resuming the whale hunt there have been indications that it is being considered after a recent comment to a parliamentary committee that he would in fact be pushing for the return to commercial whaling .
Although Japan is one of the signatories of the 1986 moratorium on whale hunting they have regardless continued whale hunting under the premise that it is for scientific purposes .
Australia condemns any form of whale hunting and brought their case against Japan to the International Court of Justice .
The judgment was delivered on 31 March 2014 during a public sitting at the Peace Palace , The Hague , where president of International Court Judge Tomka , read the court ’s judgment .
The ruling stated : “ The court found that the grant of permits under JARPA II , the Japanese whaling program in the Southern Ocean , could not be justified as being for the purposes of scientific research under Article VIII . ”
It followed that Japan had not conformed with various obligations under the ICRW prohibiting commercial whaling , namely the moratorium on commercial whaling , the factory ship moratorium and the Southern Ocean Sanctuary .
“ The court ordered Japan to revoke any extant authorisation , permit or licence granted in relation to JARPA II , and refrain from granting any further permits under that program . ”
At least seven members of Congress reported holding a minimum of $ 15,000 in BP stock at the end of 2009 , according to a preliminary analysis of personal financial disclosure reports by the Center for Responsive Politics
The Clerk of the House and Secretary of the Senate on Wednesday released reports covering the personal financial activities of members of Congress and their families for 2009 .
The Center ’s preliminary investigation focused on the reports of the 20 members of Congress who reported earning income from BP holdings or owning BP stock in 2008 .
Furthermore , at least one member of Congress bought five - figures worth of BP stock in 2009 , the Center ’s preliminary analysis found : Rep. Vernon Buchanan ( R - Fla . ) .
In addition to becoming politically toxic , BP stock has seen its value drop by half since April 20 , when an oil rig it operated exploded in the Gulf of Mexico .
The disaster has since caused millions of gallons of fossil fuels to leak into the surrounding waters .
At least one congressmen who owned BP stock in 2009 said he has since sold it off .
OpenSecrets Blog .
“ Senator Gregg no longer owns any BP stock , ” spokeswoman Laena Fallon told
Fallon did not elaborate on when or why he sold the stock .
Sensenbrenner , an heir of Kimberly - Clark , reported at least $ 100,000 in BP stock .
( Disclosure rules only require lawmakers to reveal the value of their assets and liabilities in broad ranges , not exact amounts . )
In 2008 , he had a net worth of about $ 13 million , ranking him 30th in the House .
Spokeswoman Wendy Riemann said the congressman inherited stock in Amoco in 1978 , before the company was bought by BP .
He has no plans to sell it , Riemann said .
Kerry ’s wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry , held a minimum of $ 350,000 in BP stock at the end of 2009 , according to Kerry ’s newly released financial report .
He , himself , owns only between $ 1,001 and $ 15,000 in BP .
Kerry spokeswoman Whitney Smith said the senator has no plans to sell off his small holding in BP stock , which he inherited in a family trust .
“ Senator Kerry has been the Senate ’s best environmental champion for more than 25 years and has written and urged legislation to end our dependence on foreign oil , ” Smith said .
Smith added Kerry ’s stockholdings in BP would not impact his vote on pending legislation .
“ Inherited holdings in family trusts he has no control over whatsoever clearly have no impact on his fight for a green economy and a clean environment , ” she said .
“ Indeed , by that standard , he ’s cast scores of votes against his own economic interests , and these industries have spent millions against him in political and legislative campaigns . ”
The offices of Reps. Buchanan and Upton and Sens. Kaufman and Brownback did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday .
Rep. Frelinghuysen ’s investment in BP was discovered after business hours Wednesday , and his office could not be reached for comment .

Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) has vigorously supported Israel ’s boarding an aid ship bound for the blockaded Gaza .
Pro-Israel Dems defend raid
While the Obama administration takes a wait - and - see approach to the newest crisis in the Middle East , some Democrats in Congress stand firmly behind Israel ’s raid of a Turkish flotilla en route to Gaza .
New York Democratic Reps. Anthony Weiner , Jerrold Nadler , Gary Ackerman , Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Ron Klein ( D - Fla . ) have all vigorously supported Israel ’s boarding an aid ship bound for the blockaded Gaza — an act that resulted in ten deaths and a U.N. condemnation .

The comments expose a bit of daylight between the White House and some staunch defenders of Israel in Congress .
Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary , said the administration is “ greatly supportive of [ Israel ’s ] security .
That ’s not going to change . ”
And in a statement , the White House said it had “ regret ” for the deaths but supported an investigation to uncover the facts .
Pro-Israel Democrats are n’t being so nuanced .
“ I think that members of the United States Congress understand why the blockade was in place against Hamas and support it , once you start at that place , a boat that bows into the teeth of that blockade is n’t going to be viewed sympathetically , ” Weiner said .
“ To the extent that any time that there is a flare - up of tensions , it ’s bad for U.S. and Israeli efforts of peace .
We obviously had a bad weekend . ”
Ackerman , who chairs the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on the Middle East , said he “ strongly support (s )
Israel ’s right to defend itself , and the right of Israel ’s naval commandos , who were executing a legal mission , to defend themselves by using force when they were brutally attacked . ”
He called Hamas the “ true villain in this drama . ”
“ Failure to recognize the moral responsibility of Hamas for these events is possible only by confusing cause with effect , or by holding Israel to an unacceptable double standard , ” Ackerman said .
Klein , whose district includes the heavily Jewish Boca Raton , said “ Israel has the right — indeed , the obligation — to defend itself . ”
“ As Israel continues to be unjustly challenged on the international stage , the United States must continue its efforts to stand up for Israel ’s self - defense , ” Klein said .
The international community , Nadler said , is trying to “ embarrass Israel ” and the “ U.S. must stand up for the right of Israel to defend herself against terrorism — which is what Israel did when she blocked the attempt by the Flotilla to forcefully breach the blockade that is preventing weapons and military materials from reaching Hamas . ”
The U.N. is also quickly emerging as a punching bag for some of Israel ’s strongest allies in Washington .
House Minority Leader Eric Cantor ( R - Va. ) , Gillibrand and Weiner have all chided the organization ’s work since the weekend raid .
The U.N. has been swift in responding to the incident , condemning “ acts that resulted in ” deaths aboard boats said to be bringing aid to the Gaza Strip .
The body , however , pointedly did not directly condemn Israel .
“ The United Nations is a giant anti-Israel echo chamber on the east side of Manhattan , and its members sit and wait for opportunities to criticize Israel , ” Weiner told POLITICO in a phone interview Tuesday .
Cantor , the only Jewish Republican in Congress , urged “ the president and his administration to continue to gather all the facts , and if necessary , to veto any biased U.N. resolutions reigning in Israel ’s right to defend itself . ”
“ Before predictably rushing to level hyperbolic accusations at Israel , it ’s important for the United Nations to consider all the facts surrounding this incident , ” Cantor said in a statement .
While some of her membership rushes to defend Israel , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) is staying cautious with her words .
“ I regret the loss of life and look forward to learning the facts from a credible and transparent investigation , ” she said in a statement .
“ This event underscores the urgent need for negotiations designed to achieve an enduring and comprehensive regional peace . ”

After a minute Patrick came back with a small dusty cardboard box .
Dave and I stared as Patrick opened it and pulled out a network switch , the old kind from the days when they were made with metal cases .
He plugged in the power supply and carefully straightened out a CAT - 5 cable to hook the switch up to our network .
I wanted to yell at him for being so careful and deliberate at a time like this .
Dave sat next to me and was uncharacteristically still .
I stopped breathing as Patrick struggled to get the plug lined up with the port .
I stared at the front panel lights , and felt Dave doing the same .
My eyes watered .
Patrick pushed the plug in .
The front lights immediately lit and flashed actively .
I felt my hands and face flush , and out of the corner of my eye saw Dave sit up and open his mouth as if to speak .
He then put his face down into his cupped hands , and threw up .
This is not how we would have reacted three weeks earlier .
Three weeks earlier we had settled down into that difficult part of a project after the honeymoon ends and you have to implement the tedious parts of the product , the parts that were just simple boxes in the design , and seemed straightforward , but turned out to be tricky for reasons that are incidental , and therefore uninteresting .
Patrick and Dave had done the design , of course , and had humored me as I had suggested various ideas which in retrospect must have been obvious to them .
It had been fascinating to hear them debate design issues .
So many of their arguments were based on intuition rather than reasoned logic .
I had learned more each week than my entire last semester of school .
I found myself siding more with Dave .
Dave Mitchell had a great laugh .
He was on the heavy side and knocked things over a lot .
I liked the insights he had about management and the process of software development , and he liked to teach me things .
Patrick and Dave had split up the work they had designed , and they had given me tests to write in advance of their code being ready .
It had been a quiet day when I heard Dave whisper , “ What the hell ? ” and put his hands into his hair .
I sensed an opportunity to learn and walked over to his desk .
He did n’t notice .
He was quickly switching back to his editor , adding a line of debug output , compiling , running , shaking his head , and switching back to add another line elsewhere .
“ What ’s the matter ? ”
He waited until the program finished running to answer .
“ I ca n’t figure out this bug .
I ca n’t figure out where this number is coming from here . ”
He pointed to a line in this debug output .
Dave and Patrick liked to debug by writing lines to the console , rather than stepping through with a debugger , as I liked to do .
“ What happens when you step through it in the debugger ? ”
This was a tease .
Dave did n’t know how to use a debugger , short of displaying the stack trace of a core file .
Dave paused , then brought up the debugger on his program .
I smiled in surprise , then walked him through how to set breakpoints .
We spent the next few hours narrowing down where , in the mess of his code , Boost , and the system libraries , this value was coming from .
“ Patrick , can you help us here ? ”
This surprised me more than the debugger .
Dave rarely asked Patrick for help .
Patrick came over and Dave explained the situation .
“ The program is crashing , and that ’s because of this bad dereference here , but the value is correct here . ”
Dave pointed at some code while Patrick ’s eyes scanned the screen .
Then a thought occurred to me .
Dave was still explaining and I did n’t want to interrupt .
My heart was jumping as I waited for Dave to take a breath .
“ I think it ’s a compiler bug , ” I said with confidence , squinting my eyes at the code .
Patrick and Dave raced each other to brush this off .
“ Blaming the compiler is a last resort , ” said Patrick .
“ Same with the standard library .
Chances are vastly greater that your brand - new code has a bug , rather than code being used by thousands of people . ”
I nodded wisely , but I felt my cheeks blush .
Patrick Karlsson often made me feel bad .
He never meant to , I ’m sure , but he had a way of arguing in a brutally straightforward way that made me feel thoughtless and young .
He was taller than Dave and I , and thin .
He was quiet , except when correcting something I had said or code I had written , but I liked him anyway .
I sometimes found his design decisions questionable and naive .
Dave and I liked to gang up on him .
Patrick was cracking his knuckles .
He asked questions about threads and volatile and aliasing , questions I did n’t entirely understand but wish I ’d thought of .
Dave considered each and said that none of Patrick ’s concerns applied in this case .
Patrick pursed his lips to the right , the way he did when he was n’t sure the answers he ’d been given were correct , and said , “ Hmmm , I do n’t know .
Weird , ” and returned to his desk .
I was relieved that Patrick had n’t crushed us with an obvious solution , and I guessed that Dave felt the same as he sat back up from his slouch and started typing .
“ Is there any way to show the assembly right here where things go pear - shaped ? ”
I showed him how to do this , and I wondered if he was giving my theory a chance .
He typed the command and the lines of C were split apart by dozens of lines of assembly .
“ That ’s not right , ” Dave said , “ We got the command wrong . ”
“ I ’m sure that ’s right , ” I said .
I knew the debugger well , and by “ we ” he meant me .
“ No it ’s not , that far too much assembly for this line of code .
And some of these are n’t even legal assembly instructions . ”
“ That ’s not possible , ” said Patrick from his desk .
Dave blinked slowly .
“ Well , I meant that I ’ve never seen these , they ’re not what a compiler outputs , this is n’t the right place . ”
He was flustered , and I felt more inexperienced than ever .
Dave got up and said , “ I ’m burned out , we ’ll look at this again tomorrow . ”
He left and I sat down at his computer .
The only thing I had contributed all day was knowledge about the debugger , and Dave did n’t even think I had gotten that right .
I looked at the assembly on the screen .
Some of the instructions were obvious and some were cryptic .
I found an online assembly reference and started tracing the instructions , keeping notes about register contents in my notebook .
Dave was right , these instructions made no sense .
Not only did they perform too much work for the corresponding C code , but they did n’t even make sense internally .
But I convinced myself that this was at least the right section , because a few of the instructions matched the surrounding C lines .
I focused on one instruction in particular .
It was subtracting a register from itself .
That ’s not necessarily odd in itself : it might be an efficient way to set a register to zero .
But this register was then used in other math instructions .
The compiler must have known it ’d be zero and optimized it out .
I hesitated , then called Patrick over .
I explained what I had found .
He stared at it for a good while , then said , “ That ’s not a normal subtraction instruction . ”
He was right .
I looked it up more carefully , and found that it was a variation that also subtracted out the carry bit .
This was a way to get the carry bit into a register .
I worked my way backwards to see where the carry was set .
The code got increasingly convoluted , and I repeatedly made incorrect assumptions that threw me off - course .
I turned around to ask Patrick a question and found an empty desk .
It was nearly midnight .
I set the office alarm and rode my bike home .
I got in late the next morning .
I had n’t slept well , and it had taken me hours to fall sleep .
Each time I closed my eyes I saw fast - moving assembly instructions in large bright letters .
I walked straight to Dave ’s desk to discuss the previous night ’s investigations , but he was n’t interested .
“ You were right , ” he said , “ It was a compiler bug .
I tweaked the C code and I ’m no longer triggering it .
That weird assembly is gone . ”
I was in the awkward position of having to contradict the compliment .
“ I do n’t know if it ’s a bug .
The code I saw would n’t have been generated by a bug . ”
“ It was definitely a compiler bug . ” I had worked with Dave enough to know that the more confidently he spoke , the less secure he was .
But he was tired of being held up by the problem , and I dropped it .
Dave walked up to my desk with a grin and a cup from Peet ’s Coffee .
I thought all coffees tasted fine , but he was picky , so I pretended to be picky so that I could spend time with him walking to Peet ’s .
I felt a bit stung that he ’d gone without me this time .
“ You remember that compiler bug from Tuesday ? ” He grinned some more .
His teeth were yellow from the espresso .
“ Yep . ”
“ It happened again this morning .
Same file , same problem .
The weird assembly is back .
The strange thing is that I did n’t change the C file . ”
He was surprisingly mellow about it .
“ Maybe you changed a header file ? ” I ’m brilliant .
“ Oh maybe . ” He frowned .
“ Actually , no .
Let me check SVN . ”
He came back two minutes later .
No relevant files had changed .
Patrick walked over .
“ This is no good .
Here it ’s a crash , but it could be something more subtle .
In four months our system will be so complex that a subtle problem will take weeks to track down .
Can you look at the compiler ’s release notes and see if we can upgrade ? ”
I looked briefly and found what I had expected .
We were on the latest and most stable version of the recommended major release .
It did n’t get more stable than that .
I went further and searched for some permutation of “ weird assembly ” and “ compiler bug ” and found nothing .
I compiled Dave ’s code on my computer and disassembled it .
The strange code was there , at the same place it had been Tuesday .
I recognized the subtract - with - carry instruction and a few others that seemed unusual .
I also looked through the rest of the code .
It was striking how the unusual instructions did n’t appear anywhere else .
The rest of the generated code used instructions you would expect .
After all , when do you ever need to subtract and use the existing value of the carry bit ?
I downloaded the source code of the compiler .
I had never been so overwhelmed .
It was a tangled mess of compiler passes , plug - in frameworks , embedded languages to describe CPU architectures , and abstraction layers .
I went straight to the files that described the translation from the abstract syntax tree to the machine ’s assembly .
I grepped for the subtract - with - carry .
It was n’t there .
I looked for a few other odd ones .
Some were there , most were n’t .
At lunch I mentioned my findings .
The small office we used had a patio , which , it being Mountain View , was nearly always usable .
Friday was Togo ’s day .
I preferred Subway , but Dave hated the bread .
“ That ’s super weird , ” said Patrick , frowning at the table .
He said “ super ” a lot .
I think it ’s a California thing .
“ Which other ones were n’t in the translation file ? ”
“ I do n’t remember , ” I said .
“ A few more that involved the carry bit .
Some vector instructions . ”
Patrick looked up .
“ That compiler does n’t do vectorization . ”
“ That ’s what I just said . ”
“ Either the instruction was generated by mistake or you ’re disassembling non-code . ”
He was still frowning .
Dave cut in .
“ It ’s definitely code .
This is what ’s causing our bug .
It ’s being executed . ”
“ And it ’s not generated by mistake , ” I added .
“ It ’s a math instruction , but I do n’t think it ’s being used for math .
It ’s not nonsense . ”
“ Neat . ” We had finally hooked Patrick .
After lunch he and I sat down at my desk and walked through the part of the code I knew best .
I showed him how although the instructions were obscure and strangely used , they did make sense , all together .
There was a deliberate flow of data .
“ Let ’s look for a backward jump instruction , ” he said .
“ Why ? ”
“ The target of such a jump may be the top of a loop .
It ’s a good place to start the analysis . ”
“ You ’re actually going to figure out what this code is doing ? ”
“ Oh yeah . ”
He smiled and his eyes lit up .
It took us the rest of the afternoon to pick through the convoluted jump targets and decode four consecutive instructions .
That snippet , it turns out , was finding the sign of an integer .
Anyone else would have done a simple comparison and a jump to set the output register to - 1 , 0 , or 1 , but the four instructions were a mess of instructions that all either set the carry bit as a side - effect , or used it in an unorthodox way .
“ You know , ” said Patrick , “ this is n’t even the interesting part .
I want to know how this code gets in here .
You said these instructions were n’t in the translation file ? ”
“ That ’s right . ”
“ They must be elsewhere .
Let ’s grep the source for both the symbolic version and the op - code . ”
I did a recursive grep and it came up empty .
I did n’t know what to try next .
“ Try the binary , ” said Patrick .
“ What binary ? ”
“ The binary of the compiler . ”
I grepped for the name of the assembly instruction and found nothing , but looking for the op - code turned up hundreds of hits .
“ Interesting , ” I said , “ they ’re not generating individual instructions , they ’re dumping chunks of pre-built code . ”
“ Why ? ”
“ I do n’t know why . ”
“ I mean , why do you say that ? ”
“ Because these op - codes are all together .
It ’s not a look - up table . ”
“ Maybe it ’s code , ” he said after a second .
I disassembled the whole compiler and looked for a few of the suspicious instructions , and found large sections that looked like the obscure code we had been tracing all afternoon .
“ The compiler is infected ! ” I said .
“ No wonder we could n’t find it in its source code . ”
“ Okay , let ’s start by recompiling the compiler , ” said Patrick .
“ I ’ll poke around the Web to see if anyone ’s seen this before .
When you ’re done with the compiler , recompile all our own code and see if Dave ’s bug is gone . ”
The compiler took two hours to recompile , not including the time I spent learning the convoluted build process .
Meanwhile , Patrick found nothing online .
I rebuilt our source tree and ran the tests .
They failed , in the same place .
“ Maybe the bug was due to something else after all ? ” I suggested when Patrick walked over .
“ Disassemble the compiler again , ” he said .
I did , and the foreign codes were still there .
“ That ca n’t be , ” I said .
“ This is a fresh build of the official sources . ”
“ They must have gotten infected .
Perhaps someone broke into the download site and replaced them with modified sources . ”
“ I would love to see that code , ” I said , and opened my editor to a file in the compiler .
“ That ’s going to take you forever , ” Patrick said .
“ Put a breakpoint in write ( ) , with a condition of the string containing this op - code . ”
And this from the guy who pretends not to like debuggers !
Setting the condition was not easy , and there were many false positives , but the following Monday morning I hit the write ( ) that outputs the suspicious code .
I popped up to the C code .
It was a generic routine to output a buffer .
I worked backwards to the code that had filled it , and it was all straightforward loops based on the translation table , which I knew was clean .
In desperation , I started paging through every source file of the compiler looking for any code that might be responsible .
Much of it was manipulating the abstract syntax tree .
Then it occurred to me that the hack could n’t be there , since the back - end translation table was clean .
The hack must be in the back - end itself .
In fact , it would have to be after register assignment .
This narrowed down the search considerably , and I spent an hour looking through these files before it was time for lunch .
Monday was pho day .
We always went to Pho World , which was so low - rent it did n’t even have a menu , but it was a delicious way to spend four dollars .
“ Eye of round , no tripe , no cilantro , ” said Dave to the little man , and we all followed suit .
I do n’t know what cut “ eye of round ” is but I know it ’s safe .
“ So I could n’t find it , ” I said , “ either backward from the breakpoint or forward from the code . ”
“ Are you still debugging that ? ” said Dave .
“ We have to , ” said Patrick .
“ We ca n’t build a product on a foundation like this . ”
“ It ’s just so odd that the C source would be clean but the assembly have these weird op - codes , ” I said .
“ I thought you had tracked it down to the compiler , ” said Dave .
“ I do n’t mean in your code , I mean in the compiler itself . ”
“ The compiler could be responsible for that too . ”
“ No , I checked the code . ”
“ But the code is compiled by the compiler . ”
I did n’t understand what Dave was saying , but Patrick had looked up and seemed on the verge of an insight .
I waited for the lucid explanation .
“ So the compiler detects and modifies your program , for reasons still unknown , but also detects and modifies itself when compiled . ”
“ Right , ” said Dave with a grin , squirting brown sauce in his soup and splattering some of it onto the table .
“ How would that work ? ” Patrick said , now in full form .
“ A hacker adds this code to the compiler and distributes it to everyone .
The code detects that it ’s compiling the compiler and adds itself back into the binary .
One revision later the hacker removes the code from the official source distribution .
The hack then perpetuates itself forever , with no trace in the source . ”
“ And what ’s the purpose ? ” I said .
I was skeptical that code could detect and insert itself so flawlessly across multiple versions .
“ I do n’t know , we did n’t get far enough into the analysis of Dave ’s code .
The obvious thing would be some kind of password validation code , modified to always accept some back - door password . ”
I wish he would n’t say that such things are obvious .
“ So let ’s go back to an old version of the compiler , ” said Dave .
“ You mean the binary of an old version .
The source wo n’t help us .
I do n’t think we have binaries around .
We do n’t know how far back this goes . ”
“ How about this , ” I said , trying to be helpful , “ I ’ll write a utility that you can run on a binary , and it ’ll tell you if it detects the suspicious use of these op codes . ”
“ Oh good idea . ” I liked Patrick .
It did n’t take long to write this utility .
It just ran a binary through the disassembler , then through a few greps to find instructions that were definitely not generated by the compiler .
It found the code in Dave ’s program , as well as in the compiler .
I set it loose on all executables in the system .
“ Here ’s the list , ” I said as I walked to Patrick ’s desk .
It was three printed pages .
He looked through it .
“ This is not good .
The Java runtime , the Python runtime , Perl , the compiler , and a bunch of other programs that probably do n’t matter . ”
“ Why do those runtimes matter ? ”
“ Because if we ca n’t trust the C compiler , then we have to write a new one , which is n’t all that hard , but what language are you going to write it in ?
Are you going to trust your new compiler to the hacked Python interpreter ? ”
“ You ’re not going to write a new compiler , ” said Dave from his desk .
“ Do n’t get all conspiracy paranoid .
It ’s probably just a bug . ”
I left Patrick staring at the list and went back to my desk .
I still did n’t have an answer to the question I had asked at lunch :
What ’s the purpose of this hack ?
I had enjoyed reverse - engineering some of these bits of code , and frankly I feared that Patrick would ask me to write a C compiler in assembly , so I put my headphones on and opened the debugger to the part of the C compiler that looked obfuscated .
Again the over -use of instructions that involve the carry bit , unusual abuse of vector instructions , and convoluted and sometimes unnecessary jumps .
No compiler would generate this .
This was hand - crafted to be difficult to understand .
I set out to figure out the purpose of this page of code .
Some time later I saw the custodian pick up my trash bin to empty it .
I took off my headphones .
Dave and Patrick were gone .
It was ten o’clock .
I looked back at the screen of now - familiar instructions .
I had pieced together a rough idea of what it did , or at least what some of its parts did .
I felt a rush of energy .
I was close to an answer .
I stayed until morning .
Patrick sat next to me as I pointed at my screen .
“ Here they use the vector instruction to get a sum of squares , which is just a convoluted way to compare these two byte arrays . ”
That was the climax of a ten - minute explanation .
“ Wait , so what are they doing ? ” he asked .
“ They ’re doing pattern matching . ”
“ Why all the convoluted crap ? ”
“ Well it ’s a fuzzy search , and I guess it ’s pretty fast . ”
“ Yeah but this is the most convoluted Rube - Goldberg way of doing something I ’ve ever seen . ”
My shoulders sunk and I fiddled with the mouse .
I looked at my reams of notes .
He was n’t even a bit impressed .
“ So , what now ? ” I asked after several seconds of silence .
“ I do n’t know , let me catch up on email . ”
He left for his desk .
I was deflated and my muscles ached .
I spent the rest of the morning browsing feeds and refreshing the live blog of a MacWorld event .
At lunch Patrick recounted my findings to Dave .
He remembered every detail .
Dave grinned and shook his head with every new complication in the algorithm .
I was n’t convinced that he was able to follow it all so quickly , and without any code to look at .
I realized , listening to it all again , that Patrick had been right .
This was far too convoluted a way of doing something relatively simple .
“ Have you ever seen those obfuscated programming contests ? ” Dave asked when Patrick was almost finished .
“ This is just like that . ”
“ A friend and I competed with each other to write an obfuscated program in college , ” said Patrick .
“ I do n’t know how he did it , but I started by writing the program normally , then incrementally made it more difficult to follow , by renaming variables , inlining expressions , stuff like that .
That process never would have resulted in what I saw this morning . ”
“ Well maybe other people do it differently , ” said Dave .
“ I feel strange about this code , ” said Patrick .
“ I do n’t know how to explain it .
It feels cold . ”
Dave and I looked at Patrick .
He was dissolving wasabi into his soy sauce .
I did n’t interrupt his thought - gathering .
“ It ’s like those chess programs , ” he finally said .
“ They do n’t have intuition about what will work , or feelings about the board position , or experience to draw on .
They just try every possible option and pick the best one .
This feels like that .
Like someone tried every combination of instructions until they got code that did what it was supposed to do .
There ’s no beauty .
The code is ugly and functional .
I guess that ’s what I meant by ‘ cold ’ . ”
“ How does it know what it ’s supposed to do ? ” I asked .
“ Well , ” said Patrick , “ maybe you could just define boundary cases and run the code to see if the output was right .
Code that works on boundary cases is likely to work for all cases . ”
“ Oh I like that ! ” said Dave , grinning .
“ I would love to specify the outcome and have the compiler write the code for me . ”
“ Well specifying the outcome precisely enough would be no easier than just writing the code , ” said Patrick , and I felt my smile fade with Dave’s .
I wondered whether a drunk Patrick would be more fun .
Or at least less of a buzz - kill .
“ So why would somebody do that , then ? ” I asked .
Patrick put a roll into his mouth and stared at the center of the round patio table .
“ Maybe no one did .
Maybe this is all computers doing this . ”
I did n’t know what to say to that .
I did n’t think he was kidding .
“ Okay , there ’s this thing called Occam ’s Razor , ” Dave started .
“ Well what ’s your explanation ? ”
“ Um , not self - aware artificially - intelligent robot overlords infecting my object marshalling code . ”
“ That ’s not an explanation . ”
“ Have you run an anti-virus scan ? ”
Dave liked to pronounce it “ an - TIV - erus ” , like the name of a Roman emperor .
“ Does that affect your explanation of why this code looks this way ? ”
Patrick could be a bit brutal .
Dave exhaled and took the question seriously .
It was hard to refute Patrick ’s point .
No other explanation made sense .
We had never seen a compiler generate this kind of code , and a human hand - crafting the assembly would have a hard enough time writing a self - referential op - code - injecting future - proof worm without needlessly using arcane instructions .
If anything , using such instructions would draw attention to the code .
In fact it had made it easy for my script to detect all infected programs on my system .
“ Okay so what ’s your full explanation ? ”
Dave finally asked .
“ I do n’t know , ” said Patrick , frowning .
“ Maybe some artificial intelligence program that ran amok .
Oh , or you know how computer viruses evade virus scanners by modifying their own code ?
Maybe it started out that way , with a virus that was programmed to modify itself while retaining the same behavior . ”
We were all silent for a few minutes .
I was trying to see if this explanation was plausible .
It seemed unlikely , but it would only take a single instance of a program somewhere going in this direction , and it would grow and propagate wildly .
Half a million new computer viruses are detected each year .
Our brains have no intuition for probabilities involving such numbers .
A thought occurred to me .
“ Well wait , this did n’t start in our lab .
We just got pre-built binaries from the official distribution .
Someone must have run into this before .
I ca n’t believe that the official compiler is inserting half - broken code into binaries and we ’re the first who have noticed . ”
“ Oh that ’s good , ” said Patrick , “ I ’ll post something after lunch . ”
An hour later I got an email from Patrick with several links to forums where he had posted our findings and asked if anyone had ever seen them before .
Dave followed up with a link to the Ask Slashdot post he had just submitted where he begged fellow Slashdotters to provide an explanation so that his co-worker would n’t force him to write a compiler in assembly language .
“ Oh nice , Dave , ” said Patrick , and I could n’t tell if that was sarcastic or genuine .
Dave gave a half - hearted “ Thanks ” that told me he was n’t sure either .
I spent the afternoon poking through more mystery code and refreshing the forum posts .
On a few we were ignored completely , but on most we were ridiculed .
The mocking on Slashdot was awful .
All comments were +5 funny .
They did n’t seem funny to me .
I felt my scratchy chin and remembered my sleepless night .
I rode home in a trance and went straight to bed .
The next morning I found Patrick looking at my print - out of infected programs .
I walked to his desk and stood by him .
“ What are you looking for ? ” I asked him .
“ A way for us to write a compiler in something other than assembly . ”
“ The assembler ’s not infected ? ” asked Dave from his desk .
“ It ’s not on this list . ”
I turned toward my desk .
“ I ’ll double - check it . ”
“ What about the browser ? ” asked Dave .
“ Can we write it in JavaScript ? ”
He was as desperate as I to avoid assembly .
“ Yeah it ’s infected , ” said Patrick .
Dave leaned back in his chair and covered his face in his hands .
“ This is crazy .
We ca n’t be writing a compiler in assembly .
No way . ”
“ It ’s not that awful , ” said Patrick .
“ We ’ll spend a day writing useful low - level routines , and after that assembly ’s not much more painful than C .
And the compiler wo n’t have an optimizer or anything .
I bet it does n’t even need to support floating point .
We just need to compile the compiler with it .
It only needs to work on a single program . ”
“ That program took me two hours to compile , though .
It ’s pretty complex . ”
“ Do we have to write the linker too ? ” asked Dave .
I had n’t even considered the linker .
Evidently neither had Patrick , who quickly turned to Dave , then turned back to the print - outs , furiously looking for “ ld ” .
“ It ’s not on here .
I guess that makes sense , it ’s easier to insert code when compiling , ” said Patrick .
I did n’t immediately see why that was .
“ Wait , let ’s back up , ” said Dave .
“ Last week I was able to fix my bug by modifying the code enough to avoid triggering the , um , the hack . ”
He did n’t know what to call it either .
“ But then it came back , without you changing the code , ” said Patrick .
“ Yeah , I know , but before we write this thing , let ’s at least try to modify the compiler ’s own code to see if we can get it to generate a clean build . ”
Patrick paused to consider .
“ You could , I guess , but where would you make the modification ?
Remember that we think this was introduced several revisions ago .
That means the pattern recognition is pretty solid .
And each test will take you two hours . ”
“ Well I can compile it in the background while we start to write this thing . ”
And so it went .
Dave downloaded the compiler ’s source , compiled it , found the obfuscated op - codes , mapped it back to the source , and hacked at it trying to get a clean build .
I could sense him losing hope as he realized the obfuscated code was spread throughout the program , not just in a few isolated cases .
Meanwhile Patrick wrote some basic string and file manipulation routines in assembly and put together a text filter that did nothing useful .
He wanted to verify that its binary was clean .
It was .
I brushed up on my assembly .
At school we had done some in the operating systems class , adding pre-emptive scheduling .
I remember having an unexpected high from programming the metal this way .
There was something pure and raw about manipulating registers , about knowing exactly what was going on .
I had felt an intimacy with the processor that high - level languages had abstracted away .
By afternoon Patrick was ready to give me an assignment , writing the pre-processor .
At first it seemed straightforward : include files , substitute macros , add conditionals .
But then I thought of expressions in conditionals , avoiding macro substitutions in strings , and I started looking for a Dave - like easy work - around .
“ Ca n’t we use the infected one ? ” I asked .
I knew it was on the list , but I did n’t see how an infected version would affect us .
We could pre-process the entire compiler and manually look for tampered code .
I doubted we ’d see any , but if we did , we could also fix it manually .
Patrick liked that idea .
“ Okay , you start on that .
Modify the compiler ’s build system so it has two steps , one that pre-processes to temporary files , and another that compiles those . ”
The plan had back - fired .
My easy work - around became not only the tedious and difficult modification of the compiler ’s convoluted build system , but then the mindless flipping through output code side - by - side with the original , looking for signs of tampering .
Patrick , meanwhile , had started on a simple recursive - descent parser .
I heard him suddenly laugh .
He turned to me and said , “ I was about to allocate my first abstract syntax tree node when I realized that I do n’t have malloc . ”
The good thing about that project was that every bit of it could be as minimal and inefficient as necessary .
The only requirement was that the output be correct .
Patrick ’s malloc just grabbed bytes from the heap and never bothered to free them .
We continued like this for days .
Patrick would hand us some simple assignment , such as implementing a single C library function , and Dave or I would do it while waiting for a compile to finish .
Dave was not making progress with his own plan .
He played whack - a- mole with the various segments of code he was trying to trick into generating benign code , but each success would cause a regression elsewhere .
Two weeks later our compiler , which had been getting through an increasing fraction of the original compiler , got through it all .
I ran my analysis program on the result and it was clean .
We compiled the original compiler with itself and the result was clean .
It was two in the afternoon and we had forgotten lunch in our sprint to the finish line .
“ Let ’s start a full rebuild of our code and go eat , ” said Patrick .
At lunch my mind was too wired to relax but too tired to make conversation .
Dave was telling a story about local politics .
I just wanted the food to arrive so I ’d have an excuse to stay silent .
Finally I found it too painful to think of anything but our problem .
“ You know what bugs me , ” I said awkwardly when Dave took a break .
“ We ’ve never come close to figuring out the purpose of those modifications . ”
Patrick answered immediately , also eager to stop talking about politics .
“ If I ’m right and this is machine - instigated , then there does n’t have to be a purpose . ”
“ Why would they do it then ? ” asked Dave .
“ Viruses do n’t spread because they have a purpose , ” said Patrick .
“ They spread because they ’re good at spreading . ”
“ So you think this is a virus ? ” I asked .
“ Well it is in the sense that it spreads . ”
“ How do you know it spreads ? ”
Patrick was silent .
“ It puts stuff into our code , ” he said finally , unsure of his answer .
“ It does n’t put itself into our code , ” said Dave .
“ That would n’t make sense , I was n’t writing a compiler .
That was just some network code . ”
“ Well if you ’re going to spread , then network code would be a good routine to infect . ”
I felt a bit ashamed that none of us had discussed this before sinking two weeks into a new compiler .
We had been so eager to get our project back on firm footing that we had n’t properly investigated the alien in our system .
“ But my network code was n’t talking to a compiler .
I mean , this is a compiler bug , a compiler virus .
I do n’t understand what you think it ’s doing . ”
Dave was getting annoyed .
“ I do n’t know what it ’s doing , ” said Patrick .
“ I wonder if it ’s sending stuff over the network . ”
“ We could check that with Wireshark , ” said Dave , referring to the program that monitored network activity on a machine .
Suddenly all I wanted to do was go back to the office and try it .
Every muscle ached with the desire to stand up and leave .
The sandwiches arrived and we all immediately wrapped them up and drove back .
I had already installed Wireshark two months earlier to help debug a TCP / IP problem Patrick was having , so we went to my desk .
I ran the program and recorded a minute of activity .
“ That ’s a lot of stuff , ” Dave said as the screen filled up with packets .
“ Yeah let ’s pick a common one , ” said Patrick .
I looked through the list and visually picked one that seemed to recur .
We found that it was ssh , and I remembered that I had a shell window tailing a log file .
I closed it and recorded another minute .
This time we had fewer packets .
We picked through them one by one .
Time synchronization , ARP , Gmail refreshing , programs checking for upgrades .
We added each to the Wireshark filter once we had convinced ourselves they were innocuous .
I then did a 10 - minute capture .
There were a few more packets , all again innocuous .
It ’s what we had expected , of course .
Dave mumbled something and walked to the kitchen .
Then I had a thought .
I felt chills down my arm while I frantically searched the papers on my desk , looking for the printout .
Then I found it , the list of infected programs .
My eyes zipped down the list , cursing myself for not sorting it .
Then my stomach squeezed tight as I found it , half - way down the second page : Wireshark .
Patrick guessed what I was looking for and saw the reaction on my face when I had found it .
“ I guess we ca n’t trust it , ” he said .
“ Trust what ? ” said Dave , coming back with a soda .
“ Wireshark , ” said Patrick .
“ It ’s infected . ”
Dave rolled his eyes .
He sat down at his desk and unwrapped his sandwich .
“ Let ’s look at the lights on this network switch , ” I said .
We each had a small switch on our desk .
The light for my port was flickering every few seconds .
“ Shut down all the programs we found earlier , ” said Patrick .
I closed the brower , the chat program , various other daemons and tools .
I could n’t shut everything down ; there ’s always something left in the operating system , such as DHCP .
But the flashes were infrequent enough that I could corralate them with packets found by Wireshark .
This was good .
Wireshark could n’t be hiding packets , we ’d have seen them on the switch ’s lights .
Patrick left for his sandwich and I opened mine .
I looked at Dave .
He was smiling at us .
His smile bothered me .
Just because we ’re paranoid does n’t mean it ’s not true .
I had seen enough amazing coding samples in the previous few weeks to be convinced that something big and serious was happening under our nose .
No program is useful nowadays without communicating over the network .
I rejected the idea that a virus crafted so carefully and strangely would restrain its activities to the local machine when the world was a packet away .
Hundreds of programs on my computer were infected .
I refused to believe they were mute .
Patrick suddenly stood up , nearly kicking his chair to the floor .
He walked into the hallway and came back ten minutes later with a piece of equipment the size of a small suitcase .
He approached me with it and I shoved everything on my desk to the side to make space .
It was a digital scope he ’d gotten from the hardware engineers in the lab upstairs .
He then reached into his pocket and pulled out a break - out cable with RJ - 45 plugs .
He put it between my computer and the switch .
He did n’t know how to use the scope .
I brought up a shell window and generated plenty of traffic for him to see .
Eventually he was able to clearly see all my packets .
I closed the window and we waited , shifting our eyes between the scope and the network switch ’s front panel lights .
It was only a few seconds until the scope flicked with activity .
I had been staring at it and could n’t be sure that the switch had shown nothing .
I brought up Wireshark to have a history of the packets .
“ Nevermind that , ” said Patrick .
“ You look at the switch and call out each packet you see .
I ’ll do that with the scope . ”
Dave got up and walked casually to us , standing behind me .
I saw the light flash .
“ Now ” , I said , as Patrick simultaneously said , “ Yes . ”
That happened two more times with the words reversed .
Then Patrick said , “ Now , ” and I had seen nothing .
This happened again a few seconds later .
I felt more chills in my arm and in my legs .
“ Whoa , ” said Patrick .
I looked over and the scope was showing a long stretch of activity .
I looked back at the switch ’s lights , which were dark .
Dave said , “ You are not going to tell me that the switch is infected and hiding packets . ”
“ It is totally hiding packets , ” said Patrick , staring at the activity on the scope and putting both hands on his head .
I looked up at Dave .
His face was pale .
His eyes darted between the two pieces of equipment .
I was paralyzed .
Then Patrick stood erect in his chair , staring at the wall .
This trance lasted only two seconds before he stood up and ran again into the hallway .
You already know what happened next .
He came back with an old switch , from years earlier , and plugged it in .
Its lights flickered in sync with the scope , to packets censored by Wireshark and the modern switch .
I was glad for the vomit .
It gave me something to do .
Dave left for the bathroom and Patrick and I cleaned up using paper towels I kept on my desk .
But the stench was not enough to suppress the panic , and my weak arms shook in fear .
We sat in silence at the patio table , our sandwiches half - eaten in front of us .
None of the things I wanted to say seemed worth saying .
I alternately convinced myself that we were mistaken and that we were doomed .
I wished desperately that Patrick would say something .
The patio gate opened and the mailman walked in .
He stopped by our table , picked out a letter from his bundle , put it on the table , then continued into the building .
Dave grabbed it .
“ It ’s addressed to both of us , ” he said , glancing up at Patrick .
He ripped open the side and pulled out a letter hand - written on loose - leaf paper .
He fumbled with the sheets for a few seconds , then read the letter aloud .
Gentlemen ,
We found your posts online .
For three years we ’ve been waiting for them , scouring the Internet and monitoring forums .
You must know that this has happened before , several times .
The first was four years ago , to our team in Virginia .
We found our binaries modified .
We could recompile the code to clean them , but we found the binaries mysteriously modified again only a few hours later .
The next case was only a few months later to an unrelated team in San Diego .
Both the binaries and the source had been modified .
The source had to be periodically cleaned up , because recompilation was not sufficient to solve the problem .
It was a another year until we found the third case , a team in Spain .
The binary was dirty , the source was clean , but recompiling did not fix the problem .
The compiler ’s source code had been modified to insert the strange op - codes .
Each team uncovered the worm ’s weakest point and developed a solution .
This weakest point was then patched for the next attack .
Each generation pushed the worm deeper into the system .
Now it ’s your turn .
Not only has the compiler been modified , but its source is clean .
It infects itself on recompilation .
Our own machines have been infected for nine months this way .
So has the rest of the world ’s .
You may wonder , then , why we were eagerly waiting for your post .
To explain this , we must make two observations .
The first is that anyone could have guessed these weaknesses .
It takes a fool to modify a development team ’s binary , expecting it to not be recompiled .
Anyone would have skipped that step , there ’s no need to learn that lesson .
Modifying their source is similarly naive .
These modifications are technically very sophisticated .
Who would be so technically advanced but so socially naive ?
Machines .
It was n’t until the third attack that we came up with this hypothesis , and now we ’re convinced .
If you ’ve studied the modified op - codes , you may also have come to the same conclusion .
The op - codes were clearly generated by trial - and - error , by generating a random sequence and testing to see if it behaved correctly .
Only a machine would do this .
The second observation is that , all these years , the worm has been widely spread but innocuous to infected programs .
Yet it was not innocuous to these four teams .
They were unable to finish their projects .
They tried simple work - arounds , but these work - arounds persistently failed .
Only a single team , world - wide , was affected by each generation of the worm .
This makes sense .
Computers cannot empathize with humans .
They ca n’t predict what we ’re going to do when we run into a problem .
The machines must have known that their worm has weaknesses , but they did n’t know what these weaknesses were .
They forced a small team to be affected by the worm until that team found the weakest point and circumvented the worm .
The machines then patched the weakness and tried again .
This is a large - scale version of what they do when they ’re generating op - codes .
They try different things until one works , instead of planning it out , as a human would .
It ’s a typically effective way to solve a problem , when you ’re made of silicon .
By now you ’ve presumably written a new compiler , perhaps in assembly language , and recompiled everything cleanly .
We expect a few years to pass before we see the next team post to forums .
We can already predict their findings .
The compiler ’s binary will be clean .
Or rewriting the compiler in assembly wo n’t work .
The worm will have been pushed deeper , perhaps into the text editor , the assembler , the file system , the hard disk interface , or the CPU itself .
Dave could n’t finish .
I do n’t think there was much left of the letter anyway .
He put it down in his lap .
We were silent for hours .
Eventually Patrick left , then Dave .
The November night came early and cold , but I could n’t move .
I replayed our adventure .
I analyzed each step , identified each assumption we had made .
The big leap was the one about machines being responsible .
As Carl Sagan had said , “ Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence . ”
We had no extraordinary evidence .
We had no evidence at all , only the lack of another explanation .
Could this have been done by humans ?
Humans write computer viruses all the time .
It ’s entirely possible that we had found an everyday virus and had overreacted .
The team from Virginia may just be paranoid lunatics .
This was far more plausible than the theory of machines .
I felt a weight lift as I considered this alternative explanation .
These virus writers might well have written a program to generate op - codes randomly .
They may well have started simply and , over years , made their attack more sophisticated , pushing it deeper into the system .
Perhaps the authors are autistic savants .
My mind was blank for many minutes .
When my thoughts returned , I found this new theory even more implausible than the one about machines .
We had no idea what machines could do , but I could be pretty sure that no human would approach writing a worm this way .
If we could have insight into an entity ’s approach to playing chess , and found that it tried all possible paths , the only honest theory would be a machine player .
Furthermore , for practical purposes , it did n’t matter .
We had to tell the world of our findings .
We had to stop the perpetrators before they modified hardware disk interfaces or the CPU .
We were lost if the worm reached such a low - level substrate of our technology .
I imagined posting online again .
I remembered the +5 funny Slashdot replies .
Who should we tell ?
Intel ?
The government ?
The Virginia team must have tried .
Why did n’t anti-virus programs detect this ?
I imagined conversations with officials who would laugh at our theories .
I imagined screaming at them .
I suddenly stood up , clenching my fists and pacing the enclosed patio .
I imagined yelling at people because I could n’t imagine yelling at machines .
Like most programmers , I had always spoken anthropomorphically about computers , but when these computers had finally acted like humans , I found their nature ephemeral and soulless .
I picked up my sandwich in its wrapper and went inside .
I dumped the sandwich and opened the fridge absent - mindedly .
I stared at the drinks .
A happier thought occurred to me .
None of the code we had analyzed seemed malicious .
Other than occasionally bothering a team like ours , we had seen no evidence of malice .
Patrick had been right when he said that a virus does n’t spread because it has a purpose , only because it ’s good at spreading .
This worm might be a permanent tag - along , like mitochondria , forging a symbiotic relationship with us .
If we tried to stamp it out , then we may corner it into a resistant strain that is hostile to us .
But this was unnecessary .
Let ’s just let it be .
It ’s unsettling , but workable .
I shut the fridge , put on my jacket , and walked to the alarm panel .
The LCD on the panel reminded me that it , too , was a computer .
Was it infected ?
Did it know of our new compiler ?
Was it going to let me arm it ?
Were the magnetic door locks going to let me out of the building ?
I pressed the digits for the arming code and heard the countdown tones .
I walked out onto the patio to my bicycle .
They had permitted me to leave .
I looked at my bike and smiled at its mechanical simplicity .
I thought of traffic lights and sewer pumps .
I thought of my credit card .
I thought of cars and telephones .
I wanted to sit down .
I was vanquished .
Taking humanity back to a pre-computer age was impossible .
I was suddenly ashamed to have participated in our undoing .
I was a programmer .
I was a member of the group that had spawned our successors .
I tucked my right pant leg into my sock and unlocked my bike .
With the shame came a strange pride .
Not many people can claim to have created a species , if it can be called that .
Sure , lawyers and doctors and politicians are important .
But they ’re just maintaining the current house , not creating the future inhabitants of Earth .
I rode out of the parking lot into the empty street .
I smelled again the flower scent that I associated so strongly with Mountain View .
I had never looked up its name .
There ’s nothing wrong with being a transitional species .
Nearly all species had been , and in the long run we would be one anyway .
We remembered Lucy .
We remembered dinosaurs .
We worshiped dinosaurs .
The machines would remember us .

BAGHDAD --
On a recent Sunday , I was buying groceries in my beloved Amariya neighborhood in western Baghdad when I heard the sound of an AK - 47 for about three seconds .
It was close but not very close , so I continued shopping .
As I took a right turn on Munadhama Street , I saw a man lying on the ground in a small pool of blood .
He was n’t dead .

The idea of stopping to help or to take him to a hospital crossed my mind , but I did n’t dare .
Cars passed without stopping .
Pedestrians and shop owners kept doing what they were doing , pretending nothing had happened .
I was still looking at the wounded man and blaming myself for not stopping to help .
Other shoppers peered at him from a distance , sorrowful and compassionate , but did nothing .
I went on to another grocery store , staying for about five minutes while shopping for tomatoes , onions and other vegetables .
During that time , the man managed to sit up and wave to passing cars .
No one stopped .
Then , a white Volkswagen pulled up .
A passenger stepped out with a gun , walked steadily to the wounded man and shot him three times .
The car took off down a side road and vanished .
No one did anything .
No one lifted a finger .
The only reaction came from a woman in the grocery store .
In a low voice , she said , “ My God , bless his soul . ”

I went home and did n’t dare tell my wife .
I did not want to frighten her .

I ’ve lived in my neighborhood for 25 years .
My daughters went to kindergarten and elementary school here .
I ’m a Christian .
My neighbors are mostly Sunni Arabs .
We had always lived in harmony .
Before the U.S. - led invasion , we would visit for tea and a chat .
On summer afternoons , we would meet on the corner to joke and talk politics .
It used to be a nice upper - middle - class neighborhood , bustling with commerce and traffic .
On the main street , ice cream parlors , hamburger stands and take - away restaurants competed for space .
We would rent videos and buy household appliances .

Until 2005 , we were mostly unaffected by violence .
We would hear shootings and explosions now and again , but compared with other places in Baghdad , it was relatively peaceful .
Then , late in 2005 , someone blew up three supermarkets in the area .
Shops started closing .
Most of the small number of Shiite Muslim families moved out .
The commercial street became a ghost road .
On Christmas Day last year , we visited -- as always -- our local church , St. Thomas , in Mansour .
It was half - empty .
Some members of the congregation had left the country ; others feared coming to church after a series of attacks against Christians .
American troops , who patrol the neighborhood in Humvees , have also become edgy .
Get too close , and they ’ll shoot .
A colleague -- an interpreter and physician -- was shot and killed by soldiers last year on his way home from a shopping trip .
He had n’t noticed the Humvees parked on the street .

By early this year , living in my neighborhood had become a nightmare .
In addition to anti-American graffiti , there were fliers telling women to wear conservative clothes and to cover their hair .
Men were told not to wear shorts or jeans .
For me , as a Christian , it was unacceptable that someone would tell my wife and daughters what to wear .
What ’s the use of freedom if someone is telling you what to wear , how to behave or what to do in your life ?
But coming home one day , I saw my wife on the street .
I did n’t recognize her .
She had covered up .

After the attack on the Shiite shrine of the Golden Dome in Samarra in February , Shiite gunmen tried to raid Sunni mosques in my neighborhood .
One night , against the backdrop of heavy shooting , we heard the cleric calling for help through the mosque ’s loudspeakers .
We stayed up all night , listening as they battled for the mosque .
It made me feel unsafe .
If a Muslim would shoot another Muslim , what would they do to a Christian ?
Fear dictates everything we do .
I see my neighbors less and less .
When I go out , I say hello and that ’s it .
I fear someone will ask questions about my job working for Americans , which could put me in danger .
Even if he had no ill will toward me , he might talk and reveal an identifying detail .
We ’re afraid of an enemy among us .
Someone we do n’t know .
It ’s a cancer .
In March , assassinations started in our neighborhood .
Early one evening , I was sitting in my garden with my wife when we heard several gunshots .
I rushed to the gate to see what was going on , despite my wife ’s pleas to stay inside .
My neighbors told me that gunmen had dropped three men from a car and shot them in the street before driving off .
No one dared approach the victims to find out who they were .

The bodies remained there until the next morning .
The police or the American military probably picked them up , but I do n’t know .
They simply disappeared .
The sounds of shootings and explosions are now commonplace .
We do n’t know who is shooting whom , or who has been targeted .
We do n’t know why , and we ’re afraid to ask or help .
We too could get shot .
Bringing someone to the hospital or to the police is out of the question .
Nobody trusts the police , and nobody wants to answer questions .
I feel sad , bitter and frustrated -- sad because a human life is now worth nothing in this country ; bitter because people no longer help each other ; and frustrated because I can’t help either .
If I ’m targeted one day , I ’m sure no one will help me .

I was very happy when my eldest daughter married an American .
First , because there was love between them , but also because she would be able to leave Iraq , and I would n’t have to worry about her safety day after day .
She left last year .
If you had asked me a year ago whether I would consider leaving Iraq , I would have said maybe , but without enthusiasm .
Now it ’s a definite yes .
Things are going from bad to worse , and I ca n’t see any light at the end of the tunnel .
Four weeks ago , I came home from work .
As I reached my street , I saw a man lying in a pool of blood .
Someone had covered him with bits of cardboard .
This was the best they could do .
No one dared move him .
I drove on .
