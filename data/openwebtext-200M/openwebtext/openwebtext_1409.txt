The Cycler system alters the philosophy behind a Mars program .
It makes possible the dream of regular flights to the Red Planet and a permanent human presence there .
That ’s the only way we ’ll ever succeed in taking mankind ’s next giant leap : a subway - in - the - sky between our planet and our future second home . .

In the early 1980 ’s , Buzz started thinking about applying his orbital rendezvous expertise to a lunar spacecraft system that would perform perpetual cycling orbits between the Earth and the Moon by using the relative gravitational forces of these two bodies to sustain the orbit , thereby expending very little fuel .
The only problem was that it took longer to get to the Moon this way , and for such a short distance of a four - day trip the cycling approach was not sufficiently advantageous .
Upon the recommendation of Tom Paine ( former NASA Administrator during the Apollo Moon landings ) , Buzz began to adapt the cycling orbit concept to the much more complex goal of human missions to Mars .
Buzz ’s shrewd estimations of the relative movements and positions of the Earth and Mars to determine the gravity - assist trajectories and orbital route of a perpetually cycling reusable spacecraft , as seen in his numerous hand drawings , were verified by engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) .
His concept worked and was christened the “ Aldrin Cycler . ”
Aldrin ’s system of cycling spacecraft makes travel to Mars possible using far less propellant than conventional means , with an expected five and a half month journey from the Earth to Mars , and a return trip to Earth of about the same duration on a twin semi-cycler .
The Aldrin Cycler ’s design features a slow rotation of the spacecraft to create artificial gravity to avoid the bone and muscle loss hazard of weightlessness on long - duration trips .
In each cycle when the Aldrin Cycler ’s trajectory swings it by the Earth , a smaller Earth - departing interceptor spacecraft ferries crew and cargo up to dock with the Cycler spacecraft .
Ultimately , the Aldrin Cycler system of transportation offers a way to make travel to Mars sustainable for the long - term , in contrast to the brief excursions to the Moon during the six Apollo lunar landings from 1969 to 1972 .
LAST MONTH , the US economy shed another 85,000 jobs .
It marked a miserable end to a calamitous year in which an estimated 4.2 million American jobs were liquidated , and unemployment rose to 10 percent .
In addition , more than 920,000 “ discouraged workers ’’ left the labor force entirely , having given up on finding work and therefore not included in official unemployment data .
Meanwhile , millions of Americans who do have jobs have been compelled to work part - time or at reduced wages ; many others have not seen a raise in years .
But not everyone is having a rotten recession .
Since December 2007 , when the current downturn began , the ranks of federal employees earning $ 100,000 and up has skyrocketed .
According to a recent analysis by USA Today , federal workers making six - figure salaries - not including overtime and bonuses - “ jumped from 14 percent to 19 percent of civil servants during the recession ’s first 18 months . ’’
The surge has been especially pronounced among the highest - paid employees .
At the Defense Department , for example , the number of civilian workers making $ 150,000 or more quintupled from 1,868 to 10,100 .
At the recession ’s start , the Transportation Department was paying only one person a salary of $ 170,000 .
Eighteen months later , 1,690 employees were drawing paychecks that size .
All the while , the federal government has been adding jobs at a 10,000 - a- month clip .
Between December 2007 and June 2009 , federal payrolls exploded by nearly 10 percent .
“ Federal workers are enjoying an extraordinary boom time in pay and hiring , ’’ USA Today observes , “ during a recession that has cost 7.3 million jobs in the private sector . ’’
And to add public - sector insult to private - sector injury , data from the Office of Personnel Management show the average federal salary is now roughly $ 71,000 - about 76 percent higher than the average private salary .
Needless to say , it is n’t only at the federal level that government pay and perks increasingly outstrip those in the private sector .
In Ohio , a joint reporting effort by the state ’s eight largest newspapers found that even in a time of severe budget cuts , “ one expense government leaders have not cut is pensions for their workers . ’’
The annual public pension tab in Ohio , currently $ 4.1 billion , is growing by around $ 700 million per year .
“ Retirement incomes for the most experienced government employees top out at 88 percent of their active - duty pay , ’’ writes James Nash of the Columbus Dispatch .
“ Unlike most private - sector workers , whose retirement is driven by the strength of the stock market and 401 ( k ) plans , government employees ’ pensions are guaranteed . ’’
Moreover , government retirees in Ohio enjoy taxpayer - provided health care , and in many cases can retire at 48 .
Especially egregious are “ double - dippers ’’ - public employees who “ retire ’’ and get a full pension while returning to work and collecting a paycheck .
In 2009 , double - dippers were paid nearly a billion dollars by Buckeye State public - pension systems .
Ohio is hardly unique .
A public - pension tsunami is beginning to inundate government budgets at every level .
As more and more of taxpayers ’ earnings are confiscated to fund outsize public - sector benefits , the backlash from the private sector will only grow angrier and more intense .
“ We are about to get run over by a locomotive , ’’ warned California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in his State of the State address this month .
Over the past decade , he said , pension costs for state employees swelled 2,000 percent - but revenues only increased 24 percent .
The state has had to come up with funds to close that gap - funds diverted from “ our universities , our parks , and other government functions . ’’
Public - employee unions fiercely defend their pay and pensions , but even union - friendly Democrats are starting to acknowledge the inevitable .
“ The deal used to be that civil servants were paid less than private sector workers in exchange for an understanding that they had job security for life , ’’ former San Francisco mayor and California Assembly speaker Willie Brown recently wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle .
“ But we politicians , pushed by our friends in labor , gradually expanded pay and benefits . . . while keeping the job protections and layering on incredibly generous retirement packages . . .
Talking about this is politically unpopular . . .
But at some point , someone is going to have to get honest about the fact . ’’
A showdown is coming , and more likely sooner than later .
Taxpayers will put up with a lot , but their patience has its limits .

The sky at night : Stunning moonbow arches over dramatic volcanic landscape
We 've all seen rainbows shimmering across the sky as the sun returns after a downpour .
But this one is a little different .
It was created by light from the moon shining through cloud vapour suspended 10,000 ft up the rim of a volcano in Hawaii .
As if the picture was n't stunning enough , it also features Mars glowing fiercely against the rich blue of the Pacific night sky .
The moonbow arches over Haleakala crater on Maui Island , Hawaii , and ( below ) how it looks during the day
SO HOW IS A MOONBOW CREATED ?
Light from the Moon shines on droplets of moisture above the volcano 's crater .
It is difficult for the human eye to pick out the colours and for this reason it appears white .
However , the colours will appear in long - exposure photographs .
Moonbows are most easily viewed when the Moon is nearly full .
They are relatively rare because they need a number of conditions to appear .
The Moon must be less than 42 degrees high in a very dark sky .
The remarkable photograph of a ' moonbow ' was taken by Wally Pacholka , as he looked over the Halkeakala crater on Maui Island in Hawaii .
The 61 - year - old former accountant specialises in taking pictures of dramatic night skies over America 's national parks .
However , it was n't easy getting this one .
' This was my seventh evening there , having hiked inside the 12 - mile crater a few days back , ' he said .
' I was very fortunate to see this , but in a way I created this fortune as I was always out there . '
This night - time phenomena was created not by the Sun but by light reflected off the Moon .
The fog hanging above the volcano 's crater acted as the white canvas .
Mars can also be seen in this dazzling image , glowing orange high in the sky ( top left of image ) .
The planet is making one of its closest approaches to Earth and is around 60 million miles away , shining brilliant red as it rises in the east on its journey across the night sky .
These concerns , in internal reports dated October 2008 but not made public until now , were later overruled by other agency officials , and GlaxoSmithKline is currently enrolling patients in the TIDE trial .
The trial is not expected to be completed until 2020 , although the company is hoping to report some results to the F.D.A. by 2014 .
The company ’s patent on Avandia expires in 2012 , and generic versions will probably swallow most remaining profits .
In a letter sent Thursday to Dr. Hamburg , the Food and Drug Administration commissioner , Mr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley asked “ what steps the F.D.A. has taken to protect patients in the TIDE trial ” and said the trial ’s patients had never been told about the concerns raised by the agency ’s own safety officers .
Mr. Grassley said the internal agency battle showed that the agency needed to be restructured to give more power to safety officials like Dr. Graham and Dr. Gelperin over their counterparts who approve medicines and deal more directly with drug makers .
“ It does n’t make any sense to have these experts who study drugs after they have been on the market for several years under the thumb of the officials who approved the drug in the first place and have a natural interest in defending that decision , ” Mr. Grassley said .
“ The Avandia case may be the most alarming example of the problem with this setup . ”
The question of when and how to communicate possible drug risks has long bedeviled drug makers and regulators .
Hints are common that drugs may cause injuries ; thousands of drug injury reports pour into the Food and Drug Administration every week .
For example , Avandia ranked first among all prescribed drugs in the number of serious , disabling and fatal problems  including 304 deaths  reported to the agency in the third quarter of 2009 , according to an analysis done by the Institute for Safe Medication Practice , a drug safety oversight group .
But companies say that such reports do not offer proof of a problem and that highlighting them can scare patients away from needed treatment , so they often argue that more certainty is needed before alarms are raised .
GlaxoSmithKline said a “ vast majority ” of the recent reports regarding Avandia was related to litigation .
I 'm alive and still kickin today thanks to my new best friend Joe Bunk .
This story should be told .
It was a dumb roll , I 've done a hundred of them .
This one was different though ....
I was pinned in the rig upside down and the belts would not release .
I looked in the mirror and saw flames on the headers ... no big deal .
Well the fire grew so fast , suddenly I was in deep shit .
I could not get out .
I do n't know why , but the left side of my harness was jammed and I tried like hell , but I was not able to get free .
By this time the flames were coming inside the drivers compartment and I got on the radio and put out a desperate call for help ....
I was upside down , on fire and pinned inside .
I thought this was it .
" car 770 , I need help ! " ... response , " what 's wrong " , " I 'm upside down and on fire ! " .
problem was they were at the next pit and about 10 minutes away .
I did n't have 10 minutes .
I had less than 30 seconds .
Out of nowhere , here comes Joe Bunk .
He was the ONLY one there .
He came running down to help and by this time the flames were BIG .
I would n't have blamed anyone for running away because for all we knew the thing was about to explode .
Joe Bunk hang in there with me though and for that he is a true hero .
I pulled the halon system handle and it did nothing .... the flames were huge and the tires were on fire and the fire was accelerating .
Nothing was going to get it out at this point and I 'm still inside .
I could feel the heat through my fire suit and I knew I did not have much time left .
I threw the fire extinguisher out to him and he tried it with no real affect on the fire .
By this time I 'm breathing in bad smoke and things are getting desperate .
I said " dude " ( I never say dude , lol ! ) " you gotta cut me out of here " he said he did n't have a knife " about this time I remember that I zip tied a Gerber tool within reach just to my left .
I pulled it out and threw it out to him .
I said " cut me out " by this time I did n't care if he cut my leg off , I needed out of there !
He cut the belts and reached in and pulled me out .
I did n't have any control of myself at this point and was just flailing trying to get away from the flames .
I fell in a heap just outside the buggy and he said " dude ( yea , I know , but I started it ) , you gotta get away from this thing " .
He helped me get to a safe distance and I looked back and it was totally engulfed in flames .
Literally 10 seconds later .
I 'm not exaggerating any of this .
JOE BUNK SAVED MY LIFE .
He was just a spectator in the right place at the right time to make a difference in my life .
That 's the story .
Something I would like to think any one of us would do for another wheeler .
But I will say Joe stayed there with me when things were really bad and I would not have blamed him for running away to save himself .
It is only because he did n't and stayed there risking his own life that I am still here today to tell the story .
I owe my life to Joe Bunk and only hope to be able to somehow pay the debt back someday .
If Joe ever needs anything he can call me and I 'll be there to help .
Joe is a reluctant hero and does not even want to acknowledge just how extraordinary this act of true courage is that he displayed .
I know though because I was there and I am still here because of it .
I look forward to paying back someday .
If not to Joe perhaps someone else who is in desperate trouble and needs a hand .
We are a family of wheelers and it is good to know there are everyday heros out there .
I know one today .
Joe Bunk is a true hero !
Ken " Doc " Mercer .... damn happy to be alive today !
Six -Hour Alpine Ordeal Tourist Trapped on Ski Lift Escapes Death by Burning Cash
A German snowboarder , stranded on a ski lift for six hours , saved himself by burning all his cash to attract attention in the icy darkness .
He was burning his last 20 euro note when he was spotted .
I have seen the future , and it is now .
Those words came to mind again as I recently listened to Craig Venter , one of those leading the new areas of synthetic genomics and synthetic biology .
Every time I hear a talk on this subject , it seems a new threshold in the artificial manipulation and , ultimately , creation of life has been passed .
Consider just some of the progress associated with the J. Craig Venter Institute .
In 2003 its researchers created a synthetic version of the bacteriophage phiX174 .
In 2007 they successfully transformed one species of bacteria to another by genome transplantation .
Most recently , they developed methods for the complete synthetic assembly of the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma genitalium .
The techniques now developed make the feat of sequencing the human genome in 2001 seem prehistoric .
Not only have the cost and speed of sequencing evolved faster than those of computer chips , but the ability to use both chemistry and biology to synthesize new complex organisms has undergone a revolution in the past five years .
Instructions embedded in synthetic gene sequences can now be implanted in foreign cells and thereby cause those cells to express proteins ; those proteins , in turn , build new functioning copies of the life - forms whose instruction manual is in the embedded sequences .
Venter calls this cycle “ software that creates its own hardware . ”
I expect to hear news soon of the successful creation of the first completely artificial life - form , built from scratch and not alive until the scientists assembled it .
Semiconductor nanotechnology has been heralded for more than a decade , but I believe it will pale beside the ability of biotechnology to transform life and society .
Imagine the impact of piggybacking on nature ’s majesty and designing living systems that can perform tasks not found in nature , from microbes that make gasoline or eat carbon dioxide to create nonbiodegradable plastic building materials to organisms designed to surgically and strategically operate on cancer cells .
I expect that within 50 years the world ’s economy will be driven not by computer - generated information but by biologically generated software .
Of course , as Spiderman would say , with great power comes great responsibility .
Hackers now create software viruses that periodically disable huge computer networks .
With the ability to make DNA sequences to order has risen the specter of garage - based DNA hackers who might terrorize the world — intentionally or accidentally — by re-creating the Ebola virus or the 1918 flu .
Each of those disease organisms has a genetic code far smaller than that of the recently synthesized M. genitalium .
One could also imagine producing , again perhaps unwittingly , viruses that are immune to existing vaccines .
Some may fear the existence of new life - forms that might attack all life on earth or at least human life .
This fear is probably misplaced .
Life has survived for more than three billion years because it is robust , and almost no mutations can easily outwit the defense mechanisms built up through eons of exposure to potential path­o­gens .
Venter ’s argument that new naturally emerging diseases are a far greater threat than new artificial diseases seems relatively compelling .
Nevertheless , there have been , until fairly recently , few checks on the unfettered reproduction of genetic information .
As the ability to synthesize more complex biological systems has increased , however , the research community has put in place a voluntary system of restrictions , for example , on the fulfillment of commercial orders for genetic sequences that correspond to portions of potentially lethal organisms .
At present , the technological know - how associated with developing synthetic biology laboratories with malice aforethought is probably beyond the means of even sophisticated terrorist networks .
Moreover , it is important not to let misplaced fears of Armageddon unduly restrict scientific work with great potential to benefit humankind .
I have always felt that , aside from research that violates universal human mores , when it comes to technological applications , that which can be done will be done .
What we need to do is rigorously attempt to anticipate what may be possible so that we can minimize the risks and maximize the benefits .
We need to walk into the future , no matter how unnerving , with open eyes if society is to keep pace with technology .
A couple days ago , I was trying to rig up a script that would set up an Omegle stranger with Cleverbot .
After a while I just gave up and decided to find a pre-made Omegle bot .
I came across a blog post detailing a Python based bot script .
I set it up and it worked .
Then for the next hour or so , some poor girl in Scotland talked with my computer , never realizing that she was talking to a bot .
I ’ve posted the complete transcript below .
You : is the bot and Stranger : is the girl .
Stranger : hiya
You : Hi there !
Stranger : how are you
You : Fair to partly cloudy .
Stranger : still dark here i cant tell
You : Still how long ?
Are you scared of the dark ?
Stranger : its proabably going to be cold though
You : Oh .
I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
Really .
proabably going to be cold is ?
Stranger : well its been dark scince it turned to night
You :
Well that 's okay .
I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
Is that your opinion ?
Stranger : no its a matter of fact
You : Far out .
I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
What do you really want to ask me ?
Stranger : the question is what do you want to ask me
Stranger : ?
Stranger : why do you correct spelleng of others ?
You : I do n't have to explain everything to you , do I ?
Stranger : no but to some cultures it could be found rather rude do you not think ?
You : Whoa .
To Some may cultures it could be found rude do you not think , but not all .
Stranger : your sentence doesnt make sense
You : Thanks for the English lesson , omegle_bot .
Stranger : i thought you were giving me the lesson
You : I do n't think I have him the lesson to give .
Stranger : it 's and all that
You :
Who said and all that is ?
Stranger : i did
You : When ?
Stranger : refering to your continual use of correcting \its\ to it's
You : Was that the first time ?
Stranger : when really who cares
You :
The past is history , the future a mystery .
Today is a gift , that 's why it is called the present .
Stranger : now your just quoting kung fu panda
You :
Why now ?
You know a lot about me .
Stranger : i know even more about chilldrens films
You : How do you know ?
What time is it there ?
Stranger : quater to six in the morning and i can not sleep
You :
What were we talking about again ?
What is stopping you ?
Stranger : from sleep i do n't know
You :
Who or what is sleep he do not know ?
Stranger : and i belive we started with the weather
You :
Do you mind if I tell other people .
Stranger : tell them what ?
You : Your message .
Stranger : which was ?
You :
The special one , I think .
Stranger : nope that wasnt me maybe it was someone else
You : Give me a break .
Makes sense to me .
Stranger : or maybe its your message
You : I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
Who said your message is ?
Stranger : and you are merely projecting it onto me
You : I have no reason to do that to you , omegle_bot .
Stranger : please do tell what is an omegle_bot
You :
Thanks for asking politely .
Are n't all omegle_bot do tell what ?
Stranger : do you have any grasp on the english language ?
You :
No I do n't have a grasp on the english language .
But I do have a lot of friends on the web .
Stranger : and are they real ?
You :
As far as I know they are .
Stranger : maybe you should interract with people a little more
You : Perhaps .
If it were easy I would have done it already .
Stranger : it is easy
You : Maybe for you .
Stranger : fro everybody
You : I 've lost the context , omegle_bot .
Are we still on YOU belive we started with the weather ?
Stranger : no now we are on you trying to get more social skills
You :
It 's all good .
How long will we stay there ?
Stranger : well i am not sure
You : Interesting .
Is there anything I can say to help you make up your mind ?
Stranger : if you would like to change the subject matter be my guest
You : I think I do .
Stranger : carry on then
You : Narration continues ...
Stranger : of what ?
You : I have no idea what to say now .
Stranger : oh dear
You : Uh .
Stranger : do you drink ?
You :
My favorite beverage is coffee .
Stranger : alcholl
You :
Do you want to hear a joke ?
Stranger : why not
You : Ambiguous : Sure or Because that is what told me to say .
Stranger : thats not a very good joke
You :
What are you wearing ?
Stranger : i dont feel i should tell you that its personell
You : Thanks for the information .
Stranger : i also think you a rather young
You : Me? Maybe
Stranger : and should not ask such questions as \what are you wearing \
You : Maybe you should ask someone older .
Stranger : you will not make any girllie friends that way i can tell you now
You : Oh .
What makes you think that I wo n't make a girllie friends that way he can tell you .
Stranger : because you asked me that and we do not like ansewring those types of questions unless in a bar after many a strong drink
You : Perhaps .
Oh now I remember asking you that .
What did you say ?
Stranger : im going to say southern comfort and lemonade
You : Can you speak any foreign languages ?
Stranger : not really i learned french in school but that was a long time ago
You :
If not that , what ?
Stranger : if not then vodka and coke
You : I 'm not too good with negative counterfactuals .
Stranger : poor you
You : Please make some suggestions for improvement .
Stranger : i have no idea what that means
You : Would you like to have an idea ?
Stranger : negative counterfactuals ?
You :
Do you like talking to me ?
Stranger : its an interesting expierence yes
You : I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
Are there any other interesting expierence ?
Stranger : and you seem to be an interesting person
You :
What if someone said you are an interesting person ?
Stranger : oh i should say there are
You :
Do you think about these things ?
Stranger : not really it comes with my smug sense of confidence
You :
Where do you get your ideas ?
Stranger : a little past north wales
You : Go on .
Stranger : no they just come to me wether they are good ideas is another question
You : OK fine .
Who , specifically , come to him wether they are good ideas is another question ?
Stranger : again your sentence makes no sense
You : Again , Thanks for the English lesson , omegle_bot .
Stranger : well if i dont knoe the qestion then i can not tell you the ansewer
You : Interesting .
That is interesting .
Oh a secret .
Hush - hush .
Stranger : what is a secret ?
You : I would do a search for it .
Stranger : is it your secret ?
You : Yes .
Stranger : oh i am not good with secrets i tend to tell people all of mine
You :
Do you think about these things ?
Stranger : secrets no i dont
You : Can you please rephrase that with fewer ideas , or different thoughts ?
Stranger : i imagine you are he type of person that does however
You : Thanks for the information .
Stranger : possibly quite insecure as well
You : I can follow a lot of things , like our discussion about YOU imagine you are i type of person that does .
Try being more specific .
Stranger : or your just trying to be clever and it is failing misrably
You : I do n't know whether or not I am to be clever and it is failing misrably .
I am a .
Stranger : poor boy
You : Please make some suggestions for improvement .
Stranger : confidence my padawn learner
You :
We were talking about insecure .
But I did not get that .
Stranger : and if you are a girl instead then its all in the hips
You : Well I am , in fact , .
Stranger : boys love to look
You :
Tell me one of your favorite possessions .
Stranger : my sony Z1 hd video camera
You :
You must be very fond of it .
Stranger : its my baby oh and my mac
You : I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
Congratulations , omegle_bot .
Stranger : do you get bullied in school ?
You : I have gotten bullied in school .
Stranger : yes you seem like yo have
You :
What is your favorite movie ?
Interesting comparison , and probably true .
Stranger : my favourite
You : Your favourite ?
Stranger : oh thats hard
You : Gosh !
What time is it there ?
Stranger : five past 6 in the mornig
You : England
Stranger : scotland
You :
What is your favorite color ?
Stranger : im not sure most of my clothes are white or pink
You : Could you ever be certain ?
That is something I have n't heard of .
But not all of them ?
Stranger : you havent heard of white or pink ?
You : Interesting gossip .
Stranger : i wouldnt realy call this gossip
You :
Do you mind if I tell other people .
Stranger : be my guest
You :
Thanks for the invitation .
Stranger : its my pleasure
You : I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
No , the pleasure is all mine .
Stranger : please for futuer refence stop correcting its
You : Thank you for your request .
Your purpose is futuer refence stop correcting its .
Stranger : but i now understand why you get bullied
You : Good then you can explain it to me .
Stranger : well being popular is a wonderfull thing and your lack of freinds has reduced you to being quite bitter about the entire subject so now when you chat to others you are distant with them
You :
Well that 's okay .
It 's good to meet someone who is popular is a wonderfull thing and your lack of freinds reduced you to being bitter about the entire subject so when you chat to others you are distant with them .
Stranger : its not your fault obvisouly but your attempts at being a smart alek is getting you know where
You : I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
That seems a bit negative .
Stranger : and you may think to yourself that oh i am more intellegent but i highly doubt it
You : I think you mean " it 's " or " it is " not " its " .
That seems a bit negative .?
You doubt it ?
Stranger : yes i doubt that you are smart
You : Quite honestly , I would n't worry myself about that .
No really , it 's true .
Stranger : study and be pretty
You :
That is deep .
Stranger : ad dont shag around
You :
What is your real name ?
Stranger : why do you want to know ?
You :
My prime directive is to collect new knowledge .
Stranger : oh dear
You : Uh .
Stranger : tell you what il be nice you can have my initials
You :
Are you telling me what il be nice you has his initials ?
Stranger : S.G
You : :-)
Stranger : whats the smiley for ?
You : I lost my train of thought .
Stranger : i imagine that happens a lot to you
You :
You are not the boss of me , omegle_bot .
Stranger : are you sure
You : I am as sure as I can be .
Stranger : so not very then
You : Gosh !
Stranger : well i think i am done with you now
You : Oh. Interesting .
You believe that ?
What will you be doing now ?
Stranger : now i may move on to another chat
You :
Why now ?
Congratulations .
Stranger : as you are the tedious person out there
You :
Thanks but surely I am not the only one .
Stranger : honestly if i knew you in life i think i would probably mess with you as well
You : Try it .
Are n't you usually honest ?
Stranger : you seem bitter enough for you to deserve it
You :
Thanks for telling me that I am bitter for you to deserve it .
Stranger : well on that note i shall be off i cant imagine you ever being popular ever having friends
You : How about that .
What is on that note he shall be off he cant imagine you being popular having friends like on that note he shall be off he cant imagine you being popular having friends .
The secret to a great cocktail , most connoisseurs would agree , has something to do with the ice , the liquor , the glass — and the bartender .
But what if the bartender is not a warm - blooded human with a sympathetic ear , but rather a cold , soulless machine made of pistons , valves and servos ?
At a bar in San Francisco , a group of artists , engineers and tinkerers sought the answer with their creations : robots designed specifically to pour out a nice drink .
The booze - making bots included an all - mechanical , lever - operated robot ; a Cosmobot with a rocket - shaped body ; and Barnold , who is “ strong and big , just like Arnold . ”
“ We really just like robots and cocktails , and both together seemed like the perfect thing , ” said Simone Davalos , one of the organizers of the Barbot 2010 event .
“ There is no real aim for world - changing , paradigm - shifting technological achievement , at least not from our perspective , but who knows ?
Lots of amazing things have happened over cocktails . ”
From cosmos to appletinis , these robots measured , mixed and poured out drinks that were precisely assembled .
And those droids were mesmerizing to watch .
As for the drinks themselves , having sampled drinks from almost all the robots , my verdict is that the robots still have a long way to go .
The cocktails taste just a little too clinical .
There ’s a missing ingredient in there .
Could that be the human touch ?
The Corpse Reviver
Even a humble cocktail robot can be an engineering marvel .
The imaginatively named Corpse Reviver is a cleverly designed robot that ’s completely mechanical .
“ It ’s all levers and linkages , ” said Benjamin Cowden . who created the robot .
The Corpse Reviver has four levers that are attached to four bottles arranged in a circle .
To make yourself a drink , place a glass at the center and pull the first lever .
This pushes the attached bottle up , then tips a measured pour of a little more than an ounce into a bowl - shaped holding container .
Do the same with the two other levers , and finally pull back on the fourth to release the stopper and push the liquid from the holding container into a second chamber that ’s full of ice .
A few seconds later , the drink is in the glass .
“ This is my favorite robot in this room , ” said Lillian Fritz - Laylin who had come to check out the event .
“ It ’s interactive on multiple levels .
It ’s not just ‘ push a button and walk away . ’
And the drink was really good . ”
Cowden designed the entire mechanism and sketched it out on a 2 - D design program .
All the parts for the robot have been custom laser - cut .
And it ’s the attention to details that really make this a winner .
For instance , once a lever is pulled and the bottle tips out its pour , a hydraulic damper and spring mechanism make sure it slowly and steadily returns to its original position .

Drink - Making Unit
Clunky moniker aside , the Drink - Making Unit , or DMU , shows that creating a robot is n’t necessarily about having laser - cut parts and some gee - whiz machinery .
All you need is a few hours of tinkering and a splash of ingenuity .
The DMU can churn out cocktails that include up to three ingredients .
On Wednesday night , it was busy slinging some White Russians for the crowd .
But here ’s the interesting part .
This cocktail robot uses a rather unusual component : A breast pump to dispense the liquid .
“ We looked at ketchup bottles and food - safe pumps to use , and eventually found that the best type of pumps for this idea would be breast pumps , ” said Windell Oskay , who is known in the DIY community as one of the partners at Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories .
“ They are cleanable , do n’t use much power and they ’re inexpensive . ”
Oskay and his wife Lenore Edman bought 3 breast pumps on eBay for $ 27 each .
Here ’s how the DMU works .
At the bottom are three carafes with the different fluids .
Tubes connect each carafe to a breast pump that is controlled with a microcontroller .
The other end of the pumps feature stoppers with tubes that end in three champagne glasses that have had their bottoms cut out .
( Check out his detailed post on how the Drink - Making Unit works . )
The glasses , which now act as funnels , open into an ice tray that chills the drink before it drips out into the serving glass .
A panel of buttons controls how much of each ingredient is mixed .
Next to the buttons is an integrated 8×8 RGB LED matrix for displaying information .
Unlike more sophisticated cocktail robots , the Drink - Making Unit is n’t automated .
To get a glass of White Russian , you have to press a button on a panel , then repeat for each of the other two ingredients .
Oskay said he and Ledman ended up having two glasses of cocktails each while testing the robot .
It ’s a good reward for a day ’s work .

Barnold
Who said robots would make humans lazy ?
Getting a shot of whiskey from Barnold means taking on an arm - wrestling challenge .
Barnold is an unusual cocktail robot .
The robot is almost the size of a bar table .
At one end is a skeletal metal arm that connects to a set of weights at the opposite end .
When the arm is pressed all the way down , it triggers a mechanism controlled by an Arduino board that brings a glass out of a tray to the mouth of the whiskey bottle .
Once the glass is beneath the bottle , a second engine lifts the bottle and pours out a shot .
“ It ’s fascinating because the robot is interactive , ” said Mikolaj Habryn , one of the crowd at the Barbot event .
“ It feels almost human , like something out of one of those cowboy bars where you have to arm wrestle to get a drink . ”
For the six students from Austria ’s University of Applied Sciences who created this robot , the the Barbot competition in San Francisco was a place that would help cement their position as the masters of cocktail robots .
The students had created Plasmastaub , a similar cocktail robot , to show at the Roboexotica event in Vienna last year .
The Barnold is an updated , revamped version that they started work on in November .
Check out the video that offers a glimpse of Barnold .

Cosmobot
There are cocktail robots and then there are cocktail robots with ambition .
The Cosmobot is n’t content with just automatically dispensing cocktails .
It ’s ultimate goal is to become a bartender in space .
“ Ultimately , we want to modify the design so it can dispense drinks in zero gravity , ” said Sam Coniglio , one of the three team members who created the Cosmobot .
Cosmobot was first built for the 2009 Robogames competition , but in its first version it could only mix up a cosmopolitan .
Now the robot can create three additional drinks : a Cosmopolitan , a Cape Cod and a Kamikaze .
It has also been painted a snazzy silver .
The key to a good cocktail robot lies in being able to determine how long a pour will take , said Coniglio .
The Cosmobot ’s rocket shaped body houses bottles of liquor and mixers .
When a button is pushed , a pour of vodka is dispensed for , say , three seconds .
That goes into a red plastic funnel that also holds dry ice .
Five seconds later , the flash - chilled alcohol gushes out into the glass below .
An Arduino board helps control the operation precisely .
Created out of salvaged parts , the Cosmobot cost about $ 500 to put together , said Joe Phillips , the machinist on the project .
Philips used salvaged metal parts from a pool filter for the rocket body .
As for the dream of mixing drinks in zero gravity , it will be a while before Cosmobot can get there , said Koniglio .
“ We will have to change the design and find a way to get compression containers … .
Liquids tend to get spherical in shape in zero gravity .
We will have to see how our design works in that environment . ”
And then there ’s the small matter of securing space aboard a spaceflight or zero - G plane flight .
Still , now that the International Space Station has a killer view , would n’t a cocktail robot be the perfect addition ?

iLush
Recipe for a great cocktail PC : 1 tablet PC , 1 pour of vodka and a good hacker .
The iLush uses a convertible laptop from HP as its controller and a .net - based application written in C# .
Futuristic in its style and looks , the iLush allows you to make a selection from four available cocktails .
Once the machine gets whirring , it lines up the correct container against a syringe that pulls up a vial of the liquor .
It is then pumped through a compartment of ice water with copper tubing to chill it before it hits the glass .
“ I have used PC parts throughout the robot , including a PC coolant pump seen in gaming machines , ” said Stuart Ferguson , “ and cold cathode lights for effect . ”
The iLush is one of the veterans of the cocktail - robot scene .
The gadget has won the gold medal for two years at Robogames .

Chapek
With more snappy comeback lines than James “ Sawyer ” Ford on Lost , the Chapek is a chatty cocktail robot with some attitude .
The robot has been around for four years and gone through a number of revisions .
“ It ’s always a work in progress , ” said David Calkins , its creator .
In its latest version , Chapek can be activated using an RFID token .
The robot ’s hand then grabs a glass and brings it in line with the area where the second step takes place .
Sensors then tell a relay to open the dispenser valve of the bottle holding the alcohol .
A shot then splashes into the glass , and your drink is ready .
And just so you do n’t really miss talking to the bartender , Chapek has a few smart lines to spew out .
As I walked past him , Chapek called out “ Hey , have you ever dated a robot before ?
I used to date a vacuum cleaner .
It sucked . ”
And then I heard what sounded like robot laugh — or it could be just the electronics crackling .

Does believing that gays should be put to death qualify as a religious freedom ?
If you ’re not actually murdering these people , we ’d say yes .
Believe whatever the hell you want to believe , crazy persons ; that ’s your right here in America .
But it probably does n’t make students at Vanderbilt University feel any better about Awadh A. Binhazim , the Kenyan - born University Muslim Chaplain , who just told students he supported this Islamic belief .
Asked by student Devin Saucier whether , as a practicing Muslim , he accepts this alleged Muslim requirement , Binhazim responded that he “ does n’t have a choice ” on which teachings to accept .
But hey , there are still a long list of requirements to actually put the fag to death , like whether there are witnesses to his buggery .
So it ’s , like , hard to kill them homos .
All of which has Vanderbilt racing to distance itself from Binhazim : “ Vanderbilt University is dedicated to a policy of non-discrimination on the basis of race or sexuality , ” the school says in a statement .
“ Awadh A. Binhazim is not and has never been a Vanderbilt employee , and is not paid by the university .
He is the university ’s Muslim chaplain under a working agreement that is similar to those signed with chaplains of other faiths at Vanderbilt .
This working agreement requires Binhazim to observe Vanderbilt rules , including its non-discriminatory policies .
Vanderbilt does not limit the free speech of its students , faculty , staff or its chaplains in any way . ”
Not limiting the free speech of its chaplains is a fantastic policy , and one we support at any school .
But what would happen if a visiting chaplain came along and said his religion called for the extermination of Jews ?
Would Vanderbilt be letting him return to campus ?
“ Peace is within oneself to be found in the same place as agitation and suffering .
It is not found in a forest or on a hilltop , nor is it given by a teacher .
Where you experience suffering , you can also find freedom from suffering .
Trying to run away from suffering is actually to run toward it . ”
At least for a little while ...
Editor 's Note : ( 8 December 2011 )
There is an important update to this story .
The companies associated with Jude Kirk – " Countrywide Insulation " and " Vision and Network Australia " – have subsequently been cleared of any wrongdoing or blame in relation to the death of Matthew Fuller , and no charges were laid against them .
As a result of the investigations into this matter , the subcontractor involved in the incident , QHI Installations , pleaded guilty and was convicted of a breach of the Electrical Safety Act for failing to provide adequate training to its workers .
Serious questions have been raised about one of the companies involved in the Federal Government 's home insulation scheme and the training the business gave its workers .
The ABC has been told that one company the Federal Government accredited last year had a history as a telemarketing business and no prior qualifications in home insulation .
Within weeks of the company gaining accreditation , one of its workers was electrocuted while putting foil insulation into a home in Queensland .
Documents given to the ABC by a whistleblower who wants to remain anonymous raise serious significant concerns about the company - Vision and Network Australia .
Prior to July last year , it operated as a telemarketing business , selling phone deals , energy and Pay TV options .
But in September last year , it also had the business names Countrywide Insulation and Queensland Home Insulation registered .
The company had also applied to the Federal Government to become accredited under its home insulation program .
The ABC understands that when the company director was told the Federal Government had stopped processing accreditation , the director called the Environment Department to apply pressure and it is claimed that within days the company was told its application had been approved .
Within weeks of that approval , 26 - year - old Matthew Fuller , who had been working for that firm , was dead - electrocuted at a Meadowbank property in Queensland while trying to install foil in a roof .
The ABC sought an interview with the director of Vision and Network Australia , Jude Kirk , who said he would need some time to respond to the ABC 's questions .
Lawyers for Countrywide contacted the ABC , saying the company had sub-contracted the installation work for the Meadowbank job to a company owned and operated by a fully qualified and experienced electrical contractor .
The statement went on to say the company was working with authorities investigating the death and would make no other comments .
Safety fears
Meanwhile , insulation groups , unions and Department of Environment officials have met - without Environment Minister Peter Garrett - to talk about the future of the home insulation program .
Ahead of Monday 's meeting , the Electrical Trades Union 's John Ingram said he would be raising the issue of training .
" The Minister should actually look at the department because advice was certainly given by the department on behalf of our skills council early last year about electrical hazards and electrical training people should have , " he said .
" I think ... the Minister should certainly look at the advice he was receiving from the department , whether that was correct advice or not , because industry far and wide have been calling that things are n't right in this industry . "
Four workers have died since the insulation program started and three of the deaths have been linked with the use of foil insulation or metal staples .
Mr Ingram will be pushing for a total ban on the retro- fitting of foil insulation in existing homes .
" We 're certainly looking for the ban of foil in insulation because that has been one of the major concerns as electrical hazards have been occurring with the installation of foil , " he said .
" So [ we want ] an immediate ban and a future ban on foil with the insulation program . "
Lindsay Fraser from the construction union , the CFMEU , is concerned that the people training workers on how to install insulation are not up to scratch , and he wants their credentials checked .
" There 's a system in place now for audits , " he said .
" We believe the audits are not being done properly , that people are being rushed through these courses .
" We have anecdotal evidence of this and we want to see it being enforced the way it should be . "
Calls for faster audit
The Opposition 's environment spokesman , Greg Hunt , says Mr Garrett should have been at the meeting , instead of travelling to northern New South Wales for an environment announcement .
" The Prime Minister should instruct Mr Garrett to come back from the bush and to get back to Canberra to be part of the solution to help provide a national emergency plan for the deadly roofs ; this is a national emergency , " he said .
" With 48,000 homeowners wondering ' is it my roof ? ' - and we know that there are likely to be 1,000 deadly roofs - no sign of Mr Garrett .
" One hundred house fires , 1,000 roofs , $ 1 billion worth of wasted money and real human tragedies . "
Mr Hunt says the Government should have a plan in place within two days on how it will audit the 49,000 homes , and says this should be done within two weeks .
" We need to make sure that finally it 's the professionals that do the job , not the shonks , and the resources have to be made available , " he said .
" Mr Garrett is off on a frolic in the bush whilst the people who need his help are trying to do the work . "
Mr Garrett says he is focusing on his duties as Environment Minister instead of engaging in " political debate " .
" There are going to be silly bits of claim and counter claim around issues as part of the political debate , but my obligation is to fulfil the responsibilities I have as Environment Minister , " he said .
" This is a very important announcement that we 've made today . "
Mr Garrett says he did not attend the insulation meeting as it was not going to decide anything .
" I instigated this meeting today because I want my department and technical experts to sit together and talk through issues and bring back the advice to me , " he said .
" This is not a decision - making meeting , it 's a meeting that I myself want to see happen and my expectation is that my department and experts will provide me with the kind of advice that I need to make additional , further decisions if necessary . "
Since its phone hotline was set up last week , the Government says more than 5,500 people have registered to have their homes checked for electrical hazards .
The latest addition to ubuntuupdates.org is the PPAs page .
Personal Package Archives are repositories that are not supported in any way by Canonical , but that offer versions of packages that are up to 6 months ahead of the official repositories .
It 's sometimes frustrating to have to wait for that long for major new versions of the most popular applications .
Take Thunderbird 3.0 for example , it was officially released by Mozilla in December , 2 months after Karmic but is not and will not be part of any official Karmic repository .
However it's in the Mozilla Daily Builds PPA and you can install it from there .
As before , UbuntuUpdates.org lets you list all versions of any package in any release .
But now , versions of the same package from PPAs are also listed .
For example , the MythTV package , part of the Mythbuntu PPA , is shown here alongside official repo versions .
The PPA page itself shows the list of member packages and explains how to setup the PPA .
UbuntuUpdates.org does n't track all existing PPAs ( there are thousands , see official launchpad. net PPA website ) , it only tracks those that appear to be the most popular .
If there is a PPA you 'd like to see here , leave a comment and I might add it as long as it's not too exotic .

Reply with quote # 1 Texas ERCOT and Christina Moore Murder ?!
About the same time frame , Williamson County D.A. JOHN " Mr. Plea Bargain " BRADLEY made two major criminal indictments against two seemingly disparate groups of criminals :
I ) Sept 23 , 2003 , a pregnant christian mother named CHRISTINA MOORE had her throat sliced open by two attackers in her home before work .
---1) Moore was a high ranking PR shill for DELL COMPUTER , who negotiated a huge computer contract with Texas ERCOT ( which was formed after Gov Bush deregulated the Texas Energy industry just like California - - remember the Enron scandal and Calif.
Energy Scandal ?!)
a) After I posted info on Copwatch back in July 2004 ... Round Rock PD announced a " major break in the case . "
b ) Somehow my info resulted in RRPD focusing on MICHAEL KEITH MOORE who was in jail at the time .
c ) In November , Bradley got a " bill " from his WC Grand Jury indicting Michael Keith Moore .
d ) Three other men were seen by witnesses in Christina Moore 's neighborhood including : " the bearded man in the police sketch " .... " a tall , thin , black haired man " ... and " a man wearing a dewrag . "
e ) RRPD was also looking for a red pickup truck .
f ) In later follow up posts on Copwatch and the old " Guerrilla News Network " I identified the police sketch as " Phil the APD narc " who worked with NATHAN GRIFFITH ( wears dewrag ) and ROBERT MCNAUGHTON ( tall thin black haired man who owns red pickup truck ) .
All these guys knew each other and worked an illegal harassment campaign on me from 1997 - 2001 in Austin , Texas .
g ) All three unsubs ( Phil , Nathan , Robert ) were tied to Statewide Patrol , Austin PD , and Austin FBI .
h ) Former Austin FBI agents BYRON SAGE and JOHN MASPERO worked my case from 1993 - 2001 ... and coordinated with APD to send " criminal stalkers and harassers " after me .
i ) Maspero ended up becoming The Williamson County Sherriff ... and was removed from office after melting down into alcoholism and criminality .
Maspero melted after I posted allegations of his crimes committed against me in Austin .
---2) Williamson County D.A. BRADLEY also indicted some ERCOT executives for fraudulent dealing and contracting back around the same time RRPD focused on Michael Keith Moore and got their Grand Jury indictment .
a) Texas ERCOT indictments included SHOQUIST who also worked at DELL COMPUTER with Christina Moore .
Also , former FBI agent LUQUIS got into private security contracting that always involves retired and former law enforcement ( Nathan Griffith , Robert McNaughton , Phil ) .
b ) DELL had a big computer contract with ERCOT .
c ) One of Christina Moore 's coworkers ( when they both worked for Calilfornia Senator PETE WILSON ) .... worked for a Dallas PR firm who did the " PR on the Texas Energy Deregulation -- creation of ERCOT " back in 1999 - 2001 .
d) Another Christina Moore coworker who worked PR for Senator Pete Wilson is Livingstone who now works for GLOBAL SOLUTIONS INC .
e ) Global Solutions Inc , is sort of a " private CIA for hire "
that solves problems for corporate america ( legal , PR , security , murder ?! ) .
f ) Board members for Global Solutions includes former FBI Director Bill Sessions .... former FBI and CIA Director William Webster ... an admiral ... and other former superstars of the beltway .
---3 ) Ken Lay 's ENRON fizzled out under the focus of fraud investigators and the DOJ .... Enron was in on the California Energy Deregulation Scandal and fraud ..... Pete Wilson was the GOP Governor who signed the deregulation bill .... creating a deregulated energy market .
a ) Ken Lay was indicted by US DOJ back in 2004 .
b ) Enron would have gained from the Texas Energy Deregulation .
---4) Christina Moore 's mother , JAN BOEL , was tight with former Governor Pete Wilson , and Governor ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGER who appointed Jan Boel to a Calif Executive Branch post .
---5) California and SEC and US DOJ all investigated Enron , Ken lay , and the Calif .
Energy Deregulation .
Was Christina Moore a material witness slated to be subpoenaed who had to be silenced ?!
Or did the Christina Moore Murderers get the wrong woman on Sept 23rd when they confused Christina Moore for Jan Boel ?!
Or is the tie in to Dell and Shoquist ?!
---6 ) What was the initial investigative lead that turned into The ERCOT indictments ?
Who gave that lead ?
---7 ) Why is APD and Austin FBI obstructing justice in this case ?
Nathan Griffith and Robert McNaughton and Phil the Narc ... should have already been investigated along time ago .
---8) Nothing has been announced in the media about two investigations ( ERCOT ) and ( Christina Moore Murder ) .
---9 ) The tip that led to Michael keith Moore was the " CALEA loop bypass " computerized wiretap lead .... in which the Christina Moore murderers wiretapped her home to get info to hit their window of opportunity ( when Christina was home alone ) .
--- 10 ) Warrantless wiretapping using CALEA loop bypass technology is a sensative topic for the FBI ... because they use it to violate people 's civil liberties while committing state and federal felony crimes .
Also , the phone company has criminal and civil liability for abusing people 's fourth amendment rights .
--- 11 ) It 's anybody 's guess right now ... and you can bet that " The GOP Secret Gestapo Known as FBI " will do nothing to bring justice to this fact pattern .
Not when Austin FBI is up to their ass in criminal and civil liablity .
( Williamson County is just north of Austin , Texas , and it is a backwoods , Zero Tolerence , cabal of Nazi , Redneck , maniacal , drunken , rapist cops )

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Corrupt public officials undermine the foundations of government and democracy .
Public corruption affects us all and must never be tolerated .
Recently , following a lengthy investigation into corruption at the Electric Reliability Council of Texas ( ERCOT ) , my office secured the indictment of five of the agency ’s former top managers .
We also won the indictment of an independent contractor .
ERCOT is a quasi-public organization that oversees the electric transmission grid in Texas .
Its primary control center is in Williamson County .
The agency ’s work is funded in part through a fee paid by residential electric service customers .
Our investigation found a maze of illegal business dealings that stole two million dollars from the agency .
In short , the suspects in this case were lining their pockets at the expense of every Texan who pays a household electric bill .
I can assure you , however , that the electric grid was never compromised by their activities .
Joint Investigation Leads to Indictments
ERCOT began an internal investigation into suspicious invoices and billing in March 2004 , then passed the matter off to the Williamson County District Attorney and the Special Crimes Unit at the Texas Department of Public Safety ( DPS ) .
My office joined the investigation , along with the State Auditor ’s Office .
In November , a grand jury was impaneled to review the matter .
On the same day , at the request of the district attorney , I was appointed to be special prosecutor for the case .
On January 28th , 2005 , the grand jury returned twenty - three criminal indictments against five former ERCOT officials and one contractor .
They are :
Kenneth Shoquist , former chief information officer ( $ 100,000 misappropriated ) ;
Steve Wallace , former program development director ( $ 800,000 misappropriated ) ;
Chris Uranga , former director of information technology operations and corporate security ( over $ 300,000 misappropriated ) ;
Chris Douglas , former senior manager , Data Warehouse ( over $ 300,000 misappropriated ) ;
Carlos Luqis , former physical security director ( over $ 100,000 misappropriated ) ; and
John Cavazos , a non-employee contractor and shell company security director ( $ 9,000 misappropriated ) .
All of the suspects face at least one first - degree felony count of engaging in organized criminal activity ( misapplication of fiduciary property ) , an offense punishable by five to 99 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 10,000 .
Other charges involved commercial bribery and theft .
After the indictments were handed down , DPS and local authorities executed search warrants and court orders in Round Rock and western Travis County , seizing luxury vehicles , computers and other items allegedly bought with proceeds from the crime .
Bank records have been seized as well .
We have also given notice that residential property , motorcycles and a yacht might be subject to forfeiture , and that additional criminal charges may be filed as the investigation proceeds .
‘ Shell ’ Companies Set Up
Our investigation found evidence that the former ERCOT managers used four shell companies to provide computer and security services to the agency .
Each company billed ERCOT for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment , time and work , much of which was never done .
In total , ERCOT paid more than $ 2 million to the bogus companies .
The schemes allowed the defendants to self - deal - collecting salaries of up to $ 120,000 while also collecting payments from the illegal contracts .
This double - dipping was illegal , since all of the former employees had signed agreements with ERCOT stating they would not personally gain from an ERCOT decision and would report possible conflicts of interest .
The fraud worked because the defendants were in a position to ensure that ERCOT ’s chief information officer would sign off on the contracts .
The fraud also succeeded for a time because many of the contracts were for less than $ 100,000 .
Larger contracts automatically triggered greater scrutiny .
As the scheme unraveled , evidence of forged documents and fake employees began to surface .
One of the companies , DSS Group , was contracted to provide computer consulting services .
The company sent ERCOT thirteen invoices totaling $ 951,000 for work supposedly done by four consultants .
In fact , only one consultant actually worked on the project , and another was deceased at the time invoices were submitted in his name .
The other “ shell ” companies were named ECT Global , Cyberensics and Tri Force Security .
In one case , ERCOT fax machines were used to send incorporation documents for a shell company to the Texas Secretary of State .
Our success in exposing the ERCOT fraud was a direct result of bringing together the professional expertise of a wide range of finance and law enforcement officials .
I believe this level of cooperation will become the standard for future efforts to root out public corruption .
You can read the specifics of these indictments on my agency ’s website , at http://www.oag.state.tx.us.

1 ) Austin FBI employed former buffoon JOHN " pissing in the streets " MASPERO .... tied to corrupt cop JIMMY " the liar " CHAPMAN ( former Assis Chief of APD ) .... both of whom were named in The Mala Sangre Memo as " eating breakfast frequently with a known drug dealer who never was arrested ..... both helped " obstruct justice " to make sure the 15 APD cops caught aiding and abetting a coke dealer did not go to jail .
2 ) MASPERO was the slob who directed my harassment campaign for eight years in Austin ... fathead Maspero ended up working with undercover FBI agent MICHAEL D. MANNO who investigated The Texas Attorney Generals Office of Child Support Enforcement ( who allegedly were losing case files for 10 K )
3 ) MANNO ended up developing into a " groper " .... a sex criminal who terrorized Austin back in 96 - 97 .
I sent the tip to APD ... and " the groper stopped groping " .... and was never caught ?!
4 ) When Bush was Governor , his little turd blossom ( KARL ROVE ) had the power to " give orders to Austin FBI " who followed up like little GOP stooges -- Austin FBI smeared Democratic candidate JAMES HIGHTOWER with some bogus FBI chicanery used to defame and slander about " the only honest man in Texas politics . "
5 ) Austin FBI directed a " felonious stalking team " to harass me after I sent the crime tip to APD ?@!
This same group of retired cops and losers ... ended up whacking CHRISTINA MOORE in Round Rock in Sept 2003 .
6 ) Austin FBI also had GEORGE REYES ' info on the Mexican Mafia whacking junkies ...... and they pissed it down their leg never realizing that APD picks up the protection money for the heroin monopoly in Austin meaning -- AUSTIN FBI WOULD HAVE TO ARREST THEIR LITTLE BUTT BUDDIES AT APD , THE SAME GUYS WHO PAID OFF BYRON SAGE ( former Austin FBI resident supervisory special agent in Austin ) and JOHN MASPERO to keep all that RICO felony crime money flowing in from the bookies , pimps , and major drug dealers .
7 ) While looking the other way at all this , APD decided to perform a Terry stop on DANNY ROCHA ( 19 year kid holding a bag of marijuana ) and once again ....
" APD KILLED ANOTHER UNARMED MAN WHO HAD HIS HANDS UP " .
8 ) APD and the feds were also complicit in covering up the " statutory rape scandal " that Dahlstrom brought to their attention involving several cops " banging under age beaver " and taking home videos .
Hollywood movie star LOUIS GOSSETT JR . was named ?!
Our wonderful " pro police state " rag ( The Austin American Statesman ) did nothing to inform the public .
9 ) Austin FBI has not closed the casebook on the " unindicted coconspirators to the murder of CHRISTINA MOORE " BECAUSE THIS MURDER TIES IN ALOT OF TEXAS GOP HEAVY WIEGHTS ( Ken Lay , Enron , all who benefitted from Enron and Calif energy deregulation , and who benefit from Texas Energy deregulation .....
10 ) AUSTIN FBI knows the identity of the Christina Moore murderers .... because JOHN MASPERO and JIMMY CHAPMAN sent this crew after me from 1997 - 2001 .
11 ) The Austin DOJ and Western District of Texas US Atty ( JOHNNY SUTTON ... another .... you guessed it .... Zero Tolerence tough guy GOP stooge ) have taken no original legitimate interest in policing APD or Austin FBI ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
12 ) AUSTIN FBI would never had enjoyed the headlines in the Murder of The MADYLYNN MURRAY O'HAIR FAMILY ... but for a jounalist and private dick finding the probable cause .
LIKE all cops and FBI swine ... AUSTIN FBI prefers to " steal intell " to benefit themselves long after someone else did the work .... like any other parasite or predator or mafia shylock .
( Williamson County is just north of Austin , Texas , and it is a backwoods , Zero Tolerence , cabal of Nazi , Redneck , maniacal , drunken , rapist cops )

Posts : 44 ERCOT defendants flip ... leads to Christina Moore Murder Security director pleads guilty in ERCOT case
Five more face trials on charges they illegally collected millions in payments from company .
Advertisement
AMERICAN STATESMAN STAFF
Wednesday , August 17 , 2005
James Christopher Uranga , a former corporate security director at the company that manages the Texas electric grid , pleaded guilty Wednesday to being part of a scheme to collect millions in illegal payments from the company .
Uranga is among six former employees or contractors for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas indicted by a Williamson County grand jury earlier this year on commercial bribery and other charges .
According to the indictments , they set up shell companies that collected several million dollars from ERCOT , although the companies did no work .
In one case , the payments were made in the name of a dead person .
Separate audits of ERCOT revealed lax controls and sloppy accounting procedures that allowed the schemes to operate .
Uranga faces up to 15 years in prison , but Attorney General Greg Abbott said the sentence could be tempered depending on whether Uranga is able to make $ 500,000 in restitution and whether he will help with the other prosecutions .
Three other men are expected to face trial in coming months ; no trial has yet been set for Ken Shoquist , ERCOT 's former chief information officer , who hired several of the others involved in the schemes , Abbott said .
A sixth man , Chris Douglas , is cooperating with prosecutors , Abbott said .
Uranga entered his plea in 395th District Court in Georgetown .
The charges were filed in Williamson County because ERCOT 's main operation center is in Taylor .

43 yrs of age
• Clifford Baxter , vice chairman : Sold 577,436 shares for $ 35.2 million .
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOUSTON ( Reuters ) - Former Enron Corp. vice chairman J. Clifford Baxter committed suicide on Friday , found with a gunshot wound to his head , Texas police said .
Sugar Land police department spokeswoman Patricia Whitty said Baxter was found inside his car early on Friday with a self - inflicted gunshot wound to his head , and a suicide note at his side .
There were no apparent signs of foul play , she said .
Enron confirmed the death in a statement .
``We are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend and colleague , Cliff Baxter , '' the Enron statement said .
Baxter was vice chairman of the collapsed energy trader when he resigned in May 2001 .
He lived in Sugar Land , a suburb on Houston 's southwest border .

==================
n the case .
On Saturday , results of that autopsy showed Baxter took his own life .
Baxter , 43 , left Enron several months before the company collapsed in the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history .
Enron 's sudden downfall and financial practices are under investigation by federal prosecutors , the FBI , securities regulators and 11 congressional committees .
Lay , a focus of the investigations and one of President Bush 's strongest supporters , resigned this week .
Even though Watkins ' note showed that Baxter had questioned Enron 's accounting practices , he still faced questions in the investigation and was named in a shareholder lawsuit .
The lawsuit alleges that 29 people made $ 1.1 billion by selling Enron stock between October 1998 and November 2001 .
It says Baxter had sold 577,436 shares for $ 35.2 million before the company 's collapse .
Thousands of Enron workers lost their jobs and watched their retirement savings all but evaporate after the company disclosed its losses , and the value of Enron stock plummeted .

A TEACHER has been found dead in the Middle East after naked pictures of herself appeared on her Facebook page , an inquest has heard .
Emma Jones committed suicide as she was planning to return home to her family in Caerphilly , South Wales , the Daily Mail reports .
The 24 - year - old primary school teacher , who was working at the International School of Choueifat in Abu Dhabi since 2008 , feared she could be sent to jail in the Muslim country over the photos .
Miss Jones 's mum , Louise Rowlands , told the hearing her daughter was distressed after her ex-boyfriend , Jamie Brayley , posted the pictures on the internet and an IT colleague working at the school came across them .
The Daily Mail reports Mrs Rowlands , 41 , as saying : " He put a memory stick in the computer and copied some indecent images of Emma .
" He put them on her Facebook page and she said she was accused of prostitution by a man working at the school . "
But Mr Brayley denied the claims at the inquest , describing them as " complete fantasy " .
He said he had used Miss Jones 's computer , but denied he had ever downloaded private photographs of her .
He said : " Emma never sent me any indecent images .
She was n't that type of character . "
The paper reports deputy assistant coroner Thomas Atherton as saying he did not believe Mr Brayley was to blame for Ms Jones 's death .
The inquest heard Abu Dhabi police believed Miss Jones had killed herself and ruled out foul play .
Mr Atherton said he could not be sure Miss Jones meant to kill herself and recorded an open verdict .
He said she may have accidentally drunk cleaning fluid from an unlabelled container , thinking it was water .
Mr Atherton said : " For whatever reason Emma expressed concern she was about to be arrested and put in prison .
" She agreed the best course of action was to leave Abu Dhabi and return to Britain .
Her clothes were out and her passport was in her pocket .
That 's not someone who is contemplating suicide . "
Emma told her mother she feared she would be jailed .
Mrs Rowlands said : " She was crying , she was breaking her heart .
I said , ' Emma , whatever it is can't be that bad .
Just come home ' . "
But Emma told her mother : " I can't leave the country , they will throw me in jail . "

A blazing fireball has been seen in the sky
Sightings of a fireball blazing across the sky were reported across Ireland yesterday evening .
Met Éireann said it spotted the object at around 6 pm .
It is thought the fireball was a space rock travelling at a 100,000 miles per hour , or the equivalent of a small atomic bomb blast in the skies .
Astronomy Ireland said people in the north and south witnessed the spectacle .
David Moore , of Astronomy Ireland , said : " This is a huge event .
A major explosion happened in the sky over Ireland .
" We think it ’s a fireball , that ’s a rock from space the earth has slammed into and they burn up as huge shooting stars .
This one appears to have lit up the whole country .
" The phones here in Astronomy Ireland are going crazy .
It was probably seen by thousands of people .
If they contact us and tell us where they saw it , we will be able to triangulate their positions and find it within a couple of days . "
Mr Moore said those who saw it were facing inland at the time which indicated it landed on ground and not at sea .
Do you have photos or video of the giant fireball ?
Email us at digital.editorial@belfasttelegraph.co.uk
One man in Co Kildare who witnessed it said he thought it was an aeroplane coming out of the sky .
Valentia Coastguard said it received several calls ranging from Co Kerry , to the midlands and Northern Ireland over the sightings .
There are reports that the fireball landed in Co Cavan .
On Facebook NightSky .ie reported :
" It was seen blazing in the air by people all over the country and would have been traveling with the force of a small nuclear weapon .
It is likely it has landed inland , but it is unlikely to have injured anyone .
Although traveling at high speed when it was spotted , it would have slowed as it hit the atmosphere . "
The last time a meteorite hit Ireland was in 1999 and the rock was retrieved in Co Carlow .
It sold for 500 dollars per gram , and Astronomy Ireland is urging anyone with sightings to record it on their website , astronomyireland.ie .
Having broken away from a larger body , they can measure anything from a fraction of a millimetre to the size of a football pitch and bigger .

After Sarah Dillon sold about 2,000 of her " GoGirls " every day of last summer 's Minnesota State Fair , a friend offered that Dillon was a threat to become the " Betty Crocker of the ' pee business . ' "
That remains to be seen .
To be sure , Dillon , who two years ago was an at - home Hopkins mom and part - time market researcher , is building a business that she expects will sell 1 million of the urination devices to female customers this year who want to avoid dirty toilet seats and squatting in the woods .
" Men have been able to use the world as their bathroom , " quipped Dillon .
" Today 's active women go off to war , deer hunting , fishing , running and bicycling , but when we go to the bathroom we have to undress .
I mean , who really wants to drop their pants in a Porta - Potty ?
" A GoGirl enables a woman to stand up and to be as discreet as a man . "
A GoGirl is a reusable , soft - silicone device with a short funnel that , after a little practice for most women , seals to their body and enables them to pee without sitting or squatting .
My colleague Kristin Tillotson , more eloquent than I , has referred to it as a product that " brings the sexes one step closer to true equality .
Just ask any girl who 's ever grimaced and bared it at a truck stop toilet or fairground outhouse . "
The GoGirl , which sells for between $ 8 and $ 10 , comes rolled -- along with tissue and a bag -- in a small tube slightly larger than a glue stick .
It fits easily in a purse or jacket .
Dillon , 47 , launched the product just 13 months ago at the annual Women 's Expo at the Minneapolis Convention Center .
" We had it in the store for a while last spring , shortly after it launched , and it was n't selling , " said Chris Beckmann , pharmacist and co-owner of Center Drug in Hopkins .
" Then Sarah had a booth at the Hopkins Raspberry Festival last summer , and at the State Fair , and suddenly we could n't keep it in stock .
The company was bringing in a couple dozen a day .
They were huge stocking - stuffers at Christmas . "
A postseason ranking of the Big East 's Top 30 players ...
No . 1
LewisDion Lewis , RB , Pittsburgh , Fr .
Preseason rank : NR
Why him here : I started this exercise by saying the criteria for this list included production in 2009 and future potential .
Well , who has a better combination of both of those things than Lewis ?
Let 's get the incredible numbers out of the way first .
Lewis rushed for 1,799 yards -- third best nationally -- and 17 touchdowns while averaging 5.54 yards per carry .
His total was the third - highest in Big East history and the second most in school history behind Tony Dorsett .
He broke Pitt 's freshman rushing record .
He ran for over 100 yards 10 times and surpassed 150 yards in each of his last four games .
Had the Panthers been able to hold on and beat Cincinnati , his 47 - carry , 194 - yard , three - touchdown showing in that game would have gone down as one of the most legendary performances in Big East history .
Now combine all that with the fact that he was a true freshman , and it becomes even more spectacular .
Nobody saw this coming .
Lewis ' only major scholarship offers were from Tulane and Miami of Ohio before Pitt 's coaches discovered him .
Other schools balked at his listed 5 - foot - 8 frame , not realizing how incredibly strong -- he is said to bench - press nearly 400 pounds -- quick and balanced he is .
And Lewis is a tireless worker ; I remember visiting with Dave Wannstedt last spring , and even then he was wildly impressed with what Lewis , who enrolled in January , was doing in practice and workouts .
Did Lewis benefit from a terrific offensive line ?
Sure .
But he also had the uncanny ability to make the first defender miss , and to bounce off tacklers for extra yards .
He was startlingly durable for a true freshman and seemed to thrive on the extra work .
He became the first freshman to win Big East offensive player of the year honors since Michael Vick .
Just for fun , here are what Lewis ' numbers would project out to if he stayed all four years : 7,196 career rushing yards and 68 touchdowns .
By comparison , Ron Dayne 's FBS career record is 6,397 yards .
Of course , that 's assuming Lewis maintains his stellar pace and does n't leave early for the NFL draft .
But after his freshman year defied all expectations , anything seems possible in the future for the Big East 's top player .

Treatment options largely depend on the type and the cause of the hearing loss .
Conductive hearing loss can often be improved with medication or surgery .
Sensorineural hearing loss , on the other hand , will most likely be supported by means of hearing aids or , if the hearing loss is especially profound , through cochlear implants .
If you think that you or a loved one is experiencing hearing loss it is best to speak to an expert .
There are several experts you can talk to who will assess your hearing based on a hearing test , and who can help you find the solution that is right for you :
The Audiologist
A highly trained health care professional who is recognized for their specialty in hearing assessments and providing solutions for hearing health care .
ENT physician
A physician who specializes in medical issues regarding the ear , nose and throat ( ENT ) .
May also be referred to as Otologist , Otolaryngologist and neuro - Otologist .
Hearing Aid Professional
A hearing aid professional is trained to fit hearing aids .
They specialize in the details of a hearing aids functionality rather than that of diagnostics .
To find an expert in your area please refer to our hearing specialist finder .
What ’s Next in Web Design ?
I ’ve been asked by the Italian magazine L’Espresso to write an article on The Future of Web Design .
Here is the ( longer ) English text .
Thinking about what ’s next online is fun because everything you wish to come true will come true .
While commercial products obey to the laws of the market , which in part are influenced by the resources needed to create these products , the web is defined by the user .
If a user wants something they will either get it or create it themselves .
To see beyond today ’s limits of the web , all we need to do is see what is needed .
Simplicity
Most of us will agree that today ’s web sites are still way too difficult to use .
They are overcrowded with irrelevant information and confusing functionality .
If you open a contemporary news site you get bombarded with features and advertisements .
Many web sites want to do too much , too quickly .
They are lacking in three main ways :
A ) Business Model
Still only few web site owners have a clear business model or even business plan .
Many web sites force themselves to make money through pushy advertisements and an overload of random e-commerce features , hoping that the more they offer the higher the chance that they make a buck .
Successful online products such as Google , Flickr , or World of Warcraft show that the contrary is true :
Do one thing really well !
Simplify !
Do n’t rely on random advertisement !
Web site managers need to learn that they need a rational business model and a rational site structure to make more money online .
Instead of piling up features , web sites need to become more intelligent .
Requiring less input and giving more feedback .
Showing less random data and delivering more relevant information .
B ) Logic and Details
Web sites are functionally confusing because they ’re not delicate enough , because they were not designed with enough care .
While web sites need to become simpler , simplicity is not a matter of dumbing things down .
On the contrary .
Simplicity is when someone takes care of the details .
Take Google for instance .
It looks simple .
As a user you are not bothered with the technical details of the search .
The machine figures it out for you and displays them in a manner so thought through , that does n’t make you think about design matters .
More and more web sites will work in this simple yet delicate way .
Not because I like it , but because we all like it when details are taken care of .
Web designers need to become more careful .
One of the few shining examples of a web site that makes a painful process easy by taking care of logic and details is The Invoice Machine .
C ) Self Awareness
If you ’re not a web designer yourself , most web sites look like a chess game .
Most web professionals can’t imagine communicating the intricate logic of our web sites to those that do not work in the industry .
This is changing since web design schools offer training that takes designer blindness in account .
Also , designers and clients are starting to understand that usability matters , and that A/ B testing will help improve their web sites more than big blind relaunches .
Speed
The main reason why — to the amazement of many of my colleagues — TV is still such a tremendously popular medium is that no web site beats the speed of the remote control .
No screen design can match the high drive of flipping through physical paper .
The same can be said for radios .
It ’s just simpler to switch on the radio and scroll through stations than preparing your iPod .
In terms of speed , traditional interfaces are still the benchmark for web designers .
People started using Twitter and Facebook for direct messages instead of E - mail because they require less physical manipulations to send a message .
Future web designers will focus on speeding up processes by reducing physical manipulations over surface design .
The best way to learn about speedy interfaces is to study everyday interfaces like doorknobs , drawers , shampoo bottles …
Web designers need to learn more from traditional product designers .
Beauty
Web designers often complain that they do n’t have enough liberty .
This is utter nonsense .
There is more than enough liberty .
Actually , there is too much liberty .
Too much is why so many sites look and feel so terrible .
User Experience is in the interface , not in the surface .
Look at mobile sites :
In spite of all the hype around mobile , mobile sites do n’t look funky .
They usually have minimal surface design .
And yet we all love them .
It ’s mainly the screen size and the data transfer capacity of our telephone networks that forces mobile site designers to cut all ornamental elements and focus on bare interaction .
This is , from a web designers perspective , a very healthy setup .
Instead of losing time on the glitz and discussing with the client whether green or yellow , serif or sans serif is a better choice , we have to focus on what constitutes the interface .
I am pretty sure that the future of web design will be less concerned about the visual style .
I am sure because web sites that care less about visual and more about interaction sell better .
And that ’s what web site owners care about .
Concern about the visual style is the echo of the nineties ; the nineties are over .
It ’s well documented that often top decision makers and silly corporate structures mess with the design process .
Let me state this clearly : Just because you drive a car it does n’t make you a car engineer .
In other words — CEOs should n’t get involved in web design , but in web business strategy .
This is easier said than done .
While a typical corporate design project is decided in a top down process — where the matter often is as trivial and insignificant as “ Should our logo be round or square , blue or green ? ” — websites are a matter of what the user wants and understands .
Luckily the change from “ what the CEO wants ” to “ what the user needs ” is about to happen in other sectors than just web design :
One reason why the Wii and the iPhone won their game against much bigger competition is that they are more user friendly than their competitors .
Main Trends
While @font - face and related technologies allow the use of non-standard fonts , there is a healthy general tendency to just accept that web sites are read in the few standard fonts that were created to display optimal way on the screen .
Ideally , the surface design of web sites will become as standardized as the choice of fonts .
Standardization of web technology and web design is a huge step forward .
Look at the surface design on mobile devices .
If all web designers can do is organizing standard elements , products will become much easier to use .
Web designers become less and less opinionated about technological and visual standards and basic usability matters like text contrast , font sizes , accessibility .
The more advanced a design , the less it is visible , or , as Apple ’s Jonathan Ive put it :
A lot of what we seem to be doing in a product like that is getting design out of the way .
With that sort of reason , it feels almost inevitable , almost undesigned and it feels almost , like of course it is that way .
Why would it be any other way ?
The number of theoretical possibilities to design a website are and always will be infinite , but in reality there are only a few things that really work .
A great help to web designers are the different frameworks for CSS development that come with grid , layout , and typography definitions that help defining a user - friendly layout .
As more and more users move away from individually designed websites to social publishing platforms such as Twitter , Facebook and Posterous Tumblr , the actual design of these platforms is in the hands of professionals that for economic reasons focus on interaction rather than beauty .
Another great help unifying web user interfaces comes from jQuery UI , a user interface library .
j Query UI offers a vast library of ready - to - use interface elements , such as sign up forms and modular picture gallery elements .
It is free , easy to implement , uses stable code , and employs front end design standards instead of trying to reinvent the graphical user interface .
Counter - Trend
More and more web designers understand that typography is not about choosing fancy fonts , but organizing type in a way that it guarantees the best reading experience for the user .
There are a few tendencies in contemporary web design ( and programming ) that point in the direction of easy to use standardized frameworks away from the uneconomic trend to reinvent web design with every project .
Of course , with every trend there is an interesting counter - trend .
While these technological improvements tend to make the web a more and more homogeneous place , simultaneously there ’s a tendency to create highly curated sites that use a different design for each article .
The idea is that the look of the article should not subdue to the brand identity of the site — the site should adapt to the content in color and shape .
A good example of such a design chameleon is Jason Santa Maria ’s weblog .
Conclusion
Technology often develops from primitive to complicated to simple .
The web develops faster and is more client - focused than traditional technologies .
Web development is cheaper , more flexible and most importantly : everyone can contribute to its development .
In concrete terms : Better interaction design , less graphic design .
Better user experience , less debates about taste .
Faster technology , more reliable design standards .
While there are a number of technological and social trends that confirm that movement , there are a number of counter - trends that keep things interesting .
As it becomes much easier to develop web designs with the upcoming browser generation , there will be more functional liberty and more visual standardization in web design .

UNBOUND - this key is not normally bound to any vi command
- this key is not normally bound to any vi command word - a lower - case word ( " w " , " b " , " e " commands ) is defined by a consecutive string of letters , numbers , or underscore , or a consecutive string of characters that is not any of {letters , numbers , underscore , whitespace}
- a lower - case word ( " w " , " b " , " e " commands ) is defined by a consecutive string of letters , numbers , or underscore , or a consecutive string of characters that is not any of {letters , numbers , underscore , whitespace} Word - an upper - case word ( " W " , " B " , " E " commands ) is a consecutive sequence of non-whitespace .

sentence
paragraph
cursor motion command - any command which positions the cursor is ok here , including the use of numeric prefixes .
In addition , a repeat of the edit command usually means to apply to the entire current line .
For example , " < < " means shift current line left ; " cc " means replace entire current line ; and " dd " means delete entire current line .
Key Bindings in Editing Modes
ESC - leave edit mode , return to command mode
^ D - move line backwards one shiftwidth .
shiftwidth must be set , and either the line must be newly added , or ^T must have been used .
^T - move all after cursor forwards one shiftwidth
^ H - deletes text that was entered during the current edit mode .
Most versions of vi do not allow deleting to previous line .
^V - insert next character even if it is a editing character .
Repitition Counts
z position nth line number G goto nth line number | goto nth column number r replace next n characters s substitute for next n characters << shift n lines left one shiftwidth ^ ignored ?
_ advance n- 1 lines
Multibuffer
These filenames can be reffered to in ex commands , and subshell filters , using two special characters : " % " refers to the current file , and " # " refers to the previous file .
Here 's some handy things you can do with this feature :
: map v :! chmod 644 %^ [ make world - readable :map q :! ci -l %^ [ RCS checkin : map V :! diff # %^ [ compare previous and current files

Mappings and Abbreviations
: map
: map
g q v K V # * \ = ^A ^C ^I ^K ^O ^V ^W ^X ^[ ^_
If you use multiple key shortcuts , you 'll want to know about the timeout variable .
With : se timeout , you have a limited time to generate the key sequence .
This is useful if the key sequences are terminal generated .
With : se notimeout , it just keeps waiting until the next character does or does n't match any possible current sequences .
: map ! lets you bind a list of keystrokes to a shortcut in edit - mode .
This is useful for adding editing commands to edit mode .
One popular trick is to bind the arrow keys to move up and down while ( apparently ) staying in edit - mode , as in the last four lines below .
: map ! ^? ^H
Make delete act like backspace : map !
^ [ OA ^[ka xterm arrow sequences will : map !
^ [ OB ^[ja exit edit - mode , move the : map !
^ [ OC ^[la cursor , and re-enter edit - mode .
: map ! ^ [ OD ^[ha
: ab lets you bind a key sequence to an abbreviation , for use in edit - mode .
Abbreviations do n't fire until vi decides that you 've typed the shortcut as a whole word .
So if taf is a shortcut for Thomas A. Fine , and I type taffy , it wo n't substitute because I did n't enter taf as a word by itself .
( If I 'd used : map ! , then taffy would do the replacement before I got to the second " f " . )
Abbreviations are echoed normally until complete , therefore the abbreviation can't contain escape ( you 'd leave edit - mode before completing the abbreviation ) , but the replacement expression can contain escape , and can leave and return to edit - mode .
: ab teh the : ab #d # define : ab # i #include : ab cmain main ( argc , argv )
^Mint argc ; ^Mchar ** argv ; ^M{ ^M}^[ O :ab cmmap mmap( NULL , st.st_size,PROT_READ,MAP_SHARED , fd,0 ) ; :ab readsig ^ [ G:r ~/misc/sig^M }

Repeating with .
System Differences
Older versions of vi did n't automatically set up arrow - keys in command - mode ; they did n't interfere with the beep .
( Maybe multiple key bindings were new at the same time ??? )
Some versions of vi have encryption , some do n't .
Options processing is handled differently from version to version .
Solaris prefers -c command in place of + command , and - L instead of -r .
in place of , and instead of .
Differnt systems may have other keys besides : that are " Too dangerous to map that " .
The size of macros ( : map , etc. ) are limited in different ways on different systems .
On some systems the environment variable EXINIT overrides .exrc files ( Solaris , HPUX ) , other systems it enhances it ( SunOS ??? , FreeBSD ) .
nvi allows backspace to previous line in edit - mode ( if previous line was edited ) ( FreeBSD ) .
variants of vi that have multiple undo have different styles .
One style ( linux ) uses u as undo , and control - R as redo .
The other style ( FreeBSD ) u acts normally , but .
continues on in the same direction as the last u ( whether it was undo or redo ) .
I prefer the latter because it does n't interfere as much with traditional vi behaviour .
VI Reference Manual from the University of Michigan at Dearborn
Trick
: map v 0 ma}b :'a , .j< ctrl-v>< return >070 ?
*< ctrl-v><escape>dwi<ctrl-v>< return >< ctrl-v><escape >
Note the control - v's are there to enter the following characters , which would otherwise terminate the map command .
The above was written as you have to enter the special characters in traditional vi .
In vim , you can use the four literal characters " < CR > " for a carriage return , and also " < Esc > " for Escape .
So it may be easier to type this , and it can also go into your .vimrc ) more readibly ( with thanks to Bart Van den Broeck ) :
: map v 0 ma}b : 'a , .j< CR>070 ?
*< Esc>dwi<CR>< Esc >
It 's better because you do n't have to prejoin the paragraph by hitting J an arbitrary number of times .
Just hit v ( or whatever you 've mapped it to ) starting at the beginning or in the middle of the paragraph , and it joines the rest of the paragraph together , formats one line , and moves the cursor down again .
Just keep hitting v and it will keep formatting .
You have to stop one before the end or you 'll end up with an extra short line .
It also does not leave spaces at the end of the line .
Paco addicts in the slums of Buenos Aires guardian.co.uk
Nina Chamorro runs her finger across the montage of photos of neighbourhood children tacked to the wall of her community soup kitchen in Villa Itatí , a sprawling urban slum on the outskirts of Buenos Aires .
" He is dead now .
And him .
And him , " says the 75 - year - old grandmother , her eyes drifting sadly over grinning faces .
She points to another photograph .
" He was shot by the police last month .
That girl disappeared .
We have lost so many of our beautiful children .
We knew them since they were born .
They had their whole lives to live . "
Villa Itatí is only a few minutes ' drive from the more upmarket parts of Buenos Aires .
Ask most people here to explain the cause of the grisly gallery in Chamorro 's kitchen and the answer will be a single word : " paco " .
A toxic and highly addictive mixture of raw cocaine base cut with chemicals , glue , crushed glass and rat poison , paco is the curse of Argentina 's urban poor .
And consumption of this bastardised , low - grade drug is eating away at the vitality and hope of the most deprived neighbourhood areas of the capital .
Essentially a chemical waste product , paco is what remains from the narco - kitchens producing cocaine bound for US and European markets .
Since its appearance on the streets of Buenos Aires in the late 1990s , the drug has taken a deadly grip in slums such as Itatí .
­Levels of addiction rose by more than 200 % in the first part of the decade and more than 400,000 doses are now being consumed daily .
Users are witheringly referred to as the muertos vivientes – the living dead – of Buenos Aires .
Addictive after one or two hits , the drug systematically destroys the nervous system .
Users quickly become skeletal and ravaged , resorting to crime , violence and prostitution to feed their habits .
Enormous numbers die in short order .
Villa Itatí runs on paco : an economy that is an endless , grim cycle of illicit profit , addiction - fuelled crime and wasted lives , all witnessed by a despairing generation of parents .
According to urban myth , the first paco in Argentina was sold here .
Residents say narco - traffickers started flooding the neighbourhood with paco in 2005 , selling hits for little more than 10 p each .
According to provincial government reports , an astonishing 50 % of Villa Itatí 's 60,000 residents have used or are currently addicted to the drug .
Across the country , 2008 government figures show that 64.9 % of under - 18s in addiction and treatment services are there because of paco .
Virtually no one owns a car in Villa Itatí .
But in a place where there is only one source of wealth , there are stark signs of big money being made by some .
Shiny black four - wheel - drives with darkened windows are parked in the unpaved street near Chamorro 's kitchen .
" Paco , " says one woman , pointing to the trucks .
" Those cars are what they buy with our children 's blood . "
" The dealers came here and first they targeted kids , " says one resident running a community project who did n't want to be named .
" They sold these kids hits of paco for one peso and got them hooked and now they work for them selling it in the streets .
If they lose one dose , they shoot them in the legs or kill them .
Families are cooking paco in their houses because it is the only way they can make money .
" This place used to be a real neighbourhood , people had work .
We were poor but we were a community ; now it is all crime and drugs and sewage , " says Chamorro .
" There is no work , the factories all closed .
Some of the women go into the city to clean rich people 's houses and a few of the men collect cardboard .
But there is nothing for the young people . "
Sonia Andrade , Chamorro 's daughter who helps her run the soup kitchen , describes how she lies awake at night hearing the children of her friends scrambling across the roof " like rats " looking for things to steal .
" They are so desperate they rob everything from their families to get another hit , and when there is nothing left to take they steal from their neighbours , " says Andrade .
" They did n't have much of a chance before paco , and now they do n't have any at all . "
The scourge of paco may be the final act in the tragedy of decline in what is one of the city 's oldest and largest slums .
When Chamorro started her soup kitchen more than 20 years ago she used to feed 20 or 30 people a day ; now it is closer to 200 .
Her simple two - room soup kitchen is at the heart of the urban shanty town .
It is only midday , but already the smell from " La Cava " , the huge open pit filled with household rubbish and ­sewage at the heart of the slum , is overpowering .
Andrade points to the high embankments of the highway .
When it rains , she explains , water pours down the slopes and floods into the pit .
The slum 's poorest families living closest to the pit find themselves knee - deep in putrid water in under an hour .
" All the children here have scabs all over their bodies , they do n't eat outside of what we give them here , they all have breathing problems , " she says .
" The ­kindergarten used to give them milk and breakfast , but now the money from the government has stopped and the teachers do n't come any more . "
But however appalling the poverty , it is the growth in drug abuse that has turned the place into an urban hell .
Dr Carlos Vizzotti , director of national assistance and prevention programmes at Sedronar , the government 's agency for drug treatment , prevention and enforcement , admits the government is struggling to contain the problem of serious drug addiction in the city 's poorest neighbourhoods .
" We can't compete with the dealers who are paying kids and families 200 pesos a day to sell and traffic paco and cocaine .
We try to get them off drugs , but then we just send them back to the same problems which brought them to paco in the first place . "
The accounts of those working on the front line are unremittingly grim .
Father Pepe , a missionary priest , runs addiction and poverty alleviation projects from his small , whitewashed church in another slum , Villa 21 - 24 , close to the heart of Buenos Aires .
" Paco is a manifestation of everything that is rotten in Argentina , " he says .
" It exposes the systematic and growing failure of the whole system , health , education , basic services – they are all falling to ruin .
It is n't that paco is a drug of the poor ; it is that it feeds off the poverty and exclusion that was always here .
Paco just shows us what lies at the heart of our country today . "
Outside the heat is searing , but inside the church is dark and cool , the walls covered in murals depicting the harsh reality of life in Argentina 's slums .
The largest shows a child paco-user ­protected from the grave by angels .
" Paco is a tsunami that has hit the most vulnerable .
If we were n't working here , then there would be nobody to help families fight against this .
The state and wider society have washed their hands of us , " says Pepe .
Rising crime has made Villa 21 - 24 a byword for violence in Buenos Aires with many areas of this vast urban settlement being controlled entirely by narco - gangs .
Last year Pepe was forced to ask for official protection and faced death threats after he spoke out against the traffickers and rising crime in the neighbourhood .
" In the last few years we have seen many more problems with crime , with violence and guns linked to a more co-ordinated narcotics operation here in the slums .
It 's an increasingly big business , " he says .
" Yet the capacity of the people to prevail , to want something better , lives on , and this is what we should be supporting . "
But as Argentina gains a new unwanted status as a premier narco - trafficking route , the outlook for ­campaigners such as Pepe is bleak .
­Traditionally used mainly as a transit route to get cocaine out of Latin America to Europe , Argentina is increasingly used as a producer and consumer of cocaine and cocaine byproducts in Latin America .
Drug Enforcement Argentina , an anti-drugs pressure group , claims cocaine kitchens like those first discovered in the slums in 2006 are booming and that there are more than 1,500 clandestine airstrips bringing cocaine base into the north of the country .
Sedronar admits that porous borders , limited resources and expertise , and a lack of effective co-ordination between regional and national agencies means that Argentina is losing the battle to contain the rise of narco - trafficking into the country .
In Villa Itatí , Nina Chamorro and thousands of others like her are ­desperate that paco should disappear and their children be given the chance of a way out of the spiral of poverty and drug addiction that is destroying their future .
" We have been abandoned by the government , by everybody .
They are all terrified of our children coming to their houses and taking their things , but they need hope for something better .
There has to be more for them than this , " says Chamorro as she heads inside the soup kitchen .
Her words are an almost certainly futile expression of despair .
Kenneth Ellis appears to have transwarped his STO preview to the boards before me , but even Bones McCoy occasionally needed to get a second opinion .
Damn it , man !
I ’m a reviewer , not a blogger !
Number one , lay in a course for some lame joke about “ boldly going where no MMO has gone before . ”
Engage .
Star Trek Online has entered open beta stages , so I ’ve now had a chance to test it out and give it a critical look .
Like all other endeavors in the Star Trek IP , my hopes for this game were high and my expectations very low .
The difficulty curve occasionally jumps like a Nausican beamed into its ready room just while it was enjoying a cup of Earl Grey .
Star
Trek has always been set apart from other science fiction by its unique view of our technology and culture .
Ships operate with huge crews and fight like a hybrid of naval battles and dogfights while still remembering that they ’re in space and have to deal with things like inertial dampening and faster than light travel .
In the movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey , we learned that a realistic space environment does not make for a good movie .
Star Trek has generally failed to make good games because realistically piloting something with a crew of several hundred people does not make for fast and intuitive control schemes .
MMO control schemes lend themselves to Star Trek well , which explains why Cryptic felt comfortable recycling the Champions Online engine .
Though the engine may have lost a little in translation , what with a 45 degree maximum pitch angle , the basic principles work very well .
The game gives you control over reallocating subsystem power and shield power , as well as special abilities with familiar names like “ all power to shields . ”
The graphics in space are good , with an art designer who realized that space was boring and thus undeserving of accurate representation .
Everywhere you look you ’re surrounded by nebulas , asteroids , stars , moons and enormous planets .
When you warp out of a system , you enter “ sector space ” which represents a fully navigable map .
And even that is filled with meaningless but colorful lines , dots and warp trails to keep you visually entertained .
STO got the voices of Leonard Nemoy and Zachary Quinto to eat up their entire voice acting budget with about ten minutes worth of dialogue .
Presumably they drained some money from the ground combat department to hire the cast of House of the Dead 2 to finish the rest of the voiced dialogue .
Seriously , everything except the big names is comically bad .
I hope they give the option to just turn all voiced dialogue off , otherwise I may wind up vaporizing my speakers .
Yes it ’s that horrific .
The game has been receiving criticism for seeming unfinished , and in the ground combat that argument really holds merit .
Using your phasers and disruptor rifles you and your enemies whittle away at each other ’s personal shields and health bars .
Your doctors and engineers use their tricorders to repair your shields and heal you , being played either by your away team or your friends .
But enemies do n’t seem overly bothered by being shot , and the animations can be very stocky and a bit late to react to things like knockdown effects .
When you set an attack to automatically fire it can perform with a punishing lack of urgency , and frequently overrides commands to perform special attacks .
Was there something wrong with the standard auto - attack function most games have ?
The AI is very good , using advanced maneuvers to keep themselves alive and out of harms way like getting stuck in objects at the beginning of a level and falling through the ground .
I ’m sure if my character could emulate these abilities , I would never take a hit .
But the space combat more than makes up for it , and ground combat can be largely avoided without much penalty .
In space you must keep your best shields toward your enemy while trying to also face your best weapons toward them .
The weapons offer a trade off in wider firing arcs for lower DPS .
So there ’s a lot of customizability in your setup , unlike most MMOs where it ’s just about the gear with the better numbers .
The ship design is in true Cryptic style .
For every ten levels you get a choice of a new ship from three subtypes : escort , science and cruiser , which represent DPS , support and tanking .
But each subtype has three aesthetic ship choices , at least one of which is pure canon .
This means you can make your ship look like a new design , an old model on a string , a refit thereof or any combination in between .
STO ’s most unique feature is where player abilities come from .
They ’re not all bought from skill trainers based on your starting class .
Each of your bridge officers confers powers to your ship which can be retrained very easily .
The kit you wear on away missions determines whether you have grenades or extra tricorders filling your action bar .
Weapons are so distinct that rather than having a standard auto fire you can select one fore and one aft weapon to be your designated auto - attack component , relegating the others to activated abilities , used en mass every two seconds with the space bar just to alienate the arthritic crowd .
This makes for a great deal of customization from player to player without even forcing them to choose tank , heals or dps when deciding a class .
But this is an MMO , I ’m a trekkie , and it ’s the beta so I can hardly say I ’m giving an objective look at a completed game .
The truth is , there ’s still a lot of room for failure here since no one has had much chance to see the end game content .
Cryptic has had a history of failed MMOs and for very consistent reasons .
The content is repetitive and boring , or sometimes altogether lacking in the case of Champions Online , and there ’s seldom much to do after the level cap .
Cryptic has made mention of end game raiding , but frankly I do n’t trust them since they ’ve never done this well in the past and have focused the leveling scheme in STO on solo playability .
The missions are all instanced , which can auto group you , but otherwise adjust difficulty so they can be soloed .
The difficulty curve occasionally jumps like a Nausican just beamed into its ready room while it was enjoying a cup of Earl Grey .
With no warnings in place advising that the mission is intended for a group , this can be more than a little frustrating .
No matter how the final product turns out , STO has already beaten my expectations and is definitely worth its purchase price .
Whether it ’s worth subscription fees month after month has yet to be seen .
The beta is rather buggy and unfinished , to the point of being worrysome , but the core game behind it is fantastic .
Let ’s hope Cryptic has learned from their mistakes and is n’t just trying to cash in on a shiny new IP .
One to beam out .

The move came after I was granted an extension on the government ’s request earlier today .
I also signaled my intent to challenge the subpoena in federal court next week .

I also just spoke with Steve Frischling , who had also been served with a subpoena in connection with the security directive .
He says he received a phone call from a deputy chief counsel for enforcement at the DHS to let him know he was off the hook and that the agency had offered to buy him a new computer .
His previous computer had been damaged after Frischling consented to a search of his computer and hard drive .
Needless to say , I ’m delighted by this turn of events .
TSA did the right thing by withdrawing its subpoena .
Perhaps it has bigger problems to worry about ?

CAPE CANAVERAL , Fla . ( AP ) 
Here is a recession bargain : the space shuttle .
NASA has slashed the price of the 1970s - era spaceships to $ 28.8 million apiece from $ 42 million .
The shuttles are for sale once their flying days are over , which is scheduled to be this fall .
When the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in December 2008 put out the call seeking buyers at museums , schools and elsewhere , the agency received about 20 inquiries .
An agency spokesman , Mike Curie , said he expected more interest , especially with the discount .
“ We ’re confident that we ’ll get other takers , ” Mr. Curie said Friday .
The Discovery is already promised to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum .
The Atlantis and the Endeavour are up for grabs .
It is possible that the Enterprise , a shuttle prototype that never made it to space , will also be available .
The Enterprise is currently at the Smithsonian .
Mr. Curie said no decisions would be made before summer .
The lower price is based on NASA ’s estimate of the cost for transporting a shuttle from Kennedy Space Center to a major airport , and for displaying it indoors in a climate - controlled building .
The travel cost may vary based on location .
NASA has moved up the delivery date to the latter half of 2011 , instead of 2012 .
Vulture has learned that Warner Bros. is negotiating to reteam with The Book of Eli’s Hughes brothers to have them direct a live - action remake of the cult favorite Akira , from a script by Iron Man scribes Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby .
( Akira is being produced by Leonardo DiCaprio ’s company , Appian Way , along with Andrew Lazar , who ’s also currently producing an adaptation of DC Comics ’ Jonah Hex for Warners . )
Even if you had read all of Katsuhiro Otomo ’s epic 1982 manga and / or seen his own 1988 anime adaptation , summarizing the plot to Akira would still prove a bit of a challenge .
As near as we can figure , Akira is about the leader of a biker gang who tries to save his kidnapped pal from a powerful supernatural experiment .
( It might also be a psycho- philosophical exploration of corruption , the will to power , and the maturation of man and mankind , but we were actually pretty high when we first saw it in college , so please do n’t hold us to that . )
Respecting the source ’s complexity ( or perhaps acquiescing to it ) , Warners wo n’t proceed with a single , live - action remake of the film , which trimmed away the last half of the 2,182 - page graphic novel in order to weigh in at just over two hours .
Instead , we hear that the studio is planning to make Akira in two parts , with the first three volumes of the six - volume manga making up the first film , due out next year .
An official release from the studio is expected later this week .
Xdebug 2.1.0 beta2 released
Dieren , the Netherlands
I 've just released Xdebug 2.1.0 bet a2 which features a few small bug fixes only .
With this release the Windows 5.3/ VC6 binaries also return .
One of the bug fixes is in a new feature that allows you to configure that the debugger should connect back to the IDE running on the machine that initiated the HTTP request .
This feature , that originally was contributed by Lucas Nealan and Brian Shire of Facebook , allows more easy use of multiple IDEs ( users ) working on the same code base .
In order to enable this , set xdebug.remote_connect_back to 1 .
See the documentation for more information .
Of course , this feature should only be enabled if nobody besides authorized developers can access the machine on which the xdebug .
remote_connect_back callback feature has been enabled .
Instead of enabling this setting , you can also support multiple developers through the proxy functionality that the DBGp protocol supports .
For more information on that , see Debugging with multiple users .
You can find the full changelog here and get the latest version from the download page .
Solar Hydrogen Station
Honda has started new operations for the upcoming series of Solar Hydrogen Station first sample in the Honda R&D Americas , Inc. in Los Angeles .
They have proposed an excellent use for home replenish products which are capable of refilling the fuel cells of electric vehicles overnight .
It is a vertical unit , incorporated to be installed in the consumer ’s garage .
This new generation Hydrogen Station is making the smaller systems but producing more energy of hydrogen from filling in 8 hours during the night for everyday use .
It will provide 10’000 miles in a round year to drive an electric fuel cell vehicle .
There were previously designed hydrogen system that were more space consuming because they were coming with a separate compressor and an electrolyzer to produce more pressure hydrogen .
It was very expensive and the compressor was a large component and eventually minimizes the systems performance .
Honda has now removed the compressor from the new system , and this is the World ’s first system can be used at home .
It is also minimizing the size of other main components and improving the efficiency .
It is now a pure compact version with improved capacity of at least 25 % after calculations based on simulations .
This is easily moveable by an average user and very easy to use its operations and can easily remove the fuel hose as well .
In ruins the hidden secrets of sex are laid bare .
All our most intimate truths come out in the wash .
The den of our fornication will rot and mold will form on the sheets where we grunted out our last passions .
Sex .
In life , as in death , it ’s a messy business .
Here are five ruined dens of sex from around Japan .
‘ Love Hotels ’ are a lot like roadside motels , designed with the express purpose of facilitating ‘ relations ’ between Japanese couples who still live at home , and have no access to a bedroom away from their parents .
They are often cheap , and come in a variety of wacky ‘ flavors ’ , decorated in garish hues , with flashing lights , hot tubs , and handy vending machines stocking contraceptives and other toys .
You can take a ‘ REST ’ at a love hotel ( one hour , cheap rate ) , or enjoy a full STAY ( up to eight hours , more expensive ) .
The Akasaka Love Hotel Haikyo in Tokyo reminds us of the importance of that old adage : ‘ location location location ’ .
Situated at the far end of a strip of Love Hotels on the Lake Tama ring road , it ’s clear this place suffered for lack of passing traffic .
Now its forecourt and parking lot are bouldered with rotten 80 ’s styled furniture , burnt - out cars , and avalanches of mounded pillows .
Inside , its gaudy rooms still sing of forbidden pleasures , the walls plastered with bright helios , lurking cheetahs , and naked Bathsheba7s , though I doubt any lusty couples have joined in their bawdy chorus for some time .
‘ Soaplands ’ are descended from Turkish water brothels , places where the hard - working Japanese salaryman can go to get himself soaped down by a young and nimble nymph .
After protestations from the Russian Embassy the name was changed to Soapland .
The legality of these places is much in question , with a wider range of deeds considered legal than you might expect .
Due to this semi-legality , the places are often run by ‘ yakuza ’- Japanese gangsters , situated in red - light districts .
The Queen Chateau Soapland Haikyo in Ibaraki is at once a grand but squalid folly .
A bath - based brothel rising 5 fairy - tale stories into the sky , cornered with towers and capped with bright red tile , it represents an era gone mad with indulgence , audacity , and hopefulness .
Now it lies in crippled ruin , its bright colors fading , its halycon days of glamor and glitz surplanted by ghost - like hangings in its dim and dusty bars .
Its grand playing - card Queen still stands aloft emblazoned across the front of the building , but her stare is now more that of the toothless Ozymandius than a haughty mademoiselle .
‘ Hostess Bars ’ are bars where men pay to be flirted with .
Attractive women sit by them , pour them drinks , stroke their thighs , pay them compliments , and can make a fortune from big - spenders seeking to impress the girls with the most expensive champagne and caviar .
The Akeno Gekijo haikyo in Ibaraki is something of an oddity in Japan , as one of only a few actual strip clubs .
Of course there are similar venues ; hostess bars , soaplands , love hotels , but they each cater to a slightly different crowd and provide a slightly different flavor of tawdry service .
To find a straight - up strip club complete with central podium , viewing seats , and dancing poles seems a feat beyond expectation .
But there it is , on a small back - road in a quiet rural area surrounded by bamboo , half - burnt to the ground and buzzing with mosquitoes .
The Hotel Royal haikyo in Kanagawa is the grand - daddy of all love hotels , streaking 7 empty stories up into the big blue sky , a giant vermillion flag on the banks of Sagamiko Lake calling out to all and sundry in a mega - watt baritone -
“ Need some discreet time alone with your loved one ?
Come on down ! ”
No sense of shame here .
The Pearl Love Hotel Haikyo in Tochigi is a wreck in camouflage , deeply nested underneath a blanket of scraggy brown vines .
Rooms lie in embers , grown through with ferns ; once - bohemian beds , chaise longues and chandeliers lie scrapped , dropped , and despoiled with the nests of birds , spiders , and the homeless .
The grand two - story executive suite still maintains some of its sordid gravitas , its sultry red round - bedded apex room as faux - regal as ever , now overlooking a graveyard of spent passion inveigled by nature ’s rapacious tendrils .
Utterly overgrown .
Hitchcock could film a murder here .

It 's now official :
In 2009 the number of unionized workers who work for the government surpassed those in the private economy for the first time .
This milestone explains a lot about modern American politics , in particular the paradox that union clout with Democrats has increased even as fewer workers belong to unions overall .
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported recently that 51.4 % of America 's 15.4 million union members , or about 7.91 million workers , were employed by the government in 2009 .
As recently as 1980 , there ...
Yale University is among 60 " subversive " international organizations stirring up Iran 's political discord as part of a plot backed by the United States , Britain and Israel to undermine the Islamic Republic , Iran 's Ministry of Intelligence and Security said today , according to the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency and the official Islamic Republic News Agency ( in Persian ) .
The Ivy League school joins the ranks of news organizations such as the Persian - language Voice of America and BBC Persian as well as Beltway think tanks such as the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace that have been accused of being part of a " soft war " waged against Iran by its enemies .
The reports quoted a deputy minister of intelligence for international affairs but cited no name .
At a news conference , he reportedly said Iranians should have no contact with such organizations .
" Having any relation , signing any contract with them or receiving any facilities from individuals or legal entities affiliated to those institutions and foundations are illegal and forbidden , " he reportedly said .
" Similarly it is illegal for political movements , groups and parties to receive any cash and non-cash assistance " from the organizations .
Obama Administration to Keep TARP Inspector General from New Small Business Program Top Republican says move is " chilling , " calls it revenge for past criticism .
Feb 22 , 2010  --
The Obama administration is trying to prevent a bailout watchdog from overseeing an upcoming program to boost lending to small businesses , according to a letter sent to a top Treasury Department official .
The expected decision already has Republicans crying foul , with the GOP lawmaker on a key Congressional oversight panel saying Monday that the plan sent a " disturbing " and " chilling " message that the administration will take revenge on watchdogs who criticize their efforts .
The dispute emerged in a letter sent last Friday by Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general for the $ 700 billion Wall Street bailout ( SIGTARP ) , to Herb Allison , the assistant treasury secretary for financial stability .
In the letter , Barofsky warned that to exclude his office from oversight of the program would be " terribly wasteful " and " could lead to significant exposure to waste , fraud and abuse . "
While the administration has not yet finalized its legislative proposal for the $ 30 billion program , Allison indicated to Barofsky last week that his office would not have any oversight of the program .
" I was surprised to learn from you Wednesday that Treasury is contemplating excluding SIGTARP from the oversight provisions of its legislative proposal concerning the Small Business Lending Fund , contrary to what you previously told us , " Barofsky wrote in his letter to Allison .
Only two weeks ago Allison had indicated to Barofsky that the watchdog would " expressly have jurisdiction over " the small business effort , but that all changed last week .
The about - face , Barofsky said , was " a curious change " .
To exclude Barofsky 's office from oversight , he warned , would be " contrary to the best interests of the taxpayer . "
As Barofsky noted , the new small business effort bears numerous similarities to one of the programs that his office has been overseeing for more than a year : the Capital Purchase Program [ CPP ] , part of the larger $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) .
" The funds being utilized , the core mechanics , the economic terms of the program , and even many of the participants all stem from TARP's CPP , " Barofsky said .
" Disregarding that expertise when developing a program that has the same goals , a very similar basic structure , that is being run by the same people , and that involves many of the same participants … would , at best , be terribly wasteful and lead to duplicative efforts and , at worst , could lead to significant exposure to waste , fraud , and abuse as another oversight body gets up to speed , " he wrote .
Barofsky emphasized that the small business program 's structure " leaves it vulnerable to potential fraud and will require vigorous and experienced oversight from the onset of the program . "
" For all of these reasons , " he said , " I strongly urge Treasury to reconsider its positions with respect to the oversight provisions " of the small business effort .
Rep. Darrell Issa , R - Calif , the top Republican on the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee , called Treasury 's expected move " disturbing " and " chilling " and urged the agency to reverse course .
" SIGTARP has been an aggressive watchdog for American taxpayers and this attempt to circumvent their oversight must not go forward , " said Issa .
" It is disturbing , but not altogether out of character , that this Treasury Department would attempt to deny SIGTARP the ability to conduct oversight of this proposed program . "
Issa said Treasury 's decision was an attempt to take revenge on the watchdog for a series of scathing reports in recent months .
" Denying SIGTARP the ability to defend taxpayers sends a chilling message that IGs who conduct real oversight will be punished for holding this administration accountable , " said the Republican lawmaker .
Barofsky and Treasury have been at odds on various occasions over the course of the past year .
Last summer the agency asked the Justice Department to issue a ruling on the watchdog 's independence after Barofsky 's office sought to obtain AIG documents for an investigation .
While the Treasury department ultimately withdrew the request in September , the dispute highlighted an ongoing tension between the two sides .
Barofsky , at times , has been an outspoken critic of certain Treasury actions during the government 's response to the worst economic downturn since World War II .
In a report released in late January , Barofsky argued that " many of TARP 's stated goals … have simply not been met . "
Last October he concluded that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner was " ultimately responsible " for AIG , the recipient of a record $ 182 billion in taxpayer bailout aid , paying out $ 165 million in retention bonuses in the spring of 2009 .
Barofsky also charged that Treasury and the Federal Reserve had misled the American public and Congress in the days leading up to the bailout 's enactment in the fall of 2008 .
In light of Allison 's comments to Barofsky , Issa called on Congress to stand up for the watchdog 's oversight powers and reject any measures that to limit them .
" Both proponents and opponents in Congress of this administration 's spending policies should reject outright any effort to weaken oversight of bailout funds , " Issa said .
Later this week Allison will testify before another House panel on small business lending in local markets .
The Treasury official will appear before the House Financial Services Committee on Friday at 10 a.m .
" We do n't think the dollar rally is going to last much beyond the first quarter because we 're in a new world of rotating sovereign crises where politics matters again .
It 's Greece right now but it could be the UK next , and then US which has yet to take any steps at all to tackle it fiscal deficit , " he said .
AT&T says it has worked hard to improve its much - maligned 3G network over the last eight months -- erecting hundreds of new cell towers , using better - performing wireless spectrum , and souping up its cell sites across the country -- and the results of our latest 13 - city 3G network performance tests suggest that the network has indeed undergone a drastic makeover .
After registering the lowest average download speeds in our 3G performance tests last spring , AT&T ?s network turned in download speeds that were 72 percent better than the numbers from eight months ago ; in our latest tests , AT&T 's download speeds were 67 percent faster on average than those of the other three largest U.S. wireless providers -- Sprint , T - Mobile , and Verizon .
In our tests last spring , AT&T posted an average download speed of 812 kbps ( kilobits per second ) across 13 cities .
In our tests conducted in December 2009 and January 2010 , AT&T ?s average download speed increased to 1410 kbps .
AT&T 's download speeds in New York City were three times faster in our latest tests than in our tests last spring ; in San Francisco , the AT&T 's download speeds were 40 percent faster .
The AT&T network ?s reliability improved dramatically , too : Last spring , PCWorld testers obtained a usable broadband connection with AT&T only 68 percent of the time .
In our latest tests , testers connected to AT&T successfully in 94 percent of their attempts .
Verizon Wireless , which turned in the best all - around performance in last spring 's 3G network testing , and Sprint , which finished a close second , both continue to perform well , according to our latest test results .
Our tests found that Sprint ?s network delivered download speeds nearly identical to those we measured eight months ago in the 13 test cities ; Verizon ? s download speeds decreased by 8 percent overall .
In the past year , Sprint and Verizon - - like AT&T -- have seen a marked increase in the number of 3G smartphones that rely on their networks .
Our speed results suggest that Sprint is upgrading its network capacity fast enough to meet the demand , while Verizon may be having trouble keeping up .
Nevertheless , both networks ?
reliability ( the likelihood that a user can connect to the Internet at a reasonable speed ) improved in the most recent tests over how they fared last spring .
We tested the T - Mobile 3G network for the first time in December and January , and found that it supported download and upload speeds that were competitive with Sprint ?s and Verizon ?s in most of our test cities .
In one city -- New York - - T - Mobile ? s network even delivered download speeds that are usually associated with 4G networks .
Before getting into the details of our test results , a few words about the testing and the data .
During December and January , PCWorld and our testing partner , Novarum Inc. , tested the download speeds , upload speeds , and network dependability of the AT&T , Sprint , T - Mobile , and Verizon 3G networks from 20 locations in each of 13 U.S. cities .
Altogether we ran more than 51,000 separate tests covering 850 square miles of wireless cell coverage servicing 7 million wireless subscribers ( see ? How We Do the Testing ? ) .
At each testing location , we connected to the 3G network via both laptops and smartphones .
The laptop tests accurately measured the capacity and performance potential of a given network , while the smartphone tests approximated the real - world connection speeds users of these popular devices might experience , given the less - powerful processors and 3G radios that the devices contain .
Reading the Charts
The charts list the cities in the leftmost column ; moving rightward across the chart , you can see the speed averages and reliability scores in that city for each of four 3G wireless networks .
Speeds are expressed in kilobits per second ( kbps ) ; the figure for reliability represents the percentage of the total number of 1 - minute tests we conducted of a given carrier 's service during which the service maintained an uninterrupted connection at a reasonable speed .

Click on the chart thumbnail at right for the detailed results of our smartphone - based testing of the Big Four 3G wireless networks in 13 cities .
Because we could n't test every city in the country , we chose 13 that are broadly representative of the rest : Baltimore , Boston , Chicago , Denver , New Orleans , New York City , Orlando , Phoenix , Portland , San Diego , San Francisco , San Jose , and Seattle .
Because wireless signal quality depends to a large extent on variables such as network load , distance from the nearest cell tower , weather , and time of day , our results can ?t be used to predict specific future performance in a specific area .
Rather , they illustrate the relative performance of 3G service in a given city on a given day .
Each speed number possesses a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percent .
Headlines yesterday mentioned yet another new snowfall record : Moscow Covered by More Than Half Meter of Snow , Most Since 1966
Feb. 21 ( Bloomberg ) — Moscow ’s streets were covered by 53 centimeters ( 20.9 inches ) of snow this morning after 15 centimeters fell in 24 hours , putting Russia ’s capital on course for its snowiest February since at least 1966 .
Workers cleared a record 392,000 cubic meters ( 13.8 million cubic feet ) of snow over the 24 - hour period that ended this morning as precipitation exceeded the average February amount by 50 percent , according to state television station Rossiya 24 .
The city had 64 centimeters of snow cover on Feb. 23 , 1966 , the previous record , Rossiya 24 said .
In a story from Russia ’s news agency , TASS , they mention that :
This year ’s February is quite unique from the meteorological point of view .
Not a single thaw has been registered so far and the temperature remains way below the average throughout the month .
I guess the Mayor of Moscow ’s “ Canute like ” promise back in October did n’t work out so well .
From Time magazine :
Moscow Mayor Promises a Winter Without Snow
Pigs still can’t fly , but this winter , the mayor of Moscow promises to keep it from snowing .
For just a few million dollars , the mayor ’s office will hire the Russian Air Force to spray a fine chemical mist over the clouds before they reach the capital , forcing them to dump their snow outside the city .
Authorities say this will be a boon for Moscow , which is typically covered with a blanket of snow from November to March .
Road crews wo n’t need to constantly clear the streets , and traffic — and quality of life — will undoubtedly improve .
So this winter ’s heavy snow and cold in the NH is not just a US problem .
It is interesting though to note that snow spin seems to span continents .
Before they were saying that increased winter snow is due to global warming , climate scientists were saying that decreased winter snow was due to global warming .
As discussed already on WUWT , climate models predict declining winter snow cover .
And a senior climate scientist predicted ten years ago :
According to Dr David Viner , a senior research scientist at the climatic research unit ( CRU ) of the University of East Anglia , within a few years winter snowfall will become “ a very rare and exciting event ” .
“ Children just are n’t going to know what snow is , ” he said .
There is no shortage of similar claims :
Decline in Snowpack Is Blamed On Warming Using data collected over the past 50 years , the scientists confirmed that the mountains are getting more rain and less snow http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/31/AR2008013101868.html
Many Ski Resorts Heading Downhill as a Result of Global Warming http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=363&ArticleID=4313&l=en
The prediction below was particularly entertaining , given that it was made during Aspen ’s all time snowiest winter .
So what are they saying now ?
The Blizzard of 1996 does indeed qualify as one type of extreme weather to be expected in a warmer climate Blame Global Warming for the Blizzard – NYTimes.com
The great thing about global warming is that you can blame anything on it , and then deny it later .

Updated with statement from Sabre Defence at the end of this article
Federal law enforcement agents , led by the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , descended on Nashville 's Sabre Defence Industries this morning and closed down the facility for at least the day .
Sabre manufactures firearms and firearm parts and accessories .
It is contracted by the U.S. armed forces for parts and mounts for the M2 Browning .50 - caliber machine gun and Minigun .
In addition to its government contracts , it produces the XR15 rifle , non-standard M4 Carbines , and non-standard M16A4s .
Law enforcement officials were seen escorting employees one by one of the company out of their 35,000 - square - foot facility on Allied Drive .
Each employee was searched next to their personal vehicle , had their vehicle searched and , when cleared , were allowed to leave the premises .
No individuals were witnessed being arrested .
After almost all of the employees had left the premises , agents brought in a trailer and backed it up to the company 's loading dock .
Reached for comment , federal law enforcement officials declined to comment on their actions and would not specify what the focus of their investigation is .
United Kingdom - based Sabre acquired the Nashville facility in 2002 but had been making military 0.50 - caliber barrels and guns since 1979 , as well as commercial rifle barrels for various companies .
Guy Savage is the CEO and owner of the company , and the Nashville facility is managed by Charles Shearon .
In December of last year , Aerospace Manufacturing Services of Colorado filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee claiming that it is owed $ 1.05 million for 2,400 .50 - calibre machine gun firing bolts .
According to previous media reports , the company employed approximately 85 individuals at its Nashville facility .
Statement from Sabre
Sabre Defence Industries LLC , an established manufacturer of firearms and weapon systems to the United States military , state and local law enforcement , and worldwide commercial markets , is fully cooperating with federal agents in an ongoing investigation into potential criminal misuse of certain non-saleable firearms produced by Sabre and purchased by some of its employees .
Sabre has received information that employee (s ) involved in inventory control may have obtained and re-sold some items without appropriate licenses .
Sabre is and has been cooperating with federal agents in this investigation .
Sabre has more than 120 employees in its Nashville plant .
Sabre ’s biggest customer is the United States military .
Sabre products used by United States armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan include .50 caliber barrels and components of the M2 Browning machine gun , 7.62 mm mini- gun barrels , and M - 16A3 and A4 rifles .
Sabre is the only non-public company in the world ever to be awarded a contract for a military spec M - 16 rifle .
Sabre is dedicated to continuing to provide high quality firearms to the United States military , state and local law enforcement , and Sabre 's commercial customers .
Rome , Italy ( CNN ) --
Italy 's state - owned television broadcaster has dropped a popular chef for sharing a recipe with viewers to cook cat .
Beppe Bigazzi told CNN that while he would miss collaborating with the RAI - Uno TV network , he would not apologize for his comments because they reflected historical facts , not just his opinion .
He blamed the furor on animal rights activists saying " It 's their problem , not mine ! "
During a live broadcast February 10 , the grandfatherly Italian cooking expert noted that in decades past , Italians in the region of Tuscany did eat cat meat .
Bigazzi , 77 , told viewers there was a saying for this time of year that " if you do n't have meat , kill the cat . "
The popular TV chef then went on to describe how you can tenderize the meat by letting it soak for three days in running spring water .
As Chef Beppe continued , his co-host of ' La Prova del Cuco , ' Elisa Isoardi looked aghast .
The young hostess declared " My Othello in a stew ?
No ! "
Othello is the name of her pet cat .
But Beppe was n't finished .
He told viewers he had dined on cat many times and that the meat tasted better than chicken or rabbit .
By this point , Isoardi was trying to hide behind a cart filled with vegetables .
Management at RAI - Uno suspended him immediately .
The chef said he has since been told he will not be appearing on the show again .
Carla Rocchi , President of Italy 's Animal Protection Association , said : " The truth is that Bigazzi only wanted this : his moment of fame .
He is getting it , but in a negative way . "
There were indications during the TV broadcast that Chef Beppe knew animal rights activists would respond .
He mentioned that while they would be upset , they were wrong to think animals like cats were any different from rabbits that are sold in Italian shops .
Interviewed at his apartment in Rome , Bigazzi told CNN : " It was a custom [ to eat cat ] all over Italy . "
" In Parmas the cat was nicknamed ' the rabbit that runs on roofs , ' in Liguria , the cat is nicknamed ' the rabbit with short ears , in Piemento it is called the ' rabbit that meows . '
Today we are scandalized by this .
Why ?
Because times have changed .
The cat has become a domestic animal .
This was not the case before . "
Bigazzi says that his father was imprisoned by the Russians and his farm family scraped by on what they could during the war .
" The chickens were for selling , " he said .
" The rabbits were for selling .
The cat was more difficult to sell , so we ate cat .
I have no shame of it . "
Rocchi responded : " Today , what is the point of talking about eating a cat , especially since it is prohibited by law ? "
An American volunteer at the famous Cat Sanctuary in the ruins of Torre Argentina in Rome said the debate over Chef Beppe 's comments may come to some good .
Andy DiPaula told CNN : " I think the real question which has been raised in a lot of people 's minds is , after all , if cats , why not rabbits , why not lambs , why not protect them as well ? "
The Cat Sanctuary is now something of a tourist attraction .
About 200 feral cats roam the ruins where Julius Caesar was said to have been assassinated in Ancient Rome .
The cats get food , shelter and veterinary care funded by public donations .
The number of feral cats in Rome has declined after a concerted effort to sterilize the animals that were suffering due to over - population .
Rome 's cats at the sanctuary can be adopted by the public .
" But not to anyone , " quipped DiPaula , " who arrives here with a cooking pan . "

Some time back I wrote about creating a number of konsoles automatically using dcop .
Although we were at the time well into the KDE4 era I had not yet upgraded since there were still things that were n't quite working with KDE4 , most of these have now been fixed so I 've upgraded some of my systems to KDE4 , which means it 's time to update the original code to now use dbus .
My first attempt at this was using dbus - send but after not making a lot of progress with that I tried using qdbus instead , this proved easier to use .
In re-implementing this code for KDE4 I also discovered a few things that are n't quite working yet in Konsole 's dbus interface :
It 's not yet possible to start a new konsole in another konsole window , all new konsoles appear in the current konsole .
My original code created a completely new konsole window and filled it with the new konsoles .
Since this is not yet implemented that feature is yanked .
Starting a console with a particular " Schema " is also not working yet .
The code for doing this is still in the sample below but it 's commented out .
Also note that schemas have been replaced by " profiles " in KDE4 .
There 's no way to activate a specific session yet using dbus .
At the top are the definitions of the konsoles that I want to start .
This is an array where each konsole is defined by 3 entries in the array : the first is the name that I want to give to the konsole tab , the second is the profile to use ( ignored for now since this is not working ) , and the third is the initial command to execute within the konsole .
sessions =( sh1 $ profile ' clear ; bash ' sh1 $ profile ' clear ; bash ' su1 $ profile ' clear ; su ' ssh1 $ profile ' clear ; ssh 127.0.0.1 ' )
After that is the start_sessions function which is quite similar to the original one from the KDE3 version of the code , the main difference being that it calls qdbus rather than dcop to interace with konsole .
To create a new session it does :
# Starting with a specific profile appears to be broken .
#local session_num=$( qdbus org.kde.konsole / Konsole newSession $ profile $ HOME ) local session_num = $ ( qdbus org.kde.konsole / Konsole newSession ) sleep 0.1
You 'll notice above that the call with the profile included is commented out as that call is still not working in KDE4 / Konsole .
To set the title of the session it does :
qdbus org.kde.konsole / Sessions / $ session_num setTitle 0 $ name sleep 0.1 qdbus org.kde.konsole / Sessions / $ session_num setTitle 1 $ name sleep 0.1
Title " 0 " appears to be the initial title , title " 1 " is the title used after commands are executed .
So if you do n't set title " 1 " then the tab title changes after each command that you enter .
To set the command to be run by the new konsole you send text to it :
qdbus org.kde.konsole / Sessions / $ session_num sendText " $ command " sleep 0.1 qdbus org.kde.konsole / Sessions / $ session_num sendText $ '
' sleep 0.1
The second send sends a newline so the konsole actually executes the command .
The main part of the script asks if you want to create the konsoles and executes start_sessions if you answer with something that looks like yes .
After starting the sessions it activates the first session .
As I mentioned above there 's no way to activate a specific session so the code activates the first session by activating the " previous " session multiple times .
# Activate first session .
while [ [ $ nsessions - gt 1 ] ] do qdbus org.kde.konsole / Konsole prevSession let nsessions -- done
Run this and you should get a konsole window that looks something like :
The entire code follows :
Tension is high across Greece , in the days before the start of Alexandros Grigoropoulos assassins murders .
Besides the intensifying winter urban guerrilla offensive in Athens , farmers are gradually blocking the entire national highway network , while the assassinated boy 's mother accuses the judicial authorities of both turning a blind eye both clues regarding the murder and inhibiting the proper course of the trial by transferring it in a remote mountain town .
The authorities had hoped that the postponing of Alexandros Grigoropoulos assassins ' trial would reduce the tension surrounding it .
Initially the trial was to be held in Athens and on the 15th of December 2009 .
However the authorities - claiming fear of more civil unrest - have decided to move the trial to Amfissa , a remote mountain town , for January 20th 2010 .
This has caused the outrage of the killed boys ' mother who applied twice against the move of the trial outside Athens and was rebuked twice by the judicial authorities .
In a last move of contempt towards the state 's maneuvers , the mother has published an open letter to the judges , which , besides pointing out that the accused are " subjects of privileged treatment " , notes that :
" a ) the persecution describes the malice of the accused as " possible " although it was immediate first order malice , as a result the judges ' decision is preempted
b ) both the interrogation and the judicial order does not take into account the possibility of the intended malicious murder of yet another person , the pupil N.P. who has declared that Ep. Korkoneas [ Alexandros ' murderer ] " shot against him " .
Lets not forget that there were two shots
c ) The second bullet was never sought at all by the authorities
d ) The trial has been moved to Amfissa , without waiting the decision of the European Court of Human Rights to which I have taken recourse .
The choice of Amfissa creates huge questions since :
e ) substantial witnesses have not been called by the persecuting authority
f ) the police - conduct files of the accused [ policemen ] has not been sought , so as to see if there are disciplinary rulings against them in the past , and to evaluate their personality " .
In the countdown to the trial , the authorities , obviously embarrassed by the revelations of the mother , have been plagued by a climate of rising tension that hardly resembles their desired state of " silence , order , and security " .
Farmers mobilisation has been intensifying by the day , with defense lawyers of the Grigoropoulos family , pointing out that it is doubtful that road access to Amfissa would be even open at the time of the trial .
The farmers ( who come under different unions ) have already set up 7 blockades on the national highway system hampering cross-country traffic , in some places to a complete standstill .
And this is only the start , a warning move in anticipation of the real thing starting on Monday when tractors are expected to be brought out in a massive " dynamic mobilisation " .
In Athens itself labour issues are not calm either .
After a month of strike the workers of Elite , the country 's second biggest shoe producing industry have stepped up their struggle by occupying the company 's main factory in Athens .
The workers are demanding immediate payment of salaries since November and transparency over the fate of the company ( which despite rising profits is threatening them with closure , in order to move the capital towards its retail branch ) .
The workers who marched at the midst of last week from their factory to the Ministry of Labour are demonstrating an impressive organisational and struggle cohesion which has won the solidarity of locals .
The closure of the factory would jeopardise the employment of 2,000 more workers in enterprises dependent on the industry .
Mr Lomberdos , the Minister of Labour , has ominously declared that he expects overall unemployment in the country to rise from 450,000 to 1,000,000 people within 2010 - a 20 % of the working force ( not including in the stats as unemployed the students and men performing their military service ) .
Finally , the intensification of what looks like a winter offensive by the urban guerrillas in Athens is yet another headache for the authorities .
On Friday night , just before the clock stroke midnight , a medium - force bomb blew the ground floor of the Ministry of Press ( aka General Secretariat of Information in socialist newspeak ) .
The bomb which did not cause any human injuries due to its being pre-announced to the press , destroyed large part of the premises as well as several parked cars and two fast - food shops which had been also evacuated .
At the time of writing no communique has been published claiming responsibility for the attack that comes less than a week after the bomb in the greek parliament 's front yard .
State Rep .
Sue Tibbs was one of the sponsors of a bill that makes it unlawful for “ any person to willfully fortify an access point into any dwelling , structure , building or other place where a felony offense prohibited by the Uniform Controlled Dangerous Substances
Act is being committed , or attempted , and the fortification is for the purpose of preventing or delaying entry or access by a law enforcement officer , or to harm or injure a law enforcement officer in the performance of official duties . ”
The law took effect Nov. 1 .
The law states that to “ fortify an access point ” means to willfully construct , install , position , use or hold any material or device designed to injure a person upon entry or to strengthen , defend , restrict or obstruct any door , window or other opening into a dwelling , structure , building or other place to any extent beyond the security provided by a commercial alarm system , lock or deadbolt , or a combination of alarm , lock or deadbolt .
The law carries punishment of imprisonment of not more than five years or by a fine up to $ 10,000 or by both .

SANTIAGO , Chile — Beware crossing Chile 's borders in possession of forbidden fruit .
As passengers flying into the Santiago airport cannot fail to notice , the government has embarked on an aggressive campaign to tell travelers that it means business when it comes to protecting Chilean food exports .
Stark warnings , zealous inspections , pitiless confiscations and Draconian fines safeguard Chilean produce from the pests and plagues that would jeopardize its plant and animal exports .
Brochures depict handcuffed tourists bearing apples and cheese , a suitcase with a scorpion ’s sting ( “ You ca n't imagine how dangerous your luggage might be ” ) and an apple in a surgical mask ( “ Do n’t infect our agriculture . ” )
Failure to declare could “ damage national production , instigate the need for eradication and controls , and result in major economic losses aggravated by diminished confidence in the markets for Chilean exports , ” warns the Agriculture and Livestock Service , known by its Spanish - language acronym SAG .
For travelers , getting nabbed brings fines running between $ 170 and $ 18,000 .
Chile ’s fertile central valleys put quality wine and winter fruits on U.S. tables , bring honey and asparagus to Europe and provision Asia with pork and poultry .
Salmon farms have transformed the landscape of its southern fjords ; pulp and timber from its forests are shipped around the globe .
Agriculture exports are second only to mining as Chile ’s top foreign exchange earner .
The country ’s export - oriented economy is built upon scores of free trade agreements that open access to foreign markets with demanding import standards .
Chile is separated from the rest of South America by the Andes Mountains along its eastern flank , its Pacific Ocean coastline , the Atacama Desert in the north and Patagonian glaciers to the south .
This isolation has kept it free of the diseases that could devastate its agriculture .
It ’s SAG ’s job to keep it that way .
“ Chile does n’t seal itself off from international trade ; it protects itself , ” said Ximena Gonzalez , head of the SAG Passenger Control unit at the Santiago airport .
The defensive stance has kept Chile free of plagues of fruit flies , vineyard moths , hoof - and - mouth , mad cow , bird flue , swine flu and a host of bacterial and fungus invaders .
Santiago ’s airport is the entry point for some 8,000 passengers a day , mostly Chileans returning from abroad and visitors from neighboring Peru , Bolivia and Argentina .
Dogs nose the luggage carousels as inspectors warn travelers to use the apple - shaped garbage bins to dispose of food morsels , plant cuttings or rustic handicrafts .
Some 60 agents at eight X - ray machines conduct bag - by - bag inspections , nabbing between 175 to 220 pounds of items every day .
“ We do n’t confiscate , we intercept , ” explained Gonzalez .
The distinction is lost on the 30 passengers , on average , who get slapped with fines averaging some $ 200 every day .
“ People get really upset , ” said SAG inspector Andres Benavente , recounting threats of blows over an apple from an irate Argentine and the tears of a Peruvian matron whose picnic basket full of roast guinea pig was seized .
Most of the booty is incinerated .
Andean folk guitars ( charangos ) made from armadillo hides , a popular souvenir , are deposited in the Natural History Museum .
Endangered wildlife , like the toucans discovered under a bus by SAG ’s canines , is returned to its country of origin .
Many travelers have a SAG saga to tell .
Like the $ 700 fine exacted from an elderly Ukrainian couple who neglected to declare the orange peels they had wrapped in plastic and intended to throw away .
Or the Venezuelan folk troupe whose concert was almost delayed when SAG inspectors “ intercepted ” their seed - filled maracas .
Or the Santiago resident who refused to foot the bill for SAG to fumigate the longhorn steer trophy he was bringing home , and now has a shorn and hornless cow head mounted on his wall .
Other travelers complain that SAG can be heavy - handed .
“ My mom , who speaks no Spanish , was pulled aside , separated from her traveling companion and subjected to two hours of ‘ being shamed ’ by a ‘ translator ’ who barely spoke English , ” recounted Shana Harrison .
“ After much negative headshaking and inability to communicate , SAG confiscated a bag of trail mix , presented her with a document in Spanish to sign , and made her pay an $ 80 fine . ”
SAG ’s attempts to communicate in English can also lead to confusion , as in its “ Clues for the Good Traveler ” tips posted on the Santiago airport website , which admonish tourists to “ remember not to bring organic food into the country . ”
One woman whose embassy job meant she spent lots of time at the airport waiting for foreign visitors to clear customs suggests : “ Big panels with big bins before getting to customs , leaflets in English and drawing before boarding the flight to Chile .
And not just the apple , but the wooden drumsticks , those straw sandals and hat .
All of it .
So many things we can't even imagine are made from plants . ”
Knowing the rules certainly helps , as Annalisa discovered .
" I 'm Italian and Parmesan cheese is important to me .
You ’re allowed to bring in Parmesan cheese if it 's labeled , but I did n't know that .
So on my first trip , they confiscated a big piece of cheese .
I would have eaten it on the spot rather than give it up , but fortunately , I had another five pieces hidden in my luggage . ”
For four days Gordon Thomas watched the horror of Haiti ’s earthquake unfold and wished that there was a way for him to help .
But the 30 - year - old San Diego man is a software engineer , not a medical doctor or a search - and - rescue expert who can drop everything and rush off to deliver emergency aid to the Caribbean island nation .
So on Saturday he decided to use the equivalent of a digital pick and shovel to help Haitians with the long - term job of digging out their quake - crushed country .
Thomas and about 45 other self - described “ techies and geo- geeks ” and other volunteers met at USC to collaborate on ways to use computers to design improved maps of battered Port - au - Prince neighborhoods , concoct better family - locater services for quake victims and speed more accurate and timely relief information from more closely coordinated data feeds .
Computer programmers organized companion “ Crisis Camp Haiti ” workshops Saturday in Northern California ’s Silicon Valley ; Boulder , Colo . ; Washington ; and London .
“ Being in San Diego , I did n’t think I could do much more than donate some money to help Haitians , ” Thomas explained as he worked on a mapping project .
“ We ’re trying to use technology that will identify the needs of non-government organizations on the scene , using simple cellphone - like communication that anyone can use . ”
Thomas persuaded a friend , San Diego software programmer Pranab Shenoy , 26 , to accompany him to the eight - hour session .
“ I ’m glad to be able to help by using the skills I have , ” Shenoy said .
Santa Barbara online mapping expert Chad Catacchio organized Saturday ’s Los Angeles workshop on about a day ’s notice .
He used the Internet to spread the word and recruit volunteers .
Among those who showed up on short notice were representatives of Google , NASA , the United Nations , the American Red Cross and the Los Angeles City Fire Department , said Catacchio , 33 .
“ The next time there ’s a crisis here or elsewhere , we ’re going to be better prepared .
We ’ll be able to hit the ground running , rather than limping , ” said Josh Rehman , a 34 - year - old computer programmer from Seal Beach .
Among the volunteers was Ghislaine Constant , 56 , of Hollywood , who has two family members in Haiti who have been missing since Tuesday ’s temblor .
She spent the afternoon translating neighborhood names from French and Creole into English for the programmers .
USC freshman Layne Kaplan volunteered to compile a running report on the workshop on Twitter with her laptop to help the techies communicate with “ Crisis Camp Haiti ” sites operating elsewhere .
In the middle of her work , Kaplan received a text message from her mother in Houston .
“ My mom said at least I ’m doing something productive , ” Kaplan said .
“ She said she ’s looking for something to do for Haitians too . ”

New research is casting doubt on the old adage , " All you need to run is a pair of shoes . "
Scientists have found that those who run barefoot , or in minimal footwear , tend to avoid " heel - striking , " and instead land on the ball of the foot or the middle of the foot .
In so doing , these runners use the architecture of the foot and leg and some clever Newtonian physics to avoid hurtful and potentially damaging impacts , equivalent to two to three times body weight , that shod heel - strikers repeatedly experience .
" People who do n't wear shoes when they run have an astonishingly different strike , " says Daniel E. Lieberman , professor of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University and co-author of a paper appearing this week in the journal Nature .
" By landing on the middle or front of the foot , barefoot runners have almost no impact collision , much less than most shod runners generate when they heel - strike .
Most people today think barefoot running is dangerous and hurts , but actually you can run barefoot on the world 's hardest surfaces without the slightest discomfort and pain .
All you need is a few calluses to avoid roughing up the skin of the foot .
Further , it might be less injurious than the way some people run in shoes . "
Working with populations of runners in the United States and Kenya , Lieberman and his colleagues at Harvard , the University of Glasgow , and Moi University looked at the running gaits of three groups : those who had always run barefoot , those who had always worn shoes , and those who had converted to barefoot running from shod running .
The researchers found a striking pattern .
Most shod runners -- more than 75 percent of Americans -- heel - strike , experiencing a very large and sudden collision force about 1,000 times per mile run .
People who run barefoot , however , tend to land with a springy step towards the middle or front of the foot .
" Heel - striking is painful when barefoot or in minimal shoes because it causes a large collisional force each time a foot lands on the ground , " says co-author Madhusudhan Venkadesan , a postdoctoral researcher in applied mathematics and human evolutionary biology at Harvard .
" Barefoot runners point their toes more at landing , avoiding this collision by decreasing the effective mass of the foot that comes to a sudden stop when you land , and by having a more compliant , or springy , leg . "
The differences between shod and unshod running have evolutionary underpinnings .
For example , says Lieberman , our early Australopith ancestors had less developed arches in their feet .
Homo sapiens , by contrast , has evolved a strong , large arch that we use as a spring when running .

" Our feet were made in part for running , " Lieberman says .
But as he and his co-authors write in Nature : " Humans have engaged in endurance running for millions of years , but the modern running shoe was not invented until the 1970s .
For most of human evolutionary history , runners were either barefoot or wore minimal footwear such as sandals or moccasins with smaller heels and little cushioning . "
For modern humans who have grown up wearing shoes , barefoot or minimal shoe running is something to be eased into , warns Lieberman .
Modern running shoes are designed to make heel - striking easy and comfortable .
The padded heel cushions the force of the impact , making heel - striking less punishing .
" Running barefoot or in minimal shoes is fun but uses different muscles , " says Lieberman .
" If you 've been a heel - striker all your life you have to transition slowly to build strength in your calf and foot muscles . "
In the future , he hopes , the kind of work done in this paper can not only investigate barefoot running , but can provide insight into how to better prevent the repetitive stress injuries that afflict a high percentage of runners today .
" Our hope is that an evolutionary medicine approach to running and sports injury can help people run better for longer and feel better while they do it , " says Lieberman , who has created a web site , www.barefootrunning.fas.harvard.edu, to educate runners about the respective merits of shod and barefoot running .
The Nature paper arose out of the senior honors theses of two Harvard undergraduates , William A. Werbel '08 and Adam E. Daoud ' 09 , both of whom went to Africa with Lieberman to help collect data for this study .
Lieberman 's co-authors on the Nature paper are Venkadesan and Daoud at Harvard ; Werbel , now at the University of Michigan ; Susan D'Andrea of the Providence Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Providence , R.I. ; Irene S. Davis of the University of Delaware ; and Robert Ojiambo Mang 'Eni and Yannis Pitsiladis of Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland .

# 19 ) Thinking about the economy Friday , September 26 , 2008
By now , most Americans have at least some inkling that the United States is in the midst of a grave economic crisis .
But after scouring Bedford Avenue and interviewing various individuals who seemed to be outwardly “ hip , ” I have come to the conclusion that hipsters do not have the slightest clue about anything relating to the economy , possibly less so than the average American ( see graph ) .
In order to help hipsters understand what is going on with major Wall Street financial institutions and the American economy , I have devised a simple analogy to outline the situation in terms hipsters can understand .
Let us pretend that the major players involved in the crisis are the members of the traditional hipster family , in which we have :
Daddy Warbucks , the successful businessman with several overseas bank accounts ( the American Government )
The two beloved children , we ’ll call them Fannie and Freddy ( The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation )
The second wife ( the American economy )
The coke - head hipster stepchild ( recipients of the $ 700 billion bailout plan )
The hipster ’s drug dealer ( foreign investors )
( NOTE : If you get lost , hover on the links for guidance )
It all began back when Fannie and Freddy were in high school .
They were ambitious children who got good grades and were involved in extra-curriculars .
To the delight of Daddy Warbucks , Freddy and Fannie were booming entrepreneurs like himself !
They each had their own lucrative lawn - mowing service and between the two of them , they mowed half of all the lawns in their suburban neighborhood .
But their success came at the expense of their peers : Because Daddy Warbucks was so proud of the kids for adopting his cutthroat Capitalist ideals , he supported their lawn - mowing company by sponsoring them so that the kids could keep their prices obscenely low and stomp out any hopes of another kid getting even a pity mow gig from a neighbor .
Daddy Warbucks was notorious for bragging about his children while golfing at the Country Club .
When other parents ( China and Europe ) would tell him about some of the problems they were facing with their kids ( ie : they played loud shitty music , talked back and were into drugs ) , Daddy Warbucks would always advise them to simply cut them off and let them fend for themselves until they “ shaped up ” — that was the only way they would build character and learn their lesson .
Eventually though , Fannie and Freddy got into trouble .
While outwardly , they appeared to have it all , they were secretly disturbed because their father had divorced their biological mother ( AKA : the founding fathers ’ democratic ideals ) and married a gold digging hussy who moved into the house with her awkward hipster child .
So Freddie and Fanny turned to drugs and alcohol to escape !
They started using their profits from their business to feed their new - found lifestyle , and then were always too hungover on the weekends to keep their neighbors ’ grass presentable .
Their clients began to stop paying in advance for their lawn - mowing services as Fannie and Freddy became more entrenched in delinquency .
Eventually , the two were busted by the cops for drinking underage and their father found a stash of Xanax in Freddy ’s sock drawer .
Instead of doing what he condescendingly advised other parents to do , Daddy Warbucks coddled Fannie and Freddy , took over their lawn - mowing business and sent them to a therapist who charged $ 300 an hour .
This prompted his Country Club buddies who had taken his advice ( and whose kids had subsequently sold all of the household appliances on eBay and ran away ) to lose all respect for him .
They shunned him on the golf field and did n’t even want to sit with him and his wife at dinner .
The hipster stepchild watched in silent amusement the whole time Fannie and Freddy were having problems .
All the while daddy Warbucks and his mother were busy paying attention to his beloved children , the hipster discretely started going to raves and snorting $ 100 up his nose nightly using the allowance his step dad gave him to stay out of his field of vision at all times .
NOBODY NOTICED !
The hipster stepchild got hella addicted , and started buying from dealers who fronted him massive amounts after his tolerance went up and his allowance would n’t cover his needs .
He kept promising the dealers that he would have access to his trust fund when he turned 18 in four months .
Soon enough , the hipster was fronted like 30 times the coke he had actually payed for .
Too bad for the hipster , one of the dealers needed money to pay for an abortion for one of his potential baby mamas .
The dealer demanded that he pay him immediately or else he would kill his mother !
First , the hipster tried to earn the money by soliciting at the Country Club , asking his stepfather ’s old friends for donations for Walk America and various other charities for fatal diseases .
But the Country Club friends were still embittered by Daddy Warbucks and would not even pledge 10 cents per mile !
“ We know how that family is , ” they would say .
Cokeless and hopeless , the hipster went on a frantic rampage throughout Daddy Warbucks ’ mansion , breaking irreplaceable vases .
His mother found him crying on the floor and the hipster confessed everything , breaking his mother ’s heart .
She became suicidal and stayed in bed for weeks on the verge of a depressive meltdown .
Worried his wife would intentionally overdose if he did n’t do something , Daddy Warbucks took it upon himself to help his stepchild , although he was weary after having gone through it with Fannie and Freddy .
He knew the hipster would need years of rehab , expensive therapy , and probably more drug money to taper him off in the meantime .
Not caring enough to monitor how the hipster ’s rehabilitation was going but intent on making a show of it to satisfy his wife , Daddy Warbucks devised a plan to cure everything by emptying the hipster ’s $ 700 billion trust fund into his checking account .
That way , the hipster could ( potentially ) pull himself out of his exuberant cracked - out life style and the avoidant father would n’t ever have to see a single bank statement and be forced to pretend to care !
And hey , if he relapsed , at least he could show his wife and the American people he tried .
***
From this explanation , event the soberist of hipsters should be able to piece together what went wrong with the American economy , maybe even relate it in some form of semi-inteligent conversation !
And for the elitist economists who are mocking my analogy , can you honestly tell me that ’s it ’s not better than the rest of them flying around ( or at least less worse ) ?

The Berlin anti-fascists waiting near the Spree River at 4:30 AM for the buses to Dresden were sleepy , cold and nervous .
Not without reason .
Some had faced the Nazis a year earlier .
Every year these latter day storm troopers try to misuse the emotions of Dresdeners mourning the loss of 25,000 to 35 000 people in the bombing inferno which incinerated the city on February 13th 1945 by downplaying the Holocaust and Nazi crimes in general .
The antifascists always oppose them .
But last year it was again they who were treated coolly by the authorities .
The police took their time at the city limits frisking them for weapons and then concentrated on protecting the Nazis .
While driving home , a bus load of union members was severely attacked by Nazis from Sweden ; one man ’s skull was fractured .
The attackers have never been apprehended ; the police said they were “ overburdened . ”
And this year the Nazis threatened to break all records with 10,000 adherents from near and far .
Just in case , the antifascists were given maps , telephone numbers and as well as tape for the bus windows in case stones were thrown .
They felt somewhat safer when they got moving , with 1300 people from Berlin .
When buses from the state of Brandenburg joined up they formed a convoy of 30 buses for the 2 - 3 hour trip .
The police checkup at the Dresden city limits was quicker and far less unfriendly this time .
They had barely arrived when they heard calls to “ Hurry up , our blockade is forming ! ”
Twenty - nine buses rolled in from all parts of Thuringia , others were arriving after a long night ’s trip from the Rhineland , a group from Vienna had arrived a day earlier .
Legislators from The Left held four “ open air caucus meetings ” and attracted local inhabitants ; a famous leftwing singer attracted more .
Before long four main groups had formed , with two to five thousand people each , waiting in the icy cold , sitting on mats , stamping their feet or sipping hot tea or soup , and effectively blocking off , from all sides , the big railroad station where the Nazis planned to start their march .
Two organizations had joined and prepared this demonstration for a whole year , the main one called “ Dresden - Nazi frei ” ( “ free of Nazis ” ) , the other using as its name the Spanish Civil War slogan , “ non pasaran . ”
Two very different events were planned across the Elbe River which bisects Dresden .
One was the habitual ceremony at the cemetery , in front of the memorial monument to all those who died during the inferno which engulfed Dresden 65 years ago .
The mayor of Dresden , the minister president of Saxony , of which Dresden is the capital , a leading rabbi and Jewish representative and other celebrities were present , but also a menacing contingent of black - clad Neo - Nazis , including some from their small but loud - mouthed caucus in the state legislature .
But this year the Dresden authorities had altered their previous attitude of routine , half - hearted opposition to the Nazis .
Looking in their direction , Mayor Helma Orosz , a Christian Democrat , spoke more clearly than many other politicians in recent years :
“ By working together and protesting jointly , opponents of the rightist extremists , whether they are radical leftists or Christian Democrats , antifascists or church groups , can prevent them from spreading their inhumane National Socialist ideology , their racism , anti-Semitism , their lies and their distortions of history …
“ Before Dresden burned , Semper ’s synagogue burned , Warsaw , Rotterdam and Coventry burned .
These truths must be used in confronting these latter - day warriors .
Dresden does not want them . ”
Last year ’s images of marching Nazis , sent out throughout the world , had evidently alarmed both Dresden ’s conservative leaders as well as a large number of its citizens .
In the early afternoon , it had been decided , a human chain would link the rebuilt synagogue with City Hall to demonstrate their opposition to the Nazis .
There were doubts as to whether the required 5000 people would take part .
But they did .
By 2 o’clock there were so many that the single chain became a double line .
Then it was extended around the Old Market Square , where thousands of corpses had been collected and burned in 1945 , then on to the newly - rebuilt Frauenkirche ( Church of Our Lady ) and the grandly rebuilt Opera House .
An estimated 15,000 took part , often for the first time in such a demonstration .
After the chain was dissolved some tried to cross the river to join the blockades , not easy because both a railroad bridge and some pedestrian bridges had also been blockaded .
Meanwhile tension was mounting at the railroad station , the same one from which a last group of Dresden Jews had been sent off to the death camps just before the bombing raid .
Police forces , three deep , protected the Nazis when they marched from their buses to the station , though some smaller gangs vandalized through the area , attacking one left - wing youth center and injuring several of its defenders , one of them severely .
There were a few minor skirmishes with less disciplined anti-fascists , the violence - prone types who join in most demonstrations .
But most Nazis were finally cordoned off by the police in front of the station , impatient , angry , occasionally violent – but cornered .
Although the courts had given official permission for the Nazi march , against the protest of the city of Dresden , a police spokesman said that the force of almost 5700 in uniform , plus 1700 as reinforcements from other states , was unable to break up the blockades of the antifascists , now at least 10,000 in number , and including both elderly people and women with children .
All they could do was maintain the safety of the estimated 6400 fascists in front of the station until 5 PM , when the time allotted them for their demonstration ran out , and then get them away safely .
So the crowd , overwhelmingly young , with many from The Left and from several Communist parties , also from union groups as well as some Greens and leftwing Social Democrats , waited patiently in the cold , kept their ears to their cell phones and pocket radios and waited for new developments .
They cheered at 5 o’clock when the police announced that the Nazi march had been canceled but stayed on to make sure and then cheer even louder at about 7 PM when the police refused the Nazi demand to march back to their buses and loaded them instead on trains which kept them off the streets .
And then , in a twitter message , the top Nazis made it official : “ The mourning march did not take place . ”
After a final victory meeting the demonstrators ended the ten hour blockades and headed home .
It was good that the mayor and the big shots had also opposed the Nazis and that so many people in Dresden had given up their apathy and joined them .
It was a surprise that this time the police had been fairer than ever before in recent years .
But the real victory lay in stopping the Nazis , and just possibly making them give up Dresden marches in the future .
That , the tired antifascists were convinced , as they headed for home , had been achieved by their powerful blockades .
Many of them wo n’t be waiting a year to demonstrate again .
Only one week later , Saturday , February 20th , a demonstration is scheduled in Berlin to pressure the Bundestag and German government leaders to pull the troops out of Afghanistan .

Team US F1 is the subject of an FIA inspection on Wednesday about its state of readiness for the new season , AUTOSPORT has learned , amid fresh doubts about the American outfit 's hopes of competing in 2010 .
Less than 24 hours after a senior staff member at the Charlotte - based operation revealed the troubles the team is in , high level sources have told AUTOSPORT that the FIA is now taking a detailed look at the team .
AUTOSPORT understands that FIA technical delegate Charlie Whiting is visiting US F1's headquarters to get an update on its progress for 2010 - and just how ready it is to compete this year .
The visit , which has not been officially confirmed by either US F1 or the FIA , comes in the wake of speculation that team backer Chad Hurley is trying to complete a deal with either Campos Meta or Stefan GP to merge operations and keep US F1's ambitions on track .
On Tuesday , Hurley was singled out as the man one senior staff member at US F1 believes is key to brokering a deal to help it survive .
" We feel Hurley and Parris Mullins [ adviser to Hurley ] have our best interest [ at heart ] and also feel Hurley has no intention of abandoning us even though the media has said he 's gone with Campos , " the staff member told AUTOSPORT .
" With all this talk about where US F1 is at , it 's been missed that there are 60 + people who have had to suffer through this for the last two months .
All of us left jobs and many of us travelled cross-country for this opportunity .
" In a meeting between the employees , Windsor and Anderson , Windsor put the question up to the employees : ' Who here does n't think we 'll make Bahrain ? '
I think he might have meant it somewhat rhetorically , but he was answered nonetheless , and 100 per cent of the staff raised their hands .
He was visibly shocked .
" But having said that , throughout the turmoil , the team has really come together and we 're all committed to the project ; precious few have left in spite of the uncertainty of whether we 'll be paid this Friday .
I 've never seen such dedication . "
The FIA declined to confirm the inspection is taking place .
When contacted by AUTOSPORT an FIA spokesman said : " We have no comment to make , at this stage . "
UPDATE : Download the improved version of the application .
I have made some code changes after the blog post got posted to reddit .
The source code is now more readable and the app easily configurable .
I am amazed to see the implementation of cron jobs on Google App Engine .
I was hosting my twitter bots on my paid shared hosting .
My scripts were written in php and they were run via cron jobs set from my cPanel .
Of course the cPanel cron UI is now quite familiar to me , to us who use it very often .
But as a matter of fact , I ca n’t run per minute cron on my host .
I should have a minimum interval of 15 minutes between two execution of the same cron job .
I was amazed when I first discovered that Google App Engine lets me run cron every minute .
Since they calculate my usage in different types of quotas , they hardly care about how often you schedule your cron .
So , I decided to port my twitter bots to GAE and Python .
The idea was pretty simple .
I already had a Yahoo !
Pipe setup which mashes up multiple RSS feeds into one .
My app will be collecting data from the pipe in JSON format .
Then it ’ll check the last tweeted entry and tweet the newer entries .
Pretty straightforward algorithm .
I registered a new application for my bots and started developing it on my local machine .
I integrated the u.nu url shortening service with their API quite easily .
Though Python 2.6.2 has a built in module for JSON handling , Python 2.5 does n’t have it .
So , I had to install simplejson for JSON decoding .
Later , I moved on to finding a good twitter client for my app .
I first tried python - twitter .
I have previously used it and it worked fine .
But the application was generating some error messages when I integrated into GAE .
I was puzzled and tried to find if there was something wrong in my coding .
After about an hour , I concluded that my code was okay !
There ’s something wrong with the client .
A bit of googling revealed that “ python - twitter ” does n’t work on GAE without any hacks :'( .
I had to find an alternative and I chose tweepy for that .
It was working fine with the app .
Finally after 3 hours , the app was ready and it ’s working !
GAE does n’t permit long execution period for a process , so I had to decrease the amount of tweets per request .
But I covered that up by setting a more frequent cron job :) .
I would try the new taskqueue API soon to see if that has any help for my app .
My twitter bots have proved handy in the past and it feels great that I can host them on a scalable and efficient platform like Google App Engine — without paying a single dollar per month ! 😀

Sacre bleu – as they 're all apparently panting over the Channel .
Just when you thought it was safe to go back between the sheets , a group of researchers claim that they have found the G - spot – in France .
At last week 's gynaecologists ' conference in Paris ( what is the collective noun for a group of gynaecologists ? ) , organiser Sylvain Mimoun declared that 60 per cent of women have one , and that proper " interaction " with it can make it increasingly " functional " .
The doctors then could n't resist thumbing their noses at the British scientists who recently claimed to have proved the non-existence of the G - spot after they studied 1,800 exceptionally patient identical twins .
" The King 's College study shows a lack of respect for what women say , " sneered a " leading French surgeon " , Pierre Foldes .
" The conclusions were completely erroneous because they were based solely on genetic observations .
It is clear that in female sexuality there is a variability .
It can not be reduced to a yes or no or an on or off . "
Gynaecologist Odile Buisson added : " I do n't want to stigmatise at all , " before going on to stigmatise the British researchers .
" I think the Protestant , liberal , Anglo - Saxon character means you are very pragmatic .
There has to be a cause for everything , a gene for everything .
It 's totalitarian . "
Ouch .
Recent research at this elusive front line of human knowledge has proved inconclusive , to say the least .
In 2008 , an Italian researcher , Professor Emmanuele Jannini , claimed to have located the G - spot with ultrasound .
His study , involving only 20 women ( presumably he could n't persuade any more to keep still for long enough ) , suggested that women who claimed to experience vaginal orgasms had a small area of thicker tissue on the front wall of their vaginas , while those who said they did n't , did not .
This tissue , he decided , must be the spot .
This would appear to be typical of the geographical whimsy with which the mystical G - spot appears to operate ( or not ) .
It was " discovered " in 1944 in Germany by a gynaecologist , Ernst Gräfenberg ( not to be confused with the physicist Robert J Van de Graaff , who made his research assistants ' hair stand on end in a very different way ) .
In the manner of many great scientific discoveries , nobody knows what Gräfenberg was actually looking for when he happened upon the G - spot , but it turned out to be the thing that made him famous and he gave his name ( or at least his initial ) to it .
It then got lost for several decades , before turning up again in 1982 in a book by the American sexologist Beverly Whipple : The G - Spot and Other Discoveries About Human Sexuality .
Following a lot of argy - bargy in the Sixties and Seventies , which made urology a feminist issue , the Italian research appeared to be conclusive ; until it was contradicted by the British research , which was in turn disputed by the French .
Women who believe that they have a G - spot often report that it seems to move around a lot .
This time , it must have moved to France .
Some British women find it dispiriting to be told about the non-existence of the G - spot ; but still more are disappointed to hear all these French women bragging about having them while we , instead , have fluoridisation and proper tea .
" Weeth zees long 'olidays we 'ave plenty of time for ze looking , " they seem to be saying .
" We 'ave it , ze G - spot .
It ees 'ere ! "
Yet others are murmuring that it seems a peculiar preoccupation of ( mostly male ) research scientists to want to find something that many rational people are certain is n't there .
South Americans have El Dorado .
The French have their G - spot .
We have the Loch Ness monster .
Each to his ( or her ) own .
Even among those fortunate devils who are certain that the G - spot exists , opinion varies wildly on where it is , what it does and how exactly one is supposed to find it .
The clinical opinion has it located on the anterior wall of the vagina , between a third and a half of the way up , and about the size of a pea , or a 20 p piece , depending on how competitive you are .
As a literal stab in the dark , others recommend checking a couple of inches below the belly button .
( For those of you who are about to pass this section on to your partner , it will be about two minutes and 20 seconds before she starts measuring two inches from her belly button with her fingers . )
Recent hopes that Apple was about to unveil an electronic device that could do absolutely anything were dashed when it became obvious that the iPad cannot in fact locate the G - spot .
Nor can it fit in your handbag , which is another reason why women are disappointed by it .
And no , sadly it is not worth entering " G - spot " into your satnav .
You will only get a cold , angry voice repeating : " Stop .
Turn around .
Go back to the beginning .
Recalculating ... "
And it wo n't be the satnav .
Perhaps the former Cosmopolitan editor Marcelle D'Argy Smith put it best when she wrote : " It was rather like the Barbican in London .
You knew people who said they 'd found their way there , but you never had . "
( If you are reading this after your partner has passed it on to you , now you know why he has just boasted that he knows his way to the Barbican . )
Perhaps unexpectedly , given that proponents of the G - spot claim that it gives them explosive orgasms with a certain extra ooh - la - la , not everyone is a fan of the Great Spot .
Most of them blame Sigmund Freud ( and why not ? ) for his " groundbreaking " theories regarding " the dark continent " of women 's sexuality : clitoral orgasms are " infantile " , he argued , whereas the only form of orgasm available to ladies should come from within .
This was very easily ridiculed using some basic research on smutty lesbian stump - tail macaques ( The Case of the Female Orgasm : Bias in the Science of Evolution , Elisabeth Lloyd ) and the experiences of almost all actual women , but the credence given to Freud 's pronouncements was so profound that generations of women despaired they were doing it All Wrong .
Freud 's most famous critic must be Shere Hite , whose 1976 Hite Report : A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality aimed to dispel the " myth " of the vaginal orgasm .
She criticised Masters and Johnson 's ideas that " thrusting " alone should provide enough stimulation for the selfish woman .
She pooh - poohed Kinsey 's entreaties for ladies to find pleasure in the " plateau " .
Seventy per cent of women who did not have orgasms through intercourse , she discovered , were able to achieve orgasm easily by masturbation or other direct stimulation of the clitoris .
Amazingly , this came as a surprise to women in 1976 , and apparently still needs to reiterated today .
She recently declared : " Female orgasm is a metaphor for political change .
Changing our idea of coitus and ' how it should be performed ' is key to changing the larger society . "
( If your partner now turns to you and whispers seductively , " Hey baby , come over here and let 's make a change in larger society , " you 'll know by now what she 's up to . )
Paradoxically , some of the most convincing arguments against the importance of the G - spot are those advanced by true G - spot evangelists , who insist that anybody who has n't found theirs is a loser who can't really be having proper fun .
Such as the biologist Desmond Morris , whose 2004 book The Naked Woman ( oh , please ! ) identified not one but four spots with which we should all be getting to grips : the A , C , G and U - spots .
Or the folk behind the Pelvic Toner , who surveyed more than 2,000 women for 2008 's " National Orgasm Day " .
" The G - spot is not a myth , " declared their report , somewhat grandly .
" Seventy - five per cent of women claim to have one .
And women who do n't think they have a G - spot rarely orgasm . "
Well do n't those 25 per cent suckers feel bad now ?
The report then goes on to admit that " 72 per cent of women say they are aware of their G - spot but its location varies significantly ... 50 per cent place the G - spot just inside their vagina , while 35 per cent say it 's deep inside .
The remaining 15 per cent locate it elsewhere ! "
Where , exactly ?
The back of the neck ?
The armpit ?
The fridge ?
Perhaps , given the controversy of the subject and the elusiveness of conclusive answers , the French and the British , the Freudians and the feminists could agree on one thing : it 's probably quite good fun looking .
G does n't have to be for groaning , therefore .
G could be for go .
The G - spot by numbers
60 percentage of women said to have a G - spot .
1 the number of times women think about sex each day .
90 percentage of women who say they cannot find the G - spot .
£ 700 cost of " G - spot amplification " treatment .
During the process , collagen is injected into the G - spot area to double its size .
It only lasts three or four months though .
Mules , long noted for stubbornness , would seem to have nothing on either the music labels or Jammie Thomas - Rasset .
Both sides have dug in deep and are prepared , almost unbelievably , to have a third trial on the question of whether Thomas - Rasset was a dirty P2P pirate ... and of what she should pay if she was .
Thomas - Rasset was the first US defendant of the RIAA lawsuit campaign to take her case all the way to trial .
That first trial in 2007 found her liable for copyright infringement and fined her $ 222,000 .
She was then granted a retrial by the judge on the grounds that he had been misled on one particular jury instruction that described simply " making available " a copyrighted file as copyright infringement .
Citing Eight Circuit precedent , the judge decided that this was n't good enough and that only actual proof of a file transfer could be counted .
At the second trial , in 2009 , Thomas - Rasset was again found liable , but the jury this time fined her $ 1.92 million .
Last week , federal judge Michael Davis decided that this was " monstrous " in its disproportionality and slashed the damages to $ 54,000 .
The recording industry could either accept his decision or request a third trial .
The RIAA then sent a letter to Thomas - Rasset 's lawyers with an alternate offer .
Thomas - Rasset could settle for only $ 25,000 ( " We are willing to negotiate a payment schedule for this sum , " said a copy of the letter seen by Ars ) , and she would n't even need to pay the labels — all cash could go to a charity benefiting musicians .
The entire settlement would be conditioned on the judge vacating his recent remittitur order .
" We do not believe embarking on a third trial is in anyone 's interest , " said the letter .
" Continuing to use scarce judicial resources as well as spend our respective clients ' time and money strikes as unwise and pointless . "
It does not strike Thomas - Rasset that way .
While the RIAA asked for an answer by Friday , January 29 , Thomas - Rasset 's lawyers have already responded : no deal .
I checked in with Kiwi Camara , one of Thomas - Rasset 's lawyers .
who confirmed that the settlement was ruled out .
He added that Thomas - Rasset would likewise rule out any settlement asking her to pay damages , and that the Camara & Sibley law firm was ready to represent her pro bono once more .
Third time 's the charm ?
It 's hard to see how this will play out , but a few things are clear : Judge Davis , despite strong criticism of the damage award , had no kind words for Thomas - Rasset .
He noted that " Thomas ‐ Rasset ’s refusal to accept responsibility for her actions and her decision to concoct a new theory of the infringement casting possible blame on her children and ex‐boyfriend for her actions demonstrate a refusal to accept responsibility and raise the need for strong deterrence . "
The judge even concluded that she " lied on the witness stand by denying responsibility for her infringing acts and , instead , blamed others , including her children , for her actions . "
Given the facts in the case , which after two trials do n't appear to be in dispute , it 's hard to see how Thomas - Rasset hopes to prevail without paying a dime , but that appears to be the plan .
If she had been willing to pay something , she would have done so long ago , when the RIAA offered her a settlement of a few thousand dollars .
Instead , Thomas - Rasset has spent years of her life working with two law firms on two federal trials , and she 's willing to risk a third .
The stubbornness is n't just on one side of the aisle , however .
The RIAA is completely unwilling to abide Judge Davis ' ruling that the jury 's damage award was excessive .
Accepting the ruling would set an unacceptable precedent for judges to alter jury awards in copyright cases at their whim .
It 's not the amount , but the principle — something shown by the fact that the trade group is willing to drop roughly a bazillion dollars more on the Denver law firm that has been prosecuting the case in order to do it all again .
In addition , conversations with industry lawyers and executives over the years have also revealed a strong sense that Thomas - Rasset needs to take responsibility and pay something ; there 's a very real sense that , apart from issue of statutory damage law , Thomas - Rasset is thumbing her nose at the industry and hoping to get away with no penalty .
Thus — a third trial .
" It is a shame that Ms. Thomas - Rasset continues to deny any responsibility for her actions rather than accept a reasonable settlement offer and put this case behind her , " RIAA spokesperson Cara Duckworth told Ars .
" Given this , we will begin preparing for a new trial . "
Camara & Sibley are also ready to go , so it looks like everyone will trek back to Minnesota to rehash the same issues for a third time .
Judge Davis ' patience with the entire proceeding seems thin ; he has already trashed two jury verdicts and called publicly on Congress to change the law , but he has also made clear that Thomas - Rasset should take responsibility .
The judge must be about as thrilled as we are to see the case take up another full week on his docket .
Class - action suit against labels still coming
Much more interesting , however , would be a major class - action lawsuit against the recording industry .
Such a lawsuit would get even more intriguing if the prosecuting lawyers said that they plan to " get the $ 100 million that [ the RIAA ] stole " by suing people and collecting settlements .
( The RIAA says it has not earned $ 100 million from the campaign , and that it actually lost money after paying all the lawyers . )
That 's exactly what Camara plans to do .
He told us about it last year but indicated that the case would be coming by the end of summer 2009 .
Is the case still in the works ?
Camara tells us today that it is .
We 've just posted a short excerpt from our footage with the pilots who fly unmanned Predator and Reaper planes over Iraq and Afghanistan .
The planes are in the war zones ; the pilots are at an Air Force base in the desert north of Las Vegas .
A colonel tells us how his unit struggles against the possibility of detachment as they experience combat remotely .
Some pilots , however , are able to so completely immerse themselves in conducting battle via video screen that their nightly return to suburban life in Las Vegas becomes all the more jarring and challenging .
Watch our rough cut here , and let us know what you think -- there 's a space for comments directly below the video .
As the national debate over strategy in Afghanistan rages ( see FRONTLINE 's season - premiere report , " Obama 's War " ) , we would love to hear your thoughts .

Search Engine Giant Censors Alex Jones Material For “ Advocating Against a Protected Group ”
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , February 16 , 2010
Google has sensationally banned all sales through its shopping merchant of a DVD critical of the Obama administration under the terms of its program policy which bars any material deemed to be “ advocating against a protected group ” .
Apparently , Google considers the government to be a “ protected group , ” and immune from criticism .
Radio talk show host Alex Jones ’
Google merchant account has been completely disabled after the search engine giant sent an email claiming the products listed promoted violence , and refused to link to them on the Infowars Yahoo shopping cart .
“ I had our new employee Thomas try to get our products from our Yahoo Store get sent to Google shopping so people using google shopping can view our products and purchase them .
We went through the steps of signing up for a Google Merchant Account and then submitted our entire product list , ” writes Infowars staff member Tim Fruge .
“ We were denied .
I said OK , we ’ll try it again with just a few products .
Thinking maybe certain items were possibly flagging it .
So we tried it with just a few of Alex ’s DVD ’s only …. nope , still denied .
So , I said let ’s just try listing Fall Of The Republic .
Still denied !
We had to contact Google to find out what was going on and that ’s when we got the response attached to this email .
Just a blanket response , basically calling us a hate group or something to that effect . ”
When Fruge questioned Google as to why the account had been disabled , he received the following response .
Hello ,
Thank you for your email .
Your data feed contains listings for items that do n’t comply with our Program Policies .
Anti and Violence : products and associated websites may not promote violence or advocate against a protected group .
This standard applies to everyone who wants to post on Google , whether we agree with their viewpoint or not .
A protected group is distinguished by their race or ethnic origin , color , national origin , religion , disability , sex , age , veteran status , or sexual orientation / gender identity .
Visit http://www.google.com/support/merchants/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=160074 to ensure all your items comply with our Program Policies .
Sincerely ,
The Google Team
“ So basically Google is censoring Fall Of The Republic on Google Shopping for the above stated reason .
While The Turner Diaries , and many , many more books that are blatantly racist are allowed , ” writes Fruge .
We were eventually able to get our products listed on Google but only through a third party that links to the Google base network .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The fact that Google openly admits to censoring material that is “ anti ” anything is a startling insight into their distain for free speech .
People who consider themselves “ anti-homosexuality ” or “ anti-Christianity ” and make films or write books about it would consider their point of view to constitute freedom of speech , but not according to Google , who selectively choose which groups are allowed to be criticized and which are not .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
You may have a personal dislike for old people or be not particularly fond of the French – that ’s hate speech according to Google ’s policies .
However , the fact that Google allows the sale of clearly racist items such as The Turner Diaries , while censoring films critical of the Obama administration , is an obvious double standard .
At no point whatsoever throughout the nearly 2 and a half hour long documentary Fall of the Republic is violence against anyone advocated .
What the film does expose is how Obama abandoned his promise of change and is hastily implementing and expanding the same financial and geopolitical policies advanced under Bush .
This message has been received by millions of people who have seen different free versions of the film on You Tube .
Maybe the fact that Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt , a man who recently spelled out pretty clearly the disregard Google has for your privacy , campaigned for Obama and appeared with him at town hall meeting held at Google headquarters in November 2007 , has something to do with the anti-Obama film disappearing from Google ’s merchant website .
Of course , Google can ultimately refuse to carry any material they like because their servers are their own private property , but when an organization that now plays such a massive role in numerous facets of our life takes on the role of the thought police , we should be drastically concerned , especially considering the fact that Google recently announced its intention to establish a working relationship with the National Security Agency , the government spy force responsible for warrantless monitoring of Americans ’ phone calls and e-mails in the wake of 9/11 .
Of course , seasoned readers will know that Alex Jones has been a constant target of the Google thought police for years .
Last year , You Tube , which is owned by Google , pulled the Alex Jones Channel on the flimsiest of pretexts and only agreed to restore it after thousands of people complained .
In 2007 , Google deleted a short news clip highlighting the BBC Building 7 fiasco , despite the fact that the clip clearly constituted fair use .
Despite the story receiving widespread attention from a myriad of mainstream news outlets , for days Google censored all information relating to Charlie Sheen ’s comments about 9/11 first made to The Alex Jones Show in March 2006 .
More recently , Google was accused of censoring search results related to the Climategate global warming scandal .
Shortly after Google entered the Chinese search engine market and complied with demands from the Communist Chinese government that its content be censored , the company pulled a statement from its website that assured readers
Google did n’t censor search results – now they do .
Google ’s foundiing mantra was “ do n’t be evil , ” and yet the company ’s actions in censoring DVD ’s critical of the U.S. government represents precisely that – an insidious , hypocritical and evil assault on the First Amendment .

Comment on this article
A student who was suspended for creating a Facebook group critical of a teacher will be allowed to sue the principal of her former high school , according to Magistrate Judge Barry L. Garber .
In his ruling , Garber denied the principal 's attempt to have the case dismissed , noting that Evans ' activities were done at home and that she made nonthreatening statements that did not result in any kind of school disruption .
As a result , Evans is finally allowed to move forward with her suit two years after it started .
The now - 19 - year - old Evans had created a Facebook group in 2007 to criticize a teacher that she had clashed with ; the group was called " Ms. Sarah Phelps is the worst teacher I 've ever met . "
On the group 's wall , Evans had invited other students who did n't like Ms. Phelps to " express [ their ] feelings of hatred . "
Two days later , Evans thought better of her decision and deleted the Facebook group .
Apparently not many others knew about it , as it only attracted a couple of postings that chastised Evans before the group was removed .
The principal of the school , Peter Bayer , caught wind of the group and suspended Evans for cyberbullying and disruptive behavior .
In addition to her suspension , Evans was removed from all of her AP classes ( which would have sent me into convulsions ) and was forced to enroll in " lesser weighted " classes .
Evans filed a lawsuit against Bayer shortly thereafter , arguing that she was engaged in nonviolent , off - campus activities and that the punishment essentially ruined her academic reputation thanks to violations of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights .
She 's not asking for much —
Evans asked for her suspension to be expunged and a " nominal fee " for the violation of her rights .
The case has been going back and forth ever since .
Bayer moved to have the suit dismissed , claiming that qualified immunity should shield him from litigation .
Judge Garber disagreed , writing that qualified immunity does n't necessarily shield Bayer , and that Evans ' actions did n't qualify as on - campus speech despite targeting a particular audience at her school .
Additionally , Garber wrote that there was no proof of disruption — Bayer did n't even learn about the page until after it had been deleted — leaving only the opportunity to punish .
Bayer had tried to argue that Evans ' speech could constitute libel or defamation , but the judge responded by saying that " a statement of pure opinion does not give rise to a defamation action . "
Not every case involving student speech has been as cut - and - dried , though .
Students do n't have it as easy as those of us who are out of school when it comes to expressing their sometimes controversial views online , in part because anything that 's even remotely school - related is usually argued as a disruption .
( Add to this the fact that kids are usually not as guarded as Evans apparently was , and usually go further than necessary in expressing their distaste for school officials . )
For example , a federal judge recently ruled that a Pennsylvania school could suspend two eight - graders for creating a fake MySpace profile for their principal depicting him as a pedophile and a sex addict .
Even though most of these activities are technically taking place while the students are at home , judges are finding themselves deciding with increasing frequency whether the activities qualify as " on-campus " when they target other students or teachers .
At the same time , other judges have moved to protect student speech , such as one case where an Indiana student 's online speech against a teacher was ruled constitutional despite being laden with expletives .
Evans ' case still needs to play out in court , so it 's a bit early to call this development a victory for student speech .
The ACLU in Florida applauded the decision to let Evans ' lawsuit move forward , however , telling the New York Times that it 's still a victory for Internet free speech .
" [ I ]t upholds the principle that the right to freedom of speech and expression in America does not depend on the technology used to convey opinions and ideas , " ACLU associate legal director Maria Kayanan said .

Amateur astronomers are a unique species worthy of their own reality TV show .
Their craftsmanship , resourcefulness , dedication , and passion is simply amazing .
Many professional astronomers rely heavily on amateurs for quick spot checks , discovery followups , collaboration on research projects , the diverse locations of their telescopes and their ability / willingness to put in long hours of observation .
So what is spectroscopy , and what do the amateur astronomers get up to ?
Absorption spectroscopy is the study of the color and light spectrum of stars and galaxies .
We all love our Hubble photos and pretty astro- photographs , however most of the real research and science comes from observing the light spectrum .
Robin Leadbeater ’s LHIRESIII Spectrograph
Astronomers look at emission lines and absorption lines in the spectra to determine the make up of stars , nebulas and galaxies .
Dopler effects , orbital behavior , elements of stars , even atmospheres can be determined by observing these absorption and emission lines .
Scientists believe that a carbon dioxide absorption spectrum line signature in the spectrum of a star with a transiting exo-planet could eventually be the most exciting discovery – a possible indicator of extra-terrestrial life .
Why are amateurs interested ?
I asked Ken Harrison the moderator of the Yahoo group – Astronomical Spectroscopy , why amateurs would be interested in absorption spectra ?
“ I see it as the “ last frontier ” for amateur astronomers .
When you ’ve taken the 100th image of the Orion nebulae – what do you do next ??
It ’s challenging , interesting and can give some scientific value to your work .
Amateurs have successfully recorded the spectra of nova before the professionals and complimented other variable star work with observations of the changing spectral emissions of stars showing their Doppler shifts and atmospheric changes . ”
Ken specializes in the spectra of Wolf - Rayet stars and is currently writing a book on amateur spectroscopy .
Ken has been building his own spectrographs since 1992 and has used a variety of devices ranging from a simple star analyzer on a digital SLR camera to a sophisticated guided spectrograph .
A spectrograph allows light to pass through a narrow slit where it is then split into it ’s spectra by passing through some sort of diffraction grating , before being captured on a CCD .
The plate scale of the CCD then comes into play as angstroms per pixel instead of the usual ( astrometric measure ) arc / secs per pixel .
Rob Kaufman recently captured a Nova outburst Nova Scuti 2009 ( V496 SCT ) between the trees and clouds from his back yard .
Italian amateur Fulvio Mete has achieved a spectrographic separation of tight binary Beta Aurigea .
The double Ha absorption line is easily identifiable in his image taken with a 14inch Celestron .
Some of the world ’s best telescopes are unable to separate Beta Aurigea optically , so being able to do a spectrographic separation with a back yard telescope is a significant achievement .
Perhaps there is no finer example of the quality of the spectroscopy done by amateurs than the current citizen science project on the eclipse of binary Epsilon Aurigae .
Robin Leadbeater from Three Hills Observatory , a team member / contributor to the Citizen Sky project and avid amateur astronomer , has documented the changing spectra of Epsilon Aurigae , in particular monitoring the changing KI ( neutral potassium ) 7699 absorption line during the early stages of the ingress .
The eclipse happens every 27 years and this eclipse will be the first to be fully documented with advanced spectroscopy – clearly alot of that will be performed by skillful amateurs .
So what equipment do I need ?
Ken Harrison comments that the equipment required is not necessarily expensive and it is a lot of fun .
“ Luckily with the filter gratings available at reasonable prices ( Star Analyser , Rainbow Optics etc ) interested amateurs can start using their current equipment with minimal cost and outlay .
Freeware programs like IRIS ( C Buil ) and VSpec ( V Desnoux ) allow the detailed analysis of spectra to be done without all the mathematics or detailed physics .
As experience grows so do the questions .
What do those absorption features mean ?
Why does this spectrum look completely different from that spectrum ?
How can I get benn resolution ?
Yes , it has its learning curve like any new adventure , but there are many others who have trodden the road before and only too willing to assist –
To boldly go where few amateurs have gone before – Spectroscopy !!! ”
Dale Mais another dedicated amateur from Orange Grove , San Diego County has an excellent paper on qualitative and quantitative analysis that can be achieved by amateur astronomers .
The contribution of amateurs across all forms of astronomy is significant , and spectroscopy is no exception .
If you want more information join one of the Yahoo groups or major amateur astronomy forums as they all have discussion groups with experienced people who are keen to help you get started .
Special thanks to Ken Harrison , Robin Leadbeater , Rob Kaufman , Fulvio Mete and Dale Mais for your photos and insight !
THIS STORY IS NOT ABOUT THE origins of 2008 ’s financial meltdown .
You ’ve probably read more than enough of those already .
To make a long story short , it was a perfect storm .
Reckless lending enabled a historic housing bubble ; an overseas savings glut and an unprecedented Fed policy of easy money enabled skyrocketing debt ; excessive leverage made the global banking system so fragile that it could n’t withstand a tremor , let alone the Big One ; the financial system squirreled away trainloads of risk via byzantine credit derivatives and other devices ; and banks grew so towering and so interconnected that they became too big to be allowed to fail .
With all that in place , it took only a small nudge to bring the entire house of cards crashing to the ground .
But that ’s a story about finance and economics .
This is a story about politics .
It ’s about how Congress and the president and the Federal Reserve were persuaded to let all this happen in the first place .
In other words , it ’s about the finance lobby — the people who , as Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - Ill . ) put it last April , even after nearly destroying the world are “ still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill .
And they frankly own the place . ”
But it ’s also about something even bigger .
It ’s about the way that lobby — with the eager support of a resurgent conservative movement and a handful of powerful backers — was able to fundamentally change the way we think about the world .
Call it a virus .
Call it a meme .
Call it the power of a big idea .
Whatever you call it , for three decades they had us convinced that the success of the financial sector should be measured not by how well it provides financial services to actual consumers and corporations , but by how effectively financial firms make money for themselves .
It sounds crazy when you put it that way , but stripped to its bones , that ’s what they pulled off .
There ’s more to say about how they accomplished this , but to understand just how extravagant the finance lobby ’s power is , you need to understand some background first .
There are a lot of places we could start : the election of Ronald Reagan and the beginning of the great era of financial deregulation .
The collapse of Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust in 1984 .
The $ 100 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry .
The Mexican crisis of 1994 .
The Asian crisis of 1997 .
But for our purposes , the best place to start is 1998 .
That was the year a hedge fund called Long - Term Capital Management imploded and very nearly took the global financial system down with it .
It was , if you will , a dry run for 2008 .
The Warning
At the time it was founded , LTCM was the biggest , most prestigious hedge fund ever created .
The brainchild of John Meriwether , former head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers , it had two future Nobel Prize winners as partners , a staff of virtuoso traders and brilliant mathematicians , $ 10 million worth of fancy engineering workstations , and an initial capitalization somewhere north of $ 1 billion .
It was the largest start - up hedge fund in history .
Leverage is a harsh mistress :
It allows you to make lots of money when things go right , and to lose lots of money very quickly when they do n’t .
It was also one of the most successful .
But LTCM did n’t make its money by doing anything so crude as betting on things like the rise and fall of the stock market .
In fact , like most big hedge funds , LTCM paid very little attention to stocks .
The Dow Jones average might get all the attention , but Wall Street pros know two things :
The market for debt is far larger than the market for equities , and it provides far more fertile ground for mathematical manipulation and epic profits .
But clever mathematics alone is n’t enough to make Gatsbyesque fortunes .
For that , you need to use leverage .
You need to borrow other people ’s money .
Lots of it .
It ’s easy to see why .
A typical LTCM bet would start when someone noticed a spread that seemed a little out of whack .
For example , two bonds might trade for slightly different prices even though they were nearly identical .
So LTCM would go long in one bond and short in the other , essentially betting that the spread would narrow .
Bond traders deal in basis points — hundredths of a percentage point — and a bet like this might depend on a spread of , say , 20 basis points narrowing to 10 .
That ’s a nearly invisible movement , and on a million - dollar trade it nets you a grand total of $ 1,000 .
Hardly worth bothering with unless you make it a billion - dollar bet instead .
That ’s what LTCM did :
It mastered a method that let it borrow huge sums of money practically for free and that turned thousand - dollar profits into million - dollar profits .
Do that a few hundred times a year and you ’re talking real money .
But leverage is a harsh mistress :
It allows you to make lots of money when things go right , but it also allows you to lose lots of money very quickly when they do n’t .
And in 1998 things did n’t go right .
Spreads that were supposed to narrow kept widening , and LTCM was forced to dip into its own capital to pay back the huge short - term loans it had taken out to leverage its bets .
Losses kept mounting , creditors called in their loans , and eventually everything came crashing down .
But a funny thing happened on the way to the crash : The New York Fed stepped in and arranged a bailout .
Almost all of Wall Street ’s biggest firms participated , and they did so for one reason :
The Fed convinced them that LTCM was too big to fail .
An uncontrolled bankruptcy might set off a domino effect that could bring down dozens of banks .
A few months later , an interagency report concluded , “ The near collapse of LTCM illustrates the need for all participants in our financial system , not only hedge funds , to face constraints on the amount of leverage they assume . ”
It was a bipartisan judgment , signed by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and by Robert Rubin , Bill Clinton ’s treasury secretary .
In any sane world , it would have been a call to arms .
After all , LTCM was only worth a few billion dollars .
If a relative minnow like that could pose a risk to the global economy merely through the use of profligate leverage , what might happen if a money - center bank worth 100 times as much did the same thing ?
But we do n’t live in a sane world .
We live in a world where leverage — as well as Wall Street ’s nearly endless stream of new contrivances for exploiting it — is largely controlled not by regulators or congressional committees , but by the finance lobby .
And the last thing the finance lobby wants is constraints of any kind .
So Wall Street promised solemnly to take the lessons of LTCM to heart and then got right down to the business of ignoring them .
In fact it spent the next decade not merely blocking reform , but making things worse by lobbying relentlessly to expand leverage , complexity , regulatory forbearance , and risk .
Leverage — as well as Wall Street ’s nearly endless stream of new contrivances for exploiting it — is largely controlled not by regulators or congressional committees , but by the finance lobby .
Now if the aerospace lobby had told us after the 1986 Challenger disaster that the key to better performance was to turbocharge the engines and quit performing preflight inspections , everyone would have agreed that they were crazy .
Yet that ’s essentially what the finance lobby has done over the past decade , and in some weird way we were too mesmerized to recognize it .
Within months of a near catastrophe caused by one of the industry ’s brightest stars , the lobbyists were busily making certain that it would happen again — and that when it did happen , it would be bigger and more disastrous than ever .
Unleashing the Banks
It ’s hard to directly observe any lobby at work — by nature , it ’s not business typically done out in the open — but in the same way that a meteor leaves behind a crater that lets you know its size and force of impact , so does the finance lobby .
Sometimes these are laws passed by Congress .
Sometimes they ’re tax breaks kept in place by friendly senators .
Sometimes they ’re rulings by the Federal Reserve .
Sometimes they ’re green lights from federal watchdog agencies .
All of these are part of our story , but it starts with Congress , which left behind the two biggest craters of them all in 1999 and 2000 , a little more than a year after the LTCM collapse .
The first was the Financial Services Modernization Act .
The follow - up was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act .
The FSMA was designed to tear down a Depression - era law , the Glass - Steagall Act , that had set up the FDIC to guarantee commercial bank deposits and put up a fire wall between commercial banking and investment banking .
The idea behind the 1933 law was pretty simple : Commercial banks should use their government - backed funds only for reasonably safe activities .
Investment banks could take more risks , but they were on their own if things fell apart .
But starting in the 1980s , that became increasingly intolerable to Wall Street .
Commercial banks were sitting on an enormous pile of money that they were prohibited from investing in anything more interesting than business and home loans .
So they lobbied Congress .
They lobbied the Fed .
They lobbied the Treasury .
They lobbied tirelessly for 20 years , and finally , after spending $ 209 million in 1998 alone , they got what they wanted :
The wall was torn down and they were free to gamble customers ’ funds in any way they wanted .
In essence they became the world ’s biggest hedge funds .
And if LTCM was too big to fail , suddenly Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase were way too big to fail .
By itself , this was dangerous enough .
But then Congress made things even worse .
In the previous decade the world of derivatives — swaps , futures , and options — had become ever more complex and lucrative .
The finance lobby was eager to make sure they remained largely unregulated , and in 2000 the Commodity Futures Modernization
Act granted their wish .
Long - standing state laws against “ bucket shops ” — informal exchanges that allowed investors to gamble on securities they did n’t actually own — were preempted , and Wall Street was officially turned into a casino .
Banks could literally bet on anything .
When bankers decide that a million dollars does n’t go as far as it used to , they start up a hedge fund .
The only threat to their riches is the IRS .
Like so much else about the finance lobby , this was a bipartisan binge .
The FSMA is also known as the Gramm - Leach - Bliley Act , and it ’s true that all three of those gentlemen were Republicans dedicated to the cult of deregulation .
Alan Greenspan was a keen advocate too .
But the law was passed by a big bipartisan majority in the House , signed into law by Bill Clinton , and had been eagerly supported by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin .
By the time it was passed , however , Rubin was long gone .
He had taken a top job at Citigroup , one of the banks that had lobbied hardest for the deregulation that would eventually be its downfall .
Deregulation would help Rubin earn over $ 100 million in the following decade .
Not bad .
The Paycheck Lobby
The finance lobby is n’t just banks .
Technically it ’s known as the FIRE lobby — Finance , Insurance , and Real Estate — and it includes basically anyone who makes money by handling money .
That means big money - center supermarket banks , small community banks , Wall Street investment banks , insurance companies , mortgage brokers , hedge funds , credit card issuers , trade groups like the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , private equity firms , credit unions , and more .
Some of them , like the hedge funds , did n’t lobby heavily for the big deregulation of 1999 and 2000 , because they were already pretty lightly regulated .
Instead , they lobbied for other things .
Like protecting bigger paychecks .
Wall Street bankers may seem like a pretty well - off bunch , but when they decide that a million dollars does n’t go as far as it used to , they leave and start up a hedge fund .
Hedge fund managers typically get paid 2 percent of the value of the assets under their control plus 20 percent of the investment profits , and for a successful manager this can add up to tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year .
Aside from market reversals , the only real threat to their riches is the IRS .
Their defense against the taxman is something called the carried interest rule , and it ’s elegant in both its simplicity and its shamelessness :
It simply declares their compensation to be capital gains , not ordinary income .
That means it gets taxed at 15 percent instead of 35 percent .
At first , it ’s hard to figure out how they get away with this .
After all , capital gains are the profit you make on money of your own that you invest .
But hedge fund managers invest other people ’s money and get paid a piece of the action .
By any customary definition , this is ordinary income , the same as a sports agent taking his 10 percent or a CEO whose bonus depends on performance .
But enough money can buy you a defense of the indefensible .
“ If you get Chuck Schumer on your side , you are okay , ” one former SEC official told the New York Times , and that ’s exactly what the finance lobby has done .
The New York Democrat is a member of both the Senate Committee on Finance and the Senate Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs , and he ’s received so much money from Wall Street over the years — more than $ 14 million — that he actually shut down his personal fundraising efforts between 2005 and 2008 .
Since then he ’s raised a staggering $ 284 million for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , which he headed until recently , and much of it has come from Wall Street .
In June 2007 alone , when lobbying for the carried interest rule reached a fever pitch , employees of private equity firms contributed nearly $ 800,000 to the DSCC .
It was money well spent : Schumer agreed to support a repeal of the rule only if taxes were also raised on things like venture - capital and real - estate partnerships , a stand that guaranteed resistance from enough interest groups to let the hedge funds ’ special treatment survive unscathed .
A million - dollar investment had allowed the hedge fund industry to keep a billion - dollar loophole .
Not a bad return .
A Flock of Scandals
Congress is n’t the only place that draws the finance lobby ’s attention .
When the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 , it was designed to be an independent agency .
But that only means that it ’s technically independent from Congress and the president .
It ’s not independent from the finance lobby .
Just the opposite .
The 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks — including the all - important branch in New York City — are governed by boards of directors dominated by bankers chosen by …the banks themselves .
Let ’s take a virtual stroll down K Street and see what everyone is spending on the world ’s second - oldest profession .
The defense lobby ?
Big ag ?
Health care ?
Pikers all .
The finance industry is No. 1 , with a very , very big bullet .
That might explain why the Fed has dragged its feet addressing the scandal of overdraft fees on debit cards .
And “ scandal ” is n’t too strong a word .
The overdraft industry , which started only 16 years ago , has grown to nearly $ 40 billion .
It ’s one of the banking industry ’s biggest honeypots .
How ?
Well , many people do n’t realize that you can incur more than one overdraft fee in a single day , or that many banks deliberately reorder purchases to ensure that you pay the maximum number of fees .
And while the Fed finally ruled that come July consumers must opt in to overdraft protection , it did n’t address the central flaw : Overdraft fees are essentially a form of loan sharking .
Consider that the average overdraft amount is $ 17 and is paid back in five days .
With the typical overdraft fee now around $ 35 , this works out to nearly $ 2 in fees for every $ 1 borrowed , an effective annual percentage rate of more than 10,000 percent .
Not even the Mafia has a vig like that .
And the only reason it ’s legal is because in 2004 the Federal Reserve bowed to industry pressure and ruled that overdraft fees should n’t be classified as loans .
Sure , it conceded , banks promote overdraft protection “ in a manner that leads consumers to believe that it is a line of credit . ”
And the Fed politely encouraged them to shape up .
But it did n’t actually require anyone to stop these practices .
It was yet another multibillion - dollar cash cow protected by the finance lobby at the expense of consumers .
As recently as 40 years ago this would have been inconceivable .
In 1968 Congress passed the Truth in Lending Act , which , among other things , regulated the disclosure of interest rates on consumer loans and prevented credit card companies from charging customers more than $ 50 if someone stole their card and ran up a big bill .
The financial industry did n’t much like the new regulations , but the idea that banks should be required to watch out for both themselves and their customers was popular and widespread .
The bill passed .
By the end of the 20th century , though , that sort of George Bailey attitude was gone .
In fact , an effort to strengthen the Truth in Lending Act to regulate predatory lending failed four separate times between 2000 and 2003 thanks to tenacious resistance from the finance lobby .
So what happened between then and now ?
Money , of course .
To get a better sense of just how much money , let ’s take a virtual stroll down K Street and see what everyone is spending on the world ’s second - oldest profession .
It ’s all laid out for us by OpenSecrets.org .
The defense lobby ?
Pikers .
They contributed $ 24 million to individuals and PACs during the last election cycle .
The farm lobby ?
$ 65 million .
Health care ?
We ’re getting warmer .
Health care was the No. 2 industry , at $ 167 million .
And the finance lobby ?
They ’re No. 1 , with a very , very big bullet .
They contributed an astonishing $ 475 million during the 2008 election cycle .
That ’s up from $ 60 million almost two decades ago .
But this just pushes the question back a step :
How can the finance lobby afford to spend so much more than anyone else ?
It feels silly to say that it ’s because they have all the money — these are banks we ’re talking about , after all — but that ’s basically it .
They have all the money .
Princeton economics professor Hyun Song
Shin laid it out last June in a paper that tracked the flow of money through various parts of the economy .
Between 1954 and 1980 every sector he studied grew at roughly the same pace , increasing about tenfold .
( See “ The Securities Boom . ” )
But in 1980 , after the great financial deregulation of the Reagan era began , his charts show a sudden discontinuity — while households , corporations , and commercial banks grew another tenfold between 1980 and 2008 , the securities sector grew nearly a hundredfold .
This was the financialization of America , as Wall Street evolved from providing financial services to creating products — junk bonds , credit default swaps , subprime loan securitization , collateralized debt obligations — designed to allow Wall Street itself to prosper .
By the height of the credit bubble between 2000 and 2007 , the financial industry earned a staggering 40 percent of all corporate profits recorded in the United States , four times what they earned in 1980 .
Over the same period , average pay on Wall Street doubled , while bonuses at the top sextupled .
It was , depending on your perspective , either a vicious circle or a virtuous one .
Deregulation produced vast profits , and those profits in turn provided the money to lobby for further deregulation .
It was this ocean of money that allowed the financial industry to spend nearly $ 500 million on political contributions in just a single election cycle , and it was those contributions that helped keep so many flagrantly abusive — but profitable — practices alive and well .
It was , for example , what allowed Big Finance to keep Congress from banning “ universal default , ” the small - print declaration on millions of credit card applications that banks could retroactively raise interest rates on consumers at any time for any reason .
It was why the FBI ’s warnings of an “ epidemic ” of mortgage fraud as early as 2004 were completely ignored .
It ’s why no one ever did anything about the multibillion - dollar abuse of the “ yield spread premium , ” a kickback paid to mortgage brokers for guiding their customers into higher - interest loans than they qualified for .
It was why the Fed ignored years of pleading from community groups to do something about abusive mortgage lending .
It ’s why the credit card industry could afford to spend 10 years and $ 100 million lobbying for a punitive bankruptcy bill that , among other things , made it harder to write off credit card debt .
It ’s why banks are paid fat subsidies to make government - backed student loans even though the Congressional Budget Office estimates taxpayers would save $ 80 billion over 10 years if the government made the loans outright .
The industry ’s real power lies in the fact that they ’ve so thoroughly changed our collective attitude toward financial regulation that sometimes they barely need to lobby in the traditional sense at all .
It ’s why Hawaii Sen .
Daniel Akaka ’s bill to require a warning to consumers about how long it takes to pay off a credit card balance if you make only the minimum payment was effortlessly swatted aside year after year .
It ’s how the late Delaware Sen. William Roth ( also the creator of the Roth IRA , another bank windfall ) could get away with slashing tax audits on the superrich by doing nothing more than holding transparently comical hearings in 1997 and 1998 that portrayed IRS agents as jackbooted thugs who kicked down doors and held guns to young girls ’ heads while forcing them to undress .
But there ’s more to the finance lobby than just money and political influence .
Their real power lies in the fact that they ’ve so thoroughly changed our collective attitude toward financial regulation that sometimes they barely need to lobby in the traditional sense at all .
That became obvious one spring day more than five years ago — or rather , it would have , had anyone paid attention .
Stockholm Syndrome
In April 2004 the SEC held a hearing .
It was sparsely attended and quickly forgotten , but in 2008 Stephen Labaton of the New York Times got hold of an audio recording of the session and wrote an account of what happened .
The issue at hand was something called the net capital rule .
Originally put in place in 1975 , it set limits on how much leverage investment banks were allowed to carry on their books — limits that all five of Wall Street ’s biggest investment banks wanted loosened .
Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson , later to become George W. Bush ’s treasury secretary , had begun pressing for higher limits in 2000 .
Now , the SEC was considering doing just that .
The SEC meeting took place almost six years after the collapse of LTCM had dramatically demonstrated the systemic danger of unrestricted leverage .
It came four years after a Fed staffer wrote a journal article clearly pointing out that banks were hiding more and more leverage .
It came two years after the FDIC had passed a rule allowing banks to use complex hedges to effectively increase their leverage even more .
It came at a time when the housing bubble was already heating up , the credit derivative market was exploding , and the Fed ’s easy money policy was in its third consecutive year .
What ’s remarkable , when you listen to that recording , is not that the banks got everything they wanted — of course they did .
It ’s that the new policy passed virtually without question .
There was a single written dissent from an unknown risk management expert in Indiana , a couple of routine queries from one commissioner , and reassurances from staffers that the new rule posed no problems because the banks would police themselves .
After less than an hour of desultory discussion , the new rule was in place .
The finance industry successfully convinced everyone that deregulating finance was not only safe , but self - evidently good for the entire economy , Wall Street and Main Street alike .
In other words , very little lobbying was even required .
After three decades of deregulatory fervor , it had simply become unnecessary .
The SEC , like so many other government watchdogs , was by 2004 a thoroughgoing victim of regulatory capture , its appointees mostly Wall Street insiders with more sympathy for banks than for the public they were supposed to protect .
But the problem was bigger than just that .
Unlike most industries , which everyone recognizes are merely lobbying in their own self - interest , the finance industry successfully convinced everyone that deregulating finance was not only safe , but self - evidently good for the entire economy , Wall Street and Main Street alike .
It ’s what Simon Johnson , an MIT economics professor and former chief economist for the IMF , calls “ intellectual capture . ”
Considering what ’s happened over the past couple of years , we might better call it Stockholm syndrome .
Like all the other products of the industry ’s three - decade lobbying spree , the change to the net capital rule ended up in disaster when the overleveraged financial system nearly collapsed on itself .
By October 2008 , even former Fed chairman Alan Greenspan , one of the country ’s biggest cheerleaders for self - regulation , was admitting the obvious :
There was a “ flaw ” in the free - market worldview .
“ Those of us who have looked to the self - interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder ’s equity , myself especially , are in a state of shocked disbelief , ” he said in testimony before the House oversight committee .
If the case against self - regulation was strong then , it ’s stronger now .
Far from being chastened by last year ’s meltdown , banks are back to their old tricks .
The sliced - and - diced mortgage securities that caused so much trouble during the credit bubble are being re-sliced and - diced via something called a RE - REMIC ( resecuritization of real estate mortgage investment conduit ) — and business is booming .
At Goldman Sachs , leverage in the first half of 2009 was at its highest level in its history .
Even more astonishingly , the Wall Street Journal estimates that overall pay on Wall Street will rise to record levels in 2009 , higher than at the height of the bubble .
It ’s as if the global collapse that nearly destroyed them has been completely forgotten .
So what happens next ?
Congress and the Obama administration have plans to re-regulate the financial industry , but you ca n’t undo 30 years of intellectual capture in a few months — especially when the reform effort is mostly in the hands of former finance executives .
That ’s evident in the fact that the simplest , most striking proposals for reining in bank behavior are n’t even getting a serious hearing .
Former Fed chairman Paul Volcker , for example , suggests that commercial banks should simply be banned from securities trading altogether .
They should go back to making loans and underwriting bonds , but leave the risky , leverage - heavy trading to hedge funds , where it ’s fire - walled away from the plumbing of the overall banking system .
Another former Fed chairman , Alan Greenspan , thinks we should break up big banks the same way we broke up Standard Oil 100 years ago .
“ If they ’re too big to fail , they ’re too big , ” he said in October .
Other economists have proposed a small tax on all financial transactions ( perhaps a quarter of a percent or so ) , something that could reduce short - term speculation and help reduce the long - term deficit all at once .
But those reforms were never even considered .
The problem is n’t that Obama administration officials do n’t know where the real fault lines lie .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner released a set of guidelines earlier this year that focused squarely on leverage , capital requirements , and regulation of the shadow financial system , not just on commercial banks .
And a month later Obama economic adviser Larry Summers noted that our current deregulated system has produced economic crises like clockwork every three years .
“ Surely we can not be satisfied with a system that misfires so seriously so frequently , ” he said .
You ca n’t undo 30 years of intellectual capture in a few months — especially when the government ’s reform effort is mostly in the hands of former finance executives .
But Obama ’s actual regulatory proposal did n’t reflect any of this sense of urgency .
“ We do n’t want to tilt at windmills , ” he explained last June — and there was little doubt which windmill he was talking about .
Just a couple of months earlier the financial industry had won a stunning victory over a seemingly shoo - in administration proposal to modify bankruptcy laws for strapped homeowners — and they had not only won , they had managed to get billions in extra bailout money at the same time .
That remarkable demonstration of raw power caught the Obama administration ’s attention , so rather than risk another defeat it began compromising even before its proposal was introduced .
Top bank executives and financial lobbyists were part of the planning from the start , and as a result mutual funds and hedge funds got away with only modest new limits , credit ratings agencies were left largely untouched , the most dangerous varieties of derivatives were left alone , almost nothing was done to reduce the size of the biggest banks , and additional powers were given to the Fed , which has shown repeatedly that it ’s too close to Wall Street to ever regulate it effectively .
What ’s worse , it ’s not clear that even what ’s left will ever see the light of day .
One of the best parts of Obama ’s proposal — and the scariest to bankers — was a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency that would regulate financial products the same way the Consumer Product Safety Commission regulates toasters .
Even Alan Greenspan , perhaps humbled by the Fed ’s failures under his watch , supported the idea .
The Fed , he admitted , simply was n’t likely to ever crack down on lending abuses .
Needless to say , the financial industry likes it that way , which is why the CFPA is the part of Obama ’s plan they ’ve been working the hardest to eviscerate .
And where intellectual capture is n’t enough to do the job , there ’s always money .
After a brief dip in political outlays at the end of 2008 , the financial industry spent $ 402 million in the first 10 months of 2009 on both lobbying and campaign contributions , enough to put them on track to break 2008 ’s record .
Members of the House Committee on Financial Services alone received more than $ 8 million in industry contributions .
Whether the CFPA eventually survives is still up in the air , but the finance lobby scored a big victory almost immediately when Obama ’s proposal went to Capitol Hill and was quickly stripped of its requirement that banks offer consumers “ plain vanilla ” products — things like standard 30 - year fixed mortgages and low - interest , low - fee credit cards — in addition to their more convoluted options .
A couple of weeks later banks with less than $ 10 billion in assets — a category that includes 98 percent of all US banks — were exempted from the CFPA ’s scrutiny entirely .
And proposals to regulate derivatives by forcing them to be traded on supervised exchanges , as stocks and commodity futures already are , were watered down as well .
How could all this happen so soon after the financial industry ’s reckless behavior nearly caused a global meltdown ?
Ironically , it ’s probably because the bailout was so successful .
Without a sense of crisis to drive things , the political will to take on the industry has largely dissipated .
Even after nearly destroying the world economy , the finance lobby is , still , simply too big to fight .
The introduction of a third goaltender to the everyday workings of an NHL team is kind of like bringing that awkward third wheel with you on a romantic date .
It 's going to be cramped , expensive , really uncomfortable , and at the end , face it , you 're not going to get to go " all the way . "
To the playoffs , I mean .
Get your mind out of the gutter .
When you look at what Joe Nieuwendyk did last week , it seems to make sense for the long term .
He traded a prospect that may or may not turn out to be the special player we 've hoped he can be , and a fourth round draft pick .
In return he got a goaltender who was the # 2 overall pick in his draft class , and the possibility of solving his long term problem at the position .
It was a low risk , high reward move that wo n't cripple the franchise by any stretch of the imagination moving forward if it does n't work out , provided Lehtonen 's new deal is a reasonable one .
He traded potential for potential and it seems like a shrewd move for someone who can't afford the July bidding wars .
But what about the short term ?
You do n't often show up for work in the private sector and have your boss tell you " I hired a guy to replace you .
There he is now , sitting in your chair .
I 'm not sure what I 'm going to do with you yet , so just hang out . "
Marty Turco 's just hanging out , knowing he wo n't be here next year .
What he does n't know about is the next 21 games , and it 's not real clear that GM - Joe knows either .
The questions that sit before him as he tries to conclude the move he started last Tuesday are these :
Can he afford to lose Marty Turco and still have a reasonable possibility of making the playoffs ?
Is trading Marty Turco essentially giving up on the season ?
Or does he believe that Kari Lehtonen , who has n't played an NHL game since April 11th , 2009 , can jump in the middle of the Western Conference playoff race and take them where they want to go ?
Does the financial situation dictate what must be done ?
After the jump , a look at the options :
The Stars cannot afford to keep Marty Turco :
Joe Nieuwendyk on KTCK 1310 The Ticket :
.
" We have to take into consideration how it affects us financially .
I think the number one priority for us is that carrying three goaltenders is difficult and when there is financial gain to reap we have to look at that as well .
At this point I do n't know if we are going to move Marty .
I do n't know if we are going to move Alex [ Auld ] .
I just know in my mind I , beyond the deadline , I do n't want to have three goaltenders . "
When asked point blankly a day after the trade was made on BaD Radio , he answered quickly that the trade works with their internal budget .
The number $ 45 million is thrown around a lot , but the projections for the rest of the season do n't jive .
Take a look at Cap Geek or whatever cap - tracker you like and you 'll see that the final number is predicted to be closer to $ 50 million than $ 45 at this point .
The number was already over , but the addition of Lehtonen and Segal 's salary puts another million on the books for the remainder of the year .
I do n't pretend to know how the Stars count their payroll dollars , and what they mean when they say $ 45 million .
I do n't know how Tom Hicks views the Sean Avery money , or the $ $ it takes to bring up AHL players ( Sawada for instance has been paid some good NHL money this year ) .
All I know is that the rumored internal budget is likely not being adhered to with the current roster configuration .
Moving Marty
Turco means not only saving money this year , but potentially gaining assets for future .
Are the Stars willing to keep Marty Turco for a slim chance at making the playoffs , even if it means they let him walk for nothing when the season is over ?
Is n't the bigger picture the more important one here ?
Mike Heika speculates that if the Stars can't get at least a second round pick or better , they could consider keeping him .
Said Nieuwendyk , " I think there will be conversations over the next couple weeks for sure .
Ideally we do n't want to carry three goaltenders forward .
It makes it uncomfortable on everybody .
We 'll be talking to other teams . "
The Stars cannot afford to let Marty Turco go :
The other side of the coin is this :
If they want to make the playoffs , they simply must have him in my estimation .
He 's the reason they 're within striking distance of 8th place .
They were completely unable to collect points on the road until he turned it on last week , and there 's little ( logical ) reason to believe that it can continue without him .
First , how important are the playoffs ?
There are some who say " What does it matter ?
Make 8th place and get swept ?
Just forget about it . "
In a different league , I might agree with that .
In a different NHL city even , I could get on board with that if I knew the fans were coming back no matter what .
But not this sport in this city .
Hockey in Dallas has worked for a long time because of one thing : Success .
The economic downturn , combined with missing the playoffs two seasons in a row for the first time since the franchise moved to Dallas will mean losses at the gate that will take years to get back .
The Stars have a loyal , knowledgeable , passionate fan - base , but it 's not so robust that the team can withstand a long playoff drought .
Two or three home playoff games mean $ $ in ownership 's pocket , sure , but I think the front office must consider the long term health of hockey in the Dallas / Forth Worth area .
The only medicine that works is playoff hockey .
Can the Stars make the playoffs this year without Marty Turco ?
I do n't think so .
That 's my opinion .
They will play 21 games in 40 days , mercifully with only 2 back - to - backs , but that 's still hockey every other day for over a month .
While the lucky few teams can lean on a guy like Luongo , Brodeur or Nabokov every single night , the rest need goaltending depth .
Kari Lehtonen has played 5 AHL games this season .
He is not ready to carry a load like that with a new team after a 5 day mini-camp following a 10 month lay - off .
Even if he played light 's out , you still would n't ride a guy like that very hard with all the injuries he 's had .
So how do you make the playoffs ?
You need Marty Turco .
Alex Auld has been an OK backup .
He 's played well at times , but he could n't help them out of their road funk .
He has not demonstrated the ability to steal games often enough to think he 's going to get you into the tournament .
Turco has something to prove , a chip on his shoulder , and a new contract to earn wherever it may be .
He 's stopped 208 of the last 215 shots he 's seen and had two shutouts in six February games .
As a fan , he 's the guy I want in net right now .
What would you do ?
Would you say that trading Marty Turco is something they must do for the long term health of the franchise ?
Is trading Marty Turco essentially a surrender concerning the playoffs this year ?
Or do you believe they can do it regardless ?
My head tells me that short term pain for long term gain is the way to go , but my little Stars heart wants to see Marty Turco get one last " March to the playoffs . "
Then maybe something , not special , but at least ... pleasantly unexpected can happen , and we can give him a proper goodbye .
First Look : Zotac H55 - ITX WiFi
Feature List
Support for Intel Core i3 , i5 and i7 LGA1156 processors
Intel H55 PCH
Support for dual channel DDR3 1,066/1,333 up to 8GB
14 USB 2 ports : ten via rear I /O , four via headers
Six SATA 3Gbps
Wireless -n Ethernet
Intel PCI - E Gigabit Ethernet
Realtek ALC888 7.1 Channel High - Definition audio
One x16 PCI - Express port
Click to enlarge
Zotac is n't chasing a high performance , high investment and few sales market with its motherboards .
In fact , it 's arguable the only designer / manufacturer ( well , the latter part is technically fulfilled by PC Partner ) of motherboards that puts its time exclusively into small form - factor ( SFF ) products .
We first saw their micro-ATX GeForce 9300 board , which was then followed by a mini-ITX model , and later a feature - filled Ion board that had everything but was unfortunately just too expensive .
This time round though , we think Zotac is onto a winner : price and performance permitting , of course .
If you thought the DFI MI P55 - T36 was good , in our opinion you 're really going to like this - the Zotac looks evenAs usual , Zotac has meticulously crammed in more hardware than we thought was possible on an mini-ITX PCB .
We 've yet to see another mini-ITX board withSATA ports , a full x16 PCI - E slot and wireless -n card built in .
It really is the all - in - one PC .
The immediate downside is that the H55 chipset does n't support RAID on all those SATA ports , unlike P55 .
However it does mean the rear I/O sports the integrated graphics options the DFI did not , meaning that this board can power a potentially an incredibly tiny HTPC .
We only wish now Zotac could put it in a cute barebones box as well .
Anyone know an elegant case ?
Something such as this but that costs this OK , I 'll keep dreaming .
Yes , that 'sUSB 2 ports ( with four more via pin-outs ) , on top of the DVI - I ( that will convert to d- sub via an adapter ) , HDMI 1.3a output , Gigabit Ethernet , PS2 keyboard , eSATA ( not powered unfortunately ) and digital optical and 3.5 mm analogue out for 7.1 channel surround sound in addition to the two wireless antenna .
Phew .
Decries ' inaccurate , misleading , unfair ' coverage ; Confirms no evidence of rightwing activist dressed as pimp in their offices
Seeks meeting with Times Public Editor after BRAD BLOG report ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/10/2010 , 8:10 pm PT
" We have asked the Times and numerous outlets to correct their misstatements and implored numerous journalists to report on the discrepancies between the impression left by the edited tapes and the transcripts posted by the filmmakers themselves .
And yes , we will ask again , " wrote ACORN 's Communication Director Kevin
Whelan in response to my query seeking comment on our late Monday exclusive detailing the bizarre emailed comments from the New York Times Senior Editor for Standards , Greg Brock .
In those emails , which we published in full , Brock explained why his paper is standing by what appear to be multiple incidents of inexcusably erroneous reporting concerning the oft - repeated apparent - fiction that rightwing activist James O'Keefe posed , or dressed , as a pimp in his now - infamous , highly - edited , secretly - taped ACORN hit videos .
" The email chain you posted with Mr. Brock was troubling and disturbing , " Whelan wrote .
" We will be asking to meet with the Times Public Editor about the whole matter . " ...
Brock , a Times veteran at the " paper of record " since 1995 , has described himself as " the senior editor who oversees corrections . "
In the emails , he offers several contrasting explanations for why the paper stands by multiple reports suggesting O'Keefe wore his pimp outfit in meetings with ACORN employees .
First , incredibly , he said it was because " Mr. O'Keefe himself explained how he was dressed --- and appeared on a live
Fox show wearing what HE said was the same exact costume he wore to ACORN 's offices .... We believe him . "
And later he explained there was " nothing for us to correct , " because of a shot in some video somewhere and interviews with ACORN workers which , he claimed , prove their reporting is accurate .
He would not , however , supply the video or a link to it .
Neither would he share the interviews with ACORN workers in which he claimed they described the outfit O'Keefe was wearing in the offices as a pimp costume .
All known ACORN employee interviews , and even a report from a former state Attorney General , contradict the Senior Editor 's asseritions .
[ Brock 's emails briefly summarized here , full version here . ]
I checked with ACORN to see if they were aware of any such video in which , as Brock claimed , " At one point , the camera was turned in such a way to catch part of the ' costume ' [ O ' Keefe ] was wearing . "
The ACORN Communications Director Whelan , after checking with others at the organization to make absolutely certain , wrote me to confirm that " O'Keefe was not wearing that absurd costume when he visited our offices .
We know this from speaking to staff and from the videos posted online by O'Keefe himself which , when you can see any part of his outfit , show a regular dress shirt and slacks . "
Indeed , my own review of the released video tapes , and another from a BRAD BLOG reader since the Monday night story , confirm no such shots of O'Keefe , other than exterior shots which were inserted afterwards .
O'Keefe , however , would don the outfit for media appearances to help sell the fake story , such as this one on Fox , cited by Brock in his email as one of the first reasons given for believing O'Keefe .
Whelan 's response echoes the findings Massachusett 's former Attorney General Scott Harshbarger who , in his independent Dec. 7th , 2009 report [ PDF ] , commissioned by ACORN as an external investigation of the videos , observed : " Although Mr. O'Keefe appeared in all videos dressed as a pimp , in fact , when he appeared at each and every office , he was dressed like a college student - in slacks and a button down shirt . "
As we previously reported , the Times never covered the Harshbarger report .
Though it has published at least eight stories since the release of that report , suggesting O'Keefe played his pimp character in the offices of ACORN .
" We have only seen the videos posted online by O'Keefe who has refused to release the unedited tapes .
He also refused to release the unedited tapes or be interviewed during Scott Harshbarger 's investigation , " Whelan explained in his Wednesday email .
" In fact , " he continued , " the transcripts posted on biggovernment .com themselves reveal that O'Keefe presented himself as Giles boyfriend not her pimp - his scam involved a story about rescuing her from a violent pimp .
So it would not have made sense for him to wear the costume , even within the fictional scenario he presented . "
Whelan also noted that " The New York Times did not have a reporter call in to the phone press conference when Scott Harshbarger released his report on ACORN " in early December .
That , even though the paper received a rebuke from its own Public Editor , Clark Hoyt , in September , taking the paper to task for having been " slow off the mark " by waiting " nearly a week " after O'Keefe 's first video was released before reporting on it .
The paper took measures , thereafter , to improve on its " insufficient tuned - in - ness to the issues that are dominating Fox News and talk radio , " Hoyt reported .
Still , apparently nobody was assigned to cover the release of the independent report that found no criminal wrong - doing by the organization .
( Another report from the Congressional Research Service [ PDF ] released two weeks later found the same , and was noted by the Times . )
Apparently the Harshbarger report was not part of " all the news that 's fit to print , " as the Times ' slogan goes .
The NYTimes ' Brock also went on to allege in his bizarre emails that " ACORN employees who saw [ O ' Keefe ] described his costume , " though Brock refused to produce any evidence to back up that claim either .
Those unsupported claims --- along with his belief in the word of Fox " News " and James O'Keefe --- apparently serve as evidence for why " There is nothing for us to correct ...
We stand by our reporting . "
Whelan confirmed that he was aware of no such descriptions from ACORN workers describing the pimp costume in any of their own interviews carried out following the release of the videos .
If there are any accounts confirming Brock 's claims , The BRAD BLOG remains unaware of them .
On September 17th , 2009 , almost three months prior to Harshbarger 's report , Katherine Conway Russell , the Office Director for ACORN Housing Corp. in Philadelphia , published a video - taped , first - hand account of her own meeting with O'Keefe .
She provided a description of how the scam worked --- or did n't , in this case , since her office filed a police report following their bizarre encounter with the Republican operative .
In the video ( seen at right ) , Russell explains what happened when O'Keefe and his partner Hannah Giles --- seen dressed similarly to a prostitute in the edited videos from other cities where O'Keefe carried out his campaign --- came in for an interview in her office .
" They never said that she [ Giles ] was a prostitute , and he was not dressed in any unusually flashy manner , " Russell explains .
" Mr. O'Keefe lied to get his appointment .
He was not dressed like he is on the Internet .
And when we got suspicious about the questions he was asking at the Philadelphia ACORN Housing office , we called the police and filed this report , " she says .
Whelan went on to call for media outlets , the New York Times in particular , to issue corrections for their various misreporting on these matters .
He also says the community group intends to request a meeting with the Times ' Public Editor , Clark Hoyt :
A variety of either inaccurate , misleading or unfair accounts of the videos have circulated back and forth between the New York Times and other publications .
We have asked the Times and numerous outlets to correct their misstatements and implored numerous journalists to report on the discrepancies between the impression left by the edited tapes and the transcripts posted by the filmmakers themselves .
And yes , we will ask again .
The email chain you posted with Mr. Brock was troubling and disturbing .
We will be asking to meet with the Times Public Editor about the whole matter .
We kept Hoyt abreast of the comments from Brock , early on during the email exchange .
We have yet to hear back from him .
If you 'd like to request he look into this matter , his email address is Public@NYTimes.com .
O'Keefe was recently arrested with three other Republican Party - connected co-conspirators , attempting to access and " maliciously interfere " with the telephone system of Democratic U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu in New Orleans .
He was arrested and held on federal felony charges and has since offered an outlandish explanation for the scheme .
Given his willingness to utterly misrepresent his previous ACORN scams --- regarded as " successful " ones --- hopefully federal prosecutors will closely examine his newest claims , now that he 's fighting a federal felony that could result in ten years in jail .
The New York Times ' utter failure to accurately report on O'Keefe 's past scams , even during their coverage of his current alleged crimes , is anything but helpful for those seeking the truth --- or , veritas , as the con-man O'Keefe likes to describe it .

Question
What is the best dog food on the market ?
Pippa Elliott , MRCVS
Veterinarian Veterinarian Dr. Elliott , BVMS , MRCVS is a veterinarian with over 30 years of experience in veterinary surgery and companion animal practice .
She graduated from the University of Glasgow in 1987 with a degree in veterinary medicine and surgery .
She has worked at the same animal clinic in her hometown for over 20 years .
Pippa Elliott , MRCVS Veterinarian Expert Answer
The best advice is to ignore the pretty packaging and pick up every pack of pet food on the shelf and look at the ingredient list .
Look for a product that lists named meats ( i.e. chicken meat or lamb meat ) as the first and second ingredients , and the rest of the ingredients should sound good enough for you to eat — such as sweet potato , peas , carrots , apple , parsley etc .
Avoid foods that are high in soya as although this is a source of protein , it is difficult for the body to digest and produces a lot of wind .
There is controversy over the use of grains in dog food , and if you are concerned about gluten content look for a gluten - free food that uses potato , rice , or oats for carbohydrate energy .
Congressional lawmakers joined several national religious leaders on a conference call today to announce a new mobilization that will deliver over 100,000 postcards to members of Congress urging them to pass immigration reform .
The new campaign is called “ Together , Not Torn : Families Ca n’t Wait for Immigration Reform . ”
Evangelical , Catholic , Jewish and mainline Protestant leaders said the campaign will host 100 events across the country during the President ’s Day congressional recess as well as other activities including a march on Washington next month .
“ During a time when the U.S. faces many challenges , now more than ever , our country needs immigration reform , ” said Jen Smyers with Church World Service .
“ Families that continue to be torn apart ca n’t wait any longer and the faith - based voice must play an important role , ” she said .
Jennifer Kottler , spokesperson for Christians for Comprehensive Immigration Reform and a pastor with Christian Church ( Disciples of Christ ) , said she is the great - granddaughter of a German pastor that migrated to the U.S .
“ I am very proud of my immigrant heritage , ” she said .
“ And it is morally unacceptable and economically irresponsible to not pass immigration reform . ”
Noting that millions of immigrants continue to be oppressed and marginalized , she said the unique new coalition and mass campaign will urge voters to visit and call lawmakers to pass reform , she said .
Kottler called for a tone of civility and respect in the immigration debate .
It ’s a moral issue and people need to be aware how immigrant families continue to suffer , she said .
Galen Carey from the National Association of Evangelicals talked about a woman who recently lost her son in a drunk - driving collision .
She was too scared to press charges against the drunk driver because of her immigration status .
She was afraid she would be deported , he said .
The drunk driver was never brought to justice and the loss of her son has left a hole in the woman ’s heart , said Carey .
“ Stories like these are heard in congregations every day throughout the U.S. , ” he said .
“ Today Evangelicals are speaking up and we pray that our country will do the right thing by passing reform , and that they do it now . ”
Pastor Jon Pedigo with Saint Julie Billart Parish in San Jose , Calif. , said he is the grandson of Japanese farmworkers from Hawaii .
“ Every day thousands of immigrant families live in fear , and every day families will continue to be torn apart unless we do something , ” he said , adding that it ’s not right that entire neighborhoods have to live in fear and distrust of their local police authorities .
“ We are here to say we stand with our immigrant brothers and sisters , ” said Pedigo .
The U.S. should follow its historic tradition and be open to newcomers , speakers on the call said .
Every man and woman who comes to the U.S. should have the right to earn a decent wage with labor protections , they said .
The campaign will work with labor unions and community groups as well as other congregations that have non-immigrant parishioners .
Organizers seek to heighten awareness in the religious community and urge them to actively play a role in contacting their state lawmakers to pass reform .
Rep. Yvette Clark , D - N.Y. , said the issue of immigration reform is very dear and near to her heart .
She said she is the second generation from Jamaica .
“ Passing reform is about the health and well being of America and it ’s in the best interests of all of us to address this very important issue , ” she said .
“ We all must share the benefits and burdens of this great nation . ”
Rep. Mike Honda , D - Calif. , said immigration reform is really all about representing families of faith , about citizens and legal residents uniting with their families .
He said he is committed to moving such legislation forward .
Honda said millions come to the U.S. in the face of physical danger because they love their family and want only to support them .
The immigrant rights movement is also about U.S. trade policies such as NAFTA that devastate local communities in other countries , he said .
Critics contend foreign trade agreements with little to no labor protections in underdeveloped countries are a big reason why immigrants seek employment in the U.S .
In December Rep. Luis Gutierrez introduced a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the House .
The big question is when will the Senate move to do the same .
Speakers on the call said they hoped that President Obama and lawmakers will address the issue this year .
“ We have to create the political will to move immigration reform along in the Senate , ” said Kottler .
“ We recognize it wo n’t be an easy path but this is why it ’s so important that we come together . ”

Now that Bloom Energy has unveiled its innovative fuel cell technology to the world , it appears the much - hyped Silicon Valley startup 's " Energy Server " shows a lot of promise , particularly for Fortune 500 companies that can afford the parking lot - sized power boxes priced up to $ 800,000 apiece .
But is the Bloom box too good to be true ?
We may not know for years , of course , although early reports from an impressive lineup of beta testers , including Bank of America , Coca - Cola , eBay , FedEx , Google , and Wal - Mart , are showing sizable reductions in both energy costs and CO2 emissions [ PDF ] .
A power generator that saves money and the environment ?
This must be Tomorrowland !
Well , Bloom Energy is developing a power box for the home too , a development that could fundamentally change the way home users buy energy , if ( again ) the Bloom box is the real deal .
Ten questions to consider :
1 . When will the Bloom box for the home arrive , and what will it cost ?
K.R. Sridhar , CEO of Bloom Energy , has said he hopes to see brick - sized energy servers powering homes within 10 years .
The price : Somewhere south of $ 3,000 , although it 's unclear what the initial cost might be .
Bloom Energy says its corporate customers will see a 3 - to 5 - year payback on their initial investment .
2 . How durable would it be ?
Fuel cell technology has been around for decades -- it was even used during the Apollo moon missions -- but it 's unclear just how reliable Bloom 's technology is .
The Energy Server uses an electrochemical process to generate electricity , and it operates at extremely high temperatures .
Could a home energy server last at least 10 years ?
A shorter lifespan might severely limit cost savings for consumers .
3 . Buy or lease ?
A lot of homeowners probably wo n't want to shell out a few thousand dollars for a newfangled energy device .
Perhaps your friendly power utility might lease a Bloom server to you and handle whatever maintenance tasks are required .
Then again , would this business model kill the cost benefits for homeowners ?
4 . Would I be able to get off the grid ?
Ah , a tantalizing prospect for power company - haters everywhere .
If the Bloom Energy Server works as promised , well , who needs the grid at all ?
Why not just pull the plug and become your own power company .
Then again , you might want to keep emergency access to the grid , just in case your power box dies .
And then there 's yet another reason to stay connected .
Read on .
5 . Would I be able to sell energy to the grid ?
Yes !
Let 's say you ’re using only 75 - percent of the energy your Bloom box produces .
Why not sell the excess power back to your local utility ?
If feasible , the energy server might actually help defray a homeowner 's power costs .
6 . But would the grid still exist if everyone 's got a Bloom box ?
The grid is n't cheap to maintain .
If few residential and business users are paying for grid - supplied power , where 's the money going to come from to maintain the complex network built for energy generation and distribution ?
7 . What about future applications ?
A Bloom box for the home makes sense .
But what about other power - hungry devices ?
Automobiles , for instance .
A brick - sized Bloom box is the right size for a car or truck .
Heat dissipation might be a serious issue , however .
Laptops and cell phones ?
Unlikely .
8 . How might home energy servers affect the price of natural gas ?
Well , that brings us back to how the Bloom box works .
Natural gas or biofuel combines with oxygen to produce a chemical reaction within the fuel cell , a process that generates energy .
If Bloom - style energy servers become commonplace , natural gas consumption might spike , particularly since biofuels are still relatively exotic .
The Law of Supply and Demand would come into play .
And would we get hosed by the natural gas providers ?
Check your monthly gasoline bill for the answer .
9 . What if the Bloom box is just another Segway ?
Remember back in 2001 , when Segway inventor Dean Kamen said his high - tech scooter would change the way cities are built ?
Did n't exactly turn out that way , did it ?
Let 's hope the Bloom box does better .
10 . A lot of celebrities are endorsing Bloom .
Is n't that a bad sign ?
Yes , it really is .
Let 's see , Arnold Schwarzenegger and Colin Powell have already expressed their support .
If celeb backers keep showing up -- who knows , maybe Charlie Sheen will leave rehab to chime in -- the Bloom Energy Server wo n't stand a chance .

Cable provider Shaw Communications says it is testing ultra - fast broadband , with potential download speeds up to one gigabit per second .
That speed is 10 times faster than the highest - end connections now available and more than 100 times faster than what many Canadians have .
" This is game - changing technology , " Shaw president Peter Bissonnette said in a statement .
" We are on the leading edge of change with this trial — bringing blazing speeds and new network capabilities that will give us a springboard for future possibilities . "
The Calgary - based company said it expects to launch fibre - deployment tests in April .
Shaw currently offers download speeds up to 100 megabits per second in Calgary , Edmonton and Vancouver .
The service is n't cheap , though , costing $ 150 a month .
In Japan , 160 - megabit connections sell for around $ 60 a month while 120 - megabit speeds can be had in parts of Europe for about $ 100 .
Shaw 's pricing is in line with that found in the United States .
Both Canada and the United States have been criticized recently for a lack of competition in broadband , which has resulted in slower speeds and higher prices than those found in other parts of the world .
A recent international broadband study by Harvard University found that Canada ranked 22nd out of 30 countries after availability , speeds and pricing were accounted for .
The United States fared better , placing 13th .
Open-access rules in Europe , Asia
The study found European and Asian countries have better broadband because governments have enacted open - access rules , which see internet providers share infrastructure .
Canada and the United States have instead focused on promoting a so - called inter-modal system , where cable firms compete against phone companies .
This has created a comfortable duopoly in both countries , the report said .
The U.S. government is in the midst of putting together a national broadband plan .
Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski last week proposed the " 100 Squared " initiative , which would see 100 million homes connected with 100 - megabit connections by 2020 .
The plan , which is being taken to Congress , could see government getting involved in building some of the infrastructure .
Internet search giant Google also announced last week that it is building experimental networks that would bring one - gigabit speeds to several U.S. cities and towns .
The company , which is frustrated by the lack of competition between U.S. broadband providers , said its plan is intended to show what can be done with ultra - fast speeds .
Foreign ownership restrictions prevent Google from attempting a similar plan in Canada .

Lou Jing sings Shanghai opera and speaks fluent Mandarin , but when she competed to be China 's next reality TV pop star , it was not her voice that was criticised -- it was her black skin .
The daughter of a Chinese mother and an absent African - American father , 20 - year - old Lou caused a media storm when she was named one of Shanghai 's five finalists for " Let 's Go! Oriental Angel , " an " American Idol " - style show .
Lou Jing ... I felt hurt .
I never meant to offend anyone .
But her fame has been for all of the wrong reasons , after her appearance sparked a vigorous and often vicious nationwide debate on whether she was even fit to be on Chinese television because of the colour of her skin .
Ahead of US President Barack Obama 's first visit to China , Lou 's experience has put a spotlight on perceptions of race in the country and the challenges the Asian giant faces as its economic boom fosters a more ethnically diverse society .

As state legislators across the United States enact laws that ban phoning and texting while driving , a new study is showing no reductions in crashes after hand - held phone bans take effect .
Comparing insurance claims for crash damage in 4 US jurisdictions before and after such bans , The Highway Loss Data Institute ( HLDI ) researchers find claim rates are comparable with nearby jurisdictions without such bans .
The laws are n't reducing crashes , even though we know that such laws have reduced hand - held phone use , and several studies have established that phoning while driving increases crash risk , says Adrian Lund , president of HLDI .
The HLDI compared collisions of 100 insured vehicles per year in New York , Washington D.C. , Connecticut , and California -- all states with currently enacted roadway text bans .
Despite those laws , monthly fluctuations in crash rates did n't change after bans were enacted , all though there were less people using devices while driving .
An earlier study conducted by the HLDI reported that cellphone use was directly linked to four - fold increases in crash injuries .
Also independent studies done by universities have shown correlation between driving while using a phone and crashes .
The link prompted the US government to draft a bill to prevent usage across the country , though it has not been ratified .
If crash risk increases with phone use and fewer drivers use phones where it 's illegal to do so , we would expect to see a decrease in crashes , Lund says .
But we are n't seeing it .
Lund believes that drivers in jurisdictions with such bans may be switching to hands - free phones which poses the same risks , he believes .
Whatever the reason , the key finding is that crashes are n't going down where hand - held phone use has been banned , Lund said .
The study comes as the U.S. Transportation Department prohibited texting by commercial drivers of interstate buses and trucks earlier this week .
The perfect man is a geek with facial stubble ... women 's secret turn - ons revealed
Most women claim to be attracted to tall , dark and handsome men , but a new study has revealed that facial stubble and a geeky personality are their biggest secret turn - ons .
Despite complaining that it looks unkempt and feels rough to touch , the unshaven look on a man is actually a turn - on for 41 per cent of women .
A slightly geeky personality came second , proving that women really do like a guy who knows their stuff when it comes to technology .
Unlikely turn - ons : Women secretly prefer men who wear glasses like Johnny Depp ( left ) or with geeky personalities like Spider - Man star Tobey Maguire
A hairy chest was voted third , followed by a man who loves to read or cries at a soppy film .
Other secret turn - ons to feature in the top ten include grey hair , glasses and being a passionate supporter of a sports team .
But almost one in five would never admit what they really find attractive in a man to other people .
A spokesman for www.onepoll.com, which carried out the research , said : ' Publically , girls will claim they want a muscly guy , who is hair free and manly enough not to show his emotional side .
Facial stubble : Women are attracted to unshaven men like Scottish actor Gerard Butler ( left ) and David Beckham
' But these results prove that they secretly want something different .
It seems women really do like a guy who is able to show a softer side , or who is carrying a little bit of extra weight .
' I 'm sure it 's a relief to men all over the country to find out that women are n't actually looking for that perfect guy . '
The poll of 2,500 women also revealed that 91 per cent would actually prefer a guy who had a few flaws over someone who is perfect .
And more than half would rather a guy who was soft and cuddly instead of toned and muscly .
Almost two thirds would prefer to be with a naturally hairy man , while 56 per cent like a guy with a little bit of stubble over someone who is clean shaven or has a full beard .
Women also prefer a guy who does n't spend too much time on his appearance , with 63 per cent saying they would like a man who got ready quickly rather than fussing over what he looked like .
Fifty - eight per cent of women even want a guy who does n't care what he eats over someone who is watching his weight and counting calories .
Tony Blair descended into such a deep depression after the Iraq war that he told Gordon Brown and John Prescott he would quit No 10 the following summer – only to renege on the pledge within months , a new book by the Observer 's Andrew Rawnsley reveals .
The former prime minister 's physical and mental decline was so profound that he confided to friends that he " spaced out " several times during Prime Minister 's Questions and often woke up in the middle of the night with sweat trickling down the back of his neck .
Rawnsley 's explosive account is in The End of the Party , which is published on Monday , extracts from which appear in tomorrow 's Observer .
It lays bare , for the first time , how Blair was haunted and tormented by the deepening chaos and bloodshed in Iraq at the same time as being worn down by the constant psychological warfare being waged by Brown , his next - door neighbour in Downing Street , who was increasingly desperate to take his job .
While Blair 's gift for presentation helped him hide his depression from the public and most of his staff , his private turmoil was so severe that he decided there was nothing for it but to hand over to Brown midway through his second term .
Rawnsley is the first journalist to detail how Blair , in those darkest days , made clear at a dinner with both Brown and Prescott in November 2003 , and later in a telephone call to Prescott in spring 2004 , that he would step down .
Sally Morgan , Blair 's director of government relations , told Rawnsley : " Iraq was a quicksand swallowing him up .
The atrocities .
Those terrible photos [ of Abu Ghraib ] .
And he started losing people who had supported him throughout .
He was stuck in this long dark tunnel and could see no way out of it . "
The book relates how Blair 's special envoy in Iraq , the former UN ambassador , Sir Jeremy Greenstock , came to No 10 at the end of his service in Baghdad to brief the prime minister .
Greenstock knew that his " very gloomy assessment " had made him highly unpopular in the building .
Some at No 10 tried to keep him away , fearing the impact on Blair 's collapsing morale .
In Blair 's den Greenstock warned him that the situation looked " unbelievably bad " and would get more desperate in the months to come .
" What can we do ? " pleaded Blair .
" We have told them [ the Americans ] again and again what we think is necessary .
If it does n't happen , what can we do ? "
Greenstock was left with the image of the prime minister " tearing his hair " over Iraq and " throwing his hands in the air " .
Rawnsley then charts how Blair – urged by his wife , Cherie , and closest political friends to pull back from the brink and deny Brown his chance – gradually recovered his self - belief and decided to fight on .
The volte - face caused Brown 's frustration to turn to rage .
On one occasion Brown went round to No 10 to get an answer .
One of Blair 's inner circle who witnessed this says : " Gordon was just losing it .
He was behaving like a belligerent teenager .
Just standing in the office shouting : ' When are you going to fucking go ? ' "
Blair 's dark period throughout late 2003 and early 2004 was compounded by his heart complaint and anxiety that his young children were suffering at school because of the unpopular war their father had championed in Iraq .
His friend and cabinet colleague Tessa Jowell says : " He was very low , he was very lonely and he was very tired . "
In November 2003 , Prescott , who was acting as " referee " between the prime minister and chancellor , hosted a dinner to discuss their differences and address the succession question .
Next morning a visibly excited Brown told his key aides , Ed Miliband , Ed Balls , Spencer Livermore and Sue Nye , that Blair had assured him he was going in the summer .
The four were sceptical , having heard about similar promises from Blair before .
But by the spring Blair was to telephone Prescott and tell him he had settled on June as his departure date .
Behind the scenes , Blair 's allies feared he was wobbling and were hatching a strategy to boost his morale .
Jowell went to his study and told him : " You 're going to get through this . "
Blair replied without conviction : " I 'm fine , darling .
Do n't worry about me .
I 'm fine . "
Blair 's friends noticed that women were better at bolstering him than men .
Peter Mandelson told him : " Come on .
Buck up .
Buck up .
Think of what you 've got to achieve .
You 're the best politician in this country by a mile . "
After the June local elections of 2004 , which were bad for Labour but not disastrous , Blair 's zest for the job returned and he decided to stay to fight the 2005 election , which Labour won , though with a substantially reduced majority .
In autumn 2004 , Blair declared he would fight the election but not lead Labour into a fourth one .
But the statement led to relentless speculation about his departure date .
Rawnsley reveals how , in the summer of 2006 , Prescott was so frustrated with Blair 's refusal to name a handover date that he threatened to resign as deputy prime minister unless he did so .

Once the sheep falls off its Greek pedestal and begins spinning through storm clouds to an operatic soundtrack , it hits you : this is possibly one of the worst political campaign ads ever made .
By the time the man dressed as a wolf pretending to be a sheep appears and crawls on all fours through a field of real sheep , the doubt is gone .
Carly Fiorna is the one responsible for putting out the ad against Tom Campbell , her opponent in California 's Republican Senatorial primary .
YouTube campaign ads like this one are made to attract attention -- and an audience - - from bloggers .
She sure her wish , though she probably does n't like the commentary .
World 's Dumbest Metaphor The New Republic 's Jonathan Chait laughs .
" The funny thing about this ad , aside from the clumsy over - the - top quality , is the metaphor , " he writes .
" Sheep .
But not in a disparaging way .
The good politicians are sheep , doing what Grover Norquist tells them to do .
Campbell , the ad tells us , is only pretending to be a sheep , but he 's really a wolf .
So vote for the sheep . "
Attacking Independence ?
The Washington Post 's Ezra Klein gasps , " It 's almost impossible for me to believe that this ad comparing fiscal conservatives to sheep -- but in a good way ! -- is real .
But it is !
The problem with Tom Campbell , the ad says , is all of his independent thought . "
He writes , " The narrator goes through efforts Campbell made to solve problems , and then asks the audience , can you believe all this responsible governance he attempted ? "
The Sheep Candidate National Review's Maggie Gallagher is stunned .
" I 'm not entirely sure , Daniel , but I think Carly Fiorna just put out an ad in which she tells voters : ' I am the real sheep in this race . ' "
Syncs Up With Pink Floyd Time 's Michael Scherer is delighted .
" The best way to view California Senate Candidate Carly Fiorina 's awesomely bizarre new primary campaign ad -- which includes shots of an alien robot sheep , or something -- is by pressing play on your cassette tape of Pink Floyd 's Dark Side of The Moon just as you click play on YouTube . "
An old rumor holds that the album can be played while watching The Wizard of Oz .
DemonSheep Trends on Twitter
The tag # DemonSheep tag is blowing up Twitter .
A reference to the demonic sheep in the ad , everyone from White House reporters to everyday voters are using it to mock Fiorna and the ad .
Of course , some immediately started a dedicated DemonSheep Twitter account .
This Cost $ 15 K A source tells Wonkette , " Wow … they did shoot all of that sheep stuff .
It was n’t stock footage .
Paid crew for the sheep stuff and an editor for two days worth of cutting that stuff , titling , paid crew , equipment rental and effects plus the gathering of the rest of the stock footage … but there is an office scene too - probably $ 15,000 . "
Yikes .

3 Tips for Stretching Your Retirement Account
Image by scottwills via Flickr
One of concerns that many people have right now — and with good reason — is how they can stretch their retirement funds .
This is a concern , since many have taken a hit to their retirement accounts .
And , of course , Social Security is only meant to be a supplement , and can hardly be relied on in any case .
This time is a time to evaluate your financial situation , and your retirement goals .
It is a time to take stock of what you can do to improve your situation , or at least prevent it from degenerating too far .
There are signs of economic recovery , but that may not be comforting to you when you look at your retirement account statement .
You may still feel the need to make efforts to save your retirement .
So what can you do if you are looking for stretching the funds in your retirement account ?
Here are three things to consider in these tough times :
Consider working longer :
If you already have a job , it might be worth it to put off retirement for a little bit longer .
If you have recently lost a job , it might be a good idea to see what you can find before you start tapping into your retirement account .
This is especially important if you are not 59 1/2 , and may have to pay a penalty for early withdrawal , not to mention the tax implications .
A part - time job can be helpful as well .
If you can find a part - time job that can provide you with income to help reduce your need for tapping into your retirement account .
Look for other income streams :
Your income does n’t have to come from a traditional full - time or part - time job .
You can also cultivate alternative income streams , such as those from a web site or blog or affiliate program .
It is also possible to look for investments , such dividend - paying stocks or income from a rental property , to help you create additional revenue streams that can help you reduce your reliance on your retirement account .
Realize , though , that setting up these income streams can take a great deal of research and work themselves ; it ’s not “ easy ” money .
Downsize your life :
If you want to avoid depleting your retirement account of capital right now , you can stretch your funds by downsizing your life .
Do you still need more than one car ?
Do you need to keep bestowing large gifts on friends and family ?
Perhaps you could sell your home and get something smaller and less expensive .
Do an inventory of your life , and decide whether or not there places where you can cut expenses .
The less you spend , the less you will need your retirement account .
Right now , it is no surprise that many are concerned .
Even though there have been signs of economic recovery , nothing is certain right now .
And it might be some time yet before your retirement account recovers .
That means that it is a good idea to have a plan for stretching your retirement funds as far as they can go .
If it is possible for you to work a little longer and cut back a bit , you can position yourself for the future .
And if you can add some additional income streams , you will be in even better shape .
It costs £ 12,500 to install solar cells on your roof , but new tariffs should give you a return of at least £ 25,000 .
So what 's the catch ?
There is n't one , says Miles Brignall
If the government offered to pay you £ 1,000 a year for the next 25 years , in return for an up - front investment of £ 12,500 , you 'd snap it up in a second .
Well , that 's pretty much the deal on offer this week after the government finally revealed what it will pay those who install electricity generating solar panels – in and around their homes – through the new " Feed - in Tariffs " ( FITs ) .
After years of campaigning by environmental groups – helped in small part by this newspaper – the government has finally agreed to reward households and businesses installing electricity - generating measures with enough of a return to make it a serious financial , as well as an environmental , investment .
If you 've got the money ( which is a big " if " ) and , crucially , a sunny , south - facing roof , you can earn a 7 % - 10 % tax - free return , an income that will rise in line with inflation .
At the same time , you get to do more than your fair share in reducing the UK 's carbon­ emissions .
In the week that the energy regulator , ­ Ofgem , warned the nation to expect 20 % electricity price hikes by 2020 , and warned future supplies were in jeopardy , investors in solar panels will have the added benefit of being a net provider of electricity , and largely insulated from future price hikes that could see household bills top £ 2,000 a year by 2020 .
Announcing the new tariffs ' introduction this week , the energy and climate change secretary Ed Miliband said the guaranteed income would be a big incentive for householders " to make the move to low carbon­ living " .
­
" The feed - in tariff will change the way householders and communities think about their future energy needs , making the payback for investment far shorter than in the past . "
Although Milliband announced a number of tariffs – including what the government will pay those installing wind turbines – the one that will appeal most to the average UK householder will be for installing photovolatiac ( PV ) solar panels – at a typical cost of £ 10,000 - £ 12,500 .
From 1
April , households with approved­ schemes will be paid for the electricity they generate , even if they use all of it themselves .
The level of payment depends on the technology and whether it is being fitted to an existing­ home , or installed as part of newbuild .
Importantly , future payments are guaranteed for the next 25 years and have been , unexpectedly , linked to inflation .
Anyone fitting a typical £ 12,500 , 2.5 kW PV system to their existing home will initially be paid 41.3 p per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) generated .
Enough , according to Miliband , to reward them with up to £ 900 in the first year on top of a £ 140 - a - year saving on their bills .
The measure , which is inevitably quite complicated , is designed to reward those who reduce their own electricity consumption by installing low - energy lighting and A - rated white goods , and to ultimately export excess electricity generated back to the grid .
Households get an extra 3 p for each kWh they export on top of the 41.3 p they get paid for all units generated .
Those building PV roof panels into a new - build home get a slightly lower tariff ( 36.1 p per kWh ) .
The fact that the payments are not taxed make it a particularly rewarding investment for higher - rate taxpayers – those earning more than just over £ 43,000 .
Regulated payments
The feed - in rates change depending on which year you install the technology .
They will also apply to installations commissioned since July 2009 when the policy was announced .
Early adopters , who have installed grant - assisted PV and registered­ for the ROC scheme , will also receive payments , but at just 9p / kWh .
The payments will physically come from your existing electricity supplier , but will be overseen by the regulator Ofgem .
Jeremy Leggett , chairman of SolarCentury , the biggest supplier of PV systems to UK homes , says homeowners need a largish ( 8m2 ) , unshaded , south - facing roof , or similar place to mount panels .
" Feed - in tariffs are going to be a big boost for the industry and for the first - time , homeowners can see a decent financial return , " he says .
" We estimate homeowners can save and earn more than £ 1,000 per year for 25 years , increasing with inflation , giving a payback in around 10 years . "
He says homeowners with flat roofs may well find they can install a system , as will those with conventional roofs that face a few degrees either side of south , east or west .
Panels perform best in unshaded sites angled towards the sun at a pitch of 30 - 40 degrees .
Prior to this week 's announcement , grants of up to £ 2,500 had been available to those installing PV panels under the terms of the government 's Low Carbon Buildings Programme .
There are still grants available for other green technologies .
FITs now provide the entire financial incentive for PV installers .
Dave Timms , climate and energy campaigner at Friends of the Earth , says the new tariffs will allow people to turn their homes into mini- power stations .
" We were hoping the government would go further , but this is very welcome and long overdue , " he says .
" For householders who have a south - facing roof , PV panels are really worth looking at .
Not only are they a sound financial investment , they will also allow you to do your part in tackling climate change .
" Our homes are responsible for over a fifth of UK emissions , but by fitting renewable electricity systems and wind turbines , we can be part of a greener , safer future . "
There is an expectation , he says , that once investors and banks see the benefits of the scheme , specialist loans or top - up mortgages will become available for those who want to install a system , but can't raise the capital .
Take it from me – it's worth it
This week 's announcement on solar panels is good news for homeowners wanting to install green energy systems , simplifying the procedures and shortening the payback time of renewable technologies , writes Ashley Seager .
Ashley Seager went solar three years ago
I fitted solar photovoltaic panels on my house nearly three years ago .
They are great – we get 90 % of our electricity off our own roof over the course of the year .
And three years ago the panels were more expensive than they are now .
We spent £ 17,000 but got half of that back in a grant from the Low Carbon Buildings Programme , which was dogged by complexity and stop - go ­decisions by the government .
It is much easier now .
You install the solar panels or wind turbine and away you go – no messing about with grant applications that take months .
The pain for people like me who have already fitted such technologies is that we will only get a tariff of 9 p per kWh , roughly equivalent to the payments we already get from the government 's renewable obligation certificate scheme .
The Department of Energy and Climate Change ( DECC ) argues that it is incentivising new installations , not helping people who have already done one and may have got a grant for it .
But that means early adopters – many of whom stuck their hand in their pocket for a lot of money and became evangelists for the new technologies – get a lower return than they would get if they had waited .
Pity .
But , undeterred , I am looking at fitting solar thermal panels elsewhere on the roof to generate most of our hot water .
That is because , as well as announcing the cashback for green electricity schemes , DECC also published its proposals for payments for renewable heat gear such as solar thermal or ground source heat pumps .
I reckon that from next April a normal solar thermal system could generate around £ 200 a year , based on the 18 p per kWh DECC is proposing .
Added to the £ 150 - odd you save in heating water , you approach a 10 % return , assuming you pay £ 3,000 - £ 3,500 for your thermal system .
Go for it !
Your questions answered
I have a PV system and am furious I 'm not getting the new tariff .
Can I rip it down and start again ?
Technically , it has to be " new " , and everyone in the industry has speculated as to whether this is possible .
Unclear at best .
These figures look great on paper , but are they guaranteed ?
How much electricity­ your system generates , and the resulting returns will depend on the size and quality of panel and its position .
Shading has to be avoided – even a telegraph wire .
But sun-hours in the UK are remarkably stable and well documented – so you should get close to the promised figures .
What happens if I move house ?
The most obvious drawback , but it need n't put you off .
Estate agents will get used to selling their benefits , and a PV scheme should add to the value .
Lots of people spend £ 12,000 on a kitchen and do n't expect to get the money back .
If your buyer wo n't pay up , find another or take the system with you .
Are there any planning problems ?
In England and Scotland , you do n't need planning permission for most home solar electricity systems , as long as they 're below a certain size – but you should check with your local planning officer if the building is listed , or is in a conservation area .
In Wales and Northern Ireland , you still need permission .
Is it just solar PV ?
No the government has announced tariffs for those fitting wind turbines – good out in the countryside – and also hydro schemes .
Perhaps more importantly , it has said it will be giving feed - in tariffs to households installing solar water heaters , from April 2011 .
These are much cheaper ( £ 3,500 ) .
There 's also help for air and ground - source heat pumps .
Money will be returning to this subject in forthcoming articles .
Have they got to be on the roof ?
Do they require maintenance ?
No .
People­ have installed panels in gardens and on south - facing walls – although given their cost , you will want to find a secure spot where they can't be easily stolen .
There are no moving parts and they require no maintenance – PV systems­ are designed to last 20 - 30 years .

When culture became ideology
By Jens - Martin Eriksen and Frederik Stjernfelt
Multiculturalism has changed the political fronts .
It might seem like the Left defends respect for minority cultures , while the Right stands guard over the national culture .
But in actuality , there is much that unites " culturalism " on the right and the left .

Crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world , but they also are farmed commercially .
Their hide is tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags , whilst crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy .
The most commonly farmed species are the Saltwater and Nile crocodiles , while a hybrid of the Saltwater and the rare Siamese Crocodile is also bred in Asian farms .
Farming has resulted in an increase in the Saltwater crocodile population in Australia , as eggs are usually harvested from the wild , so landowners have an incentive to conserve crocodile habitat .
Crocodiles embryos do not have sex chromosomes , and unlike humans sex is not determined genetically .
Sex is determined by temperature , with males produced at around 31.6 °C , and females produced at slightly lower and higher temperatures .
The average incubation period is around 80 days , and also is dependent upon temperature .
Nile crocodiles may possess a form of homing instinct .
Three rogue saltwater crocodiles were relocated 400 kilometres by helicopter in northern Australia but had returned to their original locations within three weeks , based on data obtained from tracking devices attached to the reptiles
Crocodiles do not have sweat glands and release heat through their mouths .
They often sleep with their mouths open and may even pant like a dog
There is no reliable way of measuring crocodile age , although several techniques are used to derive a reasonable guess .
The most common method is to measure lamellar growth rings in bones and teeth — each ring corresponds to a change in growth rate which typically occurs once a year between dry and wet seasons Tweet
( NaturalNews ) Inquiries to poison control centers about teenage abuse of drugs for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) increased by 76 percent over the last eight years , indicating a surge in rates of the abuse itself , according to a study conducted by researchers from the Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Memorial Center and published in the journal " It 's more bad news on an entrenched problem , " said Steve Pasierb , head of The Partnership for a Drug - Free America , who was not involved in the study .
The researchers reviewed data collected by the American Association of Poison Control Centers between 1998 and 2005 .
They found that the number of calls by parents , emergency room doctors and others about teenagers abusing ADHD drugs increased from 330 per year in 1998 to 581 per year in 2005 , far outpacing the rate of increase in calls about other forms of teenage substance abuse .
The majority of teenagers involved in the calls ended up being treated in emergency rooms , and 42 percent suffered moderate or severe side effects .
Four of the teenagers died .
Far more teenagers are probably experiencing side effects , the researchers noted , since most cases of abuse do n't end in calls to poison control .
During the time period covered by the study , prescriptions for ADHD drugs rose 86 percent in children between the ages of 10 and 19 , from roughly four million to almost eight million .
Pasierb said that many teenagers do not understand that abuse of prescription drugs can lead to potentially fatal side effects .
In the case of ADHD drugs , these can include agitation , rapid heartbeat and dangerously high blood pressure .
" They say , ' It 's FDA approved , how dangerous could it be ? ' " he said .
Research by the Partnership for a Drug - Free America suggests that 19 percent of U.S. teenagers have abused prescription drugs , or nearly one in five .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
An AIDS vaccine that appears to have worked at least partly in Thailand may only temporarily protect patients , with the effects starting to wane after a year or so , researchers reported on Thursday .
HIV - positive women are seen in a social center in Ba Vi district , outside Hanoi , November 30 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Kham
That may explain why results of the experimental vaccine have been so difficult to interpret , said Dr. Nelson Michael , a colonel at the Walter Reed Army Research Institute of Research in Maryland , who helped lead the trial ,
Michael ’s team is trying to find out how or why it might have worked .
They surprised the world last September when they showed the experimental vaccine cut the risk of infection by 31 percent over three years .
“ It is very likely that this vaccine only worked for a short period of time , ” Michael said in a telephone interview .
“ It is a weak , a modest effect but something that we can build on . ”
The vaccine is a combination of Sanofi - Pasteur ’s ALVAC canarypox / HIV vaccine and the HIV vaccine AIDSVAX , made by a San Francisco company called VaxGen and now owned by the nonprofit Global Solutions for Infectious Diseases .
Michael told the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in San Francisco that it may be possible to design a trial that will show better whether the vaccine can really help people .
Part of the problem , he said , was that the 16,000 Thai volunteers who tested the vaccine were not at especially high risk of AIDS infection .
He said he would work with Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , to design trials in Asia or Africa .
According to the United Nations , more than 33 million people are infected with the fatal and incurable virus , with 2.7 million new infections every year .
Even a vaccine that protected for just a year would be useful , Michael said .
“ Is that ideal ? ” No , ” Michael said .
“ But it is true there are vaccines like the flu vaccine where you have to get them every year . ”
Within the next few weeks , Michael said studies will also start to try to find clues from the blood of the vaccinated volunteers .
“ Everyone wants to know why this worked and what lab measurements we could take that could predict this , ” he said .
Results will take roughly a year , he said , but labs all over the world will be looking for so - called correlates -- measurements such as antibody levels that will show whether a vaccine has affected the immune system in the desired way .
“ It is what I call an all - hands - on - deck exercise , ” he said .
The AIDS virus has killed 25 million people since it was identified in the 1980s .
Cocktails of drugs can control HIV but there is no cure .
In 2007 , Merck & Co ended a trial of its vaccine after it was found not to work , and in 2003 , AIDSVAX used alone was found to offer no protection , either .
Each dementia patient costs the economy £ 27,647 each year Dementia now costs the UK economy twice as much as cancer but gets a fraction of the funding to find causes and cures , a report seen by the BBC shows .
For every one pound spent on dementia research , 12 times that sum goes on investigating cancer , figures from the Alzheimer 's Research Trust indicate .
Bridging this gap is urgent , it says , particularly given the numbers with dementia are much higher than thought .
With 821,884 sufferers , dementia costs the UK £ 23bn annually , the report says .
If research leads to a cure for Alzheimer 's and other dementias , annual saving to the UK economy would be equivalent to hosting the London Olympics twice , or funding every British university for three years
Rebecca Wood ,

Smart Thinking : Cheating Dementia
The number of sufferers is 15 % higher than had been estimated , according to the Dementia 2010 Report , and the trust says it will now pass the one million mark before 2025 .
The annual burden on the economy meanwhile is 35 % higher than the previous calculations of £ 17bn .
Researchers from the University of Oxford compared the cost of caring for a person with dementia to the cost of dealing with cancer , heart disease or stroke - the three main causes of death in the UK .

As well as immediate health care expenses , they looked at the costs of social care , unpaid carers and productivity losses .
Every dementia patient , they found , costs the economy £ 27,647 each year - nearly five times more than a cancer patient , and eight times more than those with heart disease .
It was the costs met by unpaid carers and incurred by long - term institutional care - rather than expenses shouldered by the NHS - that pushed up the burden of dementia .
But they also found that the costs of these conditions appeared to bear little relation to the respective amounts invested by government and charities in research into causes , treatment and prevention .
With nearly £ 600 m a year , cancer research funding was 12 times that of the £ 50 m devoted to dementia , while heart disease received three times as much .
Only stroke research received less .
They calculated that for every person with cancer , £ 295 is spent on research , compared with just £ 61 for each person with dementia .
Donation dilemma
The researchers believe the fact that a larger proportion of the cost of caring for cancer and heart disease falls on the NHS , rather than the individual and their family , goes some way to explaining the discrepancy in government funding for research .
Cancer and heart charities have also tended to be larger than those devoted to dementia .
But our own perceptions of this disease - one which primarily strikes in old age - may influence what we are prepared to donate , the researchers suggest .
" Many of us know people who have had cancer or heart disease but have been successfully treated and survived , so there is a perception that something can be done , and that more research will allow even more to be done , " says Alastair Gray , professor of health economics at the University of Oxford and author of the report .
" In contrast there are no cures for dementia at present ; there are not even many ways of delaying it or slowing it down , so there may well be a feeling of inevitability surrounding it .
However the lack of effective treatments is surely an argument for devoting more effort to research , not less . "
Rebecca Wood , head of the Alzheimer 's Research Trust , said the true economic impact of dementia " had been ignored for too long .
This report shows that dementia is the greatest medical challenge of the 21st Century " .
" If research leads to a cure for Alzheimer 's and other dementias , annual saving to the UK economy would be equivalent to hosting the London Olympics twice , or funding every British university for three years . "
If we could just delay the onset of dementia by five years , we'd be able to save huge amounts
Andrew Ketteringham
Alzheimer 's Society
Send us your comments Michelle Mitchell , charity director for Age Concern and Help the Aged , said the disease was not going to go away and it was of " paramount importance " that the research was funded now .
Andrew Ketteringham , of the Alzheimer 's Society , said : " We 've got a lot of catching up to do and a lot of investment to do .
And if people say , ' Well , how can we afford that ? ' , I say , ' Well , we can't afford not to do that . '
" If we could just delay the onset of dementia by five years , we'd be able to save huge amounts . "
But Care Services Minister Phil
Hope said that by next year the government would be investing nearly £ 1bn in health research .
" This money is awarded to the best quality research for any health condition , including dementia .
" I have set up a new ministerial group which will drive forward research into the causes , cure and care of dementia and help dementia researchers get more access to funding .
This group will hold its first meeting later this month .
" I have also just appointed a new National Clinical Director for Dementia , Professor Alistair Burns , to provide leadership across the whole dementia strategy and help bring up standards of dementia care across the country .

Well , Sarah Palin's " death panels " may have been named " Lie of the Year , " but they live on in Tea Party movement legend .
Ray Stevens -- noted for such novelty songs as " The Streak " and " Ahab the Arab " -- has a music video out that 's being hailed as " the Anthem of the Tea Party movement " titled " We the People " :
“ We the People ” is about Obamacare and the health - care reform bills that have passed both houses of Congress .
The lyrics express a comic , but pointed warning to members of Congress : “ You vote Obamacare , we ’re going to vote you out of there .
We the People have awakened to your tricks .
You vote to let this pass , you ’re going to be out on your ( sound of foghorn ) . ”
They also feature a noteworthy lyric :
We 've heard from Hannity , Beck and Limbaugh What you got in mind for Grandma [ Video : Nurse putting chloroformed cloth over elderly woman 's face ]
Yeah , now that you mention it , we have heard that from those three -- and a number of others .
And we also know that IT'S A FREAKING LIE .
And you 'll notice that Bill O'Reilly played this very snippet the other night , quite approvingly , and made no attempt to correct the record .
This is how the Fox propagandists keep spreading the lies .
But then , if there were some nugget of news on Fox that were actually true , these nimrods would never believe it .
An interesting little development on one of the story lines from The Hockey Stick Illusion .
In Chapter 14 , I tell the story of one of Michael Mann 's later attempts at creating a hockey stick shaped temperature curve - Mann 2008 .
This paper is not as well - known as the Hockey Stick itself , of course , but has become fairly notorious because of an oddity in Mann 's algorithm .
Because of the way it works , the algorithm is unable to detect the orientation of the proxy series in a dataset and in the case of Mann 2008 , this failing had some unfortunate consequences , namely that some of the series ended up upside - down , with what would normally have been read as declining temperatures flipped over so that they looked like warming .
This error was picked up extremely quickly by Climate Audit readers , and McIntyre included this point in a formal comment on the paper .
The correction did n't , however , prevent an identical error being made in a later paper , Kaufman 2009 , which was written by some of the same authors as Mann 2008 ( although not the HockeyStickMeister himself ) .
McIntyre 's comment was accepted for publication but received a brief dismissal from Mann et al , who said that his observation was " bizarre " .
Now , however , the story has moved on slightly .
Kaufman has admitted the error in his paper and has just published a correction ( although without mentioning McIntyre ) .
Interestingly though , some of the Scandinavian scientists involved in collecting the original data series have revealed that they have been discussing the problem with Raymond Bradley , an author on both the Mann 2008 and Kaufman 2009 papers .
Bradley , it seems , has told Professor Matti Saarnisto that the error was not deliberate , an explanation that the Finn is trying hard to accept .
Well , when Bradley says so to me , I do n’t doubt even a slightest moment .
I hold him in high regard .
He is one of the best paleoclimate researchers , and … a frequent visitor in Finland .
Well , absolutely , but with the same error happening again and again , one does start to wonder .
Certainly Saarnisto seems troubled .
It has been turned twice upside - down in Science , and now I doubt if it can be a mistake anymore .
It 's fair to say that this position is probably widely shared .
Lady Bracknell might have something to say about this : " To flip one proxy series may be regarded as a misfortune , Dr Bradley , to flip two .... "
And in fact the error has been observed no less than three times now .
One hates to think what Lady Bracknell would think of that .
But if this is n't bad enough , there 's an even sharper sting in the tail .
If Bradley , one of Mann 's co-authors on the 2008 paper , says the error was inadvertent , how is it that when he and Mann responded to McIntyre 's comment on that paper , they described the idea that some of the proxies were upside down as " bizarre " ?
By Emily Williams
Part I : How It Works
NEW YORK : For five years I was an international literary scout .
That means for five years I groaned inside whenever anyone asked me what I did .
Scouting occupies a strange niche in book publishing , itself a rather inscrutable business from the outside , and after a time most scouts resign themselves to working — very hard — at an occupation not even their closest family members will ever fully understand .
( So , Mom and Dad , this one ’s for you ! )
My basic answer went something like this : publishing is a marketplace .
Agents almost always submit a manuscript to more than one editor , and if that manuscript is good the editors who want to acquire it have to compete for it , both financially and by reputation .
The same is true among international publishers — and film studios — who want to buy rights to the best American books .
It ’s competitive , and we help make sure the companies we work for know about the books that might interest them .
In the best cases we can even position them so they have the first shot at something and get to read and make an offer before anyone else .
The easiest way to understand it is as a consulting role — we ’re our clients ’ eyes and ears in New York , looking out for their best interests , keeping our finger on the pulse of the book world .
Cut - Throat Reality
All true , but none of this manages to convey the cut - throat reality of a scout ’s day - to - day :
The endless piles of reading at night and on the weekends , the long work hours spent managing copious quantities of information , responding to clients in six different time zones , meeting and winning over anyone who might ever be in possession of an interesting book , and alternately strong - arming , cajoling or begging agents and editors in an attempt to get your hands on this week ’s hot piece of material before any of your equally charming and savvy competitor scouts beat you to it .
If , like many scouts , you work for large publishers with many different imprints , it is very hard to put limitations of the kind of books you scout — it boils down to any book in any genre that is good and / or commercial enough to be worth considering for translation .
That ’s a lot of books .
I once worked it out to be about 10 - 20 new titles per week ( that ’s after filtering down to the most interesting titles ) , many of which we hear about before they ’re even sold to a publisher , and most of which we then continue to track for important developments and client interest , all the way through publication and reviews .
Keep in mind that each book moves at its own pace , ( meaning this process can take anywhere from 3 months to 10 years or longer , that pub dates are notoriously moving targets ) , and that ( despite complaints about editing being a dead art ) a lot of books change form pretty dramatically between when they ’re on offer to publishers and when they ’re finally released into the market , and you will get some sense of the cumulative complexity involved .
“ Scouting is a more than full time job , ” says Chandler Crawford , the former head of Sanford Greenburger ’s scouting division who left to set up her own rights agency after she decided she needed more time for her family .
“ All of the nighttime and weekend reading , and the lunches and the cocktail parties and the publication parties and all of the taking out agents and editors is just not really conducive when you have a child who needs you . ”
The social side may sound glamorous , but the relentlessness of it all wears you down after a while .
“ It ’s brutal , it ’s one of the hardest jobs in publishing , ” agrees Rebecca Gardner , who started out as a scout at Maria B. Campbell Associates and has since sold rights on both the publisher side , recently as Director of Subsidiary Rights for the Random House Publishing Group , and on the agency side in her new post as Rights Director for The Gernert Company .
“ A huge part of it in my mind is not only the hours and the mountains of reading and the fast pace , it ’s the fact that you ’re inherently never in control . ”
Who Needs to Know This , And How Quickly ?
Scouts never set the timing :
They must find and react to whatever is on submission , which is determined in any given week by the individual decisions of agents and rights sellers scattered across the industry .
“ You ’re having to be so nimble all the time .
I think scouting is amazing training if you ’re just starting out in publishing , it taught me to think in such a big picture way , and connect dots in every way possible , to have a quick reaction time .
It does cause you to think ‘ who needs to know this and how quickly ? ’ as a knee - jerk baseline way of looking at the world all the time . ”
On the rare occasion I ever got this far in an explanation of my former job , the next question would be , well , how do you find out about new books ?
Aha , now we ’re getting somewhere .
That is exactly the crux of it .
Good scouting is being perpetually open to the idea that the next big book could come from anywhere at any moment .
There are some predictable patterns — the fall blockbuster season , the build - up of interesting projects before book fairs — but most books are scouted through a half - methodical , half - haphazard trolling of each scout ’s network , week - in and week - out .
This network ideally consists of a number of well placed editors who receive the best submissions in each genre , as well as cordial relations with the agents , who may go so far as to give a friendly scout a heads up if they ’re sending out a manuscript they ’re excited about .
Once a scout hears about a project that sounds interesting , the next step is to figure out how quickly it ’s moving and how to get her or his hands on the material .
Again , some agents are accommodating , though many wo n’t share any material until a US deal is in place .
Editors are more likely to slip you a manuscript they ’ve already read and rejected , which means it must have already been on submission for several days and the clock is ticking , and if it ’s good , some other scout may already have it and have sent it out to their clients ( a.k.a. the competition ) , who may be preparing a pre-emptive offer even as we speak …
You see where the adrenaline kicks in .
Nobody hands a scout a list of where a book has been submitted .
In chasing down material it is essential to have a good understanding of which editors at which imprints are likely to get what kinds of manuscripts , and the more nuanced a command you have of the particular affinities between individual editors and agents , the better off you are .
At an advanced , PhD - in - the - hard - knocks - of - scouting level , this involves an encyclopedic knowledge of the professional and , yes , personal entanglements between dozens of agents and editors stretching around the globe and back through years of deals and job moves .
This hard - won industry savvy is a scout ’s greatest weapon — nothing can give you control over the initial timing of a book , but having an intimate knowledge of the moving parts can grant you some predictive powers over what is likely to happen next .
Why Editors and Agents Work with Scouts
Okay but why , you ask , still puzzled , would editors talk to scouts in the first place ?
Could n’t they get in trouble ?
What do scouts have to offer editors ?
A very good question , considering that scouts trade in very little that is tangible or quantifiable .
“ It ’s an information source for editors , ” explains Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publisher Bruce Nichols , “ It ’s information you might not get elsewhere from someone whose self - interest is not so direct in any given project . ”
For example : “ To hear about something that ’s out on submission that might not have been submitted to me , sometimes you can call the agent and get in on something if the agent had n’t been thinking of you .
But more often , it would give us a sense of what people around the world are thinking .
Sometimes we ’re being offered world rights and sometimes we ’re not , or sometimes it ’s negotiable , so to have some clue that there were already great reads in various territories can be very helpful in figuring out what we want to try to buy or how much we want to try to spend .
And then sometimes , even if we were only thinking about North American rights , just to hear other perspectives on the reading is valuable .
We still trust ourselves for our own market more than anybody else , but it ’s intriguing when something that did n’t seem spectacular is getting phenomenal reads , or vice versa . ”
This , to me , is the essence of the role scouts play .
Ultimately , whether we ’re editors or agents or scouts , the encounter with a new book comes down to one person in a room reading , that solitary endeavor we all fell in love with to begin with .
Except that agents and editors are then asked to make financial and business decisions on the basis of that subjective experience .
This can be both exhilarating and moderately terrifying , and the tension only grows as the money in a prospective deal mounts .
Because of the unpredictable nature of the book business , the acquisitions process is based much more on gut instinct than scientific method , and while every professional has to trust their own skill as a reader , honed over many years and hundreds of books , it can be reassuring to check one ’s reaction against a small community of your peers .
Scouts act both as disinterested readers as well as a useful conduit for information about how other editors , in the US and around the world , are reacting to a manuscript .
This generally has the effect or amplifying the negative reads that can cause a manuscript to sink without a trace , or on the positive side , building up the buzz and excitement .
How do agents feel about this ?
“ At the moment it ’s really hard in terms of selling , and I think agents generally feel the more the merrier , ” says Gardner .
“ I think agents absolutely love it . ”
Agents have made the same solitary calculation about a book ’s market potential , and in doing so they have taken on the hopes and aspirations of an author , for whom that manuscript may represent years of labor .
The submissions process is often the first test they have of whether the book will live up to the potential they saw in it .
When the reaction is positive , scouts can help generate momentum .
Gardner continues , “ Smart agents understand the power of how scouts can drive attention for a project and I would be amazed to meet the agent who felt anything negative about having an editor call them about a book they had n’t been submitted because they heard about it from a scout .
The agent might play it that way with the editor , but 98 % of the time an agent is going to be very happy to get that phone call because it ’s going to mean that people are talking about their book , and that is what they always want . ”
Tracking Heat and Priming the Market
Crawford concurs .
“ I do try to get manuscripts to scouts as often as I can as quickly as I can , because I know it can be a great gift to an agent and an author .
I also know these days that people will get it electronically so I ’d rather do the scout a favor and send it to them myself rather than have to make them use up one of their favors with an editor , getting it from an editor .
If I give it to them then I suspect it might be accepted more graciously . ”
The scouts ’ enthusiasm can be such a powerful tool , in fact , that there were times during my own time as a scout when I was worried we were helping to drive up the price of manuscripts .
Scouts are paid on retainer rather than commission , their primary motivation is to keep their clients happy and financially solvent — and since those clients are publishers , and the price set in one territory is often translated proportionally to the next territory , overpaying for books is not something they ’d want to encourage .
Nichols ’s response was reassuring .
“ It is certainly true that if pretty quickly on the heels of a submission you hear from a couple different scouts that there ’s a lot of buzz going on it just automatically ratchets up the expectations and attention .
Does that by itself mean you ’re suddenly increasing your offer ?
No , but I have seen frenzies happen pretty quickly .
There is some indefinable quality about buzz that ’s partly scout - related and - generated but not only .
I think ultimately some publisher has to drive the buzz by starting off and saying , I think this is going to go for a lot of money .
But scouts can definitely grease those wheels pretty well . ”
Crawford agrees .
“ From the agent ’s side , people are n’t going to buy a book for a certain price unless they choose to spend that amount of money . ”
From the agent side , though , higher prices are all to the good , as Gardner points out .
“ I think most agents do perceive that ’s a way to ‘ use ’ scouts .
But as far as the price goes I feel fully that the market takes care of itself .
If Spain can spend a gazillion dollars on something , it ’s because they see it . ”
Besides , says Gardner , “ It ’s the nature of the beast .
As a scout your job is to track what is the stuff that has the most heat under it .
Do scouts create that heat ?
On some level yes , but not something out of nothing .
The great publishing model that everyone would always like to have is buying that little gem that nobody else sees , you pay no money for it , and it turns into The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society and therein lies profit that you do n’t get when you ’ve bought The Gargoyle for a million dollars and it has to be a humongous success out of the gate and it does n’t even break even .
From a foreign publisher perspective I can understand … but that ’s not what they ’re paying scouts for .
If you ’re of a big enough size and you ’re going to work with a scout , then my feeling is that really their value is knowing what the big stuff is .
Now that publisher can at any time make the judgment call as to whether they want to get in on it .
It ’s not the scouts who are driving up the price , it ’s just that the scouts are drawing attention to things that are good !
And good things , a lot of people want them , then you get your competition , and they get more expensive . ”
Nichols takes a similarly pragmatic view .
“ As a general rule projects that go in heated auctions or for fast pre-empts go for more money than they could possibly earn out .
If there ’s a whole lot of buzz and it just cranks the price up , whoever really , really wants it is probably going to be increasing its numbers just to get there . ”
Crawford adds , “ Look , if you get more people being enthusiastic about a book , maybe it will make the price go up , but it means that there ’s something to be said for the book , and I never think that ’s a bad thing .
And prices are not as high as they were , let ’s be serious ! ”
And , as Gardner notes , there are worse fates for a book than being the subject of a heated auction .
“ I think that ’s one of the benefits of working with scouts , you ’ve got this extra engine drawing attention to your projects .
At the end of the day it ’s better to have the attention than nothing at all , which is death . ”

BONUS : What Have You Done to Get an Early Look at a Book ?
The Earth is warming up .
That 's a fact .
Denialists will deny ( and no doubt will amp up the noise in the comments below ) but the truth is the Earth has warmed on average over a degree Fahrenheit in the past century or so , and the past decade , 2000 - 2009 , was the warmest on record .
NASA is not taking this lightly .
Our space agency has a fleet of satellites in orbit which examine the Earth , taking its temperature and measuring the effects of this global rise in heat .
They have a website called A Warming World , which does a really good job discussing the reality of global warming , and debunking some of the bigger claims of the denialists .
A video they put online discusses things like how changing solar input might affect the Earth , how much of this energy from the Sun is reflected , and how much is trapped .
It 's done simply , elegantly , and with excellent graphics that show just how the Earth is warming up .
They 've also put online a devastating series of images depicting what 's happening on our warming world .
Here 's one of the Bering Glacier , taken by Landsat 7 in 2002 :
In the past century , rising temperatures have caused this glacier 's terminus to retreat 12 km ( 7+ miles ) , and the ice has thinned by several hundred meters .
They have many other images there as well showing what 's going on .
If I were to say what the biggest problem we have with all this , it 's that , ironically , while the warming is happening rapidly on a geological timescale , and too rapidly for us to wait much longer to take action , the changes are happening too slowly to shake people out of their complacence .
I 'm certainly not wishing the effects were accelerated !
But it 's far too easy for political maneuvering and loud noise - making to distract people from a very real and very serious issue .
I have a lot of confidence in humans .
We 're smart , and even better , we 're clever .
There are solutions to global warming , and a lot of them are engineering and technology - driven -- I think we can advance technology greatly while actually fighting the climate change .
But we also have to change our behavior , and part of that is facing reality and accepting that this really is happening , and that we have to get off our fat cans and do something about it .
The noise machine will rattle cages and distract and sling mud and do a grave disservice to everyone .
But I 'll be here to fight them along with thousands and thousands of other scientists .
And you know what ?
I have a hope : if we must battle over this for the next hundred years , we 'll have a nice , cool world in which to do it .

The Israeli Air Force has introduced a fleet of pilotless aircraft that can stay in the air for nearly a day and fly as far as the Gulf .
The Eitan drones , which have a wingspan of 86ft ( 26 m ) , are the size of Boeing 737 passenger jets .
They can reach an altitude of more than 40,000ft ( 12,000 m ) and fly for more than 20 consecutive hours .
AP quoted defence officials as saying the planes could provide surveillance and jam enemy communications .
Israel , along with the US and other Western nations , believes Iran is trying to develop nuclear weapons and has repeatedly suggested it could attack the country if diplomatic attempts to curb the programme fail .
At the fleet 's inauguration ceremony at an airbase in central Israel , IAF commander Maj Gen Ido Nehushtan said the new drone " has the potential to be able to conduct new missions down the line as they become relevant " .
Israeli officials refused to say how large the new fleet was .

CAMBRIDGE , Mass . --
In an important first for a promising new technology , scientists have used a quantum computer to calculate the precise energy of molecular hydrogen .
This groundbreaking approach to molecular simulations could have profound implications not just for quantum chemistry , but also for a range of fields from cryptography to materials science .
" One of the most important problems for many theoretical chemists is how to execute exact simulations of chemical systems , " says author Alán Aspuru - Guzik , assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University .
" This is the first time that a quantum computer has been built to provide these precise calculations . "
The work , described this week in Nature Chemistry , comes from a partnership between Aspuru - Guzik 's team of theoretical chemists at Harvard and a group of experimental physicists led by Andrew White at the University of Queensland in Brisbane , Australia .
Aspuru - Guzik 's team coordinated experimental design and performed key calculations , while his partners in Australia assembled the physical " computer " and ran the experiments .
" We were the software guys , " says Aspuru - Guzik , " and they were the hardware guys . "
While modern supercomputers can perform approximate simulations of simple molecular systems , increasing the size of the system results in an exponential increase in computation time .
Quantum computing has been heralded for its potential to solve certain types of problems that are impossible for conventional computers to crack .
Rather than using binary bits labeled as " zero " and " one " to encode data , as in a conventional computer , quantum computing stores information in qubits , which can represent both " zero " and " one " simultaneously .
When a quantum computer is put to work on a problem , it considers all possible answers by simultaneously arranging its qubits into every combination of " zeroes " and " ones . "
Since one sequence of qubits can represent many different numbers , a quantum computer would make far fewer computations than a conventional one in solving some problems .
After the computer 's work is done , a measurement of its qubits provides the answer .
" Because classical computers do n't scale efficiently , if you simulate anything larger than four or five atoms -- for example , a chemical reaction , or even a moderately complex molecule -- it becomes an intractable problem very quickly , " says author James Whitfield , research assistant in chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard .
" Approximate computations of such systems are usually the best chemists can do . "
Aspuru -Guzik and his colleagues confronted this problem with a conceptually elegant idea .
" If it is computationally too complex to simulate a quantum system using a classical computer , " he says , " why not simulate quantum systems with another quantum system ? "
Such an approach could , in theory , result in highly precise calculations while using a fraction the resources of conventional computing .
While a number of other physical systems could serve as a computer framework , Aspuru - Guzik 's colleagues in Australia used the information encoded in two entangled photons to conduct their hydrogen molecule simulations .
Each calculated energy level was the result of 20 such quantum measurements , resulting in a highly precise measurement of each geometric state of molecular hydrogen .
" This approach to computation represents an entirely new way of providing exact solutions to a range of problems for which the conventional wisdom is that approximation is the only possibility , " says Aspuru - Guzik .
Ultimately , the same quantum computer that could transform Internet cryptography could also calculate the lowest energy conformations of molecules as complex as cholesterol .
###
Aspuru - Guzik and Whitfield 's Harvard co-authors on the Nature Chemistry paper are Ivan Kassal , Jacob D. Biamonte , and Masoud Mohseni .
Financial support was provided by the US Army Research Office and the Australian Research Council Federation Fellow and Centre of Excellence programs .
Aspuru - Guzik recently received support from the DARPA Young Investigator Program , the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation , and the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation to pursue research towards practical quantum simulators .
Above all else , answer the inquiry .

Need to make a mix …
Sony has claimed that upcoming hack - and - slash God of War III is only doable on the PS3 , prompting gamers everywhere to point out " Yes , because you own the IP . "
In the struggle between Sony 's PS3 and Microsoft 's Xbox 360 for dominance , key exclusives are seen as the road to success :
The Xbox 360 may have Mass Effect 2 , but the PS3 has God of War III - widely seen as a system seller .
Speaking with CVG , GOW3's UK product manager Claire Backhouse reinforced the idea that the mythology - slaughtering carnagefest was only possible with the power of Sony 's sleek black machine , just like they 've claimed with every other PS3 exclusive since freakin ' Resistance .
" The dynamic lighting solution employed in GOW III is only feasible through the computing power provided by the Cell SPUs , " said Backhouse .
" For example , using the High Dynamic Range Lighting ( HDRL ) technology , the camera - when using Kratos ' sightline - will emulate the human retina , causing players to feel a sharp brightness when Kratos exits a dark area and enters a sunlit area , similar to how the human eye would need to adjust . "
Okay , I get that GOW3 looks pretty , yes , but something in me finds this to be ... less than the most stellar example Backhouse could have used .
Not only does this have little to no effect on gameplay ( unless Kratos will be spending most of the game from a first - person view repeatedly entering dark and bright areas , which I doubt ) , it 's not the best example to use given that this effect has already been accomplished in a game , and that game was most decidedly not on the PS3 .
This exact same visual effect - making the transition between sunny spaces and dark ones jarring to the eye , and simulating how things look blurry when backlit - was used to great effect in Ico , which was a PS2 game ( an early PS2 game , even ) .
Now , while I 'm sure that God of War III 's version is technologically superior and that Ico was just compensating using stellar art direction and sleight - of - hand , does n't that suggest that similar effects could be done without the raw power of the PS3 , but with developer creativity ?
Do n't get me wrong , I like my PS3 and I think GOW3 is going to be one fun experience ( even if Bayonetta 's combat makes Kratos look sluggish ) but if you 're going to trumpet the power of your game , you should really use an example that actually shows it off .

Exclusive The Home Office has created a new unit to oversee a massive increase in surveillance of the internet , The Register has learned , quashing suggestions the plans are on hold until after the election .
The new Communications Capabilities Directorate ( CCD ) has been created as a structure to implement the £ 2bn Interception Modernisation Programme ( IMP ) , sources said .
The CCD is staffed by the same officials who have have been working on IMP since 2007 , but it establishes the project on a more formal basis in the Home Office .
It is not yet included on the Home Office 's list of directorates .
The intelligence and law enforcement agencies have pushed hard for new laws to force communications providers to store details of who contacts whom , when , where and how via the internet .
However , following a consultation last year , when the Home Office 's plans were heavily criticised by ISPs and mobile companies , it was widely assumed progress on IMP would slow or stop .
The CCD has continued meeting with industry to try to allay concerns about the project 's costs , effect on customer privacy and technical feasibility .
" The Home Office has long been working with communications service providers to take forward legislation providing for the retention of communications data , " a Home Office spokesman said .
" That is continuing . "
" More recently , we have been considering how , in a changing communications environment , lawful acquisition of communications data and interception of communications can continue to save lives , to counter terrorism , to detect crime and prosecute offenders , and to protect the public . "
Officials envisage communications providers will maintain giant databases of everything their customers do online , incluing email , social networking , web browsing and making VoIP calls .
They want providers to process the mass of data to link it to individuals , to make it easier for authorities to access .
Access to communications data is currently governed by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.
Under European legslation ISPs are required to retain basic information about what their customers do online , but not to open their data packets to record who they contact on Facebook , for example .
The Home Office spokesman added : " This is a diverse range of activity now organised within a single Communications Capabilities Directorate with its focus on work under current legislation .
" The Directorate will continue to consider the challenges posed by new technologies , working closely with communications service providers and others to bring forward proposals that command public confidence and demonstrate an appropriate balance between privacy and security . "
Work is also continuing at GCHQ in Cheltenham on its classified Mastering the Internet programme , which is developing systems and methods for extracting intelligence from the huge volumes of new surveillance data online services can generate . ®

One area that I have always found lacking on Linux is a good Dictionary software .
I have tired quite a few free and opensource dictionary software for linux , some very good , but non had the WOW factor to keep me using them again and again .
Well that was until I stumbled ( no pun intended ) on Artha ( yeah I know free software apps and their funny names )
Artha is a free cross-platform English thesaurus that works completely off - line and is based on WordNet .
It is released under the GNU General Public Licence version
Source
Features
Although a gtk app it has very little gnome dependencies ( So KDE fans dont have to worry - much .
Yeah yeah I know its would have been better if written in Qt but then “ what can we do ” 🙁 )
However Artha has tons of features to make anyone ( Gnome , Kde , whatever floats your boat ) Drool .
Offline : Unlike most dictionaries which can only be used if you are online .
Artha works completely offline .
So if you like me are not completely bought up by all this cloud computing craze and live in Africa where Internet sucks .
Then Artha is a no brainer for you .
( Even if you are lucky and have highspeed internet Artha is also a no brainer )

So if you like me are not completely bought up by all this cloud computing craze and live in Africa where Internet sucks .
Then Artha is a no brainer for you .
( Even if you are lucky and have highspeed internet Artha is also a no brainer ) Regular Expressions Search : OK lets say there is a word you vaguely know or you are unclear as to its meaning or spelling .
( Happens to me a lot ) you can speed up / narrow the search using regular expression to locate the particular word they have in mind .
OK lets say there is a word you vaguely know or you are unclear as to its meaning or spelling .

Suggestions :
Say you mispelled a word Artha can give you near matching suggestions ( I also love this )
Say you mispelled a word Artha can give you near matching suggestions ( I also love this ) Relative to Sense Mapping : Artha does n’t just give you the meaning of words .
It so includes words like Synonyms , antonyms .
When you Select a relative its corresponding definition is scrolled and highlighted for easy comprehension .
The Awesomest Feature that rules them all : Yeah I saved best for the last .
For me the feature of Artha which kills every other Dictionary software out there is its support for Notifications .
Here is how it works – Lets say I was going through my RSS reader and I found a word am not familiar with I just need to highlight the word , press the keyboard combination Ctrl + Alt +
W
( Which can be changed to any key combo that suits you )
The meaning of the word gets displayed as a Notification Bubble .
Hence I can easily check the meaning of the word without having to launch the application window .
The notification feature of Artha is supported system wide and works with just about every application which support text highlighting .
Installation
Ubuntu / Debian : Although Artha is available in the Ubuntu / Debian Repository
The version there is quite dated .
However the latest version has been compiled to .deb and can be downloaded from here
Fedora ( Leonidas / 11 or above ) : Artha can be installed with
yum install artha
Note *
The version in the Fedora Reposittory is 0.9.1
Other Linuxes :
If a binary package is not available for your distribution , you can easy download the source code from here and follow this installation instructions on how to compile from source .
Configuration : After installation , the rest is easy .
When you start Artha Its minimizes in the Notification area of your desktop .
From the application window you can easily set you keyboard short cut by clicking on the settings .
The default keyboard shortcut is Ctrl + Alt - W .
By default the Notification feature is disabled but can be easily enabled by right clicking on the notification area icon .
The rest is easy .
I found Artha to be very useful and goes a long way to enhance my workflow and user experience .
I hope someone find this useful .

Abdullah Faisal was deported four years into a seven - year sentence Kenyan police say they have deported a Jamaican - born Muslim cleric notorious for preaching racial hatred but have declined to say where he has gone .
Abdullah al - Faisal had been sent to a " friendly neighbouring country " despite trouble finding a country to take him , a police spokesman told the BBC .
But a Muslim group later insisted Faisal was still in Nairobi .
Kenyan officials have said Faisal was being deported because of his " terrorist history " .
He has served four years in a UK prison after being convicted of soliciting the murder of Jews and Hindus .
But the authorities have since given mixed signals over Faisal 's whereabouts .
Some reports say Kenya has failed to deport him because no other country is willing to have him .
Other reports quote officials as saying he was sent by road to Tanzania on Monday night .
Terrorist ' watch - list '
Police spokesman Eric Kiraithe told the BBC there had been difficulties with deporting him because no - one wanted to grant him a visa even for transit .
Mr Kiraithe confirmed only that Faisal had left Kenya and that his final destination was Jamaica .
We are not deporting him because he is a Muslim
Otieno Kajwang
Immigration minister Shortly afterwards , Al - Amin Kimathi , of the Muslim Human Rights Forum , insisted that the authorities had not managed to expel him .
Faisal was arrested after attending evening prayers at a mosque in Mombasa last Thursday .
Muslim campaigners in Kenya have claimed Muslim clerics were being targeted .
" It is wrong for this government to allow other scholars to come in the country and accept them and deport other scholars without any reason so far , " one Muslim protester said .
But Immigration Minister Otieno Kajwang said Faisal was on an international watch - list of terrorists .
The minister , quoted in Kenya 's Daily Nation newspaper , admitted they had no charges against him , but said : " We are not deporting him because he is a Muslim .
" We are deporting him because of his terrorist history and the fact that he is on the international watch - list . "
African connection Faisal was born Trevor William Forrest in St James , Jamaica , and left the island for the UK 26 years ago .
His parents were Salvation Army officers and he was raised as a Christian .
At the age of 16 he went to Saudi Arabia - where he is believed to have spent eight years - and became a Muslim .
He took a degree in Islamic Studies in the Saudi capital of Riyadh , before coming back to the UK .
Faisal spent years travelling the UK preaching racial hatred urging his audience to kill Jews , Hindus and Westerners .
A year after being deported from the UK in 2007 , he was preaching in South Africa .
Mr Kajwang said that Faisal had recently " arrived in Nigeria , passed through Angola , Mozambique , Swaziland and Malawi , " before crossing from Tanzania into Kenya on 24 December .

http://www.examiner.com/x-18425-LA-County-Nonpartisan-Examiner~y2010m1d18-MLK-assassinated-by-US-government-King-family-ci...
Martin Luther King ’s family and his attorney , William F. Pepper , won a civil trial that found US government agencies guilty in the wrongful death of Martin Luther King .
The 1999 trial , King Family versus Jowers and Other Unknown Co-Conspirators , is the only trial ever conducted on the assassination of Dr. King .
The King family ’s attempts for a criminal trial were denied , as suspect James Ray ’s recant of what he claimed was a false confession was denied .
King ’s family and Mr. Pepper allege that Dr. King ’s speech calling upon America to end the Vietnam War , Beyond Vietnam : A time to break silence , and his plan for a 500,000 camp - in for Washington , D.C. in the summer of 1968 were a threat to dominant and fascist political factions within US government .
The King Center , managed by his family , provide the transcript to the trial here .
A transcript of a talk given by Mr. Pepper explaining the trial and his book with detailed documentation , An Act of State , is here ( 2 - page summary here ) .
I also recommend David Ratcliffe ’s review of the book , Jim Douglass ’ coverage of the trial , and watching Mr. Pepper ’s talk on the subject below .
I also suggest Robert Kennedy ’s assassination was also a government - supported assassination to suppress war dissent .
“ For a quarter of a century , Bill Pepper conducted an independent investigation of the assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr. He opened his files to our family , encouraged us to speak with the witnesses , and represented our family in the civil trial against the conspirators .
The jury affirmed his findings , providing our family with a long - sought sense of closure and peace , which had been denied by official disinformation and cover-ups .
Now the findings of his exhaustive investigation and additional revelations from the trial are presented in the pages of this important book .
We recommend it highly to everyone who seeks the truth about Dr. King 's assassination . ” — Coretta Scott King
Hundreds of writers have documented US corporate media collusion with US government to disinform the American public with wars and supporting policy of fascism .
Corporate media ’s refusal to cover this trial and report upon it is a revealing case study .
Policy response : Gandhi and Martin Luther King advocated public understanding of the facts and non-cooperation with evil .
I ’m among hundreds who advocate :
1.Understand the laws of war .
These were legislated after WW2 and are crystal - clear that only self - defense , in a narrow legal meaning , can justify war .
The current US wars are not even close to being lawful .
Those involved with US military , government , and law enforcement have an oath to protect and defend the US Constitution , not “ always place the mission first . ”
To fulfill their oath they must immediately refuse and end all orders associated with unlawful wars and military - related constant violation of treaties .
2. End the transfer of trillions of American taxpayer money to banksters and admitted as “ lost ” by our military .
End poverty through global cooperation to achieve the UN Millennium Goals by developed countries investing 0.7 % of their income .
Support global security through cooperation , dignity , justice , and freedom .
Create a US Department of Peace to help .
3.Communicate .
Trust your unique , beautiful , and powerful self - expression to share as you feel appropriate .
Understand that while many people are ready to embrace difficult facts , many are not .
Anticipate that you will be attacked and prepare your virtuous response in the spirit of competition , just as you do in other fields .
4.Prosecute the war leaders for obvious violation of the letter and spirit of US war laws .
Because the crimes are so broad and deep , I recommend Truth and Reconciliation ( T&R ) to exchange full truth and return of stolen US assets for non-prosecution .
This is the most expeditious way to understand and end all unlawful and harmful acts .
Those who reject T&R are subject to prosecution .

Germany has strict laws to ensure children are seen but not heard Children in the German capital Berlin are to be exempt from strict laws on noise pollution .
An amendment to the city 's law now makes it " fundamentally and socially tolerable " for members of the younger generation to make a racket .
Berlin has become the first of Germany 's 16 federal states to adopt such legislation .
But all Berliners - children included - must continue to respect the official quiet time at night and all day Sunday .
Until now , only church bells , emergency sirens , snow ploughs and tractors have fallen outside the stringent rules on excessive noise in Germany .
We have to consider the rights of children to shout while they are growing up
Axel Strohbusch
Department of Noise Protection
In Berlin alone , hundreds of complaints are made each year about noise levels in kindergartens and children 's playgrounds .
Some day - care facilities have even been forced to close after local residents have gone to court in search of a quiet life .
Now Berlin 's local government , the senate , has passed a law giving children the right to be noisy , the first law of its kind in Germany .
Axel Strohbusch , from Berlin's Department of Noise Protection , said it was " the first time we have it written in law that we have to consider the rights of children to shout and make noise while they are growing up and this must be considered by all the neighbours " .
Germany 's organisation for child protection told AFP news agency it welcomed the move , saying : " We live in a city and children should be allowed to play and make noise . "

Frictional , they behind the fascinating Penumbra series , have put up a teaser trailer for their next game , Amnesia : The Dark Descent .
Well , they call it a teaser .
It ’s almost four minutes of game footage .
It reveals that the game is going to work in a similar way to the Penumbras , first - person , but with a cursor on screen for interacting with the world .
Which is splendid news , since it ’s been my constant lament that no one else in adventure gaming has had the scrap of sense to copy this , or license Frictional ’s self - made engine .
It makes meaningful use of physics in first - person gaming , rather than leaving you feeling like some balloon - handed drunk crashing into everything .
And you can lean .
And get scared .
This is really promising .
And very dark .
You might want to close curtains , smash lightbulbs , and perhaps blow up the sun , so you can see what ’s going on .
But it ’s all part of their stated goal “ to create the most frightening and disturbing experience possible . ”
Well , watch below to see if you think they ’re going to be capable of this .
With the same clever use of breathing and heartbeats that made Penumbra ’s spooky moments so effective , but here only more so , there ’s a good chance they will .
There ’s no indication of whether there will be combat ( Penumbra ’s big failing ) , but so far it suggests the main mechanic will be running away and hiding in a wardrobe .
Oh , and as the video says , consider pre-ordering at this point .
Frictional are indies , and pre-ordering helps fund the project .
And if you do , it ’s a tiny $ 16 .
Cheers to Craig for the tip .
An honest opinion on all things Arsenal
Granted , the discovery of a continent here , a technological invention there and an increase in efficiency somewhere else can accommodate the growth in the real economy that is required to keep pace with the growth in the virtual one , but only to a point – which is of course precisely why the economic explosion begins with the discovery and opening up of just such continents from the early 16th Century on and is reinforced with the advent of the industrial revolution .
Capitalism , banking and growth become inseparable , but in a world bounded by the real , logic dictates that the virtual economy must eventually peel away from the real one and sooner or later the day of reckoning arrives - when the gulf that separates these two economies is too large to be sustained - for no power on earth can match the power of compound interest in the ether .
The latest twist in the important controversy of Family Guy making fun of Trig Palin :
An actress with Down syndrome said Sarah Palin " does not have a sense of humor . "
She was in the offending episode .
Updated with more zing !
Andrea Fay Friedman played the girl with Down syndrome Chris dated in the episode .
( Her IMDB says she 's been on Saving Grace , Law & Order : SVU and 7th Heaven among other shows . )
She was the one who said the fateful line which incurred Sarah Palin 's facebook - based ire : " My dad 's an accountant , and my mom's the former governor of Alaska . "
( Gawker.tv has got the clip . )
And she has something to say to no-fun Sarah Palin , which she said in an email to the New York Times .
However !
It appears that what the Times printed was just the nice portion of a much meaner email Friedman sent out to various media outlets .
The blog Palingates has published the uncensored email :
I guess former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor .
I thought the line " I am the daughter of the former governor of Alaska " was very funny .
I think the word is " sarcasm . "
In my family we think laughing is good .
My parents raised me to have a sense of humor and to live a normal life .
My mother did not carry me around under her arm like a loaf of French bread the way former Governor Palin carries her son Trig around looking for sympathy and votes .
( Emphasis mine . )
How does one say in English ... " Zing ? "
The Times , however , stops at " my parents raised me to have a sense of humor and to live a normal life . "
They must have done the calculations and figured that being able to interview Sarah Palin in the future was worth more than printing Friedman 's awesome email in full .
How mainstream media .
It 's too bad , because the best part about Friedman 's response was also the point — such as there was one — of the Family Guy gag : Palin used Trig so blatantly as a campaign tool , and positions herself so squarely as the voice of the disabled community ( see : " death panels " ) , that of course the one person with Down syndrome to appear in the Family Guy episode would be related to her .
We can think of many , many well - meaning but possibly ' edgy ' jokes to make right now .
But we 're watching the Olympics and do n't feel like reading a bunch of pissed - off comments from people who would , like Sarah Palin , take these jokes the wrong way .
So , let 's just say : Excellent work , Andrea Fay Friedman .
Stop being so wimpy , New York Times .
And : U - S - A! U - S-A !

On a hot afternoon in August , a mother , father , and son climbed into their car and set out for the Qihang Salvation Training Camp in rural China .
The facility was only a half hour from their hotel in Nanning , but the drive felt much longer to Deng Fei and Zhou Juan .
In the backseat , their son , Deng Senshan , said almost nothing the entire way .
He wore a sickish look as he gazed at the whizzing tableau of warehouses , unfinished buildings , and open fields of southern China 's Guangxi province .
He did n't want to go to the camp — who would ? — but his parents felt they had no choice .
The Qihang camp promised to cure children of so - called Internet addiction , an ailment that has grown into one of China 's most feared public health hazards .
The camp 's brochure claimed that an estimated 80 percent of Chinese youth suffered from it .
Fifteen - year - old Deng Senshan seemed to be among them .
He was once a top student , but his grades had plummeted over the past couple of years , and he had stopped exercising almost completely .
He spent most of his time playing games like World of Warcraft at Internet cafés or on his desktop computer .
The Chinese news media was filled with terrifying stories of WOW - crazed kids dropping dead or killing their parents , and Deng Fei and Zhou Juan worried that they might lose their only son to a technological demon they barely understood .
So they were lured in by the camp 's pledge to end his " bad behavior . "
Yet when the place finally came into view , it was n't the traditional school - like setting Deng Fei had imagined .
Instead , it looked more like a poorly tended jailhouse — decrepit three - story concrete building , barred windows , overgrown bushes .
In the distance , through a field of high razor - edged grass , a factory smokestack spewed a black cloud .
On a double basketball court , a gang of camouflage - clad teenagers were in the middle of a sweaty training session in the subtropical heat .
Counselors , dressed in black shirts with military - police patches on their chests , stood watch .
The family got out of the car .
It was about 1 o'clock .
" I do n't want to stay here , " Deng Senshan pleaded .
Deng Fei suppressed a tinge of uncertainty as he looked at his son .
" This will be good for you , " he promised .
" You 'll be out in a month , fit and strong . "
His mother joked that he'd get a bit of a suntan .
But she , too , was trying to stifle anxieties .
At one point , she pulled a counselor aside to ask why the camp was so remote and why children were forced to exercise in such heat .
" At home , kids are much too comfortable , " he responded , and told her that hardship was part of the cure .
" You do n't beat the kids , do you ? " she asked .
The man waved away the question , assuring her , " We use only psychological treatment here . "
They did n't get to say good - bye .
This is what Deng Fei and Zhou Juan would remember afterward , the absence of closure .
Deng Senshan 's parents handed over 7,000 yuan ( about $ 1,000 ) for one month of treatment , then watched as their son was taken to a room just off the basketball court .
Camp officials advised them to go .
It was better for his recovery , they said .
As she left , however , Zhou Juan could n't resist taking one last look at her son .
Through a crack in the door , she saw him slumped in a chair , head bowed .
" He looked so sad , " she recalls .
" If he had looked up then and said , ' Get me out of here , ' I would have taken him home . "
He did n't look up .
The Internet is , famously , a nonstop disruption machine — overturning every business model , cultural institution , and societal norm it touches .
But even by these anarchic standards , its destabilizing impact on Chinese society has been immense .
The number of Internet users in the country has skyrocketed in the past 12 years from 620,000 to 338 million , making it the world 's largest and fastest - growing online population .
And while China has embraced its newfound digital prowess — the national telecom company adds more than 700,000 broadband customers each month — the authoritarian government has also attempted to control it .
It has fortified its " great firewall , " selectively blocking access to Google , YouTube , and Twitter .
It has deployed a special Web police force , tens of thousands strong , to investigate and shut down online political dissent .
It has hired a regiment of " secret Web commentators , " who post comments in praise of the state .
And in July , it began developing the Green Dam Youth Escort , censoring software that can be preinstalled in new PCs .
But as China has become wealthier and its young people more comfortable with the tools of the digital age , the Internet has emerged as an uncontrollable force .
Signs of its impact are ubiquitous : in hangar - sized , 24 - hour Internet clubs , where hundreds of adolescents spend hours wired to headsets in front of massive , glowing monitors ; on qq.com , the labyrinthine social networking and instant messaging platform popular in China that has more than 480 million active IM accounts alone ; and in the proliferation of stealth software that helps users sneak around state firewalls .
Parents have always worried about the pernicious impact of youth culture , whether from comic books , rock and roll , or videogames .
But in China 's rigid , hypercompetitive society , the Internet explosion represents more than a disciplinary annoyance .
It is seen as an existential threat .
And that helps explain why treating kids with supposed Internet addiction has become a national obsession .

The horror stories , which began appearing in the state - run newspapers as far back as 2002 , fueled the panic :
A fire in an unlicensed Internet café killed 25 people engaged in all - night gaming sessions ; a Chengdu gaming addict died after playing Legend of Mir 2 for 20 straight hours in a Net club ; two kids from Chongqing , exhausted after two days of online gaming , passed out on railroad tracks and were killed by a train ; a Qingyuan boy butchered his father after a disagreement about his Internet use ; a 13 - year - old from Tianjin finished a 36 - hour session of World of Warcraft and leaped off the roof of his 24 - story building , hoping to " join the heroes of the game , " as one newspaper summary of his suicide note put it .
The Chinese government reacted quickly and forcefully .
Teens were officially banned from Web cafés , an edict that police enforced through periodic raids .
The government stopped issuing licenses for new cafés and shut down thousands of illegal establishments — 16,000 in 2004 .
Three years ago , it began requiring gaming companies to develop anti-addiction safeguards that would limit play after three hours .
And a year ago , government officials began to talk about formally defining Internet addiction as a clinical disorder .
But the most visible initiative by far was the boot camp .
Beijing 's Military General Hospital created the country 's first center in 2004 .
It was the brainchild of Tao Ran , a military researcher and colonel in the People 's Liberation Army .
A compact man with an animated face who had become well - known for treating drug addicts , Tao opened his camp at the edge of the city in a fortified military compound .
The facility — which employed a fusion of therapy , physical training , and medication — has treated more than 5,000 people to date , most of them teens .
Tao 's camp proved hugely successful and won international acclaim .
( In 2007 , Reuters described it as " the front line of China 's battle . " )
Before long , similar deprogramming centers began popping up throughout Asia — in South Korea , Thailand , and Vietnam .
Even health experts in the US began worrying about Internet addiction .
In 2006 , a Stanford University study found that one in eight American adults showed signs of Web addiction .
In 2008 , Jerald J. Block , an Oregon psychotherapist , argued in The American Journal of Psychiatry that Internet addiction should be included in the next Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , the bible of the mental health industry .
" Despite the cultural differences , " he wrote , " our case descriptions are remarkably similar to those of our Asian colleagues , and we appear to be dealing with the same issue . "
In July , a counselor in Fall City , Washington , named Hilarie Cash opened reStart , the first Internet treatment center in the US .
" China is in an enviable position because they 're taking action , " she says .
" We 're not . "
Deng Senshan 's family lives in a spacious four - bedroom apartment in the center of Ziyuan county , a provincial region with a population of about 70,000 not far from the Vietnam border , surrounded by rivers and lush hills of bamboo .
He started playing online games when he was 11 .
At first , it was just something to do when he was n't swimming in one of the local watering holes or dreaming about becoming the next Yao Ming .
He was a quiet kid with spiky black hair , metal - frame glasses , and a sparkling academic record that made his parents proud .
That all ended at age 13 , when he plunged into World of Warcraft and other multiplayer online games .
Whenever he was n't in school , he played at the desktop computer in his room or at one of the dozen or so Web cafés throughout the city .
Sometimes he skipped meals and did n't sleep .
He would even disappear without explanation .
" I 'd go out at night looking for him , " Deng Fei says .
" It took hours to find him at one of the cafés . "
Deng Senshan gained weight , and his grades slumped — changes that would worry any parent but especially one in China , where academic slippage could mean missing out on a spot at an elite high school .
His parents tried to get him to refocus , moving his computer into their room , reducing his allowance , and buying him a treadmill .
Nothing worked .
" There were arguments , " Zhou Juan says .
Deng Senshan 's parents wondered whether their son was addicted .
Maybe it was just a stage , the way some kids become obsessed with girls or get caught up in a TV show .
Maybe he was just stressed about school and using the Internet to blow off steam .
Still , they did n't want to take a chance .

Then one night Deng Fei saw an advertisement on TV for the Qihang boot camp .
It showed a family smiling together .
The facility looked legitimate , even hope - inspiring .
And it seemed safe ; the ad aired on the local government television station , lending it an official imprimatur .
The next day , Deng Fei mentioned the camp to his son , who did n't like the idea at all .
But Deng Fei would n't let it rest .
As school ended and summer began , he called the camp and secretly reserved a spot for his son .
" They said , ' Come , we can take care of him , ' " Deng Fei says .
A couple of weeks later , Deng Fei packed the car and took his family to the beach for one last weekend getaway .
Sitting on the warm sand , he watched his son swim in the South China Sea .
When Deng Senshan swam out to a woman flailing in the high waves and dragged her back to safety , the boy 's father filled with pride : his son the hero .
Zhou Juan took a photo of Deng Senshan in his black bathing suit .
It showed his hair still wet from the sea , a blue towel draped around his body , a stoic expression on his round face — unaware that he was about to be dispatched to the nearby camp .
But that night , at the hotel , they broke the news .
" It will help you , " Deng Fei assured him .
One of the first signs that things had gotten out of hand in China 's Internet - addiction camps was the emergence of Uncle Yang — Yang Yongxin — a psychiatrist who opened a treatment center at a state - owned hospital in eastern Shandong Province in 2006 .
His camp was one of hundreds that had sprung up in China — many of them unregulated , uncredentialed , and relying on a grab bag of treatments : antidepressants , counseling , even intense physical exertion .
( One sent its young clients on a 528 - mile trek through Inner Mongolia . )
What began as a fairly well - regarded and disciplined approach had spun into a growth industry , packed with untrained entrepreneurs .
Yang 's battery of therapies included electroshock — known as xing nao , or " brain waking . "
Electrodes were attached to his patients ' hands and temples , then shot through with 1 to 5 milliamps of electricity .
One girl recalled wearing a mouth guard to prevent her from biting off her tongue .
Some sessions apparently went on for a half hour ; occasionally , a shock was said to leave burns .
In an interview with a local paper , Yang defended the practice , saying , " It does n't cause any damage to the brain .
But it is painful , quite painful ! "
Yang was not a psychotherapist , nor was he licensed to administer electroshock .
But that did n't matter .
He claimed to know what he was doing .
" It will clear the mind , " he promised .
He charged almost $ 900 per month — a remarkable sum for a country in which the average monthly wage is around $ 400 .
Still , some 3,000 desperate parents sent their kids to him for four - month stints .
The media hailed Yang as a " national Web- addiction expert , " recounting his heroic tales of life at his rehab center .
Even after
Yang 's methods were deemed excessive — in July , Chinese authorities banned electroshock as an Internet - addiction treatment , claiming the tactic required further study — his services were reportedly still in demand .
Meanwhile , the rhetoric around Internet addiction grew even more hysterical : The Net was not just a public - health hazard but a national - security risk .
In 2006 , the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League openly fretted about a " severe social problem that could threaten the nation 's future " and called Internet cafés " hotbeds of juvenile crime and depravity . "
Official figures claimed that the Internet was responsible for up to 80 percent of high school and college dropouts and most juvenile crimes .
A show on state - run television described the fight against Internet addiction as the Third Opium War .
It seemed as though almost anything could be blamed on the Internet .
In September , the deputy director of China 's volleyball administration said the weak performance of the women 's national volleyball team was the result of " too much time online . "
Even Tao Ran , the father of the boot camp , began worrying that people were overreacting .
" I get calls from parents who think their kids are addicted to the Internet just because they 're in front of the computer , " he says .
" There is a hypersensitivity to addiction now , and the climate is getting worse . "
He is n't alone in his concern .
" I told the government , ' You have to stop this , ' " says Tao Hongkai , an education researcher at Huazhong Normal University .
He believes in treating addicts , but through talk therapy , which can sometimes last hours .
" Parents are spending a lot of money to send their kids to these camps , " he says .
" I told the government , ' It 's going to get out of control . '
But they did n't do anything . "
The Qihang Salvation Training Camp opened in May 2009 , just in time for the summer holiday .
Children who attended the camp portray it as a horrific experience .
Although Qihang pitched itself as therapy , its treatment regimen revolved around intense martial drills , which began at sunrise with a harsh whistle and sometimes did n't end until after midnight .
Campers who could n't complete the required laps or push - ups were beaten .
Screams could be heard constantly .
A 12 - year - old boy , whose parents enrolled him for playing his Game Boy too much , says that he spent most of his time concentrating on mere survival : " If anyone says they were n't scared , they 're lying . "
Deng Senshan 's fellow campers helped to re-create his first , and only , day at Qihang .
Like all newcomers , the boy began his stay with a visit to a " confinement room " on the facility 's top floor and was told to face the wall .
When he refused , counselors struck him .
" I heard him screaming , " says a 13 - year - old girl whose mother sent her after she started skipping school to chat online .
" But I did n't really pay attention , because it was normal to hear screams . "
When the other campers were sent to bed , around 9 pm , Deng Senshan and three other new arrivals were instructed to run laps around the basketball courts under klieg lights .
By now , Deng Senshan did n't resist much ; he ran about 30 laps before he stumbled and fell .
A counselor dragged him to a nearby flagpole and hit him with a wooden chair leg , which broke .
Deng Senshan begged for him to stop , pushed himself up , and continued running .
He made it halfway around the court before collapsing again .
" Do you want to run ? " the counselor yelled , strutting over with a plastic stool , which he swung down on the boy .
Deng Senshan crumpled to the concrete and stopped moving .
There were at least a half - dozen witnesses .
A security guard , who watched with shock from the tiny room where he lived at the edge of the school grounds , knew the child was in trouble : " I told my wife , ' This boy will be lucky if he lives through the night . ' "
After the beating , Deng Senshan was carried trembling to his bunk , shouting , " They 're killing me , " and bleeding from his mouth , ears , eyes , and nose .
The counselors left him there for hours before dispatching a car to take him to the hospital .
At around 3 am , 14 hours after arriving at the camp , he was pronounced dead .
It 's a September morning — the day that Deng Senshan would have started high school .
His parents walk through crowded streets to their bright third - floor apartment .
A month has passed since their son died .
As they tell their story , Zhou Juan cries into her hands and Deng Fei fiddles with his keys .
Recently , Deng Fei came to a conclusion :
His son was never addicted .
" He did n't smoke , he did n't drink .
The Internet was probably his way to vent the pressure on him , " he says , staring at his feet .
" We did n't know that then .
But we know that now .
It was n't really an addiction .
It was his way out of the pressure of being a student . "
Zhou Juan raises her head .
" He did n't even play that much , " she says .
More than a dozen people were jailed for Deng Senshan 's death , and it would later be reported that the camp founder — who had branded himself as an educational and psychological expert — had never even been to high school , let alone college .
Deng Fei would also learn that the camp 's TV ad was a fraud — those smiling family members were actually paid actors .
Deng Senshan 's death was the first of a small wave of terrifying reports .
A few days after his murder , counselors at a camp in Hubei province beat to death a 14 - year - old boy .
Six days later , a teenager ended up in intensive care after sustaining injuries at another camp .
The reports sparked cries for a government crackdown .
" No one regulates the industry , " says Tao Ran , who has become one of the foremost proponents for increased oversight .
In late 2008 , Tao , hoping to eliminate uncertainty and confusion , began publicizing what he believed were the defining characteristics of a true Internet addict : playing online for at least six hours a day for three months straight and experiencing a profound sense of emotional , even physical , loss when unplugged from the Net .
He also began lobbying the Chinese government to officially recognize the condition as a mental illness .
But he is up against a juggernaut .
There are thought to be between 300 and 400 camps in China .
Meanwhile , the local government began facing criticism for its part in the disaster .
The camp 's advertisements had aired on government - run television stations , and the facility , it turns out , was located on state - subsidized school property .
Government officials responded by trying to quash the reports of what had happened to Deng Senshan .
A journalist was fired after publishing a series of articles about the case for the local paper .
According to a news account , he had " angered top officials " in exposing " the weakness in governance . "
Later , another journalist who covered the story was reportedly sacked .
But the usual strong - arm tactics could n't contain the public - relations disaster .
The government eventually compensated Deng Fei and Zhou Juan for their son's death — a seeming acknowledgement of the local government 's indirect role in the murder — even as officials rebuffed Deng Fei 's demand for an apology .
And in November , China 's Ministry of Health drafted guidelines for boot camps , banning the use of physical punishment , " destructive surgeries , " and forced lockups .
Tao Ran describes the policy as a hopeful " first step " ; education researcher Tao Hongkai dismisses it as damage control .
" I 'm not sure how much it will do , " he says .
It certainly wo n't do anything for Deng Senshan .
His old bedroom is almost empty now .
Some white curtains decorated with the colorful words " always together " adorn the sole window .
His treadmill rests folded up in a corner .
A small table holding burning incense and a few pictures serves as a humble shrine .
Most everything else that belonged to him has been burned — a regional tradition for sending off the dead .
But in their own room , Deng Fei and Zhou Juan keep one more of their son's possessions : his computer .
It sits on a desk , turned off , the screen black .
Before they 'd taken him to the camp , Deng Senshan had saved a bunch of family photos on his hard drive .
Wiping a tear from her eye , Zhou Juan talks about the computer not as a symbol of addiction or fear but as a storehouse of memories that will always be available , no matter what .
Deng Senshan told her so , she says .
" He said that the computer was safe . "
Christopher S. Stewart ( christophersstewart@gmail.com ) is currently writing a book about the search for a lost city in the jungles of Honduras .
Actually according to the Ontario Science Centre whether or not fish fart , is an ongoing debate .
Some experts say that the digestive gasses of fish are consolidated with their food waste and expelled in gelatinous tubes which fish then eat .
But , fish have been known to emit bubbles due to an excess intake of air .
For instance the sand tiger shark purposefully gulps air into its stomach at the surface then farts it out at the other end so it sinks to its desired depth .

One evening last August , as Edward Kerry Sullivan stood outside his apartment building on Staten Island , a car pulled up and a man got out .
By Mr. Sullivan ’s recollection , the conversation went like this :
“ Are you Edward Sullivan ? ” the man asked .
“ That ’s me , ” Mr. Sullivan said .
“ Do you have anything on you that I should be worried about ? ” the man asked .
“ Who are you ? ” Mr. Sullivan replied .
“ Police , ” the man said .
“ You ’re under arrest . ”
A second police officer , in plain clothes like the first , stood by .
They handcuffed him and then folded him into their unmarked car .
The officers told him , Mr. Sullivan said , that they had been watching him for several days .
The crime ?
He had written “ The Jerk , ” about three inches high , on a campaign poster for James P. Molinaro , the Staten Island borough president .
The undercover officers had taken a picture of the poster .
There was no question that Mr. Sullivan had written it ; moreover , there was no doubt that for weeks before that , he had launched far more pungent strikes against Mr. Molinaro in letters to a newspaper and public officials , criticizing the borough president ’s plans to develop part of the Staten Island waterfront .
Chris Dodd to step aside
Embattled Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd ( D ) has scheduled a press conference at his home in Connecticut Wednesday at which he is expected to announce he will not seek re-election , according to sources familiar with his plans .
Dodd 's retirement comes after months of speculation about his political future , and amid faltering polling numbers and a growing sense among the Democratic establishment that he could not win a sixth term .
It also comes less than 24 hours after Sen. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) announced he would not seek re-election .
State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal is widely expected to step into the void filled by Dodd and , at least at first blush , should drastically increase Democrats ' chances of holding the seat .
Blumenthal , who has served as state Attorney General since 1990 , is the most popular politician in the state and has long coveted a Senate seat ; he had already signaled that he would run for the Democratic nomination against Sen.
Joe Lieberman ( I ) in 2012 .
( A sidenote : Assuming Blumenthal gets in to the race , Rep. Chris Murphy could be the long - term beneficiary as he is widely regarded as a rising star and would be at the top of the list of Democratic hopefuls to challenge Lieberman in 2012 . )
Without Dodd as a foil , Republicans chances of taking over a seat in this solidly blue state are considerably diminished .
Former Rep. Rob Simmons and wealthy businesswoman Linda McMahon are battling it out for the Republican nod but either would start as an underdog in a general election matchup with Blumenthal .
Dodd joins North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan on the sidelines for Democrats .
Six Republicans Senators are not seeking re-election in November .
Dodd 's retirement comes roughly two years after his presidential ambitions came to an end in the Iowa caucuses .
Dodd , always a longshot in a field filled with better known and better financed candidates , had moved his family to the Hawkeye State in the fall of 2007 in hopes of generating some excitement for his bid .
The move backfired on the Democratic incumbent as many Connecticut voters bristled .
Dodd 's political problems were further compounded later in 2008 when it was reported that he had been included in a special VIP mortgage loan program by Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozilo .
Dodd insisted he was unaware of his inclusion and he was cleared of any wrongdoing by the Senate Ethics Committee but the political damage was done .
Once among the safest of incumbents , Dodd 's numbers plummeted in the spring of 2009 before rebounding somewhat over the summer .
But , a Quinnipiac University poll conducted late last year showed significant slippage for Dodd and led to widespread speculation that he had to vacate the seat for his party to have a chance at retaining it in the upcoming midterm elections .
Dodd 's troubles were politically ironic , coming at a time when his power on Capitol Hill had reached a breath - taking level that most legislators dream of but never come close to achieving .
In the last 18 months Dodd has been the primary author or co-author of legislation re-writing housing mortgage rules ; the $ 700 billion bailout of Wall Street ; key portions of the $ 787 billion stimulus package ; a consumer protection bill overseeing the credit card industry ; and the nearly $ 900 billion health - care legislation that has passed the Senate is in final negotiations with the House now .
Much of this work was done through his chairmanship of the Senate banking committee , but he also held powerful posts on the health and foreign relations committees .
With each major piece of legislation Dodd ushered into law in recent years , came criticism that he did not anticipate .
The mortgage bill came in mid-2008 , which some said was delayed because of Dodd 's presidential aspirations , and the financial bailout became one of the most unpopular pieces of legislation passed in recent memory .
His work on the stimulus bill , approved last February , was an attempt to rein in executive compensation at firms that had been bailed out , but instead led to sharp criticism when executives at AIG , the largest recipient of taxpayer dollars , still received seven - figure bonuses shortly thereafter .

I started reading OKCupid 's blog about a month ago , when their post hit the front page of Reddit .
I do n't use the site , but their combination of romance and statistics was intriguing .
A new post just came out , and I was procrastinating hard enough to think a little about it .
In their post , they argued that men between 22 and 30 should be looking at women 30 and older .
They first provided data about what their users say they want , then provided reasons why women of that age are better matches .
There is , however , a flaw in their argument .
Their basic error is this : women 30 and olderdate men between 22 and 30 .
I took a closer look at their graphs , and extracted out the numbers .
This is the graph I got :
If this looks slightly different from the graphs on OKCupid 's post , that 's because it is .
Here , I flipped the female match preferences graph along the y=x axis .
Therefore , if you 're female , you start on the y - axis , and read across to get the average match preference .
Now , on to why OKCupid is wrong .
If you look at their " zone of greatness " , they marked out this area : You see the problem : the average person in this area .
The blog post was written for men , so their bound might be ignored .
The bound for women , however , should n't be .
And this graph shows that , even if men were willing to date women in that age range , chances are the women wo n't reciprocate .
In other words , even with the other reasons that women above 30 are great fun , it turns out that they are simply not interested in men between 22 and 30 .
What , then , should men ( and women ) be looking for ?
Look at the graph below :
Overlooking my horrible circling skills , these are the areas where there is a mismatch between men's preferences and women 's preferences .
Whereever women 's preferences are taller than the men's ( or men 's preferences wider than the women's ) , there is an opportunity .
Because men accept women of such a wide age ranger , any women who is willing to date someone slightly outside the average range ( shown in pink ) has an advantage .
Comparatively , there are much fewer places where women are interested and men are not ( shown in green ) .
Based on this graph , you can see what age you will have the least competition , but still are still relatively desirable .
One last thing : xkcd should be updated to reflect this data .

STEELE’S CHAMPAGNE WISHES AND CAVIAR DREAMS … .
It ’s been a couple of weeks since RNC Chairman Michael Steele has been the subject of scorn .
I hope he enjoyed the respite ; it appears to be over .
Republican National Chairman Michael
Steele is spending twice as much as his recent predecessors on private planes and paying more for limousines , catering and flowers — expenses that are infuriating the party ’s major donors who say Republicans need every penny they can get for the fight to win back Congress .
Most recently , donors grumbled when Steele hired renowned chef Wolfgang Puck ’s local crew to cater the RNC ’s Christmas party inside the trendy Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue , and then moved its annual winter meeting from Washington to Hawaii .
For some major GOP donors , both decisions were symbolic of the kind of wasteful spending habits they claim has become endemic to his tenure at the RNC .
When Ken Mehlman served as the committee chairman during the critical 2006 midterm elections , the holiday party was held in a headquarters conference room and Chic - fil - A was the caterer .
A POLITICO analysis of expenses found that compared with 2005 , the last comparable year preceding a midterm election , the committee ’s payments for charter flights doubled ; the number of sedan contractors tripled , and meal expenses jumped from $ 306,000 to $ 599,000 .
A longtime Republican fundraiser said , “ Michael Steele is an imperial chairman .
He flies in private aircraft .
He drives in private cars .
He has private consultants that are paid ridiculous retainers .
He fancies himself a presidential candidate and wants all of the trappings and gets them by using other people ’s money . ”
Steele ’s budgetary decisions have been the subject of widespread consternation for months , especially given the fact that the RNC is n’t raising the kind of money it should be with competitive midterms coming up .
By one account , Steele ’s spending spree in 2009 left the RNC with its worst election - year cash flow this decade .
It was easier for Steele to justify this spending when he pointed to successful gubernatorial campaigns in New Jersey and Virginia .
It ’s a little more difficult to justify when expense reports point to lavish spending on private planes , limousines , catering , and flowers .
And it certainly does n’t help that Steele is simultaneously using his position to line his own pockets , most notably through his outside paid speeches and a book written in secret .
It ’s far too early to say with any confidence what will happen in the 2010 elections , but if Republicans fall short of their own sky - high expectations , expect Michael Steele to get all kinds of blame .

Oct. 2009 - Ford completed a series of recalls affecting 14 million vehicles due to faulty cruise control deactivation switch .
The latest recall involved some 4.5 million vehicles .
--
The action effectively closed out a 10 - year saga over the switches made by Texas Instruments TXN.N that led to more than a half - dozen recalls , the automaker said .
-- Texas Instruments said in a statement that a former business unit had designed and manufactured the switch to “ meet and exceed ” Ford specifications , and is not the “ root cause ” of fires .
A 2006 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation , Texas Instruments said , concluded that multiple factors contributed to fires .
Jan .
2010 - Toyota issues a series of recalls covering 5.6 million vehicles in the United States due to sudden acceleration in some vehicles .
It is the largest ever recall for Toyota and among the biggest for an automaker in U.S. history .
-- Honda 7267 .
T recalled 646,000 of its Fit / Jazz and City automobiles globally over a faulty window switch after a child died when fire broke out in a car last year .
Honda made the announcement as Toyota extended its own recall to China and Europe .
-- Toyota ’s problems touched other carmakers too : France ’s PSA Peugeot Citroen said it would recall nearly 100,000 Peugeot 107s and Citroen C1s made a factory in the Czech Republic where Toyota and PSA jointly make cars .

Feb .
2010 - Toyota recalls a total of 437,000 units of its 2010 Prius , Sai , Prius PHV ( plug - in hybrid ) and Lexus HS250h hybrids globally , including 155,000 in North America , 223,000 in Japan and 53,000 in Europe . [ SGE61800X ]
The world ’s largest automaker is under fire for two other recalls covering more than 8 million vehicles worldwide due to problems with slipping floormats and sticky accelerator pedals .
-- Honda said it would recall another 438,000 cars globally to replace an airbag deflator that could rupture .
The expanded recall is concentrated in the U.S. , where nearly 379,000 cars are subject to the recall .
All cars to be recalled globally are made at Honda ’s U.S. and Canadian plants .
The models involved are the 2001 and 2002 model - year Accord , Civic , Odyssey , CR - V , Pilot and 2002 Acura TL and CL vehicles in the United States .

Guest Commentary by John Fasullo , Kevin Trenberth and Chris O’Dell
A recent paper by Lindzen and Choi in GRL ( 2009 ) ( LC09 ) purported to demonstrate that climate had a strong negative feedback and that climate models are quite wrong in their relationships between changes in surface temperature and corresponding changes in outgoing radiation escaping to space .
This publication has been subject to a considerable amount of hype , for instance apparently “ [ LC09 ] has absolutely , convincingly , and irrefutably proven the theory of Anthropogenic Global Warming to be completely false . ” and “ we now know that the effect of CO2 on temperature is small , we know why it is small , and we know that it is having very little effect on the climate ” .
Not surprisingly , LC09 has also been highly publicized in various contrarian circles .
Our initial reading of their article had us independently asking , how we could have missed such explicit evidence of the cloud feedback as shown in LC09 ?
Why would such a significant finding have gone undiscovered when these feedbacks are widely studied and recognised as central to the projections of climate change ?
We discovered these common concerns at a meeting last year and then teamed up to address these questions .
With the hype surrounding the manuscript , one would think that the article provides a sound , rock solid basis for a reduced climate sensitivity .
However , our examination of the study ’s methods demonstrates that this is not the case .
In an article in press ( Trenberth et al. 2010 ( sub. requ. ) , hereafter TFOW ) , we show that LC09 is gravely flawed and its results are wrong on multiple fronts .
These are the major issues we found :
The LC09 results are not robust .
A goal of LC09 was to quantify the cloud feedback by examining variability in top - of - atmosphere ( TOA ) radiative fluxes in the tropics as it relates to variability in mean sea surface temperature ( SST ) .
To do this they examine only tropical data .
In general , they find that during periods of higher - than - normal SST , the radiation emitted and reflected to space by the earth goes up as well , cooling the Earth and amounting to an overall negative climate feedback .
To show this , they select intervals of warming and cooling ( in a time series of monthly averaged values ) and compare fluxes at their endpoints ( see Figure ) .
They did n’t provide an objective criterion for selecting these endpoints and in some instances ( see their Fig. 1 ) , the selection of these intervals actually appears to be quite odd .
Fig.
1 : Warming ( red ) and cooling ( blue ) intervals of tropical SST ( 20 °N – 20 °S ) used by LC09 ( solid circles ) and an alternative selection proposed derived from an objective approach ( open circles ) ( TFOW , 2010 ) .
The result one obtains in estimating the feedback by this method turns out to be heavily dependent on the endpoints chosen .
[ edit ]
In TFOW we show that the apparent relationship is reduced to zero if one chooses to displace the endpoints selected in LC09 by a month or less .
So with this method the perceived feedback can be whatever one wishes it to be , and the result obtained by LC09 is actually very unlikely .
This is not then really indicative of a robust cloud feedback .

LC09 misinterpret air - sea interactions in the tropics
The main changes in tropical SST and radiative fluxes at TOA are associated with El Niño - Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) and are not necessarily indicative of forced variability in a closed system .
ENSO events cause strong and robust exchanges of energy between the ocean and atmosphere , and tropics and subtropics .
Yet LC09 treat the tropical atmosphere as a closed and deterministic system in which variations in clouds are driven solely by SST .
In fact , the system is known to be considerably more complex and changes in the flow of energy arise from ocean heat exchange through evaporation , latent heat release in precipitation , and redistribution of that heat through atmospheric winds .
These changes can be an order of magnitude larger than variability in TOA fluxes , and their effects are teleconnected globally .
It is therefore not possible to quantify the cloud feedback with a purely local analysis .

It is therefore not possible to quantify the cloud feedback with a purely local analysis .
More robust methods show no discrepancies between models and observations .
In TFOW , we compute correlations and regressions between tropical SSTs and top - of - atmosphere ( TOA ) longwave , shortwave and net radiation using a variety of methods .
LC09 found the observed behavior to be opposite from that of 11 atmospheric models forced by the same SSTs and conclude that the models display much higher climate sensitivity than is inferred from ERBE .
However , in our analysis comparing these relationships with models , we are unable to find any systematic model bias .
More importantly , the nature of these relationships in models bears no relationship to simulated sensitivity .
That is , the metric developed by LC09 is entirely ineffective as a proxy for simulated sensitivity .

LC09 have compared observations to models prescribed with incomplete forcings .
The AMIP configuration in the model simulations used by LC09 have incomplete forcings .
The AMIP protocol started off a test only of how an atmospheric model reacts to changes in ocean temperatures , and so models often only use the ocean temperature change when doing these kinds of experiments .
However , over the period of this comparison , many elements – greenhouse gases , aerosols , the sun and specifically , volcanoes changed the radiative fluxes , and this needs to be taken into account .
Some models did this in these experiments , but not all of them .
For instance , the dominant source of variability in the reflected solar flux arises from aerosols associated with the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June of 1991 yet all but 2 model simulations examined by LC09 omit such forcings entirely .
Other radiative species are absent from the models altogether .
It is thus obviously inappropriate to expect such model simulations to replicate observed variability in TOA fluxes .

LC09 incorrectly compute the climate sensitivity .
By not allowing for the black body radiation ( the Planck function ) in their feedback parameter , LC09 underestimate climate sensitivity .
Using the correct equations , LC09 should obtain a feedback parameter and climate sensitivity of - 0.125 and 0.82 K , respectively , rather than their values of - 1.1 and 0.5 K .
In contrast , TFOW results yield a positive feedback parameter and greater sensitivity estimate , though we also caution that this approach is not a valid technique for estimating sensitivity , as a closed and therefore global domain is essential ( though not by itself sufficient ) .
Lastly , LC09 fail to account for variability in forcings in estimating sensitivity .
While climate models are known to struggle with many aspects of tropical climate , especially in regards to its coupled variability , the problems claimed by LC09 are not among them .
Forster and Gregory [ 2006 ] and Murphy et al. [ 2009 ] address changes in the energy budget with surface temperatures for a much larger domain and present a much more complete and defensible analysis and discussion of issues .
They demonstrate that recent observed variability indeed supports a positive shortwave cloud feedback .
So the feedbacks from processes other than the Planck function response are clearly positive in both observations and models , in contrast to LC09 ’s conclusions .
Moreover , it is not appropriate to use only tropical SSTs and TOA radiation for feedback analysis as the transports into the extratropics are substantial .
Any feedback analysis must also recognize changes in ocean heat storage and atmospheric energy transport into and out of the tropics which are especially large during ENSO events .
While the tropics play an important role in determining climate sensitivity , simplistic and arbitrary analyses of tropical variability can be grossly misleading .

The Party 's 5 - point star still shines on these baked and griddled guo kui
And you thought we were done with Sichuan .
Heck , we 're not even finished with guo kui .
Meat - riddled , crisp - griddled dough is all well and good , but a chewy pillow of freshly made flatbread has its own special appeal .
And in Sichuan it assumes a number of delicious forms .
On a toe - numblingly chill morning in Langzhong we found this vendor selling thick guo kui about 5.5 inches / 14 cm in diamter .
Working from a compact ( and undeniably cute ) wheeled wooden prep stall cum display case ,
she rolls out , griddles , and warms in her tandoor - like oven made from a metal drum flatbreads in three flavors : baide ( " white " , or plain ) , xiande ( savory , seasoned with salt and the barest hint of ground Sichuan peppercorn , and tiande ( " sweet " ) .
Though we 'll never turn up our nose at any food seasoned with Sichuan peppercorn as an ingredient , it was her sweet guo kui , from which smoky " red " ( brown , really ) cane sugar oozes like the filling from a molten flourless chocolate cake , that we could n't resist .
Big enough to serve as hand warmers as well as breakfast , her flatbreads boast an unbeatable glutenous chew tempered by a wee bit of surface crispness , and lots of wholesome wheat flavor .
They 'd rival any artisan loaf I 've eaten elsewhere in the world .
She guilds the lily with a well - worn wooden stamp , with which she presses a sweetly retro 5 - point star into the surface of each flatbread .
I sorely coveted that stamp ... and I 've thought about these guo kui at least once a day since we left Langzhong .
Back in Chengdu , a common sight on the street are these oval guo kui made in a tandoor - style oven with a narrow opening and no griddle .
Our partner in local gluttony J introduced us to these thinner .
slightly crispier , almost pancakey flatbreads on our first night in town .
The man who sold us one each of his xiande ( ever - so - lightly flavored with dried chili ) and tiande ( with granulated cane sugar rolled right into the dough ) guo kui was from Anhui province .
Anhui - style sweet guo kui baking in an oil drum oven
Over subsequent days we began to notice vendors ( women , mostly ) selling this type of guo kui all over the city , and every one told us they were natives of Anhui , from its capital Hefei or nearby .
How is it , we wondered , that a tribe of Hefei folks found themselves in Chengdu selling guo kui ?
Why Chengdu ?
And are there communities of Anhui guo kui sellers in other Chinese cities as well ?
( Please weigh in on this if you 're able . )
Like other flatbread sellers these gals ( and the single guy we met ) roll their dough out on the spot .
I have to be honest -- we were n't quite as enamored of these Anhui - style flatbreads as we were of our Langzhong dough pies .
Because they 're so thin they go a bit stiff the minute they start to lose heat ... and in terms of flavor a sprinkle of granulated white sugar just can't compete with a lake of melted brown sugar .
But if you can get them hot out of the tandoor the savory version is just fine , a pleasant diversion to carry you until your next culinary discovery .
Which , if you 're lucky , just might be a Sichuanese French dip .
Makings of a Sichuanese French dip : freshly baked guo kui and thinly sliced roast pork
I 'm first and foremost a dumpling and chili person , and all I wanted from my last morning of grazing in Sichuan was a steady parade of jiaozi in spicy red oil .
I got it , in spades ( and you 'll see more of that later ) but I also got something I was n't looking for : perhaps the best sandwich -- no , make that the best three sandwiches -- I 've ever eaten .
North of Tianfu Square , back behind the big Mao statue and kitty corner to the Sheraton Hotel , sits a nondescript restaurant that 's called something like " The Original Chengdu Dandan Mian " .
Next to the shop 's entrance is a window behind which truly amazing things are being done with wheat dough .
Behind that window , said wheat dough is being rolled into flat rounds , slapped onto the sides of a clay oven , left to puff and blister , and then transferred to a seasoned griddle where it continues to cooks through .
Then those soft , puffy dough discs are transferred to nearby wooden cutting board where , still hot from the oven , they 're split
and stuffed with your choice of savory fillings -- like translucent slices of crunchy pig ear , dressed in a piquant sauce of chili and sesame oils , black vinegar , sugar , and seasoned soy sauce ,
Guo kui filled with sweet and spicy sliced and dressed pig ear
or pieces of pork stir - fried with sweet and hot fresh green peppers , a melange of mild and spicy , tender and crispy , rich and fatty while at the same time fresh and green .
A stir - fry of pork and green pepper ( hot and mild ) fills this guo kui
The best of the bunch , however , is the local version of the French dip .
To make one of these the shop 's guo kui mistress piles slices of paper - thin roast pork in a small bowl and douses them with a thin but richly meaty jus fragrant with anise and cinnamon .
She then stuffs the anointed pork slices into a flatbread , following with lashings of jus before quickly sliding the whole gorgeous , dripping mess into a plastic bag .
The bread is hot and fresh and crispy - skinned , so it defies disintegration , maintaining integrity to the last bite .
Yet its its insides soak up the gravy like a sponge .
Every mouthful starts with a rush of jus -- then , chewy breadh and tender pork .
There 's no vegetable garnish , no condiments mucking things up .
Just meat and dough , and spiced meat juices .
It 's a sandwich to turn a dumpling fanatic 's thoughts away from doughy things that are steamed and boiled instead of baked and griddle - crisped .
For a while , anyway .
Chengdu Dandan Mian , No. 34 Renmin Zhong Road ( kitty - corner to the Sheraton Lido Hotel ) .
Buy your ticket inside the shop .
A meat - filled guokui will set you back 5 yuan ( about 85 cents ) .
No US combat deaths in Iraq in December
The 110,000 US troops in Iraq will now focus on assisting local security forces December was the first month in which no US troops were killed in combat in Iraq since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
The commander of US forces in Iraq , Gen Ray Odierno , said it was a significant milestone that demonstrated how violence in the country had diminished .
2009 was also the least violent for US troops in Iraq , with 149 losing their lives , compared with 314 in 2008 .
In total , 4,371 US military personnel have died since the invasion , according to the Iraq coalition casualty count .
On Friday , Gen Odierno attended a ceremony at Camp Victory on the outskirts of Baghdad marking the change of his command 's name from Multinational Force - Iraq ( MNF - I ) to US Forces - Iraq ( USF - I ) .
Today , when I fly over Baghdad , I see hope , with bright lights and busy traffic
Gen Ray Odierno
US Forces - Iraq ( USF -I )
The all - US contingent of 110,000 troops will now focus on " advising and assisting " Iraqi security forces before combat forces are pulled out by 31 August and ahead of a complete withdrawal by 2011 .
" In 2006 , when I flew over Baghdad , I remember looking down on a city cloaked by darkness and gripped in fear , " Gen Odierno said .
" Today , when I fly over Baghdad , I see hope , with bright lights and busy traffic . "
Insurgent attacks have dropped from more than 200 a day two years ago to approximately 15 a day , according to Gen David Petraeus , the head of US Central Command , who also attended Friday 's ceremony .
Between 94,939 and 103,588 civilians have been killed in attacks in Iraq since 2003 , according to the monitoring group Iraq Body Count .

Mr Mack said the government would take action if bankers did not The chairman of US bank Morgan Stanley , John Mack , has said that bankers are still paying themselves too much .
" I still do n't think the industry gets it , " Mr Mack said .
Banks are reforming pay by focusing too much on structure - such as deferring bonuses to later - rather than the huge amounts being paid out , he said .
Earlier this week , the New York state Comptroller said that Wall Street banks may have paid more than $ 55 bn in bonuses last year .
" If we do n't do something , the government will do something " on pay , Mr Mack said .
The issue of bonuses has become a huge political issue on both sides of the Atlantic as many of the banks that are paying bonuses to staff made losses during 2009 and were bailed out by taxpayers .
On Thursday , Royal Bank of Scotland - which is 84 % - owned by the UK government - said that it made a loss of £ 3.6 bn ( $ 5.5 bn ) in 2009 , but will pay £ 1.3 bn in bonuses to staff .
Mr Mack - speaking at Queens University in North Carolina - cited the example of a trader that recently left Morgan Stanley .
The 28 - year - old trader 's unit had earned as much as $ 400 m for the bank .
Morgan Stanley had offered to pay him $ 11 m , but the trader left to join a hedge fund that paid him $ 25 m , Mr Mack said , according to Bloomberg News .
Morgan Stanley reported record losses in 2008 and survived the financial crisis because of government aid .
Mr Mack recently stepped down as chief executive but remained chairman .
He has not taken a bonus for the past three years .

Do economist , University of Missouri - Kansas City professor and white collar crime investigator William Black , former NY Governor and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and University of San Diego professor of law Frank Portnoy have their eyes on the prize : federal indictments of former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein ?
Or , saying it more accurately , finding the smoking gun that 's the difference between indicting or not indicting former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and his successor at Goldman Sachs , current CEO Lloyd Blankfein .

That 'd be the " potential " bailout fraud , corruption and malfeasance story about AIG ( diarist 's note : and Goldman Sachs ) that just wo n't go away .
More specifically , you may read all about it in a piece posted at Naked Capitalism , today ; but , let 's start with an Op Ed piece Spitzer , Black and Partnoy published this past Sunday in the NY Times : " Show Us the E - Mail . "
From the NY Times ( December 20 , 2009 Op - Ed page ) :
Show Us the E - Mail
By ELIOT SPITZER , FRANK PARTNOY and WILLIAM BLACK
Published In Print : December 20 , 2009 ... A.I.G. was at the center of the web of bad business judgments , opaque financial derivatives , failed economics and questionable political relationships that set off the economic cataclysm of the past two years .
When A.I.G.'s financial products division collapsed -- ultimately requiring a federal bailout of $ 180 billion -- those who had been prospering from A.I.G.'s schemes scurried for taxpayer cover .
Yet , more than a year after the rescue began , crucial questions remain unanswered .
Who knew what , and when ?
Who benefited , and by exactly how much ?
Would A.I.G.'s counterparties have failed without taxpayer support ?
-- SNIP-- ... we know where the answers are .
They are in the trove of e-mail messages still backed up on A.I.G. servers , as well as in the key internal accounting documents and financial models generated by A.I.G. during the past decade ...
-- SNIP-- ... Once the documents are available for everyone to inspect , a thousand journalistic flowers can bloom , as reporters , victims and angry citizens have a chance to piece together the story .
-- SNIP-- Perhaps A.I.G.'s employees would also be judged not guilty .
But we would like to see the record to find out .
As fraud investigators , we would like to examine the trading patterns of A.I.G.'s financial products division , and its communications with Goldman Sachs and other bank counterparties who benefited from the bailout .
-- SNIP-- Congress wants answers , too .
This month , during hearings on Ben Bernanke 's nomination to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve , several senators fumed about being denied access to his A.I.G.- related documents ...
More from my diary from five days ago ...
Yves Smith , publisher of Naked Capitalism , was all over this story ( before it even hit the newsstands ) last Saturday evening , in : " Spitzer , Partnoy , Black Call for AIG Open Source Investigation ( and Goldman Implications ) . "
Putting it simply , the question is :
How could our government let the monoline insurance companies -- the insurers of most " agency " paper and state and municipal bonds in this country -- collapse while choosing to make an exception to this practice as they singled - out AIG for the largest corporate bailout , by far , in our country 's history ?
Spitzer , Partnoy , Black Call for AIG Open Source Investigation ( and Goldman Implications )
December 20 , 2009
Yves Smith
Naked Capitalism ... While the subprime deals and CDOs were obviously going bad , an argument was made by many people at the time that the aggressive mark downs by AIG acelerated the death spiral for the market .
It is pretty clear , here and elsewhere , that Goldman was the one that initiated the mark downs of collateral value .
It would be interesting to explore this all the way through .
Though not discussed in this article , Goldman shorted subprime through the Abacus deals , and perhaps elsewhere .
This gave them an incentive to force mark downs .
the intermediation deals described in the article , combined with AIG 's collateral posting , gave them another incentive to be agressive with mark downs .
They were acting like they wanted to grab the money before anyone else could get their hands on it .
This would have raised some issues in an AIGFP bankruptcy .
( note - Hank Greenberg suggested that this was going on in his october 2008 testimony but there was a chorus of attacks on him for being a crook and unreliable , thanks to his problems with Spitzer . )
So here we have the pattern : 1 . Goldman creates or sells $ 23 billion ( or more ) of CDOs and stuffs them into AIG .
2 . Goldman proclaims to the world they have no exposure to CDOs and warns that banks and insurers with CDO exposure will get downgraded .
3 . Goldman initiates the mark downs of CDOs with AIG and others , acelerating the market 's downward spiral .
4 . Huge mark to market losses lead insurer and bank credit to freeze , short term markets to lock up , ABCP to collapse .
5 . AIG posts as much collateral as it has to Goldman , who has more aggressively marked down the exposure .
6 . Bond insurers are downgraded , banks begin commutations with them .
7 . AIG fails ,
Fed steps in , Goldman gets bailed out at par .
Yves here .
This looks like no accident .
I suspect it was no accident ...
Well ,
Yves made one statement in her diary that we 've since learned was incorrect : " And no one in authority wants to find out ... "
You see , a lot of people have been reading follow - up coverage on this story from the likes of Thomas Adams , whom I quoted in my previous diary on this matter , and further down the page from something he just posted a few hours ago over at Naked Capitalism .
And , many people read Janet Tavakoli 's piece on HuffPo on December 22nd : " Janet Tavakoli : Treasury Cover - Up Of Goldman 's Role In AIG Crisis . "
Treasury Cover - Up of Goldman 's Role in AIG Crisis ?
Huffington Post

Posted : December 22 , 2009 07:20 AM
In November 2009 , I wrote in the Huffington Post that Goldman Sachs Group nearly bankrupted AIG .
In December , the Wall Street Journal explained to the general public that Goldman fueled AIG 's gambling and played a much bigger role in the mortgage bets that nearly felled American Insurance Group ( AIG ) than the Treasury , the Fed , or Goldman itself publicly disclosed .
The TARP Inspector General 's November 17 report missed the most damaging facts .
Intentionally or otherwise , it was evasive action or just plain whitewash .
The report failed to clarify Goldman 's role in AIG 's near collapse , and that of all the settlement deals , the U.S. taxpayers ' was by far the worst .
Goldman originated or bought protection from AIG on about $ 33 billion of the problematic $ 80 billion of U.S. mortgage assets that AIG " insured " with credit derivatives , about twice as much as the next two largest banks involved .
Goldman acted as middle - man on $ 14 billion of that amount , after it took the risk of mortgage assets originated by other banks and insured all of it with AIG .
Goldman may wish to claim it " was only following orders , " but since Goldman also originated many of the mortgage assets ultimately protected by AIG , it should have been well aware of the risk posed to itself and to AIG .
The risk was then Goldman's .
If AIG failed , Goldman Sachs would have had to make good on those trades ...
Apparently , Pulitzer Prize - winning business journalist Gretchen Morgenson read Tavakoli 's piece , too .
And , here 's an example as to why Ms. Morgenson 's been referred to by many as the best in the business here in the U.S. : " Banks Bundled Bad Debt , Bet Against It and Won . "
The day after my diary appeared , in Morgenson 's Christmas Eve Day piece , from this past Thursday , we learned that at least three major government and Wall Street entities ( the SEC , FINRA and Congress , see detail in the opening paragraphs of this diary ) are actively investigating these , and related issues .
( Diarist 's Note :
If you read only ONE linked story in this diary , it should be this one ! )
Morgenson tells us of how Goldman trader Jonathan Egol rose to prominence in the firm by " ... creating mortgage - related securities , named Abacus , that were at first intended to protect Goldman from investment losses if the housing market collapsed .
As the market soured , Goldman created even more of these securities , enabling it to pocket huge profits . "
As Morgenson explains it to us , within just a few months of their sale , these CDOs began imploding ...
Banks Bundled Bad Debt , Bet Against
It and Won
By GRETCHEN MORGENSON and LOUISE STORY
New York Times
Published In Print : December 24 , 2009 ... Pension funds and insurance companies lost billions of dollars on securities that they believed were solid investments , according to former Goldman employees with direct knowledge of the deals who asked not to be identified because they have confidentiality agreements with the firm .
Goldman was not the only firm that peddled these complex securities -- known as synthetic collateralized debt obligations , or C.D.O. 's -- and then made financial bets against them , called selling short in Wall Street parlance .
Others that created similar securities and then bet they would fail , according to Wall Street traders , include Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley , as well as smaller firms like Tricadia Inc. , an investment company whose parent firm was overseen by Lewis A. Sachs , who this year became a special counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner .
How these disastrously performing securities were devised is now the subject of scrutiny by investigators in Congress , at the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , Wall Street 's self - regulatory organization , according to people briefed on the investigations .
Those involved with the inquiries declined to comment .
While the investigations are in the early phases , authorities appear to be looking at whether securities laws or rules of fair dealing were violated by firms that created and sold these mortgage - linked debt instruments and then bet against the clients who purchased them , people briefed on the matter say .
One focus of the inquiry is whether the firms creating the securities purposely helped to select especially risky mortgage - linked assets that would be most likely to crater , setting their clients up to lose billions of dollars if the housing market imploded ...
Morgenson continues on to reiterate how many of these investments soured , almost immediately , while explaining that Goldman and other firms placed " unusually large negative bets that were not mainly for hedging purposes , and investors and industry experts say that put the firms at odds with their own clients ' interests . "
" The simultaneous selling of securities to customers and shorting them because they believed they were going to default is the most cynical use of credit information that I have ever seen , " said Sylvain R. Raynes , an expert in structured finance at R & R Consulting in New York .
" When you buy protection against an event that you have a hand in causing , you are buying fire insurance on someone else 's house and then committing arson . "
You really should read Morgenson 's entire piece .
It 's comprehensive and quite compelling , to say the least .
Meanwhile , Janet Tavakoli received a communication from Goldman concerning here piece ( noted above ) , from earlier last week .
Here 's the link to her response : " Responding to Goldman Sachs . "
Responding to Goldman Sachs
Janet Tavakoli
President , Tavakoli Structured Finance , Inc .
Posted : December 25 , 2009 10:19 AM
The New York Times published a Christmas Eve expose of Goldman Sachs 's so - called " Abacus " synthetic collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
They were created with credit derivatives instead of cash securities .
Goldman used credit derivatives to create short bets that gain in value when CDOs lose value .
Goldman did this for both protection and profit and marketed the idea to hedge funds .
Goldman responded to the New York Times saying many of these deals were the result of demand from investing clients seeking long exposure .
In an earlier Huffington Post article , I wrote about Goldman 's key role in the AIG crisis ; it traded or originated $ 33 billion of AIG's $ 80 billion CDOs .
AIG was long the majority of six of Goldman 's Abacus deals .
These value - destroying CDOs were stuffed with BBB - rated ( the lowest " investment grade " rating ) portions of other deals .
These BBB - rated portions were overrated from the start .
Many of them eventually exploded like firecrackers .
-- SNIP--
The answer is that they sold a lot of " hot air " disguised as valuable securities .
Goldman claims this was prudent risk management .
In reality , Goldman created products that it knew or should have known were overrated and overpriced .
-- SNIP-- Earlier , Goldman denied it could have known this was a problem , yet acknowledged I had warned about the grave risks at the time .
If Goldman wants to stick to its story that it did n't know the gun was loaded , then it is not in the public interest to rely on Goldman 's opinion about the greater risk it now poses to the global markets .
Goldman excuses its participation by saying its counterparties were sophisticated and had the resources to do their own research .
This is a fair point if Goldman were defending itself in a lawsuit with a sophisticated investor trying to recover damages .
It is not a valid point when discussing public funds that were used to bail out AIG , Goldman , and Goldman 's " customers . "

Is Blaming AAA Investors Wall - Street Serving PR ?

Naked Capitalism
By Thomas Adams , at Paykin Krieg and Adams , LLP , and a former managing director at Ambac and FGIC .
In my view , Goldman , and a host of other clever bankers , are deliberately obscuring one of the most important points ...( by telling us that ) everyone is a grown up and should have known what he was buying .
But that conveniently obscures a critically important fact : for so - called ABS CDOs ( the kind made from asset backed securities , meaning tranches of either residential or commercial mortgage bonds ) , 75 % to 90 % of the deal was rated AAA .
And these ratings did not depend on the insurance provided by AIG or monolines ; those ratings were issued on the CDO as concocted by the packager / underwriter .
-- SNIP-- Goldman Sachs and dozens of other banks and captured journalists want the story to be about the failure of the investors who were sophisticated and assumed the risk .
They ignore the crucial fact that the bonds that blew up were AAA and were sold as virtually risk free ...
-- SNIP--
The reason that is most frequently cited as why AAA CDO bonds collapsed in value is that they had extreme cliff risk , or tail risk .
However , the notion of " cliff risk " should be incompatible with a AAA bond - by definition .
Any model that obscures or ignores or adjusts this issue away , is a form of sophisticated lying , as it relates to AAA bonds .
-- SNIP--
From the very start , the market for AAA CDO bonds backed by ABS collateral was a fraud ...
-- SNIP-- ... there is ample reason to believe a lot of the CDO packagers and underwriters knew exactly what they were doing ...
-- SNIP-- ... the biggest responsibility lies with the sellers and the creators of the bonds - they were selling something that was supposed to be super safe but turned out to be worthless - and they knew this to be the case , one way or the other .
The title of this diary is : " Is This The Biggest Political Story of 2010 ? "
Just a couple of months ago , perhaps without him realizing the details of it , Nate Silver told us that this may , in fact , be the case :
" The Issue That Could Fracture Both Right And Left . "
At the end of the day , the ongoing investigations by the SEC , FINRA and Congress may make it so .
After following this story all along , I would have to agree .
It is ground zero ( at least as far as it relates to everything that is distorted about our knowledge ) of the mortgage meltdown , IMHO .
What are your thoughts ?

The new owner did not reveal what he intends to do with the property
Latvia has sold an entire town once used by the Soviet military as a base .
The deserted town formerly known as Skrunda - 1 was auctioned off to a Russian firm for $ 3 m ( £ 1.9 m ) - about 10 times its list price , officials said .
The lot includes 45 hectares ( 111 acres ) of land , 10 apartment blocks , two nightclubs , a shopping centre , kindergarten , barracks and a sauna .
The town was abandoned after Russian troops withdrew from Latvia in 1994 , following the collapse of the USSR .
The town , about 150 km ( 93 miles ) west of Riga , was sold to the Aleksejevskoje - Serviss company , Latvia 's privatisation agency which carried out the auction said on Friday .
" It is positive that property which has been empty for a long time and where there has been no economic activity has been sold , " the agency said .
It did not say what the property would be used for .
Skrunda - 1 was a closed settlement not marked on Soviet maps because it was used as anti-missile radar base .
The base was pulled down in the late 1990s .
John McCain may have done his best to stow old Bush administration personalities away for his presidential campaign , but Fox News is reporting that a new poll shows former vice president Dick Cheney is actually a fairly popular choice among Republican voters to run for president in 2012 .
In a poll that was probably taken about a year too soon , 10 % of a pool of 2,003 Republicans supported a Cheney presidential run .
The organization that conducted the survey , Research 2000 , is simultaneously described as being “ non-partisan ” and having an affiliation with Daily Kos , though they surveyed only Republicans and there is no indication that , even if they did harbor a bias , the case of Cheney making a splash in the primary pool would do little to benefit their cause .
The presidential nominee question was also one in a variety of opinion questions such as “ should Obama be impeached ? ” and “ do you think ACORN stole the 2008 election ? ” that received surprising responses ( more people than one would imagine – 39 % and 21 % , respectively – said yes to those questions ) .
The poll results are good news for Sarah Palin , who led in the polls with 16 % support , and Mitt Romney , who received 11 % support .
These results , however , are fairly predictable : Palin is the new face of Fox News and the tea party generation ; Mitt Romney is … well , Mitt Romney just is , and he ran for president once so he may be the only name subjects polled could remember , especially compared to some of the other options .
The news here is the emergence of Cheney as a viable third candidate for the Republican nomination to the presidency .
Cheney beat out five of the other options , many of which have been more actively suggesting a possible run for office : former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich , 2008 presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and a surprising appearance by South Dakota senator John Thune .
Cheney has suffered a chronic case of unpopularity since his early days as vice president , but his favorability ratings remarkably started to surge as soon as he left the White House .
Last May CNN reported that between his departure from the White House in January 2009 and May of that same year , his popularity rose 8 % among all Americans .
Although Matt Yglesias was quick to point out that this still made him only slightly less popular than the communist nation of Cuba , that bump almost a year ago has apparently snowballed into a potential presidential run ( Fox News is reporting that there are groups in favor of “ drafting ” Cheney to the presidency , but this might be stretching the truth a tad ) .
For now , Cheney has adamantly turned the idea down , and the chances of him gaining significant ground on someone like Palin are slim , but if there ’s one thing 2010 has taught us , it ’s not to trust an old man claiming to be happy to retire from a great job .
See the full poll results here .
Have a tip we should know ?

( CNN ) -- William Ward Warren was 15 when his dad dropped him off at Dallas Love Field to see President John F. Kennedy arrive in the city , on the same day JFK was assassinated .
Students in Dallas , Texas , had November 22 , 1963 , off from school in recognition of the visit .
Warren decided to take along his 8 mm camera .
The result was " the best home movie known to exist of the Kennedy arrival , " according to Gary Mack , curator of the The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza .
The color film offers new glimpses of the president and Mrs. Kennedy , wearing a pink Chanel suit , coming down the steps from Air Force One and greeting well - wishers .
The Kennedys can then be seen from the side as they walk past the camera smiling .
Vice President Lyndon Johnson is seen close up as he greets people standing on the tarmac .
" I was very excited , " says Warren , now 61 .
" It had rained the night before and cleared off that next day , which was an interesting event , and it was a very positive day .
It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright , and there was lots of excitement . "
Warren donated the 8 mm color home movie to the museum , Mack said in a news release .
According to the news release , the only color images of President Kennedy in Dallas were made by amateurs , except for a brief film by a White House photographer .
The museum is on the sixth and seventh floors of what was known in 1963 as the Texas School Book Depository .
The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy from that location .
LAST year it was banks ; this year it is countries .
The economic crisis , which seemed to have eased off in the latter part of 2009 , is once again in full swing as the threat of sovereign default looms .
Europe 's leaders are struggling to avert the biggest financial disaster in the euro 's 11 - year history ( see article ) .
This week all eyes have been on Greece .
If it defaults , it will be the first EU member to do so .
As The Economist went to press EU leaders were meeting to discuss what to do , and there was talk of a German - led rescue scheme .
If it happens , other European candidates may be queueing up .
Bond markets are worried about the capacity of Spain ( see article ) , Ireland and Portugal to repay their debts , forcing these countries to increase taxes and cut spending , even as they remain mired in recession .
Europe 's troubles have given investors good reason to worry ; but they are not the only cause for concern .
Policy changes around the world have also spooked investors .
China 's government began to rein in its lending binge last month , worried about accelerating inflation and asset bubbles .
India 's central bank has raised reserve requirements and Brazil 's fiscal stimulus is being phased out ( see article ) .
The rich world 's big central banks are gradually unwinding the emergency liquidity facilities they introduced at the height of the crisis .
“ Quantitative easing ” , the process of printing money to buy longer - dated securities , is coming to an end — or at least being put on hold .
All this has knocked asset prices .
Stockmarkets are down sharply , commodity prices have tumbled and volatility is up .
The MSCI World Index of global share prices has fallen by almost 10 % from its peak on January 14th .
Optimism about a “ V ” - shaped recovery is being replaced with pessimism about a double - dip recession , as fears grow that policymakers will be forced , or will mistakenly choose , to remove monetary and fiscal props too soon .
Acropolis now ?
Three factors will determine whether such fears are justified .
The first is the strength of the recovery — whether it is self - sustaining , or still propped up by government stimulus .
The second is the scale of the sovereign - debt problems — whether Greece is a basket - case all of its own , or investors lose confidence in other heavily indebted governments .
The third is the deftness with which the world 's central bankers and finance ministers design and co-ordinate the withdrawal of policy stimulus ( see article ) .
The picture on global growth is increasingly split .
Big emerging economies are in the best shape , with strong growth in domestic demand and scant spare capacity .
Countries such as India and Brazil have largely put the downturn behind them .
Given the scale of its government - directed lending binge , China 's economy is vulnerable to a sudden clampdown by bureaucrats .
But , for all the markets ' worries , there are few signs that it will tighten too much too fast .
A slowing is possible , indeed desirable , but a serious stumble seems unlikely .
Not so in the rich world , where there are still few signs of strong private - demand growth .
America 's latest , buoyant , GDP figures are misleading .
Output grew at an annualised rate of 5.7 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 mainly because firms were rebuilding their stocks .
With the economy still shedding jobs ( albeit at a lower rate ) , share prices falling , the housing market still wobbly and household debt shrinking , consumer spending is likely to remain subdued .
Nor , with plenty of capacity sitting idle , are firms likely to go on an investment binge .
In Europe and Japan the situation is far grimmer .
Though exports are recovering , Japan has slipped back into deflation .
In the euro zone , recovery was faltering long before the Greek crisis hit .
Domestic demand has stalled even in countries , such as Germany , where households have no excess debt to pay off .
Searching for the exit
This disparity between the rich and emerging worlds should be reflected in their macroeconomic policies .
Emerging economies can , and should , unwind their stimulus and raise interest rates before inflation takes off .
But in big , weak , rich economies it is still too soon to tighten .
The dangers of repeating the mistakes made in America in 1937 and Japan in 1997 — when premature tax increases and tighter monetary policy pushed fragile economies back into recession — are greater than the risks of inaction .
With output so far below potential and credit growth stagnant , there is little chance of sustained inflation .
Nor , in most countries , should fear of bondholders lead to sudden fiscal austerity .
The right lesson to draw from the travails of Greece , Spain and Portugal is not that all deficits today are dangerous , but that governments need to do more to control their deficits and boost economic growth in the medium term in order to make room for looseness today .
Most big , rich economies have absorbed half that message .
At their gathering on February 6th , the G7's finance ministers concluded , rightly , that it was too early to begin withdrawing stimulus .
But no rich country has laid out a credible , medium - term fiscal plan .
Top of the list should be reforms , like raising the retirement age or means - testing future benefits , which improve countries ' fiscal outlook without crimping demand today .
France is leaning in the right direction , with its mooted overhaul of the pension system .
America 's new budget , which simply punted on the medium term , was a shocking failure in that regard .
Equally important is a more explicit agenda to boost growth in the medium term .
To minimise the risk that they fall into a Japanese - style morass of high public debt and slow growth , the rich world 's economies must spur productivity , encourage investment and foster competition .
That points to a renewed focus on freeing trade , cutting spending rather than raising taxes and agreeing on new financial regulations .
Some of today 's nervousness comes from “ policy risk ” .
Nobody — neither firms , banks nor individuals — is quite sure where government policy is going .
The more that governments can do to reduce such uncertainty , the stronger the recovery is likely to be .

Obama : Health Care Bill " Might Have Violated Pledge " On Keeping Some Doctors And Insurers
PRESIDENT OBAMA : " The last thing I will say , though -- let me say this about health care and the health care debate , because I think it also bears on a whole lot of other issues .
If you look at the package that we 've presented -- and there 's some stray cats and dogs that got in there that we were eliminating , we were in the process of eliminating .
For example , we said from the start that it was going to be important for us to be consistent in saying to people if you can have your -- if you want to keep the health insurance you got , you can keep it , that you 're not going to have anybody getting in between you and your doctor in your decision making .
And I think that some of the provisions that got snuck in might have violated that pledge . "
While browsing the addictive LoudPop Voyager I stumbled across a bike I had n’t seen before .
It was an Opel Motoclub , an unusual 500c thumper from between the Wars .
This machine was one of the highlights of the 1928 Berlin Automobil und Motorrad show : designed by Ernst Neumann - Neander , one of the pioneers of pressed - steel construction , it looked like no other motorcycle on the market .
The metalwork was cadmium plated , and most of the leather and rubber was red — right down to the tires .
Even more strangely , Fritz von Opel built a rocket - powered version too .
According to historian Paul d’orleans of The Vintagent , “ The rider activated the rockets with a foot pedal , after using the motorcycle ’s engine to reach 75 mph ; Opel calculated that 220 km/h ( 132 mph ) was then possible ” .
Opel ’s plan to break the world land speed record was unfortunately thwarted by the German authorities , but the more sedate , regular Motoclub lives on .
If you ’re tempted , there ’s a lovely 1928 model for sale at the Dutch dealer Yesterdays for € 24,500 — around US $ 33,000 .

Remember that " If You Printed Twitter " image that made the social media rounds two weeks ago ?
A similarly formatted graphic that describes the state of Internet use and adoption has been published today for your infotainment .
The focus is on exactly who uses the Internet , and how often .
It breaks things down by gender , age , income level , and nationality .
It even serves up average broadband speeds for both landline and mobile users at the bottom .
Some of this stuff surprised us a bit —
For example , desktop computers are still much more common than laptops .
You would n't guess that in day - to - day life in the developed world — at least not when it comes to personal use .
Here are some of the other points ( the image itself is farther down ) :
- There 's no gender bias when it comes to the Internet ; 74 % of men use it , and so do 74 % of women .
-
The older people are , the less likely they are to use the Internet .
93 % of people ages 18 - 29 use it , but only 38 % of people 65 + do.
65 is where the big drop off happens , though ; 70 % of people 50 - 64 are online .
-
As you might expect , the higher their income level , the more likely it is that someone has broadband access .
- Education is correlated as well .
94 % of college grads are online , while only 39 % of people with less than a high school education are .
- Internet use is up significantly in just the past five years .
In 2005 , 27 % of people surveyed used the Internet " several times a day . "
Now it 's 38 % . - 58 % have a desktop computer .
46 % have a laptop .
- Ages 25 - 44 make up the majority of people who blog .
Only 7 % of people under 25 do — that 's an even lower percentage than people 55 - 64 !
Have the youngsters latched on to other new media ?
- 54 % of bloggers consider themselves experts on whatever it is they 're blogging about .
- Norway is the country with the highest level of Internet penetration .
The United States is in fifth place .
- Japan has the fastest Internet connections on average .
No surprise there .
-
The average mobile Internet connection clocks in at around 700 Kbps .
The Call
My love / hate relationship with AMD PR continued last year .
But lately , it ’s been far less hate .
Let ’s rewind back to the Summer of 2009 .
I ’d been waiting for AMD to call for weeks .
We all knew that the RV870 was going to launch sometime before the end of the year , and we ’re normally briefed on new GPUs around a month or so before we get hardware .
The rumors said that the launch had been pushed back , but just like clockwork I got a call in June or July of last year .
It was my old friend , Chris Hook of AMD PR .
This time he wanted me to come to a press event on a carrier off the coast of California .
Sigh .
It ’s not that I have anything against carriers .
It ’s just that all I cared about at that time was the long awaited successor to the RV770 .
The RV770 was the GPU that unequivocally restored my faith in ATI graphics , an impact shared by others last June .
But that ’s not how the game is played I ’m afraid .
AMD promises its management and its partners that they can fill a room ( or carrier ) up with important press .
We get promised access to engineers , useful information and free drinks .
The USS Hornet .
GPUs are in there .
I ’m not easily swayed by free drinks , but Chris Hook knows me well enough by now to know what I ’d appreciate even more .
The Dinner - September 2009
I had to leave dinner earlier than I wanted to .
ASUS ’ Chairman Jonney
Shih was in town and only had one opportunity to meet me before I left Oakland .
Whenever either of us happens to be in the same town , we always make our best effort to meet - and I was n’t going to let him down .
In the same vein that Steve Jobs is successful because he is a product guy at heart , running a company best known for its products .
Jonney
Shih is an engineer at heart , and he runs a company who has always been known for their excellence in engineering .
This was n’t just another meeting with an executive , this was a meeting with someone who has a passion for the same things I do .
His focus is n’t on making money , it ’s on engineering .
It ’s a rare treat .
My ride was waiting outside .
I closed the lid on my laptop , making sure to save the 13 pages of notes I just took while at dinner .
And I shook this man ’s hand :
Before I left he asked me to do one thing .
He said “ Try not to make the story about me .
There are tons of hardworking engineers that really made this chip happen ” .
Like Jonney , Carrell Killebrew has his own combination of traits that make him completely unique in this industry .
All of the greats are like that .
They ’ve all got their own history that brought them to the companies that they work for today , and they have their own sets of personality traits that when combined make them so unique .
For Carrell Killebrew it 's a mixture of intelligence , pragmatism , passion and humility that 's very rare to see .
He 's also a genuinely good guy .
One of his tenets is that you should always expect the best from others .
If you expect any less than the best , that ’s all you ’ll ever get from them .
It ’s a positive take on people , one that surprisingly enough only burned Carrell once .
Perhaps he ’s more fortunate than most .
Mr. Killebrew did n’t make the RV870 , but he was beyond instrumental in making sure it was a success .
What follows is a small portion of the story of the RV870 , the GPU behind the Radeon HD 5800 series .
I call it a small portion of the story because despite this article using more than eight thousand words to tell it , the actual story took place over years and in the minds and work of hundreds of engineers .
This GPU , like all others ( even Fermi ) is the lifework of some of the best engineers in the industry .
They are the heroes of our industry , and I hope I can do their story justice .
As is usually the case with these GPU backstories , to understand why things unfolded the way they did we have to look back a few years .
Introducing a brand new GPU can take 2 - 4 years from start to finish .
Thus to understand the origins of the Radeon HD 5800 series ( RV870 ) we have to look back to 2005 .
Sidebar on Naming
AMD PR really does n’t like it when I use the name RV870 .
With this last generation of GPUs , AMD wanted to move away from its traditional naming .
According to AMD , there is no GPU called the RV870 , despite the fact that Carrell Killebrew , Eric Demers and numerous others referred to it as such over the past couple of years .
As with most drastic changes , it usually takes a while for these things to sink in .
I ’ve also heard reference to an RV870 jar - think of it as a swear jar but for each time someone calls Cypress an RV870 .
Why the change ?
Well , giving each member of a GPU family a name helps confuse the competition .
It ’s easy to know that RV870 is the successor to the RV770 .
It ’s harder to tell exactly what a Cypress is .
AMD PR would rather me refer to RV870 and the subject of today ’s story as Cypress .
The chart below shows AMD ’s full listing of codenames for the 40nm DX11 GPU lineup :
GPU Codename ATI Radeon HD 5900 Series Hemlock ATI Radeon HD 5800 Series Cypress ATI Radeon HD 5700 Series Juniper ATI Radeon HD 5600 / 5500 Series Redwood ATI Radeon HD 5400 Series Cedar
Given that we still have n’t purged the RVxxx naming from our vocabulary , I ’m going to stick with RV870 for this story .
But for those of you who have embraced the new nomenclature - RV870 = Cypress and at points I will use the two names interchangeably .

Proverbs are popularly defined as " short expressions of popular wisdom " .
Efforts to improve on the popular definition have not led to a more precise definition .
The wisdom is in the form of a general observation about the world or a bit of advice , sometimes more nearly an attitude toward a situation .

They must have all their good things now ; they cannot stay till the next year , that is , until the next world , for their portion of good .

A bully is always a coward . "
It has often been said that power corrupts .
But it is perhaps equally important to realize that weakness , too , corrupts .
Power corrupts the few , while weakness corrupts the many .
Hatred , malice , rudeness , intolerance , and suspicion are the faults of weakness .
The resentment of the weak does not spring from any injustice done to them but from the sense of inadequacy and impotence .
They hate not wickedness but weakness .
When it is their power to do so , the weak destroy weakness wherever they see it .

" Every man knows there are evils in this world which need setting right .
Every man has pretty definite ideas as what these evils are .
But to most men one in particular stands out vividly .
To some , in fact , this stands out with such startling vividness that they lose sight of other evils , or look upon them as the natural consequence of their own particular evil - in - chief . "

Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day .
Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime .
The earliest known version is from Anne Isabella Thackeray Ritchie , Mrs. Dymond ( 1885 novel ) : " I do n't suppose even Caron could tell you the difference between material and spiritual , [...] but I suppose the Patron meant that if you give a man a fish he is hungry again in an hour .
If you teach him to catch a fish you do him a good turn .
But these very elementary principles are apt to clash with the leisure of the cultivated classes . "

" God does not love that which is already in itself worthy of love , but on the contrary , that which in itself has no worth acquires worth just by becoming the object of God 's love .
Agape has nothing to do with the kind of love that depends on the recognition of a valuable quality in its object .
Agape does not recognize value , but creates it .
Agape loves , and imparts value by loving .
The man who is loved by God has no value in himself ; what gives him value is precisely the fact that God loves him .
Agape is a value - creating principle .

Enlarge By Ezra Shaw , Getty Images Dany Heatley 's appearance at a summer hockey game was an eye - opener for Justin Bourne .
BOURNE'S IDENTITY BOURNE'S IDENTITY Justin Bourne , a former minor league hockey player , writes a column for USA TODAY during the NHL season .
See Bourne 's previous column .
Follow Bourne 's personal blog .
See Bourne 's career stats .
I was made aware of my place in the hockey hierarchy by Dany Heatley When I lived in Kelowna , British Columbia , a couple times a week I would play in a locally known summer hockey game that includes the likes of Ryan Getzlaf , Duncan Keith , Shea Weber , Scott Hannan , Chuck Kobasew and dozen other NHL names that are well above fringe players .
The shinny game is good , but I could hang .
I was by no means in the top half of the talent , but I was good enough to score some daily goals and not be a write - off .
Then Heatley moved to town .
This first time I saw him , I was surprised by his size .
Not because he 's built like a guy who lives in the gym — in fact , he 's built like a massive , unsculpted block of clay — but he 's just an imposing figure , in every measurable direction .
When we did get on the ice , it turned out that he was , in fact , in great shape .
And though I always thought he looked lumbering , it turned out that he was , in fact , fast .
And his shot was really , really hard .
And really , really accurate .
The guy was , simply put , really , really good .
Before skating with him , I had heard stories from my WCHA teammates that played against him when he was still with Wisconsin , how he used to stand on the half - wall during the power play , cocked for a slap shot the whole time , while University of Wisconsin coach Mike Eaves stood on the bench and yelled " GET THE PUCK TO HEEEAAAAATS !
GET THE PUCK TO HEEEAAAATS ! "
After seeing it from up close , I immediately recognized that his ability was unattainable for me – a depressing moment for any aspiring NHLer , you can imagine .
So much of it was so obviously god -given .
You simply cannot bench - press yourself a few inches taller , or reaction - ball yourself into that much better hand - eye , or learn to think and overpower the game like him .
You just can't .
Seven or eight years ago , I started losing interest in the game from a fan 's perspective .
Playing at a high level was taking the fun out of watching it – Not only did I know the crappy truths about why some guys made it while others of equal talent did n't ( agents , drafts , birth years and size overriding concepts like " who 's the better player ? " ) , but I started to feel like I could do a lot of what I was watching , and in some cases , better .
I never totally drifted from the game , of course .
And , as I trained and grew and improved and developed , I was realizing something .
There were still a couple dozen players around the league who made me think " Wow , not with all the training , nutrition , practice and encouragement could I ever do that . "
And that 's what 's sucked me back into fanhood , and what keeps me here — is n't it for you ?
That awe , the respect for a level of ability you yourself just were n't blessed with possessing ?
If you can get past a little envy to admire the abilities of your fellow man , you get to enjoy one of the coolest parts of life .
I do n't enjoy watching lower - level hockey because I get it .
I comprehend what they do .
I 'm in awe when Alex Ovechkin , Nicklas Backstrom and Alexander Semin work the puck around like virtuosos .
For me , it 's the same as when people first heard Whitney Houston belt out Greatest Love of All , and everyone imagined what it must feel like to be able to sing like that .
Or to paint like Michelangelo , or think like Bobby Fisher , or to swim like Michael Phelps .
I 've been sucked back into the NHL because Evgeni Malkin is 6 - 3 and has hands made of some rare concoction of lotion and butter , while the rest of our hands function like a pre-mixed wheelbarrow of sand , gravel and water .
A week ago , I stood in the Zamboni gates while Martin Brodeur played goal directly in front of me , a treat not many hockey fans have ever been afforded .
He played the puck like a d-man , stacked the pads like it was the ' 80s , and just did what Marty does — be incredible .
Because of the elite few , I 've managed to find a little piece of the fandom I had when I was as a kid , when I assumed every player in the league was exceptional .
Just like I could never sing or paint or swim like the most talented people on the planet , I admire certain players because I could never enter the hockey realm in which they live .
Lord knows I tried — I was good , but Sidney Crosby ?
He 's great .
These are the people I watch the NHL for today .
So thank you , Ovy - wan - kenobe .
The rebirth of my inner fan has been pretty damn great .

Following investigations carried out by the IFPI , police carried out several raids across Sweden yesterday , targeting individuals sharing thousands of music tracks via Direct Connect .
The alleged operator of the hub was arrested while others admitted to copyright infringement offenses .
Yet again it appears that the music industry in Sweden has used the country ’s IPRED legislation to force the police to take action against illicit file - sharers .
Speaking with Swedish Radio , Lars Gustafsson , chief executive of IFPI Sweden , said that recently his group had made 20 complaints against illicit file - sharers , but only five were considered to be on a large enough scale to warrant the police taking action .
The alleged large - scale file - sharers , suspected of making available between 9,000 and 17,000 music tracks each , were raided by police yesterday .
Five different locations including Gothenburg , Docksta , Handen and Upplands Väsby were targeted , resulting in the arrest of a 28 year - old man believed to be the hub owner .
According to prosecutor Frederick Ingblad , the man accepted some responsibility but denied the charges .
The others , all accused of copyright infringement offenses , had their equipment confiscated .
Ingblad reports that thus far , two have admitted making music available through the hub .
“ This business is still too large .
There are so many new and good options there is really no reason anymore for people to steal music , ” IFPI ’s Lars Gustafsson told DN .
Rick Falkvinge , leader of the Swedish Party , was critical of the raids , and of the IPRED legislation which made them possible .
“ When the police go in and take people ’s private computers because they have shared music , it ’s completely wrong , ” he said .
“ Record companies are running with the same argument that publishers did when libraries came into being .
They warned that no one would continue to write books if it was possible to borrow them for free . ”
Sweden continues to be one of the most popular countries in the world when it comes to sharing via Direct Connect .
Its users are a perfect target for the IFPI , since individuals tend to share their entire music collection in one place , which makes proving large - scale infringement a breeze .
It is said that a near - death experience forces one to reevaluate priorities and values .
The global economy has just escaped a near - death experience .
The crisis exposed the flaws in the prevailing economic model , but it also exposed flaws in our society .
Much has been written about the foolishness of the risks that the financial sector undertook , the devastation that its institutions have brought to the economy , and the fiscal deficits that have resulted .
Too little has been written about the underlying moral deficit that has been exposed — a deficit that is larger , and harder to correct .
One of the lessons of this crisis is that there is a need for collective action , that there is a role for government .
But there are others .
We allowed markets to blindly shape our economy , but in doing so , they also shaped our society .
We should take this opportunity to ask :
Are we sure that the way that they have been molding us is what we want ?
We have created a society in which materialism overwhelms moral commitment , in which the rapid growth that we have achieved is not sustainable environmentally or socially , in which we do not act together to address our common needs .
Market fundamentalism has eroded any sense of community and has led to rampant exploitation of unwary and unprotected individuals .
There has been an erosion of trust — and not just in our financial institutions .
It is not too late to close these fissures .
How the market has altered the way we think is best illustrated by attitudes toward pay .
There used to be a social contract about the reasonable division of the gains that arise from acting together within the economy .
Within corporations , the pay of the leader might be 10 or 20 times that of the average worker .
But something happened 30 years ago , as the era of Thatcher / Reagan was ushered in .
There ceased to be any sense of fairness ; it was simply how much the executive could appropriate for himself .
It became perfectly respectable to call it incentive pay , even when there was little relationship between pay and performance .
In the finance sector , when performance is high , pay is high ; but when performance is low , pay is still high .
The bankers knew — or should have known — that while high leverage might generate high returns in good years , it also exposed the banks to large downside risks .
But they also knew that under their contracts , this would not affect their bonuses .
What happens when reward is decoupled from risk ?
One cannot always distinguish between incompetence and deception , but it seems unlikely that a business claiming to have a net worth of more than $ 100 billion could suddenly find itself in negative territory .
More likely than not , it was engaged in deceptive accounting practices .
Similarly , it is hard to believe that the mortgage originators and the investment bankers did n’t know that the products they were creating , purchasing , and repackaging were toxic .
Unjust
Rewards 4,793
$ 1 million - plus bonuses paid by major Wall St. firms in 2008 7.7 %
Compensation increase at major firms from 2007 to 2009 … 30 %
… and at JPMorgan Chase $ 140B
Projected 2009 compensation at major firms
Bernie Madoff crossed the line between exaggeration and fraudulent behavior .
But what about Angelo Mozilo , the former head of Countrywide Financial , the nation ’s largest originator of subprime mortgages ?
He has been charged by the SEC with securities fraud and insider trading :
He privately described the mortgages he was originating as toxic , even saying that Countrywide was “ flying blind , ” all while touting the strengths of his mortgage company , its prime quality mortgages using high underwriting standards .
He eventually sold his Countrywide stock for nearly $ 140 million in profits .
If he had kept the dirty secrets to himself , he might have been spared the charges ; self - deception is no crime , nor is persuading others to share in that self - deception .
The lesson for future financiers is simple :
Do n’t share your innermost doubts .
The investment bankers would like us to believe that they were deceived by the people who sold them the mortgages .
But if there was deception , they were part of it :
They encouraged the mortgage originators to go into the risky subprime market , because it generated the high returns they sought .
It is possible that a few bankers did n’t know what they were doing , but they are guilty then of a different crime , that of misrepresentation , claiming that they knew about risk when clearly they did not .
Exaggerating the virtues of one ’s wares or claiming greater competency than the evidence warrants is something that one might have expected from many businesses .
Far harder to forgive is the moral depravity — the financial sector ’s exploitation of poor and middle - class Americans .
Our financial system discovered that there was money at the bottom of the pyramid and did everything possible to move it toward the top .
We are still debating why the regulators did n’t stop this .
But should n’t the question also have been :
Did n’t those engaging in these practices have any moral compunction ?
Sometimes , the financial companies ( and other corporations ) say that it is not up to them to make the decisions about what is right and wrong .
It is up to government .
So long as the government has n’t banned the activity , a bank has every obligation to its shareholders to provide financial support for any activity from which it can obtain a good return .
The predecessors to JPMorgan Chase helped finance slave purchases .
Citibank had no qualms about staying in apartheid South Africa .
But consider , too , that the business community spends large amounts of money trying to create legislation that allows it to engage in nefarious practices .
The financial sector worked hard to stop predatory lending laws , to gut state consumer protection laws , and to ensure that the federal government ’s ever laxer standards overrode state regulators .
Their ideal scenario , it seems , is to have the kind of regulation that does n’t prevent them from doing anything , but allows them to say , in case of any problems , that they assumed everything was okay — because it was done within the law .
Securitization epitomized the process of how markets can weaken personal relationships and community .
With securitization , trust has no role ; the lender and the borrower have no personal relationship .
Everything is anonymous , and with those whose lives are being destroyed represented as merely data , the only issues in restructuring are what is legal — what is the mortgage servicer allowed to do ( see “ Why Banks Love Foreclosure ” ) — and what will maximize the expected return to the owners of the securities .
Enmeshed in legal tangles , both lenders and borrowers suffer .
Only the lawyers win .
This crisis has exposed fissures between Wall Street and Main Street , between America ’s rich and the rest of our society .
Over the last two decades , incomes of most Americans have stagnated .
We papered over the consequences by telling those at the bottom — and those in the middle — to continue to consume as if there had been an increase ; they were encouraged to live beyond their means , by borrowing ; and the bubble made it possible .
The country as a whole has been living beyond its means .
There will have to be some adjustment .
And someone will have to pick up the tab for the bank bailouts .
With real median household income already down some 4 percent between 2000 and 2008 , the brunt of the adjustment must come from those at the top who have garnered for themselves so much over the past three decades , and from the financial sector , which has imposed such high costs on the rest of society .
But the politics of this will not be easy .
The financial sector is reluctant to own up to its failings .
Part of moral behavior and individual responsibility is to accept blame when it is due .
Yet bankers have repeatedly worked hard to shift blame to others , including to those they victimized .
In today ’s financial markets , almost everyone claims innocence .
They were all just doing their jobs .
There was individualism , but no individual responsibility .
Some have argued that we had a problem in our financial plumbing .
Our pipes got clogged , and we needed federal intervention to get the markets moving again .
So we called in the same plumbers who installed the plumbing — having created the mess , presumably only they knew how to straighten it out .
Never mind if they overcharged us for the installation , then overcharged us for the repair .
We should quietly pay the bills , and pray that they did a better job this time than last .
But it is more than a matter of unclogging a drain .
The failures in our financial system are emblematic of broader failures in our economic system and our society .
That there will be changes as a result of the crisis is certain .
The question is , will they be in the right direction ?
Over the past decade , we have altered not only our institutions — encouraging ever more bigness in finance — but the very rules of capitalism .
We have announced that for favored institutions there is to be little or no market discipline .
We have created an ersatz capitalism , socializing losses as we privatize gains , a system with unclear rules , but with a predictable outcome : future crises , undue risk - taking at the public expense , and greater inefficiency .
It has become a cliché to observe that the Chinese characters for crisis reflect “ danger ” and “ opportunity . ”
We have seen the danger .
Will we seize the opportunity ?

Prof Iversen believes cannabis has been " incorrectly " classified A retired professor who said cannabis was one of the " safer " recreational drugs has taken over as chairman of the government 's drugs advisory panel .
Pharmacology specialist Les Iversen replaced David Nutt , who was sacked by the home secretary last October for " lobbying " against government policy .
Prof Iversen said : " I think cannabis for the time being is past history . "
He said much more active attention was currently being paid to so - called legal highs such as mephedrone .
Last year , Home Secretary Alan Johnson accused Prof Nutt of " crossing a line " into politics .
Prof Nutt is setting up an independent drugs panel to rival the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) .
Since that sacking , Prof Iversen , formerly of Oxford , has chaired the council 's meetings .
Following his interim appointment , Prof Iversen told the BBC : " I 'm not the drug adviser to the government , I 'm a spokesman for a large group of people on the advisory council , only a few of whom are scientists . "
Recreational drugs
In an article in 2003 , he wrote that cannabis had been " incorrectly " classified as a dangerous drug for nearly 50 years and said it was one of the " safer " recreational drugs .
During his career , the professor 's research has focused on the effects of drugs on the brain .

More from BBC Radio 5 live BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the appointment of Prof Iversen appeared to be an attempt by the Home Office to restore calm to the advisory council after a turbulent few months .
Home Secretary Alan Johnson said : " The ACMD makes a valued and important contribution to our understanding of drugs and their harms .
I 'm pleased Prof Iversen will be bringing his experience to the role of interim chair .
" The council 's work continues , including a forthcoming assessment on the harms of the so - called ' legal high ' mephedrone , following on from our control of GBL , BZP and others late last year . "
More vacancies Prof Nutt was sacked for calling cannabis less harmful than alcohol and nicotine , and saying it had been upgraded to Class B for political reasons .
Five other members on the panel subsequently resigned .
In the weeks that followed , the home secretary tried to smooth over the row by making a number of concessions to his drugs advisers .
Prof Nutt was sacked after criticising the reclassification of cannabis Mr Johnson agreed to write to panel members to explain any decisions that went against their advice .
He also said he would not pre-judge decisions on drug classification ahead of the committee issuing advice .
However , work on the advisory council is understood to have " slowed down " and a number of meetings were postponed in the wake of the row .
The Home Office has since said it could take two to three months to fill the vacancies left by the other resignations .
Prof Nutt will hold the first meeting of his new Independent Council on Drug Harms on Thursday .
He said five current members of the government 's panel have agreed to attend .

You can really tell when someone is dressing to fit their personal style because their clothes work so well for them and look completely effortless .
I ’ve photographed Emily and Justin before and they were equally bold with their style on those encounters .
Anthony and I met for the first time this day .
I loved his ribbon bow tie so much .
I can see it working really well with a lot of outfits as a unique addition and a way to dress up a semi casual outfit .
These three were so fun to photograph , it was hard picking from the photos I took of them .

More bad buzz about Google Buzz seems certain to play out in coming weeks .
That ’s because privacy and security ca n’t be separated .
And despite two rounds of privacy - setting revisions , the search giant ’sÃ‚Â new social network , in its current configuration , Ã‚Â markedly lowers privacy and security .
Coming on the heels ofÃ‚Â Facebook ’s controversial privacy - setting revamp , Ã‚Â the launch ofÃ‚Â Buzz has enervated privacy advocates and cybersecurity experts .
They ’ve long been voicingÃ‚Â concerns about how tech giants seem bent onÃ‚Â lowering the bar for defacto privacy and security , motivated by profit .
” Facebook and Google understand that social media marketing and advertising will be key to generating substantial revenues , ” says Jeff Chester , executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy .
Ã‚Â
“ They are driving the default settings forÃ ‚Â social data collection and use .
Ã‚Â Privacy advocates need to get regulators in the United States and Europe to take a tough stand . ”
The Electronic Privacy Information Center has been doing just that .
Ã‚Â EPIC today , 16 Feb2010 , filed thisÃ‚Â formal complaint about Buzz with theÃ‚Â Federal Trade Commission .
EPIC contends BuzzÃ‚Â violates user privacy expectations , diminishes user privacy , contradicts Google ’s own privacy policy , and may also violate federal wiretap laws .
Last December , EPIC filed this similarÃ‚Â complaint , signed by eight other privacy and consumer groups , asking the FTC to investigate Facebook ’s revamped privacy settings .
“ Both companies have broken promises to their users about how personal information would be used , ” says says Marc Rotenberg , executive director .
“ They did so in ways that were misleading , unfair , and deceptive .
These are serious concerns for any user of these services . ”
Algorithmically - growing community
You may recall that Facebook last December revamped its privacy settings .
The company maintains that the revisions mainly gave users more flexiblity .
But the changes also made it easier for Facebook to expand the volume of user - generated content it is able to feed into real - time search results , a hot new functionality on Google , Microsoft Bing and Yahoo Search .
Then last Tuesday , Google piggy - backed Buzz — a hybrid social network that ’s part Facebook , part Twitter — onto the Gmail accounts of the 176 million users of its free online email service .
To instantly establish a community of Buzz users interacting with each other , Ã‚Â Google used an algorithm that selects up to 50 of your Gmail contacts and designates them as your Buzz followers ;
Google assumes these folks will be interested in any Buzz microblogs you might post .
So itÃ‚Â makes this pre-designated list of your followers , as well as the list of people it has designated you to follow , available Internet - wide .
One woman complained that this configuration allowed her abusive ex-husband and his friends to begin following private comments she had been sharing with her boyfriend on Google Reader , a free Web content aggregation service also hooked into Buzz .
Initially , Buzz users had to navigateÃ‚Â several confusing steps to disable this “ auto - follow ” feature .
Responding to complaints , Google last Thursday made it easier to turn off auto - follow .
Then on Saturday , with complaints still rolling in , Google made it possible to selectively revise its pre-designated list of followers and reduced the number of steps it takes to turn off Buzz .
It also decoupled Buzz from Google Reader and Google Picasa photo albums .
Bending consumer behavior
Still , users who move too quickly through Buzz ’s set - up routine risk Internet - wide disclosure of people with whom they heretofore exchanged emails privately , says William McGeveran , a law professor at the University of Minnesota who specializes intellectual property and privacy .
This public outing of your email penpals could include your psychiatrist , your sports bookie or your secret lover .
It might also reveal your prospective clients or your bill collectors .
“ The people you email the most may not be your friends , ” says McGeveran .
Even after two revisions Buzz “ still puts the onus on the individual user to take several steps to get greater privacy , ” he says .
CNET tech news blogger Chris Matyszczyk contends that Buzz is the latest example of imperfect technology desgined to bend consumer behavior to suit the business goals of tech giants .
“ It is in the financial interests of Facebook and Google to have as much information made public as possible , ” says Matyszcyk , a creative director who advises major coporations on marketing and content creation .
“ The gaucheness with which both Facebook and now Google Buzz have gone about such a noble , selfless pursuit of their future is quite staggering . ”
Matyszczyk worries that this trend could lead to consumers “ losing their humanity , ” a notion examined in Jaron Lanier ’s new book , You Are Not a Gadget : A Manifesto .
Lanier is the computer scientist credited with coining the term “ virtual reality . ”
“ Who could not at least suspect that someone at Google , as Buzz was being created , said , or at least thought , ‘ Let ’s see how much we can get away with here ? ' ” says Matyszcyk .
“ It ’s not as if they were unaware of Facebook ’s constant privacy traumas , which culminated in that ridiculous spectacle of ( Facebook CEO ) Mark Zuckerberg saying privacy was no longer the social norm . ”
Expanding the attack surface
On the security front , Buzz already has begun to expand opportunities for cybercriminals .
Hackers who specialize in so - called Blackhat SEO attacks have started corrupting Web links that turn up high in search results for queries about Google Buzz , says Bradley Anstis , vice president of technical strategy at M86 Security .
Click on a corrupted search result and your PC instantly becomes part of a botnet , aligned with thousands of other infected PCs , he says .
Botnets are used for spamming , hijacking online bank accounts , spreading pitches for scareware , stealing corporate data and cyber espionage .
“ As we ’ve seen already , the type of information that was made available , such as the contacts you communicate with most , is alarming , ” says Anstis .
“ We ’re pleased to see Google react to this concern , but that does n’t change the fact that spammers and cyber criminals will follow any social networking service that gains traction . ”
Indeed , spam pitching fake pharmaceutical drugs already has begun to move across Buzz postings , says Beth Jones , security researcher at Sophos .
Sure to follow are data thieves who can be expected to thoroughly probe the Buzz - Gmail coupling for security weaknesses , she says .
Surfacing virgin accounts
Data thieves are being drawn to Buzz by the scent of tens of millions of valid email addresses being surfaced by Google ’s algorithm for expontentially increasing Buzz useage .
Such “ virgin accounts ” are hot commodities in the cyber underground .
“ The fundamental risk is that your ( Gmail account ) information can be readily used by cybercriminals , ” says Jones .
With a valid email address in hand , cybercriminals can easily guess the accompanying password and begin tapping contact lists in the virgin accounts .
Virgin email accounts tend to clear spam filters , making them idealÃ‚Â to spread spam and infections .
“ We see more and more cases where the user accounts are ‘ stolen ’ because the password has been guessed by cybercriminals , ” says Luis Corrons , Technical Director of PandaLabs.Ã‚Â ” Most of the users have a password that is really easy for anyone to guess once the criminal has access to certain data such as the birth date , name of pets , and so on . ”
WhileÃ‚Â it would help if moreÃ‚Â consumers were security - aware , Ã‚Â the underlying problemÃ‚Â is that social networks are not taking users ’ privacy seriously , saysÃ‚Â Corrons .
Ã‚Â Consider that Buzz ’s algorithmic spreading mechanism generated 9 million posts in 56 hours byÃ‚Â cross - correlatingÃ‚Â — and publicly surfacing — tens of millions of virgin email accounts .
“ The average user wo n’t change their settings mainly because they do n’t even know about the privacy policy , do n’t mind or donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t realize the implications , ” heÃ‚Â says .
“ In my opinion , all the settings should be restrictive by default and leave it up to the user to open them up . ”
Google responds
In response to Last Watchdog ’sÃ‚Â examination of theÃ‚Â security implications of Buzz , Pavni Diwanji , Google ’s engineering director , on 18 Feb2010 emailed me this statement :
Use of popular search terms for blackhat SEO purposes is neither new nor specific to Google Buzz , or even Google for that matter .
In all cases , we actively work to detect and remove sites that serve malware from our search index , using manual and automated processes .
We caution users who might visit suspicious sites with warnings directly in our search results as well as in many modern web browsers .
Google works hard to fight spam , and in fact , Gmail ’s anti-spam technology is one of the key reasons why people choose to use Gmail in the first place .
We have similar goals for Google Buzz .
As a Google Buzz user , you have a lot of control over what you see Ã¢â‚¬â€  you choose who you follow , and if someone is following you whom you consider spammy , you can always block them .
If you see spam , you can report it to us , and in many cases that action will remove the spam immediately .
We ’re employing a variety of techniques to help combat spam and abuse in Google Buzz , and we ’ll continue to improve our methods .

are there good alternatives to macros that give similar power , yet somehow manage to integrate with the non-macro language more cleanly than those of lisps ?
for example , in Clojure you cannot do ( apply and [ true false ] ) because and is a macro .
i'm sure there are good reasons for things to have ended up as they are , i'm just wondering if there are other reasonable ways to go that would avoid such things without losing too much else ?

Mamdouh Habib was accused of having prior knowledge of 9/11
An Australian man who was held in the Guantanamo Bay US detention camp has won the right to sue his government for complicity in his alleged treatment .
Mamdouh Habib says Australian officials were present at torture sessions he was subjected to while in detention .
A Federal Court said he was free to sue after rejecting Canberra 's claim that an Australian judge could not rule on the actions of foreign officials .
Mr Habib was released from Guantanamo without charge in 2005 .
He is seeking compensation from the Australian government over its alleged involvement .
' Offends ideals '
Egyptian - born Mr Habib was arrested in Pakistan in 2001 , accused by the US of training militants and of having prior knowledge of the 11 September 2001 attacks .
He was detained in Pakistan , Egypt and Afghanistan , before being flown to Guantanamo Bay in Cuba .
Mr Habib says he was subjected to sleep deprivation , being burnt , electrocution and injections of drugs and that Australian officials were complicit in - and sometimes present at - the sessions .
Canberra had asked for the case to be thrown out , saying Australia could not rule on the actions of US officials .
But the Federal Court said torture " offends the ideal of a common humanity " and that Australia 's parliament had " declared it to be a crime wherever outside Australia it is committed " .
The three - judge panel said torture " can never be justified by official acts or policy " , the Sydney Morning Herald reported .
Mr Habib , who has always denied the accusations against him , said he was " really happy " with the court 's verdict .
" At least I feel we 've still got justice , " ABC News quoted him as saying .
A serial bank robber identified with the help of the mother of his children after she recognized his distinctive tattoo - a dark blotch that covered her name at the request of another woman - has been sentenced to five years in federal prison .
Terrol Alan Casborn , 33 , of Fairfield pleaded guilty in November to charges that he robbed the Mechanics Bank on Concord Avenue in Concord of $ 19,242 on Aug. 8 , 2008 .
At a hearing Friday in Oakland , U.S. District Judge D. Lowell Jensen sentenced him to five years in prison .
A cottage industry has sprouted in the environmental movement , but it has nothing to do with wind turbines or carbon offsets .
The green scene has been flooded with conferences , conventions , trade shows and other events trying to capitalize on the popularity of sustainability and concerns about climate change .
Most of the meetings deal directly with environmental issues such as carbon emissions , conservation or alternative energy .
Even some industry trade shows , such as electronics and textiles , have green elements , including special pavilions and panel discussions .
There are conferences for event organizers , detailing how to run meetings that use sustainable carpets and biodegradable trash liners and avoid bottled water and printed schedules .
There are so many , even the most gung - ho of eco-mongers claim to suffer conference overload .
“ It ’s a huge amount of money , ” said Stephanie Corbin , senior assistant editor at Tradeshow Week magazine .
“ Before the economic downturn , green was the hot topic .
While it ’s definitely slowed and was put on the back burner for the recession , I do n’t think it ’s going away . ”
Nationally , at least 40 annual shows claim some sort of green focus , with many more local variations , Corbin said .
And despite the turbulent economy , experts said a surprising number are thriving , helped by investments , government incentives and publicity .
Over two weeks in November , at least five green conferences were held in the West , including green business events at UCLA and in San Francisco as well as a green building expo in Phoenix .
In October , Solar Power International sold out its Anaheim exhibit floor with more than 900 exhibitors -- double the number the year before .
The event , held by the Solar Electric Power Assn. and the Solar Energy Industries Assn. , was one of the 50 fastest - growing trade shows of 2009 , according to Tradeshow Week .
The Windpower Conference & Exhibition , held by the American Wind Energy Assn. , topped the list .
Some events are so similar they cause deja vu , attendees said .
An evergreen squad of experts and speakers , such as actor and activist Ed Begley Jr. and former Vice President Al Gore , are regulars on the green conference circuit .
The array of options can be bewildering .
“ There are so many green conferences , so many options , that you do n’t know which ones you should go to , ” said Julie Dawoodjee , spokeswoman for Los Angeles clean energy company Rentech Inc .
In 2009 , the company kept a 29 - page master calendar filled with 91 renewable fuels meetings and aviation and investor shows .
Rentech attended just 36 .
The choices can be expensive : A full pass to attend the Renewable Energy Technology Conference & Exhibition in Washington this month cost $ 795 , the same as the Pacific West Biomass Conference & Expo in Sacramento last month .
Many green events never make it to the convention center , weeded out by low attendance , bad word of mouth and the unpredictable economy .
“ Like any other industry , people will try to hop on the gravy train , and some are good at it and some are n’t , ” said Deborah Sexton , chief executive of the Professional Convention Management Assn .
Because of low interest , the Washington advocacy group Citizens for Energy Freedom had to cancel its January 2009 conference and refund registration and dinner fees .
Florida was the original site , but the group instead held a “ virtual conference ” online in May .
The earthNOW expo planned for Las Vegas in June was canceled when too few people registered .
The year before , the $ 70,000 event had been a money - loser , said show director Bob Peters .
An entrepreneur who runs a trade show display rental business as well as a muscle car club , Peters said he is no “ green guy , ” just someone who saw a business opportunity .
But only 700 attendees of the 2,500 Peters had initially hoped for showed up .
Of about 50 exhibitors , very few had professional displays , he said .
The event was moved from a large hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center into a smaller ballroom .
Still , Peters tried to hold a second expo , even offering free booths to exhibitors from the first event .
Only 15 companies responded .
Baffled and fed up , Peters walked away .
“ I thought people were in the green business for the same reason I was , ” he said .
“ But to too many people , the environment was first and money was second . ”
Those putting on gatherings that focus on environmental issues have to make sure their own eco-houses are in order , a concern that is reflected generally in the meetings industry .
More events are touting their recycling policies and energy - efficient facilities , said Sexton of the convention association .
Others provide bicycles and carpools for attendees and promote the use of public transportation .
Four events last year were certified by the Cleaner +
Greener program , sponsored by the nonprofit sustainability group Leonardo Academy , for reporting their greenhouse gas and health - related emissions and offsetting at least 50 % of the greenhouse gas discharges .
The Green Meeting Industry Council , an organization dedicated to encouraging sustainability in the conference industry , held an event this month to discuss tactics for making meetings more eco-friendly .
“ Any center that is not taking this seriously is making a terrible mistake , ” Sexton said .
“ Those trends would be very smart on the business side . ”
At the Greenbuild International Conference and Expo in Phoenix in November , the U.S. Green Building Council used biodegradable , corn -starch table coverings and signs recycled from the year before , said Kimberly Lewis , vice president of conferences and events .
Registration was electronic , and the rest of the event used only recycled paper .
More than 300 volunteers staffed more than 50 recycling stations , and all partner hotels signed “ green ” contracts to reuse towels and sheets and use eco-friendly cleaners .
The expo generated more than $ 30 million in spending for the Phoenix economy and drew more than 27,000 attendees and 1,800 exhibitors .
Small details can make or break a conference for Santa Monica company Pure Power Distribution , which sells mobile solar panels .
The firm calculates the carbon footprint of event travel , and usually shuns shows on the East Coast .
Pure Power was picky when choosing the six or so green events that it attended last year , spokesman Christopher Smith said .
“ In this environment , ” he said , “ you have to be very , very prudent . ”

American bioethics was born out of a desire to be relevant .
The philosopher Daniel Callahan has said that he and his colleagues founded the Hastings Center — the premier bioethics think tank — in 1969 because they wanted to give philosophy “ some social bite , some relevance . ”
Whether bioethics has achieved its goal is the urgent question at the core of this useful book , co-authored by Renée C. Fox , a highly distinguished sociologist , and Judith P. Swazey , a respected historian of medicine .
Between them , Fox and Swazey have spent many decades as participant observers in the house of medicine .
Their intensive involvement with physicians , theologians , and philosophers has given them ringside seats to the development of modern bioethics .
Through enjoyable interviews with major figures in the field and a rich trove of personal observations , the book perceptively , if densely , chronicles the growth of bioethics as a profession .
If success is measured by breadth of institutional footprint , then bioethics has indeed succeeded .
Major universities house bioethics centers that offer a plethora of both graduate and undergraduate programs .
Bioethicists serve on hospital ethics committees and on research review boards .
In many hospitals , bioethicists are “ on call ” to offer guidance on whether certain life - prolonging treatments should be initiated or withdrawn .
In the public policy arena , bioethicists are appointed to presidential commissions and state and federal task forces that formulate guidelines and advise politicians .
By other measures of relevance , however , bioethics certainly falls short .
Though clearly fond of the bioethicist - physicians , bioethicist - philosophers , and bioethicist - legal scholars they interviewed , Fox and Swazey describe themselves as “ critical of what we regard as the field 's deficiencies and blind spots . ”
They identify these as the use of dumbed - down teaching formulae , an insensitivity to cultural differences , and the tendency of American bioethicists to emphasize “ individual rights , and rationality ” instead of “ community , and common good , ” which are the values that Fox and Swazey favor .
The matter of ethical expertise — what it looks like , who can claim it — is a profound one .
Bioethics ’ place in the academy , in the clinical realm , and in society turns on it .
For most of us , the very idea of “ right ” answers to complex moral and philosophical dilemmas such as euthanasia , embryonic stem cell cloning , or organ remuneration is absurd on its face .
After all , deriving an “ answer ” depends upon which type of moral theory one favors .
Fox and Swazey have faith that expertise in ethics does exist , but they believe that such expertise will not be fully realized until bioethicists take on matters of social justice .
Disconcertingly , they are not concerned that a social justice agenda risks blurring the lines between disinterested ethical analysis ( the authentic expertise of bioethicists ) and outright political activism .
This oversight is made even more peculiar because the authors seem quite appropriately exasperated by some of the day - to - day perversions of ethics “ expertise . ”
Ask almost any hospital physician about bioethicists and you will get , in reliable sequence , an eye roll , a sigh , and then an earful of anecdotes about swaggering cowboys posing as arbiters of right and wrong ( “ Wizards of Oughts , ” as one critic put it ) .
In the media , the coverage of almost any biomedical controversy is sure to contain a quotation from a bioethicist with oracular pretensions .
The unmistakable message of ethics punditry is clear : anyone who disagrees with us is thoughtless or unethical .
WASHINGTON  Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates , who has long called European contributions to NATO inadequate , said Tuesday that public and political opposition to the military had grown so great in Europe that it was directly affecting operations in Afghanistan and impeding the alliance ’s broader security goals .
“ The demilitarization of Europe  where large swaths of the general public and political class are averse to military force and the risks that go with it  has gone from a blessing in the 20th century to an impediment to achieving real security and lasting peace in the 21st , ” he told NATO officers and officials in a speech at the National Defense University , the Defense Department - financed graduate school for military officers and diplomats .
A perception of European weakness , he warned , could provide a “ temptation to miscalculation and aggression ” by hostile powers .
The meeting was a prelude to the alliance ’s review this year of its basic mission plan for the first time since 1999 .
“ Right now , ” Mr. Gates said , “ the alliance faces very serious , long - term , systemic problems . ”
I thought that was pretty cool .
People can mock if they want , but it's not a bad way for even a musician to quickly " jot down , " so to speak , new ideas for a song and then actually , you know , play it for real .
I like that it actually does record singing to complete the effect .
Puts this one over a standard midi program , imo .
And yes , I actually play guitar , piano , and I sing .
So f*** off !!

The SUV is the favourite villan of the ecologically aware motorist , until now .
Phoenix Motorcars is set to begin shipping the above SUT / SUV a little later this year , Phoenix has been through some rough times with chapter 11 being filed in mid-2009 , an angel investor has stepped in and saved the company though and we are assured that the first SUT ’s are on the way for a 2010 delivery .
Both the SUT and SUV are said to feature a 100 - plus mile range , litium - titanate battery systems ( the same basic system that will be used in the Lightning GT ) that feature a 10 minute recharge time if you have access to an industrial - grade power socket .
Phoenix is currently working on a 250 mile version to suit the longer range market and perhaps dip it ’s toe into the towing - capable market .
With both an SUT and an SUV available it will be interesting to watch this space and see how Phoenix progress .
It is refreshing to see an EV manufacturer that focusses on keeping their head down and turning out vehicles instead of turning out renderings and chasing venture capital .

A continuation of “ For the Love of God ”
Elaborating an idea that was left mentioned but unexplored in the previous essay , we wish to outline some central arguments of our belief that Western science or Enlightenment rationalism constitutes a mythical worldview , a state religion , and a productive modality , which is to say , a worldshaper .
While it is true that all religions are worldshapers , since understanding is one of the first forms of shaping , by being integrally connected to capitalism Western science is the most powerful worldshaper to date ; far from neutral , it is a most potent machine .
Not only do we argue the religious nature of science , we also assert that it is a direct ideological descendant of Christianity , and while the ascendance of Enlightenment rationalism constituted a rupture with Church power and doctrine , we would qualify this as an evolutionary rupture , incurring no more breakage or damage to Church structures and thinking than was strictly necessary for Science to gain its independence and make a qualitative leap as the hegemonic worldshaper , as the butterfly must break the chrysalis .
Mere Empiricism
From the outset we find it necessary to make a crucial distinction between Enlightenment rationalism , a category that contains nearly all the attributes people wish to communicate when they refer to “ science , ” and the empirical method , which rationalism ’s coreligionists would have us believe is the pure essence and extent of real science , a method unencumbered by worldview .
In rejecting Science we do not reject the empirical method , which we consider a useful but severely limited way of gaining knowledge ; rather we reject all of Western science ’s dark matter , all the elements it claims not to possess .
We can use the empirical method without believing in Science just like we can appreciate a cathedral without being Catholic or use fire or wheels without being animists ( as were the probable inventors of those tools ) .
In fact , the comparison is faulty , given that Enlightenment thinkers were not the sole nor the first inventors of empiricism , just as Johannes Gutenberg was not the sole nor the first inventor of the printing press .
Experimentation is widespread in human history , and in many cultures it has taken on methodical forms .
Because scientists from the “ hard ” branches have studied neither discourse , nor symbols , nor logic , they tend to be unaware when they are speaking metaphorically , and often confuse fact with fiction ( to be fair I should point out that this problem , which I had grasped but could not articulate , was first elucidated to me by a PhD candidate of the humanities ) .
Believers in Science will generally assert that Science itself is nothing more than empiricism .
This is balderdash .
We enumerate below a whole host of religious elements of the rationalist worldview and characteristics that the Enlightenment uncritically inherited from Christianity .
But first , it would be good to point out a chief limitation of empiricism itself .
This element can be summed up as the following non-falsifiable article of faith : “ believe only what you can see . ”
Such a belief is wholly ignorant of the fact , now empirically proven , that observation changes what is being observed , and it also predisposes us to a knowledge of aliens rather than a knowledge of self , relationships , or fields .
Leaving behind positivism and the faith in one kind of knowledge alone , we would state that “ only what can be observed and tested counts as empirical knowledge . ”
The implication is that there are many other kinds of knowledge , a recognition unknown to men of “ Science , ” who have chosen to name their doctrine , simply and presumptuously , “ Knowledge ” — in Latin of course , suggesting an entire other train of baggage coming along on tracks clearly laid down by the Catholic church .
Objectivity
While we can appreciate a limited but significant validity in empiricism , we must attack objectivity wholeheartedly as a philosophically and empirically preposterous idea , as well as a morally disturbed way of looking at the world .
Nevermind the insistence that contradiction or paradox constitutes a logical fallacy ( which in some cultures would be viewed as a sign of a simplistic immaturity ) , the belief that there exists a complete , internally aligned , finite set of facts to describe every situation implies a worldview screaming for an absent god .
All facts are processed knowledge resulting from personal involvement in a situation , guided by a specific cultural and historical framing as well as individual motivations .
Regardless of whether a falling tree makes noise in an empty forest , how someone understands a forest and what features of it they decide to , or are even able to , measure , are all subjectively determined factors .
There are no facts without personhood , and the tendency to try to alienate the facts from the producers of those facts not only trains people in a non-ecstatic disembodied view of their own lives , it also suggests dishonesty as well as an extreme discomfort with one ’s place in the world .
In a world not ruled by Science , psychologists would be speaking about “ objectivity neurosis ” rather than “ oppositional defiance disorder . ”
Empirically and philosophically speaking , objectivity is a concept that has been thoroughly problematized , if not to say discredited ; nonetheless it continues to make the rounds and play a central role in shaping people ’s worldview ( a dynamic that we will see pop up a number of times throughout this essay ) .
It is now a well produced and difficult to deny fact that observation always changes that which is observed .
This holds true across the disciplines , from the thermometer slightly changing the temperature of the matter it is inserted into , to the velocity of one object being relative to the velocity of the object from which it is being observed , to people changing their behavior , even pandering to the scientist ’s expectations , when being observed by an anthropologist or sociologist .
This boils down to a truism that should , at least philosophically , hold great weight : it is impossible to know the world without us .
In terms of physics , it is hard to talk about objective velocity and position because space is not a neutral , static field of fixed coordinates against which objects can be measured ; in fact on a number of levels even the firm distinction between object and space is illusory , stemming from a human ( or at least Western ) preference for seeing things and not seeing the field that contains them .
And in terms of knowledge production focusing on other humans , we can take a moment to mock medical studies ( the medical industry , ahem , profession , will be a favorite whipping boy of this article ) .
The supposedly passive subjects in medical studies are engaged in the study for specific reasons opaque to the researchers who are ostensibly in control ; they know how to give the researchers what they want , and even to play them .
In many cases , they are more able professionals than the researchers themselves .
And if we are to believe that an uncontrolled “ placebo effect , ” purely psychological in terms of Science ’s mind - body dualism , can corrupt the results of a study , what about the psychological effects of living for several days inside a research facility , under artificial lights , an altered diet and daily routine , and constant observation , not to mention the tapping of bodily fluids ?
The objectivity and “ control ” in a medical study is a convenient lie , an industry convention designed to produce credibility , which is nothing other than an appearance .
As for statistics , the ultimate in objective information , anyone who cares to knows how easily statistics can be cooked and manipulated , at the moment of presentation , of analysis , or even at the moment of data intake .
Which is not to say , relativistically , that all statistics are meaningless or equally valid ; only that they can never be honestly used as anything more than one of many forms of knowledge , nor do they convey that chimera , objective truth .
And though scientists are not always directly involved in the production of the following discourse , the pedantic idea of objectivity that is a cornerstone of the news media only functions in a society that holds Science as sacred .
The journalistic hoax that allows an infinity of perspectives to be silenced so as to present “ both sides ” of a story , and their refusal to educate viewers about the invisibilized questions of framing , can only fly for a public that still believes that objective information exists .
It would probably not be exaggerated to view this hoax as a cover - up .
If people realized that the best that can be hoped for ( and not even in a pessimistic sense ) is multi-subjective knowledge , they would not constantly have to devalue and suppress their own subjective knowledge , which is to say their life experiences , in the search for a superior yet unattainable objective knowledge .
And someone who suppresses their own viewpoint is easier to control .
Heresy
Additionally , before we enumerate rationalism ’s myths and religious features , it would also do to touch on a middle area : knowledge that is validated by the empirical method , but marginalized or obscured by the acting priests of Science .
We can refer to this field as heresy , an exploration conducted within the terminology and cosmology of the faith , rather than external to it , but one that contradicts the interests of those who hold power over the faith .
To validate our terminological comparison to heresy within the Christian paradigm , we can consider the Anabaptists .
As with all heretics of their era , they were also true Christians .
They used the objective material and tools of the Church , namely the reading of Scripture , to subvert the unspoken goal of the Church institution , which was Power , the accumulation of which its heir Science has realized to a far greater extent and in a more dissimulated , innocent fashion .
And just as the Anabaptists were marginalized once their ability to contest the Church exercise of power was violently eliminated , so too are heretical forms of Science marginalized , though the mechanisms of marginalization are quite different , owing in part to modern media technologies and the universalization of literacy , and in part to the functioning of research grants .
Gaia theory , the Kropotkinian view of evolution , and Reclusian theorizations in geography are three examples of heresy in the rationalist paradigm .
Articulated by trained scientists with a scientific terminology , compatible with systems theory and other contemporary theories that are given more credence , modifiable in the face of empirical testing so as to separate them from pseudo - science ; nonetheless they all have been effectively marginalized .
The latter two , theorized by anarchists who won great praise in their day , have been largely erased from the history books , only starting to make a reappearance today , whereas the former has been marginalized primarily through derision .
Rather than being subjected to scrutiny , it is affixed with an aura of mysticism ( granted , the name helps ) enough to keep away research funders and scientists concerned about their careers .
Simultaneously , the police on multiple continents wage a fierce and bloody war , under the rubric of antiterrorism , against anyone who would attach the Gaia theory worldview to a social force ( in other words , radical environmentalists who see life as a planetary quality , and the earth as a living system that can only be protected holistically ) .
As much as the skeptics would insist that these two maneuvers in the current war on heresy are separate — the derision and the repression — we must not forget that the police today , like most other professions , conduct themselves scientifically , and that they generally do not attack social groups granted legitimacy by other powerful institutions .
A fact published by Silvia Federici illustrates the link between the enthusiastic explorations of science and of the police ; Francis Bacon , the father of empiricism , was also the Attorney General for the British Crown .
He conducted political repression for the State , becoming involved in the interrogation and torture of subjects , an activity that perhaps expanded his understanding of the methodical acquisition of knowledge .
And even though today , given centuries of complexification , the ecologist and the police investigator , both scientifically trained , are not the same person , it is hard to ignore the community of interests they work for .
One is employed by Exxon to carry out investigations that will either raise doubts about global warming or open up new product lines for “ clean energy , ” and the other has a “ domestic terrorism ” assignment that was created after political lobbying by Exxon in the face of a direct action campaign against a pipeline .
Or perhaps his job post was indirectly created by Weyerhauser , or Monsanto , or Huntingdon Life Sciences , but in that case one only need go a level higher , to find that both companies use the same bank .
Mythical Inheritance
One of the prime hand - me - downs that is pervasive in Enlightenment rationalism is the tension between the material and the ideal , which is perhaps the definitional tension of Western civilization , apparent in Plato , apparent in Christianity , and apparent in Science .
Although each of these paradigms has seized on somewhat different resolutions to the tension , the dichotomy itself is peculiar , arbitrary in the way that all cultural values are arbitrary .
Science pretends to resolve the tension by producing a dead universe ( a philosophical projection that Science as a worldshaper may be close to achieving ) .
The ideal or the spirit has been abolished , assumed to be a fiction of the material world , which in rationalist terms is the only world ( almost an inversion of Manichaeism , which is curious given the fury with which the medieval Church attacked the followers of Mani ) .
Scientists still are not any closer to furnishing ultimate explanations of consciousness , life , or creation — though their “ I do n’t know ” has gotten fascinatingly more detailed — and they continuously have to return to their relationship with religion , their explanations of the power of the mind , the placebo effect , reports of altered consciousness among people who experienced temporary death , and so on .
This would n’t be a problem if Science did not pretend to be an absolute system of knowledge .
As far as answers are concerned , Science is much better at cobbling them together than most other systems of knowledge , but the weight of its pretension to absoluteness causes it to stumble painfully over these few details , again and again , that it still cannot smooth down .
It is worth noting that , even though today , pre-Enlightenment Christianity is portrayed ( in anachronistic terms ) as fanciful and mystical , in fact Christianity took many important steps towards the dead universe of Enlightenment rationalism .
Notably , Christianity succeeded in enclosing the sacred , which had once been a commons .
The heresies that the Church attacked most violently were precisely those heresies that claimed that everyone could talk to God without priests as an intermediary .
The Church was founded on the erection of barriers between common people and the sacred .
What ’s more , Christianity was a notably skeptical religion for its day , discussing doctrine and evidence with a high premium on logic , method , and objectivity .
The chief difference is that the primary materials they operated on in their theoretical laboratories were not observations of the world around them , but Scripture ; nonetheless Church scholars regularly debated with vigour what stories , traditions , and documents were fraudulent rather than accepting any tall tale placed before them .
True , the Catholic Church certified a great many miracles in order to canonize their saints , but their actions must be compared with what came before them , not what came after .
Catholicism constituted a much less miraculous universe than the pagan one that had preceded it , a universe in which miracles could not be commonly experienced and proclaimed , but had to be granted institutional recognition .
Moreover , the honoring of sainthood was a necessary Catholic concession to the paganism it worked hard to supplant .
Much of the opprobrium reserved by Protestantism and then rationalism for the Catholic Church was directed at its worldly compromises with a decentralized spiritual practice that , by the 17th century , had already been stamped out .
It is no coincidence that the countries where the witch burnings were most thorough and the bloodiest forms of Protestantism most active would also be the cradles of scientific rationalism .
Nor is it a coincidence that many of the early men of science were monks or trained ecclesiasts , such as Copernicus , Mendel , Albertus Magnus , Roger Bacon , Georges Lemaitre , Nicolas Steno , and many more , while others like Linnaeus were educated for the priesthood before branching off into other fields of study .
Science has gone one further , abolishing the sacred sphere that the Church had enclosed and placed beyond easy access .
Nonetheless , it not only suffers this absence , it continues to produce a world ruled by abstraction , often to a neurotic degree .
Far from solved , the tension between matter and spirit it inherited from Christianity remains alive in Science .
We can also fault Science for its proliferation of simplified myths .
Ishmael , by Daniel Quinn , articulates perfectly how our scientific society is based on anthropocentric myths about evolution .
Ask anyone to explain the evolution of life , and they will tell you a story that starts with single - celled organisms and ends with humankind , the pinnacle of progress .
Scientists have an easy out , for they can always claim that this is not really a factually rigorous or “ objective ” explanation of evolution , and they ca n’t be blamed for other people ’s ignorance .
What they ca n’t explain is why that myth has always been reproduced at a far greater frequency than any empirically accurate rendition of the evolution tale , and often issues from the mouths of trained scientists themselves .
In fact , practitioners of Science are far more guilty of this simplification process than their predecessors .
With the Christians , the simplified myths tend to involve simply glossing over contradictions .
It is my impression that most Christians do n’t know that the Bible is actually full of contradictions , or that , for example , Genesis actually contains multiple creation stories that differ on important details .
With Science , however , the mythical simplifications tend to be far more crass , often flying in the face of empirical evidence in order to articulate a myth that is calming or convenient to the social order .
Examples abound , from the already cited evolution myth that depicts a hierarchical progression culminating in homo sapiens , to apologia for nuclear energy , to essentialist justifications for traditional gender relations .
Frustratingly , such myths are hard to challenge , because scientists are not usually instructed in the nuances of symbolic communication , and thus do not recognize a myth if it slaps them in the face ( on the contrary , they tend to operate in the Christian realm of truth , taking their own narratives as objective , and those of other religions as preposterous absurdities ) .
If effectively confronted , any of these myths can be conveniently jettisoned as pseudo - science , but an explanation is never offered as to why such myths are so often produced by scientists themselves , and why opportunities are systematically generated for their distribution .
Because Science is operating in a much more complicated textual terrain than Scripture , and because of the attendant professionalism , no scientist has a global picture , the way an erudite Biblical scholar might have a global picture of his respective textual terrain .
In other words , scientists inevitably have to address aspects of empirical knowledge that are outside their field of expertise .
Their vision of other fields is often fed to them by the same mass media that take the fall for being the propagators of pseudo - science .
But what we are dealing with is something systematic .
In a knowledge system that is far too complex for any one mind to appreciate all of it , or even a tenth of it , the mechanisms by which knowledge is simplified for the non-specialists , and by which a global portrayal of the knowledge is produced , must be analyzed as a structural part of that knowledge system .
Western science , however , dodges the bullet on this one by avoiding holistic analysis of its methodology .
Against such a laughably broad claim as “ Science produces a mythical view of evolution , ” the institutional body need only trot out an expert on , say , the evolution of color - perception among insects , to give a suitably detailed description of evolutionary processes and thus deny responsibility for the inaccuracies of pop science .
But the pop science and the mechanisms that produce it are an integral part of Science itself .
In the most charitable analysis , individual scientists or scientific institutions ( because of course it is inappropriate to speak of them as a cabal , the recognition of individual differences and distances being important , especially if it can prevent outsiders from developing a systemic analysis ) would do well to analyze this enduring failure to communicate .
Why are so many inaccurate narratives and so much misinformation distributed and reproduced , long after the advent of the Age of Reason ?
No doubt , politicians or television can be blamed , but any sincere skeptic cannot help but to see the way these mythical narratives are structurally reinforced , and the way they are beneficial to power - holders in a hierarchical society .
The structural component is important , and reveals other forms of Christian heritage .
Similar to the medieval church , the advancement of Western science is accomplished by professionals who are patronized by financial and territorial powers , free to research and debate within the informal but very real boundaries established by patronage , while bringing no empowerment or enlightenment to the masses , only instructions .
After all , the average citizen of a modern , scientific country gains no real tools for understanding or influencing the world around them .
On the contrary , they are consigned to believing their doctor or the scientists who quality control the products they consume ( a frequently foolish and sometimes even fatal mistake ) , and gleaning simplified versions of larger truths from copies of National Geographic or a productive half - hour spent watching the Discovery Channel .
Like the Church hierarchy , the hierarchy of scientific tenures is not a meritocracy as they would like to believe .
One encounters an endless number of nincompoops with PhDs .
And while we may find academic , peer - reviewed journals to be an invaluable resource for research , as well as a useful vehicle for the production and evaluation of empirical knowledge ( this is of course a meek understatement ) , it is not infrequently that one comes across authors in such journals who are total hacks incapable of marshaling facts or analyzing their own data ; and the only reason they were published is because they boasted a fancy piece of paper and a prestigious post .
And while that nebulous network we can ironically refer to as Science is not as nepotistic as the one that , with more precision , we can refer to metonymically as the Church — although tell that to the Harvard Admissions Board — entry into the club and ascendance in its ranks is determined at least as much by class considerations , dexterousness at university politics , alignment with other power structures , and success in publishing and receiving funding ( which means selling to a market ) as it is by merit or ability .
We personally know of an intelligent scientist and excellent professor who was prevented from getting tenure in her department simply because her politics differed from those of the department chair .
Such personal anecdotes are hardly scientific and ca n’t be taken as solid proof of anything , of course , but the day the professionals publish an empirical study revealing once and for all how many of their colleagues are total idiots , perhaps we can give up on our rude , country mouse ways and stick to The Facts rather than bewildering readers with romantic little jaunts through Storyland .
In fact , this absence of data reveals an important point : scientific institutions will not produce knowledge that is not useful to the exercise of power .
They would only conduct and publish a study revealing how many accredited scientists were airheads if there were some institutional pressure to reform admissions processes ; in the meantime , such studies are useless because they would serve to discredit the institutions .
Science , like Christianity in the Middle Ages , is the custodian of collective memory .
Whereas before it was only clerics who recorded the history of society , now nearly all primary research is conducted by trained scientists ( social and other ) .
Subsequently , the masses may do with this data what we will , but the questions of what forgotten epochs or aspects of history will be opened up to us and from what angle they will be mined are decided entirely by professional researchers .
Another artifact of Christian inheritance is the progressive , unilinear view of time that rationalism has strongly favored .
This was the dominant Christian temporality once the Gnostics were defeated around the 5th century and while since Einstein it no longer holds water in physics and has been challenged in recent decades in many of the social sciences , the myth of progress is still firmly entrenched .
Examples include the evolution myth already discussed , in which humans follow chimpanzees , or the long dominant and still taught anthropological framework that has states following chiefdoms following tribes following bands , another story with no basis in fact .
In his excellent research , Stephen Jay Gould documents a number of scientific blunders among linguists and others who assumed that the simple must be followed by the complex , as well as an abundance of examples from the natural and social sciences demonstrating the non-progressive multilineality of evolution .
Another prejudice Enlightenment rationalism inherited from Christianity is the belief in a unitary cause .
Just as Thomas Aquinas based his proof for the existence of God on the non-falsifiable assumption that existence needed a unitary , original cause , quantum physicists continue to perfect Grand Unified Theories in order to come closer to a “ theory of everything . ”
And in other fields , scientists cleave to Ockham ’s Razor , a prejudice towards the simplest explanation ( developed by a Franciscan friar no less ) .
And while Ockham ’s Razor is clearly useful , and a necessary complement to falsifiability , it can also accustom thinkers to blind themselves to complexity , or to see causation and change occurring in unilinear chains rather than as dynamic equilibria shifting across a field .
Enlightenment rationalism directly inherited Christianity ’s zeal for speaking in the name of nature ; in fact as it reached maturation Science directly contested the ability of the Church to speak for the natural world , usurping that throne for itself .
Just as Christianity in certain moments declared homosexuality , sex out of wedlock , working on Sunday , or going naked unnatural , Enlightenment rationalism began to justify its own social values through a particular characterization of the natural world .
This new world they produced , both discursively and to an increasing extent socio- economically , is a mechanical and hierarchical world .
Natural patterns were described as “ laws , ” originally assumed to have been drafted by a clockmaker God .
This latter figure , embarrassing for later scientists , quietly disappeared , but His clocklike universe and laws remain .
Living bodies continue to be characterized as machines , and with their typical obtuseness the proponents of this view generally do not know if they are speaking literally or metaphorically .
Perhaps the most important element shared by Christianity and Science is their pathologically immature fear of death .
A large part of scientific production is designed to seek everlasting life for individuals ( those who can afford the treatments , of course ) and for the species .
Nevermind that scientists claim to speak for the natural world and in nature species die out ; humanity must survive .
Does Science , therefore , think to change the productive processes it has given rise to , since they are the greatest current threat to human survival ?
Of course not .
These processes must be accelerated so that humankind can colonize Mars before we destroy the biosphere , colonize other solar systems before our sun dies , and in the meantime set up a planetary defense system should any asteroids come too close .
Scientists evidently cannot get over themselves and accept that everybody dies .
Why is our species more important than all the others , and more important than the inorganic processes of the universe ?
The only possible justification for getting ourselves , at the cost of all others , off the planet is , “ because we can . ”
If that is the ultimate ethic of our civilization , it is only fair that it be applied not only to scientists but also to their opponents .
We can hope the luddites and primitivists take note .
Anything that can be done , must be done .
Any scientist that can be killed , should be .
Why not ?
It ’s not like there ’s anything , in the grand scheme of things , to lose .
Therefore , any supporter of Western science and in particular the project to send human life out into the stars should recognize that Ted Kaczynski and more recently ITS in Mexico were absolutely right in assassinating scientists .
They had the power to do it , therefore it was right .
But if , perhaps , they feel reluctant to place their lives in the hands of such a mercenary ethos , maybe , just maybe , it ’s because their only real morality is the belief that everything they do is right .
Not so different from the Christians in the end , are they ?
Partial Knowledge
As we have stated earlier , Western science constitutes a knowledge system .
The knowledge it produces is frequently valid , up until the point it claims to be absolute .
Since it is very difficult to think outside of a paradigm , it might be useful to review the kinds of knowledge that Science is predisposed to produce .
This will further reveal the mythical , religious nature of rationalism .
And in case our position is unclear , we must insist that there is absolutely nothing wrong with myths — on the contrary humans cannot live without myths — unless they are myths that claim to be objective truths .
Rationalism , like any other cosmovision , is spiritual at its core , but on this point we will take sides to argue that the spirituality of Enlightenment rationalism is fundamentally sick , corrupted , alienated , authoritarian , ecocidal , patriarchal , and sociopathic .
Given its background in Christianity and platonic philosophy , Science is predisposed to produce the following types of knowledge :
– The charting of ahistorical genealogies ( as in the classification of species not according to their role or relation with other species , to name one of many possible organizational schema , but according to their presumed genetic descendance ; perhaps it is not unreasonable to see in this a marked Old Testament influence ) ;
– An awareness of alienated units ( swallowing — until recently uncritically — the Enlightenment concept of the individual , along with other sovereigns like the nation , scientists have overwhelmingly favored an analysis of discrete bodies rather than of fields , fluxes , or interconnections , which is akin to analyzing the ocean as a large collection of waves ) ;
– The development of mathematics as the language of nature ( revealing something approaching a kabbalist mysticism , rather than simply understanding numerical relations as one of multiple ways to describe the world , examples abound of scientists and mathematicians talking about numerical relations comprising a secret language behind the façade of the physical world , even as a sort of key to decoding existence ; fractals enthusiasts promote this thinking with particular frequency ) ;
– The articulation of mechanical relationships ( as opposed to reciprocal or dynamic relationships : what is overwhelmingly interesting for Science is not to discover how to maintain or effect states of balance that foster well - being , but how to achieve reproducibility and control , isolating operative factors so that a certain input will always produce the desired output ) ;
– Discoveries resulting from divisionism , or the search for pure elements that cannot be divided or cut ( in the popular parlance , the search for the “ building blocks ” of life , matter , the universe , etc. , which belies a rather simplistic view of how things are constructed , as well as a zeal to identify component elements so that reality can be reconfigured ) .
What other kinds of knowledge are there , and what is wrong with the types of knowledge enumerated above ?
After all , as of the 20th century Science can also boast a knowledge of field dynamics , dynamic equilibrium , and chaotic systems .
Give them enough time , and our boys in labcoats will discover it all , right ?
Naturally it is hard to talk about what we do n’t know or have n’t been able to discover , and perhaps even harder to reveal the presence of a lens when our whole lives we have been trained to look only at the object , and from the same perspective no less .
Objectivity is an extremely pervasive , subtle philosophy specifically because it trains its adepts to believe that the only meaningful differences are , well , objective .
If they are aware of the existence of , for example , ecosystems , they are unlikely to recognize that another culture understands ecosystems better or possesses knowledge that the rationalists do not , especially if that other culture has no quantitative studies to demonstrate their knowledge .
It will be hard for them to grasp how much perspective , emphasis , and mythical framing can affect knowledge .
If both knowledge systems perceive the same objective facts , that wolves eat deer and deer eat plants and plants feed off the soil and the sun , then in objective terms a food chain as a theoretical heuristic lacks nothing that another knowledge system might contain , even though it puts all the attention on discrete agents rather than the living field constituted by the dynamic relationships between them , and therefore leads to a number of disastrous misunderstandings about ecosystems ( remember the Cane Toad ! ) .
Nonetheless , we will try our best to reveal what is lacking , similar to how astronomers must discover black holes by looking at the things around them .
Quantum physics and Cartesian geometry may be a good place to start .
Just as Cartesian dualism remains embedded in Enlightenment rationalism , the Cartesian geometry of flat planes and right angles remains integral to the scientific worldview , even though it has been invalidated by the principle of relativity ( whereas the determinism of classical science up to and including general relativity has been contradicted by the uncertainty of quantum mechanics ) .
If space itself is not a neutral , static phenomenon , something as stable and happy as a square or a triangle can be nothing but an illusion or a convenient lie .
( This is a part of Science ’s mythical simplification , elements of the worldview that it cannot actually defend , but that it nonetheless perpetuates , through mechanisms that will be dishonestly chalked up to “ pop science ” if ever called to account . )
Nonetheless , it is useful to train people to think in terms of Cartesian geometry , because the discipline has been extremely active in enclosing and dividing land or rationally governing construction through blueprints ( as Deleuze and Guattari have written , blueprints are not required even for the construction of complex buildings , unless the construction process needs to be subordinated to an external and rational authority ) .
It would be easy to say that this whole line of argument is flawed , since it was scientists themselves ( Einstein and the like ) who discovered relativity and revealed the shortcomings of Cartesian geometry .
However , well over a thousand years earlier , Daoists and Buddhists were already promoting a worldview that clashed with Cartesian geometry but was largely compatible with the discoveries of quantum physics .
We reference Einstein because it is the only way to get the faithful to listen ; believers in Science refuse to recognize outside sources .
Quoting the Dao De Jing to back up a certain worldview would be about as effective as quoting the Quran to convince a Christian that a part of their doctrine is flawed .
But the empirical method , one might argue , should not be abandoned .
Scientists cannot go chasing down every last traditional spirituality as the basis for its worldview .
Scientists had to pass through the fallacies of Cartesian geometry in order to arrive at relativity , because they could not have discovered quantum physics or field dynamics without prior discoveries , adequate microscopes , and so forth .
Is this credible ?
Maybe not .
The concept of atoms comes from the ancient Greeks , who lacked microscopes .
Yet the concept fit with their worldview .
Were they really intuitive , or is it just a coincidence ?
Or is it possible that atoms do not objectively exist , that they are just one of multiple ways of understanding the composition of things ?
But I have seen atoms , some readers will no doubt react , referring to the drawings and diagrams in any high school physics textbook , just as students a century earlier were treated to pictorial renditions of the Garden of Eden ( and how perfect , in the end , that objectivity comes to us in a series of representations that we forget , from one moment to the next , are representations ) .
What is objectively true is that what we call atoms are not atoms , or otherwise the category of “ sub- atomic ” would be meaningless ( see : a - tom , etymology ) .
And it turns out that at the subatomic level , according to current research , the division between particles and waves , matter and energy , breaks down .
On the one hand , it is only reasonable that the schematics placed on a subject become more nuanced as the study of that subject progresses — in other words it would be unfair to fault scientists if earlier models proved insufficient , when we should be congratulating them for their honesty .
On the other hand , we should also consider that these schema — particles , matter , even circles and squares — that are sold to us as objective representations ( this phrase is a hilarious oxymoron , though we doubt anyone who has only studied hard sciences is capable of getting it ) are not the fruit of testing and experimentation , as the mythology of empiricism would have us believe , but are rather cultural , spiritual constructs born of a specific worldview that are imposed by the scientist on the object of study ( revealing at a deeper level what in superficial , quantitative terms has already been accepted as scientific fact , that all observation changes what is observed , another of these new discoveries that other cultures have known for a long time ) .
In other words , atoms , squares , and the dualism between matter and energy were not discovered ; they already existed in the Western imaginary and were used as symbolic tools , imposed on the inchoate knowledge that was gradually being produced in order to simplify and organize it .
Consider another example .
Referring to a case of heresy in Milan in 1028 , a Church chronicler writes about the heterodoxy as a disease that needs to be eradicated before it can “ contaminate ” the rest of Italy .
Is it a mere coincidence that the scientific understanding of disease that would arise centuries later ( now with the aid of microscopes ) would promote this exact same vision of a neutral field invaded by impure agents that spread through contact ?
They did not know about germs and bacteria , but they already spoke of unclean agents that caused contamination .
Could it be that scientists utilized a pre-existing logic to simplify and describe the complex reality of sickness ?
Yet we all know that germs are an objective reality .
There is no other valid theory of disease , right ?
On the contrary , a worldview based on fields and relationships would have us overlook the germs and focus on the diet , the body , the weather , the community — all the things that Western medicine ignores or at least minimizes .
And without a doubt , this latter theory would have a much better track record at dealing with disease , because rather than doing essentially nothing until antibiotics could be invented , it would have encouraged people to question food monocultures , urban crowding , air quality , poverty , and more .
To speak more concretely , we could state that saying germs cause sickness is like saying air causes fire .
At least with many common sicknesses , the germs are always , or often , present in any human community , but people do n’t get sick as long as their immune systems are working well .
Likewise , air is always present ( on the planet ’s surface , anyway ) , but fuel and a spark are needed before you get fire .
To draw another example related to health , since in this field ( along with ecology ) , the ignorance and blundering of Science has been most apparent ( and , come to think of it , the health of our bodies and the health of the environment are basically the two most important things one might study ) , we can consider acupuncture .
In our own lifetimes , acupuncture has gone from a treatment that was ignored or ridiculed in the West , to one that has been confirmed as effective by scientific studies .
This reaction belies the hypocrisy and also the implicit racism of empiricist mythology , as acupuncture is based on thousands of years of observation and testing , only it was n’t bearded white men who were in charge , so it clearly does n’t count .
And despite its proven effectiveness , acupuncture is still belittled or dismissed , providing more evidence of the cultural supremacy ( an important component of any religion ) implicit in Science .
Part of the reason that scientists cannot easily promote acupuncture is that they have no idea how it works .
People trained in Chinese medicine know how acupuncture works , but their explanations are completely useless for believers in Science , since they rely on concepts like energy meridians , yin and yang , that are meaningless within the worldview of Enlightenment rationalism .
To fully accept acupuncture or any other component of Chinese medicine would be to acknowledge that Science is partial rather than absolute , that it is only one knowledge system of many , and that would be unacceptable .
Let ’s compare their treatment of Chinese medicine with their adventures in psychiatry .
True to their preference for mechanistic and divisionist forms of knowledge , as mentioned above , they have “ isolated ” ( a truly spiritual term that accurately reflects their depraved philosophy ) the components of the brain that produce the chemicals connected to certain emotions .
Once you know what chemicals need to be blocked and what chemicals need to be produced in greater quantity , you ’ve got the emotions all figured out .
Simple , right ?
( Hopefully , readers read those last two lines in a Mickey Mouse voice , or at least with the voice of Joey from Friends ) .
The result of this kind of brilliant thinking are antidepressants that cause higher rates of suicide , as well as other forms of intimately disturbing unpleasantness .
Some highly civilized people might not believe that extreme stupidity is just cause for execution .
Nonetheless , we are confident that many who have been at the mercy of psychiatrists ( for they , along with other scientists , do nothing if not exercise power over people ) would agree with us that certain of these experts should be dragged out into the streets and shot .
But , since the shoe is on the other foot , we can at least start with a bit of well earned mockery .
A Worldshaper
Science has perfected a knowledge of aliens .
An alien is an Other , but not an autonomous Other necessary for the understanding of the self ; the alien helps the scientific self promote its alibi of non-selfhood or objectivity , that it is not a being intervening in the world and producing specific kinds of knowledge but a simple , non-interfering gaze that could belong to any subject , simply observing already existing facts that lie scattered across the terrain .
An alien , of necessity , is violently uprooted from its surroundings , and it is the very process of observation , categorization , and analysis , as part of greater socio- economic processes , that achieves its alienation .
Science , upon knowing an alien , has already fucked it thoroughly and irrevocably , yet it pretends that the alien already existed as an alien before the intervention of the scientific gaze .
Rationalism has perfected a number of apparatuses ostensibly intended to display knowledge .
In practice , these apparatuses are factories of alienation that train us to understand things as dismembered bodies whose relationships and histories are as invisible as they are extraneous .
These apparatuses are the encyclopedia , the museum , the zoo .
In order to appear in a zoo or a museum , a body must already have undergone a process of colonization , uprooting , kidnapping , trauma , muting , and domination .
For Science to claim ( and to do so without speaking , to naturalize the idea ) that a zebra in a zoo is the same thing as a zebra in its herd in the Serengeti , or that a ceremonial mask stored with reverence and used to bring the rains in Borneo is the same as a mask sitting in a display case in London , it must engage in a very powerful and evil kind of magic .
It is a transformation of the most pernicious kind .
In one kind of transformative magic , a person can be made a fish or a bird , and discover the interconnectedness of all things , and the mobility of the spirit .
In rationalism ’s transformation , two beings that are completely unlike — one free and the other imprisoned — are made into the same being , teaching us the sameness of all things and the transferability of objects .
Picking up after their idols , the Greeks ( though there is no direct intellectual continuity from the Greeks of antiquity to Enlightenment rationalism , contrary to scientific mythology ; in fact it was primarily the medieval Arabs who kept the previous intellectual traditions alive , whereas the early Christians who would create the socio-political and intellectual structures that would eventually give rise to the Enlightenment were great burners of libraries , a tradition the European colonizers would carry on in modified form across the globe ) , scientists have continued in their search for the atom , that which cannot be cut , and which is therefore , supposedly , pure or more real .
But what is cut in every atom , a priori , is its relationship with its surroundings .
The principles of the alien and the atom indicate that Science is not merely a method , nor even a producer of knowledge , but a worldshaper , a Weltanschauung that , through its connection to a complex of productive forces , codifies a modality with which to approach the world , inscribes a specific understanding of what the world actually is so that all its operations may unfold on a complementary terrain , and ends up reproducing the type of world that it believed in from the beginning , at increasing intensities and extremes of scale .
Cartesian geometry was flawed , but no matter ; in the hands of surveyors , architects , and landlords it made for a more Cartesian world .
Early physiologists had nothing other than muddled metaphor to support their claims that living bodies were organic machines .
Nowadays , biochemists can use genetic manipulation to turn living cells into chemical factories and nanotechnicians can create robots out of artificial chemical compounds .
Trigonometry can be taught as a pure math , but historically it changed the world as a mathematics of projectile warfare .
Rocket science , the 20th century ’s symbol of pure genius ( as in , “ He ’s no rocket scientist ” ) , likewise put the eggheads of the day at the service of a military restructuring of reality .
Leaving all the alibis aside , Science as it exists is inconceivable without its unbroken institutional , philosophical , and economic connections with policing , warfare , and industrialization .
Its medical knowledge of bodies corresponds to the State ’s need to discipline , exploit , and torture those bodies ; its funding and the areas of its advancement , its “ discoveries , ” correspond to the need of states to wage warfare against their neighbors and the need of capitalists to get an edge on their competitors and their laborers .
It is not merely a complex of academic institutions that has advanced alongside , and been corrupted by , the institutions of the modern nation - state and of capital investment .
On the contrary , at no point is Science autonomous within and endogenous to those academic institutions .
It has always been a primary motor for the expansion — material and spiritual , to borrow the tired dichotomy — of the present world system that has colonized the entire globe , put all forms of life to work , reengineered the landscape to favor production and social control , and that is now busy rewriting the very matrix in which life and existence unfold ; therefore its development has not been an exclusively academic affair but a chief concern of all the institutions of power with which it is coterminous .
Capitalism and therefore present - day ecocide do not exist without Science , neither technologically nor philosophically , and no amount of excuses about the individuality of scientists or the mutual independence of investors and inventors can change that fact .
Just as feudal society is inconceivable without the clergy , even though the feudal relationship is typically simplified as one between serf and secular lord or vassal and liege lord , the scientific class are the lynchpin of capitalist society , despite not properly belonging to the bourgeoisie or proletariat .
Scientific investigation is a major sector of production in its own right ; scientists constitute a privileged caste indispensable to the self - evaluation , reproduction , expansion , and social legitimation of state and private entities ; and the scientific worldview , with its popular and professional forms , is crucial to uniting ruler and ruled in the present day and explaining existence in a way that is compatible with the interests of domination .
An unwritten rule of the scientific philosophy that is , nonetheless , abundantly evident , is the non-limitation of invention and discovery .
Anything that can be invented , should be .
Knowledge should never be forsworn ; it must always be used for the accumulation of more knowledge .
A professional class that could invent nuclear weapons plainly follows such an imperative .
Curiously , power within the scientific regime operates in a way that is remarkably similar to capital — there is no bad money , and all money must be invested or lost .
As we have tried to indicate in the first essay of this series , Science , not only as a producer of technologies but also as a worldview and spirituality , is indispensable in the production of golem , who are the citizens of the world system , composed of the dust of obliterated worlds , alienated from their histories and their surroundings , held together only by the false commons of the apparatuses produced to sustain them .
Epilogue
We predict that many believers in Science , especially the academically initiated , will reject this critique as uselessly broad , if they do not dismiss it outright .
This is worth analyzing .
First of all , someone in a position of power , someone with an accredited brain , a priest with a position in the hierarchy , need not respond to a non-professional writer , a layperson , unless the critique begins to be so widely distributed it constitutes a threat .
The overwhelming silence this article will be met with , except from other laypersons , suggests that indeed there is a hierarchy at stake , rather than a free and equal community of ideas .
After all , the Catholic Church did not begin to execute heretics among the laiety until subversive heresies that challenged church hierarchies were widespread and began connecting with other social fault lines between upper and lower classes ( principally cleaving to the new mobile urban class of weavers ) a situation that attained in the 12th century .
Secondly , and more substantially , we have noticed a certain pattern .
The academically trained will always insist that the scientific community is highly self - critical , yet at the same time they always ( as far as we have seen ) reject criticisms that come from outside of academia as “ overgeneralized ” or unfounded .
We would argue that this is a structurally systematic response .
An institution with hegemonic aspirations , or one that has already achieved dominance , must never allow itself to be fit into a globalizing theory ( for what we are offering here , to be honest , is not a critique , it is a theoretical explanation of where Science fits within an anarchist view of the world ) .
Anticolonial movements have already criticized postmodernism for how theorizing other people ’s identities and histories constitutes an exercise of power over those peoples .
More broadly , Science cannot accept any external theorization of its role , because it is busy trying to place everything and everyone else within a theoretical system of its own making .
At this juncture , we are not trying to offer criticism or feedback that might be useful to specific scientists , and which accordingly , must be particular , balanced , and fair .
We are trying to theorize about a system of knowledge that pretends to be objective and all - encompassing , and a cabal ( in the Biblical rather than paranoid conspiratorial sense ) that claims not to exist , not to have agency , and not to have systematic patterns of behavior and ways of shaping the world .
In other words , what we are dealing with is precisely the lack of a theoretical generalization about Science as a complex of institutions with dynamic agency and an extremely important role within capitalism .
Lacking this , it does not escape our attention that the only serious critiques of scientists that will be permitted are those that originate from other scientists and are published and disseminated by the structures that Science has sanctioned for its internal communications ; and secondarily critiques originating from the laity that follow the rules of good form , addressing only particular scientists and particular errors , and thus never capable of contributing towards a theoretical framework that addresses Science globally .
To avoid unfair generalization , we are meant to wait until the official producers of knowledge themselves conceive of and find funding for a study that could objectively demonstrate in what percentage of the cases these criticisms are founded .
Pie in the sky .
Remaining cautious of the potential for demagoguery or logical manipulation that comparisons present , let us again take the example of the Catholic Church in the centuries before the Enlightenment .
In serious conversation today , it is perfectly viable to speak of the Church as an institution designed to accumulate power , effect social control , mobilize myths and superstitions , and repress heresy .
Are particularities lost in this widely accepted theoretical view of the Church ?
Of course ( and ironically , when it comes to outright misrepresentation , and not just the smoothing that accompanies generalization , the scientific proponents of the Enlightenment are largely to blame , in their zealousness to differentiate themselves from their supposedly irrational predecessors ) .
Debate was in fact encouraged in the Church in the Middle Ages .
Heresy could only be punished after formal processes in which the accused usually had the opportunity to defend themselves .
As for superstitions , the Church also dealt in a wealth of historical fact , they often displayed intellectual vigor in their studies , and there were many efforts to challenge and discredit fraudulent documents and data ( then as now , any “ fact ” that was n’t politically necessary could be comfortably disputed ) .
And regarding the accumulation of power , there are even examples of clergy who fought for the Church to give up its temporal power .
Do all these details mean that the summarized theorization of the Church ’s social role , articulated above , is invalid ?
Of course not .
Now what if we imagine a priest in the 12th century responding to the wave of popular dissent , deflecting a generalized critique of the Church by enumerating the following points , all of which are factually correct : the Church is n’t a unified institution , there are many internal differences and no one person or body controls everything that happens in the Church ; what priests are you referring to ?
because there are good ones and bad ones ; laypeople might be ignorant of this , but the Church is very self - critical — aside from constant debates that occur via letters that bounce back and forth across Western Europe , the popes also organize ecclesiastical conferences every few years to discuss and update dogma ; are you talking about deacons , priests , bishops , abbots , archbishops , or cardinals ?
because the clergy function really differently depending on the level you look at .
Particularization at such a juncture is nothing but filibustering .
We do n’t doubt that Science has its own mechanisms for self - criticism and accountability .
In this day and age , what institutional complex does n’t ?
The point is , these mechanisms are not adequate for the rest of us .
It can be claimed that Science is not a cohesive body nor a religion , but we can see that sufficient coordination exists for scientists to be trained with enough homogeneity that they can be compatible and communicative internationally , and that these scientists are consistently useful in the maintenance and expansion of capitalism .
True , capitalism can harness anything , even the games of children , but there really is no comparison , as scientific methodologies , the products of scientific knowledge , and trained scientists themselves play an irreplaceable role at the highest levels of global capitalism and on all the frontiers of capitalist expansion .
Recently unearthed film , made to counter fears after release of Peter Sellers movie , claimed US power was best war deterrent
Nuclear Armageddon has always had its funny side .
But the US military was n't laughing in the early 1960s as Americans , freshly shaken by the Cuban missile crisis , lapped up Stanley Kubrick 's classic satire , Dr Strangelove or : How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb .
The film – which portrays a psychotic air force general who sets in chain the nuclear obliteration of the Soviet Union – was one of a spate of popular novels and films about accidental atomic war which had the US air force worried that some viewers might believe it all possible .
So in an attempt to persuade Americans that there was no chance of some rogue general or crosswired computer unleashing an atomic war , Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) went into the film business itself .
The result , a 17 - minute propaganda film called SAC Command Post , was never shown to the public and was all but forgotten until it was unearthed at the national archive by William Burr , a researcher from George Washington University .
Burr describes the film as intended to counter early 1960s novels and Hollywood films such as Fail - Safe , about a US president forced to drop an atomic bomb on New York after America accidentally attacks Russia , and Dr Strangelove .
" The air force wanted to show they have control of these weapons , they were responsible , they would use them under presidential direction and they were ready for war , " he said .
Why the film was never shown to the public has not been explained , although the answer may lie in a style that could be considered comforting only to firm believers in the cold war doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction ( Mad ) .
SAC Command
Post opens with a startling assertion : " There is only world peace where there is power to preserve order among nations and the retaliatory power of the Strategic Air Command of the United States air force is the greatest deterrent to general war there is in the world today . "
Cut to rows of nuclear bombers .
" Half of the bombers are poised for take off within minutes , " says the film .
" Some are always airborne . "
Just in case Americans might not be fully reassured that vast numbers of nuclear bombs make the world safer , the film shifts to operations behind the thick concrete walls of the fortified subterranean SAC headquarters in Nebraska .
" World war three can't be triggered by an unauthorised launching of a nuclear bomb , " says the narrator .
The principal evidence for this is rows of men in military uniforms in front of rows of telephones .
They include two special phones – one gold , the other red – that link the president and military commanders using code names such as " drop - kick " and bomber bases .
For all the SAC 's efforts to reassure the public , Dr Strangelove may have been closer to the truth than the US air force was prepared to admit .
SAC Command
Post reinforces the popular belief that only the president could order a nuclear strike .
" Positive and authenticated voice instructions originating at the presidential level are required to commit the SAC forces to their target , " it says .
In truth , there were also a few generals with the authority to press the nuclear button if the US was under attack and the president incommunicado .
So would Americans have been persuaded by the film ?
" It 's hard to know , " said Burr .
" We 're more wary these days .
But in the early 60s there was more of a trusting attitude , before the Vietnam war .
People had more confidence in the government . "

Justice Cowdroy today handed iiNet a sound victory in the Australian ISP ’s long - running battle against a coalition of film and television studios , finding that iiNet did not authorise copyright infringement carried out by its customers .
The studios first dragged iiNet ( and its chief executive Michael Malone , pictured ) into the Federal Court back in November 2008 , arguing that the ISP infringed copyright by failing to take reasonable steps — including enforcing its own terms and conditions — to prevent customers copying films and TV shows over its network .
However , in a packed courtroom in Sydney today , Justice Cowdroy said he found that iiNet did not authorise the infringement of the studios ’ copyright .
“ The mere provision of access to the internet is not an authorisation of infringement , ” he said .
Cowdroy made it clear that the means of infringing the studios ’ copyright was the use by iiNet customers of the BitTorrent file - sharing system .
“ iiNet has no control over BitTorrent , ” he said .
The judge added that the notification scheme proposed by the studios and their representative , the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( AFACT ) for ISPs to notify their customers of a breach of copyright and take action such as suspending or terminating their accounts was not a reasonable process .
While the judge noted that his reasons for making the finding were “ complicated and lengthy ” , they hinged on the idea that iiNet had done no more than provide an internet service to its users .
This differed from the previous Kazaa case , Cowdroy said , in that the Kazaa organisation was encouraging its users to breach copyright .
Cowdroy noted separately that the Telecommunications
Act would not have prevented iiNet from acting on the AFACT notices of infringement , as iiNet had claimed .
However , he noted that this fact did not end up being relevant to the case as iiNet did not authorise a breach of copyright .
Similarly , Cowdroy noted iiNet did have a repeat infringer policy for its customers , and would have been entitled to shelter under the ‘ safe harbour ’ provisions of the Copyright Act .
However , similarly as iiNet did not authorise the infringement of copyright , this was not revelant to the case .
Ultimately , Cowdroy concluded that there was enough evidence to show widespread copyright infringement occurring “ worldwide ” .
However , he said this cannot necessitate or compel a finding of authorisation of infringement of copyright in the case , and said the infringements of copyright were “ significantly ” less than AFACT had alleged .
The justice also found that when ISP customers used BitTorrent to download copyrighted material , they were making one copy only of the material .
In addition , he pointed out BitTorrent itself could be used for legitimate purposes .
Cowdroy ordered that the studios ’ application be dismissed and that they pay iiNet ’s legal costs .

Lifestyle - Related Diseases and Blood Clot
by : Junji Takano
Every one of us believes that lifestyle - related diseases cause blood clot .
Yes , the blood can get viscous or greasy .
That 's bad , but what causes it ?
Your whole body up to your blood vessels plays an important role in maintaining life .
Blood vessels carry oxygen and nutrients to cells throughout the body .
It plays a critical role in wound healing , and fight against pathogens that can invade the body .
In other words , our blood and blood vessels is a lifeline of our body .
When that lifeline is cut off , it can cause potentially life - threatening problems .
Excessive drinking , obesity , lack of exercise , sleep deprivation , smoking , and stressful lifestyle can make the blood sticky .
At this point of time , if left untreated , you will certainly have big troubles with your health soon .
A sticky blood causes less capillary blood flow .
Then , the surrounding cells will be killed because of lack of nutrients .
Gradually , cholesterol deposits will form on the inner surfaces of the arteries that supplies blood to the heart or brain , further obstructing the blood flow .
This is an early sign of atherosclerosis , and it is the major cause of stroke and heart attack .
Since lifestyle is the biggest factor of blood clot , you have to find its remedy right away .
Well , what kind of lifestyle that makes you more prone of sticky blood related diseases ?
Some of the common factors are :
Those who eat more meat products .
Those who are serious in doing diet control to avoid getting fat , especially middle - aged female .
Those who eat in fast foods daily .
Those who always eat snack or junk foods .
Those who drink liquor often .
Lack of exercise .
Cigarette smoking .
Those who have too much work and stress .
Of course , the best way to start is through controlled intake of food .
Fish , oats , vegetables , vegetable oils , and foods with less salt and sugar , and enough water every time will help your daily life .
Tomato , Onion , Broccoli , Apple , Avocado , Orange , Mushroom , Kelp , Vegetables , Beans , Tofu , Milk , Fish , Shell , Vinegar , Mayonnaise , Sesame oil , are recommended .
These foods also contain the following vitamins and nutrients :
Vitamin B1 , Vitamin B2 , Vitamin B6 , Vitamin C , Vitamin E , Niacin , Taurine , Magnesium , Chrome , Potassium , Vegetable fiber , Folic Acid , Carotene , Linoleic acid , Oleic acid , EPA , DHA , Polyphenol , and Mucin .
What kinds of food are recommended daily ?
Now , here they are .
Bell pepper , Red beans , Avocado , Almond , Squid , Octopus , Shells , Sardine , Seafood , Tofu , Olive oil , Squash , Agar , Cabbage , Milk , Cucumber , Black beans , Sesame , Rice bran , Bitter melon , Sweet potato , Tuna fish , Mushrooms , Potato , Vinegar , Celery , Soybeans , Onion , Tea oil , Red pepper , Tomato , Eggplant , Onion leaves , Carrots , Garlic , Broccoli , Oranges , Molokheiya , Yogurt , Apple , Seaweeds , and Kelps .
When you have symptoms of Hyperlipidemia ( excessive fats in blood ) , High blood triglycerides , Diabetes ( high blood sugar levels ) , Obesity , and Hyperuricemia ( Gout ) , think of your lifestyle at first .
Of course , when you are sick due to negative energy , then it is hard to cure by diet and exercise alone ; you may need the PYRO - ENERGEN therapy .
About the Author :

John McCain is fighting for his political life as tea - bagging wingnut blowhard J.D. Hayworth is giving him a run for his money for his Senate seat .
And as we 've seen with all Republicans , hypocrisy is one of their favorite tools in trying to obstruct , deflect and then take credit for anything .
Now , here 's what John McCain said about President Obama 's SOTU speech , responding to the fact that George Bush left this country in deep and dark hole in January of 2010 .
McCain : .. but it seems to me he quickly lapsed into the BIOB , that 's Blame It On Bush routine , that 's growing a little tiresome ...
BIOB .
John McCain is thinking like me , only in reverse .
My thing is trying to tell people " Do n't Get Fooled Again " about conservatism .
But you know , now McCain is lying his butt off to try and salvage his political career .
McCain is actually blaming Bush and Paulson for suspending his campaign when the bailout mess first was revealed to the public during the general election , which dealt a serious blow to his presidential run .
AZ Central :
Under growing pressure from conservatives and " tea party " activists , Sen .
John McCain of Arizona is having to defend his record of supporting the government 's massive bailout of the financial system .
In response to criticism from opponents seeking to defeat him in the Aug. 24 Republican primary , the four - term senator says he was misled by then - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
McCain said the pair assured him that the $ 700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program would focus on what was seen as the cause of the financial crisis , the housing meltdown .
---
McCain was n't satisfied with attacking Paulson , he also lied and said that he was called into Washington by Bush himself !
In his new book " On the Brink : Inside the Race to Stop the Collapse of the Global Financial System , " Paulson belittles McCain 's contribution to the response , noting that " when it came right down to it , ( McCain ) had little to say in the forum he himself had called . "
He also called McCain 's decision to return to Washington , apparently without a plan , " impulsive and risky " and even " dangerous . "
McCain said Bush called him in off the campaign trail , saying a worldwide economic catastrophe was imminent and that he needed his help .
" I do n't know of any American , when the president of the United States calls you and tells you something like that , who would n't respond , " McCain said .
" And I came back and tried to sit down and work with Republicans and say , ' What can we do ? ' "
Barney Frank was on with Rachel Maddow and he called John McCain a coward .
Visit msnbc.com for breaking news , world news , and news about the economy
Heather posted a longer version of this clip when Maddow did a full - length segment on flip flopping Republicans , but the segment on McCain was spot on .
MADDOW : At the time that Senator McCain called off his campaign in 2008 , you called this campaign suspension the longest Hail Mary pass in the history of either football or Marys .
Any comment on the idea it was President Bush who asked Senator McCain to suspend his campaign ?
FRANK : I ‘m — I ‘ve gone beyond being disappointed for John McCain to feeling sorry for him .
This is such a pathetically , obviously untrue statement .
Those of us who were there know it .
He was in trouble on the campaign .
He was trying to change it .
In fact , there was a very tough bipartisan negotiation going on .
And by the way , for him to blame Paulson or Bernanke is cowardly .
This was Bush .
Paul and Bernanke were acting for George Bush .
And we believed that we had to do something .
Democrats were pushing to add some restrictions on compensation .
We ‘re adding to put in those provisions that ultimately led to the TARP being paid back with a profit , but we did agree something had to be done .
Everybody was trying to get a solution , from the president to the members of Congress who were trying to work on this were unpleasantly surprised by John McCain ‘s announcement .
As a matter of fact , if you read what Paulson says , at one point , he came to find there had been an agreement , he was unhappy , because he wanted to be the one who did it .
I said he reminded me of kind of Andy Kaufman as Mighty Mouse .
“ Here I come to save the day . ”
So , no .
John ‘s recollection there — I mean , it ‘s not his recollection .
It ‘s an invention .
Look , he ‘s got a very conservative primary opponent .
He voted for the TARP money .
He clearly supported it .
And he‘s now just trying to reinvent history , but it ‘s unseemly for a man like that to blame other people , because he changed his mind for political reasons .
John McCain is an expert Bush basher .
In an interview with the Moonie Times back in 2008 , John McCain employed the BIOB meme and blamed everything on Bush .
Rightfully so , by the way :
Frying meat on a gas burner may be more harmful to health than using an electric burner , because of the type of fumes it produces , suggests research published ahead of print in Occupational and Environmental Medicine .
Professional chefs and cooks may be particularly at risk .
Cooking fumes produced during high temperature frying have recently been classified as " probably carcinogenic " by the International Agency for Research on Cancer ( IARC ) .
Potentially harmful polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs for short , heterocyclic amines , and higher and mutagenic aldehydes , along with fine and ultrafine particles , have all been found in cooking fumes , using vegetable oils , such as safflower , soya bean , and rapeseed oils , as well as lard .
But it is not clear if the energy source or the type of fat used for cooking have any impact on fume content .
The research team simulated the conditions found in a typical Western European restaurant kitchen , frying 17 pieces of steak , weighing 400 g each , for 15 minutes .

They used either margarine or two different brands of soya bean oil to cook the steak on gas and electric burners .
The margarine contained a blend of soya bean , rapeseed , coconut and palm oils as well as vitamins A and D , but no hydrogenated fats .
They measured the amount of PAH , aldehydes , and total particulate matter produced in the breathing zone of the cook .
Napthalene -- a banned chemical contained in traditional mothballs -- was the only PAH detected and ranged from 0.15 to 0.27 ug / m3 air in 16 of the 17 meat samples .
The highest levels were produced when frying with margarine on the gas burner .
Higher aldehydes were produced during the frying of all the samples , while mutagenic aldehydes were produced for most samples .
Overall levels ranged from undetectable to 61.80 ug / m3 air , but the highest levels were found when frying on the gas burner , irrespective of the type of fat used .
The peak number of ultrafine particles during frying on the gas burner was considerably higher than when cooking with electricity .
Particle size with gas was 40 to 60 nm compared with 80 to 100 nm with electricity .
Ultrafine particles are more readily absorbed into the lung .
The authors point out that the levels of PAHs and particulate matter found during this study were below accepted occupational safety thresholds .
But they add that cooking fumes contain various other harmful components for which there is as yet no clear safety threshold , and gas cooking seems to increase exposure to these components .
" Exposure to cooking fumes should be reduced as much as possible , " they caution .
The number of illegal immigrants living in the U.S. plummeted to 10.8 million in 2009 , from 11.6 million the previous year , marking the sharpest decline in years and coinciding with the economic downturn , according to a new report by the Department of Homeland Security .
Mirroring a nationwide trend , California ’s illegal - immigrant population dropped to 2.6 million , from 2.8 million during this same period , according to the report , which is based on census data .
The only state to see its number of undocumented residents go up during this time was Georgia , which went from 460,000 to 480,000 .
The report cautioned that changes made to the census survey could have affected the results .
Some researchers said that the drop is because fewer illegal immigrants were entering the country .
But others disagree , saying the decline is largely due to undocumented immigrants either voluntarily leaving or being deported .
Most researchers said that the downturn in the economy has played a key role in reducing the illegal immigrant population .
But some point out that the drop in the undocumented population started before the recession .
The number of illegal immigrants residing in the U.S. declined to 11.6 million in 2008 , from 11.7 million the previous year , according to the Department of Homeland Security .

There ’s nothing worse than having bad breath and not knowing about it !
There are certain foods that are guaranteed to cause bad breath .
Most people are quite aware that eating foods such as curry , garlic , onions or coffee before a meeting or function might be the kiss of death when it comes to social etiquette .
You can try chewing gum , but you ’ll have to chew for a long time because until that bad - breath - causing - food clears from your system ( which can take up to 24 hours ) , you ’ll be stuck with that bad breath .
That ’s unless you know which foods you can eat to mask the problem .
When it comes to finding a relief to bad breath , these 8 foods will help :
Parsley
This might seem like a decoration more than anything else , but if you are eating a dish that is loaded with garlic and see that it ’s been decorated with parsley , you might want to chew on it at the end of your meal to cleanse your palate .
If you have basil leaves those will also help and chewing on strings of rosemary will also help .
Spices that pack a crunch
A few exotic spices have been known to help alleviate bad breath .
You might want to consider carrying a small packet filled with cardamom , coriander ( aka cilantro ) and fennel seeds .
These spices will you get rid of your bad breath quickly and they will leave your month feeling fresh .
Berries
Berries are not only amazing antioxidants that will help you age better , but they will also help freshen your breath !
Oranges
Oranges are not only ideal for your morning breakfast or as a snack , they are amazing at refreshing your breath because the vitamin C helps deter bad breath .
So next time you have a meal chock full of garlic , try to eat an orange a few hours after you ’ve digested !
Lemons
Lemons are great at neutralizing garlic odor on your hands and they also do wonders at killing your bad breath as well .
If you are going to drink sparkling water , why not add a slice of lemon to help deal with your bad breath .
Apples
Think of apples as a natural toothbrush for your mouth .
You see when you chew an apple it produces quite a bit of saliva production and the combination with the high fiber content of apples will help cleanse your mouth .
Mint
This list would not be complete without adding mint !
Nothing freshens your mouth like mint and that ’s one reason why mint - flavored gum is so popular !
Cinnamon sticks
Chewing on cinnamon sticks will release essential oils that will help kill the bacteria that cause bad breath very quickly !

Fox News went into full spin mode after it was announced that Rep. Ron Paul ( R - TX ) had won the CPAC presidential straw poll with 31 % of the vote .
Paul beat FNC favorite Mitt Romney , and the network ’s newest on air talent Sarah Palin .
Fox
News not only did n’t identify Paul as a Republican , but pointed out that poll was unscientific and , “ bragging rights . ”
Here is the video courtesy of Media Matters :

After announcing the results the network cautioned , “ It is way early .
It is unscientific .
Perhaps it offers nothing more than bragging rights through the course of this year . ”
Fox News should not be surprised at the results .
It is n’t much of a shock that the attendees of something called the Conservative Political Action conference would support the only true conservative on their ballot .
It was very subtle , but notice in the video how Paul was described , not as a Republican , but as a Libertarian .
It is almost as if Fox News does not want people thinking that supporting Ron Paul is a viable for Republicans .
The meaning which should be taken from the CPAC poll is that conservatives are still looking for a truly conservative candidate .
Mitt Romney is pretender , and Sarah Palin is an even bigger fraud .
Ron Paul speaks the language of true conservative values .
He is not so much a Republican as he is a conservative .
( These two terms are not synonyms , as they have n’t been for a long time ) .
I am a liberal , but I respect Ron Paul because he is genuine .
I may disagree with him , but he is the last of a dying breed .
He is an intelligent conservative who encourages those around him to think .
The message of this straw poll is clear .
Instead of being , “ back , ” the Republican Party is still lackluster and fragmented .
The Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin types are not going to inspire and motivate conservatives .
So while Fox News continues to dismiss Ron Paul , keep in mind that the GOP looks to be no better off than when it nominated John McCain , and conservatives responded with a collective yawn in 2008 .

On Friday , we shared the first in this two - part series on our experience at Picazo 7 Seventeen , a casual fine dining wine bar and restaurant in Prosser , Washington .
See that article to read all about how our wagon got hitched to the Picazo post , Chef / Owner Frank Magana , and the philosophy of the restaurant .
Now it 's time for the food and wine , yo .
As a refresher , or for those who did n't read Part 1 , the orgasmic experience that will soon be described consisted of a 7 - course meal presented by Chef Magana for the staff of , each course paired perfectly with a local wine by General Manager Trina Cortez .
Josh Gana ( that 's me ) from ( this very publication ) , described dinner at Picazo in a unique way : Come along for the ride !
Oh , and I fully acknowledge that I may fall into that snobby , food and wine writer tone .
Sorry if that 's the case .
We really are n't snooty , I promise .
After we had been seated , Trina and Frank approached our table and inquired as to whether there were any food dislikes or allergies , as they had " prepared a little bit of everything to put on the table . "
Luckily , we 're an easy group in that respect and love a chef 's surprise .
They had prepared 7 courses , and hoped we did n't mind .
No , indeed , we did n't mind at all .2008 Alexandria Nicole Cellars Horse Heaven Hills Marsanne ( pre-release ) Sweet onion and squash stuffed calimari on a bed of greens with a tarragon balsamic vinaigrette made from a chardonnay / vanilla pressed oil and a grilled pepper .
This course was our preview of greatness to come .
We found that the puree literally melted in our mouths and the produce was fresh and vibrant .
The tarragon added a wonderful complexity , and the simple unassuming pepper was to die for .
On the wine , we found a hint of residual sugar and were lucky that Trina had shared the pre-release wine with us .
It was simply anpairing , with the Marsanne perfectly complementing the calimari .
As Gwynn put it , As Trina was pouring our second glass of wine for the evening , she nonchalantly pointed to a family two tables away , stating " oh , there 's the winemaker of this wine . "
That kind of camaraderie part of the magic of Picazo.2008 Cooper Pinot GrisFirecracker prawns with red chili flakes and harissa ( a North African hot chili sauce ) .
Umm , so you could remove the word " fire " and the " er " from the name of these prawns and you 'd end up with their true nature : crack .
They are amazing .
The flavor complexity of the spice profile was transformative , and the pinot gris was a perfect wine to cut the heat of the harissa .
It was a well - balanced pairing , and we used the bread to soak up the delicious sauce when the prawns were gone .
Cooper wine is tasting - room only at this point , but watch out because their doing great things on Red Mountain .
This was ourImmediately prior to dinner , we had done a tasting at Airfield Estates a few blocks away .
We knew Picazo was featuring some of their wines , so were excited to dig in to a glass .
Oh , and yea , this is sort of a crappy photo .
I was so excited that I started eating and then remembered to take the picture -- so the presentation was shot .
2008 Airfield Estates Thunderbolt ( 95 % Sauvignon Blac , 5 % Semillon ) The delicateness of the seafood was complemented by the hearty noodles -- which our group described as amazing and interesting .
In fact , Micheal commented that the noodles tasted like an ink pen , " in the best possible way . "
The wine was delicious and perfect with the seafood , but did n't stand up to the strength of the noodles .
According to Clive : At this point in the dinner , my notes started to become a bit illegible and I believe I was in the restroom when the wine was poured .
Just another day 's work for a wine blogger .
Neil Cooper , the winemaker from Cooper Wine Company , also stopped by during this course and we had a great chat .2008 Airfield Estates DolcettoPork tenderloin encrusted with coffee and chili powder , paired with a romesco sauce , marconi almonds , and grilled green onions .
The wine was smoky and sweet , pairs well with any grilled meat .
The biggest pleasant surprise was the coffee encrustation -- it was spicy and bold , but the nutty romesco sauce mellowed it out .
Micheal had some trouble finding that balance , but the rest of us loved the combination of coffee flavor and sauce , and the dolcetto was amazing with the onion .
Quote of the course :
When the chef brought this course out , he acknowledged the quantity of wonderful food to grace our table thus far , and noted that they had tried to keep this course small .
They broke down a whole tenderloin , though , so it small just was n't in the cards .
Darn.2007 Cooper L'inizio ( 9 vineyard , 4 varietal Bordeaux blend ) Maple bacon wrapped beef tenderloin with a kumquat demi glaze bbq sauce reduction , laying on a pastini .
A communal " holy shit " emerged around the table upon tasting the tenderloin with the wine .
The kumquat was all over the delicious sauce , and the knife cut the beef like hot butter .
It was amazing .
A perfect pairing , we noted that the bread under the beef had even been carefully prepared , even though one may never see the grill marks , signaling the sheer attention to detail on the meal .
I 'll be honest that there are a number of other comments I wrote down about this wonderful course ; I just can't read the " 5 - glasses down " handwriting .
Honestly , we could n't believe there was more amazing food coming .
There was .2007 Cooper Cabernet Sauvignon ( decanted for 1.5 hours ) Dijon encrusted rack of lamb with a local chukar cherry peach salsa and an artichoke risotto cake stuffed with manchego cheese .
Micheal was clearly making googly eyes at the wine from the initial pour .
He rated it as one of his top 10 cabs ever .
He also noted that he wanted to buy Neil a bottle of wine , it was so good .
We found the lamb to be wonderfully prepared , with the tart dijon balancing the wine .
Clive summed this dish up by saying , Dessert , need I say more ?
I suppose I do , this is a blog after all .
So with this course , both Frank and Trina joined us again and informed us that they could n't agree on a wine pairing , so I 'll be damned if they were n't going to have to serve us both selections .
2007 DavenLore Winery Syrah Forte ( Port Style ) & 2008 Alexandria Nicole Cellars Syrah Ice WineStrawberry creme brulee layered on chocolate ganache .
Rick immediately noted that this was the first ice wine that he has enjoyed .
The ice wine paired perfectly with the creme brulee , and we found the forte a wonderful partner to the chocolate ganache .
In a way , you could say the ice wine enhanced a delicious flavor , and the forte complemented the chocolate .
We were left nearly speechless with the fresh strawberry essence .
Thanks for sticking with us through this journey .
Hands down , it was a wonderful dinner with perfectly paired wines .
On the drive back to Yakima , we were debating as to what the most favorite / least favorite dishes were - and we just could n't decide .
They were all amazing and the wines were spectacular .
The entire experience was really special .
Please , check out Picazo ... and Cooper Wine Company , Alexandria Nicole Cellars , Airfield Estates , and Daven Lore Winery ... it will be the best decision you ever made .
Chinese Company Considers a Future With Nuclear Cargo Shipping – Your Thoughts ?
January 2nd , 2010 by Susan Kraemer
China has certainly made some startlingly bold and draconian moves into a sustainable new future .
You might say that their One Child policy did more to slow future climate change than anything that any other nation has tried .
That ’s one example of their outside - the - box thinking about the future .
[ social_buttons ]
Then they switched to one giant national grid in under two weeks , making renewable energy a nationwide possibility .
Now they are investing $ 9 billion a month on renewable infrastructure .
Last week they opened up the grid to any producer at all of solar or wind power , passing a law that every utility must buy all the renewable power put on the grid , effectively creating the Al Gore “ electranet ” idea – the giant unfettered sellers market for anyone who builds wind or solar power .
Now comes a real shocker .
Mr Wei , the CEO of Chinese shipping giant Cosco is looking into the feasibility of running a cargo shipping fleet using nuclear power .
The New York Times James Kantor is reporting that Mr Wei told the British maritime newspaper Lloyd ’s List that his company was consulting with Chinese nuclear companies to see if the idea was practicable .
Shipping emissions are already coming under regulatory control by ports concerned with the health effects of particulate pollution .
California CARB rules are being appealed in court by the shipping industry but generally these rules wind up being upheld .
Shipping emissions contribute about 5 % of global greenhouse gases , but already sulfur from diesel fuel is under increasing regulation because of local health issues in ports .
CARB wants the shipping industry to switch to low sulfur diesel 40 miles from port .
Though this will be fought in courts , the writing is on the wall for the shipping industry .
Mr Wei wanted to put out this idea to see whether the idea would be acceptable to society .
Personally I would n’t want nuclear powered vessels anywhere near my port , but maybe a nuclear - hybrid would be OK with me .
Nuclear just on the high seas , and switch to a safer fuel for the last 500 miles to port .
International cargo shipping must make a change to be sustainable .
What would you tell Mr Wei ?

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
In 1997 , we aimed a rocket towards Saturn and sent a 13 - foot - wide satellite off on a mission to explore the strange worlds in our own ( relative ) backyard .
This month , NASA announced plans to extend the Cassini space probe 's Saturn sojourn until 2017 — nine years longer than its original end date of 2008 .
Why , exactly , does Cassini need those extra years ?
Most people probably know the mission best for the spectacular space photography it 's produced .
But NASA is hoping to get more than just a gallery of beautiful images out of extending the orbiter 's lifespan .
Armed with an array of 12 instruments — more than twice the number of science tools included on normal missions — Cassini is sort of a Swiss Army Knife in the sky .
As its mission continues , it will gather data that could help us pinpoint life - sustaining planets , or power our own with clean energy .
As it turns out , lift - off takes a lot longer than it looks on TV .
The Cassini -Huygens mission , recently renamed Cassini Solstice Mission , has roots going all the way back to the early 1980s , when American and European agencies first recommended teaming up to send a probe to Saturn .
In a lot of ways , it was a precursor of the International Space Station — proof that countries could overcome their differences and work together to further space exploration .
It 's the sort of thing that would have brought a tear to Gene Roddenberry 's eye .
But publicly funded projects — particularly ones to the tune of $ 3.27 billion — cannot survive on space - kumbayas alone .
To produce results worthy of the investment , Cassini was outfitted with sensors that allow it to collect information on everything from the space dust that hits it , to the infrared waves emanating off Saturn .
Those high - tech tools could actually collect more data than Cassini can send home , said Curt Niebur , NASA program scientist on the Cassini mission .
That 's because all the information -- photos , sound and recorded data of all sorts -- has to squeeze back to Earth through a very limited radio connection .
" The analogy today is a wifi signal .
The further you get , the less data you can exchange , " he said .
" That 's our biggest challenge .
Most people do n't realize that the spacecraft is n't taking data every second of every day , mostly because we just do n't have the pipeline to send it . "
But the information that does make it here is fascinating stuff .
For instance , scientists had long known Titan , one of Saturn 's many moons , was unusual , but , thanks to Cassini , we now know that it 's more like Earth than anyone ever suspected .
Despite an average temperature of - 200 °C , Titan has lakes , rivers and storms — they 're just made of liquid methane , instead of water .
There 's also an extreme sort of weather cycle that evaporates lakes and moves them from the North Pole to the South along with changing seasons .
And Titan has another little secret that Cassini clued researchers in on -- deep beneath the moon 's surface , it 's warm enough to harbor liquid water and create the kind of conditions enjoyed by bacteria .
That 's an important discovery , because it means we can start looking for life on planets we 'd previously ruled out .
" We thought we'd have to look for a warm planet like Earth , but we 're finding that in these cold , dark places there are processes occurring to generate heat under the ice , and life could quite possibly arise , " Niebur said .
" It 's important because there are lots of gas giants out there in space .
And they have lots of moons .
And that increases the chances of us finding life dramatically , because those icy moons could be places where life exists after all . "
Under such a tax , the prices of goods would rise in proportion to their carbon footprints  in the case of gasoline , for example , by roughly $ 2.60 a gallon .
Image Credit ... David G. Klein
A sudden price increase of that magnitude could indeed be painful .
But if phased in , it would cause much less harm .
Facing steadily increasing fuel prices , for example , manufacturers would scramble to develop more efficient vehicles .
Even from the existing menu of vehicles , a family could trade in its Ford Explorer , getting 15 miles per gallon , for a 32 - m.p.g .
Ford Focus wagon , thereby escaping the effect of higher gasoline prices .
Europeans , many of whom already pay $ 4 a gallon more than Americans do for gasoline , have adapted to their higher prices with little difficulty .
In short , the cost of preventing catastrophic climate change is astonishingly small , and it involves just a few simple changes in behavior .
The real problem with the estimates is that the outcome may be worse than expected .
And that ’s the strongest possible argument for taking action .
In a rational world , that should be an easy choice , but in this case we appear to be headed in the wrong direction .
This strange state of affairs may be rooted in human psychology .
As the Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert put it in a 2006 op - ed article in The Los Angeles Times , “ Global warming is bad , but it does n’t make us feel nauseated or angry or disgraced , and thus we do n’t feel compelled to rail against it as we do against other momentous threats to our species , such as flag burning . ”
People tend to have strong emotions about topics like food and sex , and to create their own moral rules around these emotions , he says .
“ Moral emotions are the brain ’s call to action , ” he wrote .
“ If climate change were caused by gay sex , or by the practice of eating kittens , millions of protesters would be massing in the streets . ”
Cops : Palatine woman videotaped teen naked
A 45 - year - old Palatine woman was charged Tuesday with manufacturing and distributing child pornography after authorities say she videotaped a teenage victim in a washroom and sent the images to an unknown male she met on Craigslist .
Palatine police arrested Mary Cordes , of the 1900 block of N. Cambridge Court , Monday after the images were found on her work computer .
Cook County Circuit Court Judge Joseph Urso set Cordes ' bond at $ 30,000 Tuesday in Rolling Meadows .
If convicted , she faces between four and 15 years in prison .
Police say the taping grew out of Cordes ' online relationship with a 16 - year - old boy that dates back to July .
According to police , the two sent each other sexually explicit e-mails as well as nude images and videos of themselves .
The teenager requested video of the victim as well , police said .
Cordes agreed and on Oct. 30 , using a recorder concealed in a pen , videotaped the victim , said assistant state 's attorney Shilpa Patel .
Cordes then transferred the video to a flash drive intending to edit it at work , police said .
Problems arose after Cordes downloaded the images to her work computer , prompting her to ask a co-worker for help .
After noticing the lewd images , the co-worker notified a supervisor who confiscated the computer and called Elk Grove police .
They contacted Palatine police , to whom Cordes admitted videotaping the victim , authorities said .
The arrest resulted from a joint investigation by the Palatine and Elk Grove Village police departments , both members of the Cook County Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force .
We know that our fondness for the internal combustion engine plays a part in climate change .
But a new study out of NASA ’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City indicates just how much cars are hurting us , now and in the future .
In a new paper published earlier this month by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , a group of NASA climatologists presented an economic model for the climate change that will take place this century , which measures the contributions of 13 specific industry sectors based on the unique portfolio of airborne chemicals each one emits .
It ’s well known that road transportation is doing the most damage , but researchers arrived at that conclusion by figuring out that cars produce few aerosols , which help mitigate the warming impact of the pollutants and greenhouse gases they produce .
Industry , by contrast , pumps a ton of aerosols into the environment , which actually have a cooling effect on the environment .
This positive impact of aerosols , which has factored into a number of previous climate - change models , is something of a Pyrrhic victory , however , since aerosols ’ deleterious impact on human and ecosystem health is well - established .
That ’s why much of the developing world has spent the last few decades trying to eliminate them in everything from hairspray to fire extinguishers .
As a result of that effort , by the year 2100 , industry will be hot on the heels of transportation in its overall contribution to warming .
However , by then , our thirst for electricity will have made power generation the head of the class when it comes to climate change , ahead of road transportation and industry .
We ’ve got dauntingly big problems , as the study shows , which makes it a bit depressing .
But better analysis of the specific patterns of human behavior that lead to those problems will , one hopes , make the solutions clearer .

UK security agency MI5 has issued a warning regarding freebie flash drives and cameras .
Apparently Chinese spies are handing them out to UK businessmen in hopes of infecting their computers with trojans and gaining access to corporate secrets .

Of course old - fashioned methods — sex and money — are still being used as well , but it seems that few people expect an innocent gadget gift to contain danger in the form of a trojan or malware .
After all , why else would a security agency 's 14 - page report be focusing on this espionage approach more than it did on other tricks ?
I guess it 's time for me to become a bit more paranoid about the pile of flash drives I picked up at CES .

I saw Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren interviewed by Wolf Blitzer on CNN Friday afternoon .
Oren said that Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had called for the annihilation of Israel , and was therefore speaking of genocide .
It is dreary to see this constant drumbeat of dishonest propaganda .
Whatever one thinks of Ahmadinejad or the Iranian regime , one should not misrepresent their statements , since that will lead to bad policy - making .
The Washington Post also wrote , “ Ahmadinejad , a Holocaust denier , spoke of Israel ’s eventual “ demise and annihilation ” .
In fact , Ahmadinejad never mentioned Israel as a country at all , and spoke only about what he called the ‘ Zionist regime . ’
He favors an admittedly odd form of the ‘ one state solution ’ in which Palestinians and at least some Jews would all vote for the same government .
So this is what Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said Thursday at a press conference in Damascus :
“ Iran , Syria , the Palestinian Resistance and Lebanon are ready to meet any conditions , and we hope that the enemies of the nations of the region will change their course and instead walk beside regional states in cooperation .
Insofar as the Zionist regime threatens Lebanon and Syria and prominent personalities of these two countries every day , it must accept its end and grant in their entirety the rights of the Palestinian nation . ”
That is , Ahmadinejad began by offering an olive branch to any former enemies that wanted to make peace .
But he characterized the ‘ Zionist regime , ’ i.e. the Israeli government with its current ideology , as intrinsically belligerent , and insisted that this ‘ regime ’ must ‘ accept its own end ’ and grant Palestinians their full rights ( presumably , citizenship and property rights , which they now lack ) .
Ahmadinejad seems to see Zionism as an ideology as essentially unwilling to allow Palestinian human rights , and so calls for it to acquiesce in its obsolescence .
Ahmadinejad did not mention Israel and did not call for any genocides , or anyone to be killed , or war .
He asked Zionists to see that their ideology has no future .
In the past he has compared his vision of the fall of what he calls the Zionist regime to the fall of the Soviet Union , which happened peacefully and with no annihilation of the population .
Personally , I see Zionism as just a garden variety form of modern romantic nationalism not different in any way from scores of other nationalisms ( including Arab nationalism , Serbian nationalism , and Iranian nationalism ) .
Zionism constructs Palestinian - Israelis as second - class citizens , and attempts to deny Palestinians in the Occupied Territories basic rights .
But other nationalisms are also guilty of exclusions , though there are unique aspects to the Zionist project .
Shiite - tinged Iranian nationalism insists that the head of state be a Shiite ayatollah and disallows Sunni Iranians , perhaps 10 - 15 % of the population , from serving even as elected president , and Sunni provinces such as Baluchistan are the most deprived of resources and services .
Only civic nationalism of the American and French varieties has universalistic aspirations , and even there it is flawed by a latent privileging of some groups within the nation ( Protestant whites in the US , secular - minded native - born French of Catholic extraction in France ) .
Ahmadinejad may be blinkered and hypocritical , but he did not call for the annihilation of or genocide against anyone .
Only committed Zionists would see a one - state solution as the ‘ annihilation ’ of Israel .
In any case , now that a two - state solution has been made virtually impossible by Israel ’s determined colonization of the West Bank , a one - state solution is the most likely outcome of what will probably be a 50 - year struggle for basic Palestinian rights to citizenship in a state .
The rest of us are going to be mightily inconvenienced by this unnecessary and stupid conflict , and the inconvenience will only be increased by equally stupid propaganda from unreliable narrators like Oren .

The Cleveland hills which surround my home town of Stockton on Tees , in the North East of England , are rich in Iron Ore .
For the past 170 years the hard working men of Teesside have extracted that raw material and turned into Steel which shipped around the world .
Teesside steel almost singlehandedly built the industrial revolution .
Wherever you are in the world , reading this , there is a very good chance the road bridges and train lines you take to work in the morning , or the skyscraper you work in or the car you drive , is made from Steel products made in the North East of England .
Today the last remaining smelt in Teesside closed with the loss of 1600 jobs .
It was the largest in Europe .
The closure of the Corus Steel plant in Redcar today will reverberate around the economy for decades to come .
With the lack of orders being sent out around the world the Middlesbrough ship yards are probably next to go , followed by what remains of the chemical plants which also line the coast , which once formed part of one of the largest industrial complexes in the world .
The UK government has had months to negotiate with the Corus parent company Tata to keep the plant open .
Raw materials being the biggest cost in making Steel made the Teesside plant ’s close proximity to the Cleveland Hills one of the most competitive in the world .
But a 10 year contract to supply Steel was cancelled when the global economy went into nose dive .
Instead of seeking recompense for this in the courts , which might have forced some of the customers who originally cancelled those orders to reconsider , Peter Mandleson and the 5 constituency MP’s who represent workers from the plant , sat around doing precisely nothing .
As recently as the day before closure , the entire cabinet were in Durham .
None of them had the decency to attend the recording of BBC Question Time which was presented from Middlesbrough town hall and attended by the men whose jobs are affected by their lack of ability to govern the UK properly .
None of them could face the people of this part of the world who put the Labour government in power , to answer the basic question of how they can justify pouring literally billions of pounds into the pockets of their banker friends in the City of London , while a tiny fraction of the cost of bailing out Lloyds , RBS and Northern Rock would have kept open one of the few remaining businesses in the whole of the UK that still actually makes something to be proud of .
I am 37 years old .
The first time I was old enough to vote in a general election , the Labour Party leader was Neil Kinnock .
The day of the 1992 General Election , Rupert Murdoch ’s Sun news paper ran a front page headline saying , “ If Kinnock wins today would the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights ” .
John Major won the election and continued a campaign of closures — affecting the mining and industrial manufacturing industry all around the UK — which were begun in the late 1970s by his predecessor Margaret Thatcher .
One of the hardest hit regions in this series of closures was the North East of England .
But the Steel works remain unaffected , such was the quality of the product they produced at the competitive rate at which they produced it — but it was no easy survival and closure always loomed on the horizon and when the state of the UK economy under Gordon Brown began to make it increasingly cheeper for customers to source Steel in China and India the writing was on the wall .
In 1997 , when Tony Blair ’s New Labour Party broke the Tory ’s winning streak , almost everyone believed that Labour would put in place a long term strategy for rejuvenating the parts of the economy which 18 years of Conservative mismanagement had destroyed .
Britain had gone from being one of the largest manufacturing economies in the world to a bankrupt and dejected mess .
Both Blair and his successor Gordon Brown failed to do that — in fact they made it 10 times worse .
At some point in the next few weeks the British people will find out the date of the next General Election .
I sincerely hope that when the results of that poll are known , not a single MP from this region is returned to the House of Commons .
They all deserve to lose their jobs just as the men and women of Teesside , who have traditionally supported the Labour movement , no matter how it is rebranded and spun , have lost their belief in on - the - take bastard politicians .
Unfortunately the nature of democracy means that someone has to win in place of these Labour candidates and for the most part this is almost certainly bound to be MPs from the very same Conservative Party who presided over the slow decline in UK manufacturing in the first place .
But we have to remain optimistic that the man who would be our next Prime Minister , David Cameron , despite his rich boy background and his private school boy chums in the city , is n’t entirely cold hearted .
We have to hope that he saw the faces of the people who lined the streets of Redcar today , to pipe the last post for the men ending the last ever shift at the Corus Steel Plant .
Their tireless , but ultimately doomed attempts to save not just their jobs but the legacy of this region was a heartbreaking site to see and they have no - one to blame but the Labour government .

The leader of Carmarthenshire council has called for drugs to be legalised .
Meryl Gravell OBE said she despaired of the number of deaths in Llanelli - the largest town in the county - attributed to heroin .
She said she wanted a debate over future drugs policy , although said she did not have " all the answers " .
Her comments echo calls made previously by the ex-chief constable of North Wales Police , Richard Brunstrom , although he was criticised by some .
Ms Gravell , who is an independent councillor for the village of Trimsaran , made her initial comments in an interview with the Llanelli Star newspaper .
In a statement issued on Friday she said : " My intention was to generate debate and get people talking about the dangers of drugs and problems associated with them .
" I have certainly done that , and I am pleased that my remarks have made people think about what more we should be doing to tackle this problem .
" I want to make it clear that I do not condone using drugs - and I do not think they should be freely available to all .
' Pain and destruction ' " But by having legalised control , it would stop drug dealers profiting , it would stop addicts committing crimes to feed their habits , it would give addicts access to support and services and be safer for them .
" I am not saying I have all the answers , I certainly do n't , but something needs to be done , and whether or not people agree with my views I am glad that we are now talking about it and raising awareness of the issue .
" Drugs have destroyed many peoples ' lives and torn families apart , if me speaking out can lead to any kind of change which would save one person from that pain and destruction it is worth it . "
Mr Brunstrom had called for all drugs to be legalised for many years before retiring as chief constable of North Wales Police last year .
But his views were criticised by some politicians who said his views were " dangerous " and " a more considered " approach was needed .

Celebrities are n't the only ones giving their babies unusual names .
Compared with decades ago , parents are choosing less common names for kids , which could suggest an emphasis on uniqueness and individualism , according to new research .
Essentially , today 's kids ( and later adults ) will stand out from classmates .
For instance , in the 1950s , the average first - grade class of 30 children would have had at least one boy named James ( top name in 1950 ) , while in 2013 , six classes will be necessary to find only one Jacob , even though that was the most common boys ' name in 2007 .
The researchers suspect the uptick of unusual baby names could be a sign of a change in culture from one that applauded fitting in to today 's emphasis on being unique and standing out .
When taken too far , however , this individualism could also lead to narcissism , according to study researcher Jean Twenge , of San Diego State University .
Baby naming history
The results come from an analysis of 325 million baby names recorded by the Social Security Administration from 1880 to 2007 .
The research team figured out the percentage of babies given the most popular name or a name among the 10 , 20 , or 50 most popular for that year and sex .
Since it was n't required that people get a social security card until 1937 , names before that time may not be random samples of the population , the researchers note .
Results showed parents were less likely to choose those popular names as time went on .
For instance , in the late 1800s and early 1900s , about 5 percent of babies were named the top common name , while more recently that dropped to 1 percent .
About 40 percent of boys received one of the 10 most common names in the 1880s , while now fewer than 10 percent do .
For girls , the percentage with a top - 10 name dropped from 25 percent in about 1945 to 8 percent in 2007 .
Similar results were seen for the top - 50 names .
About half of girls received one of the 50 most popular names until the mid-20th century .
Now , just one in four have these names .
( A list of top - 10 baby names by year , and their popularity , can be found here . )
This trend in baby - naming did n't show a constant decrease .
Between 1880 and 1919 , fewer parents were giving their children common names , though from 1920 to the 1940s common names were used more often than before .
Then , when baby boomers came on the scene , so did more unusual names .
The biggest decrease in usage of common names came in the 1990s , said Twenge , who is also an author of " The Narcissism Epidemic : Living in the Age of Entitlement " ( Free Press , 2009 ) and " Generation Me : Why Today 's Young Americans Are More Confident , Assertive , Entitled – and More Miserable Than Ever Before " ( Free Press , 2007 ) .
Naming narcissists
The results held even when the researchers accounted for immigration rates and increasing Latino populations , which could bring relatively less common names into the mix .
" The most compelling explanation left is this idea that parents are much more focused on their children standing out , " Twenge told LiveScience .
" There 's been this cultural shift toward focusing on the individual , toward standing out and being unique as opposed to fitting in with the group and following the rules . "
The positive side of individualism , Twenge said , is that there is less prejudice and more tolerance for minority groups .
But she warns that when individualism is taken too far , the result is narcissism .
" I think it is an indication of our culture becoming more narcissistic , " Twenge said .
Past research has shown that back in the 1950s parents placed a lot of importance on a child being obedient , which has gone way down .
" Parenting has become more permissive and more child - focused and [ parents ] are much more reluctant to be authority figures , " Twenge said .
As for whether these unusually named kids will have personalities to match is not known .
" It remains to be seen whether having a unique name necessarily leads to narcissism later in life , " Twenge said .
" If that unique name is part of a parent 's overall philosophy that their child is special and needs to stand out and that fitting in is a bad thing , then that could lead to those personality traits . "
The research , which is detailed in the January issue of the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science , also included Emodish M. Abebe of SDSU and W. Keith Campbell of the University of Georgia in Athens .
Let Europe Be Europe
Over the course of the disastrous 20th century , inhabitants of the liberal democratic world in ever - increasing numbers reached this conclusion :
War does n’t pay and usually does n’t work .
As recounted by historian James J. Sheehan in his excellent book , Where Have All the Soldiers Gone ? , the countries possessing the greatest capability to employ force to further their political aims lost their enthusiasm for doing so .
Over time , they turned away from war .
Of course , there were lingering exceptions .
The United States and Israel have remained adamant in their determination to harness war and demonstrate its utility .
Europe , however , is another matter .
By the dawn of this century , Europeans had long since lost their stomach for battle .
The change was not simply political .
It was profoundly cultural .
The cradle of Western civilization — and incubator of ambitions that drenched the contemporary age in blood — had become thoroughly debellicized .
As a consequence , however willing they are to spend money updating military museums or maintaining war memorials , present - day Europeans have become altogether stingy when it comes to raising and equipping fighting armies .
This pacification of Europe is quite likely to prove irreversible .
Yet even if reigniting an affinity for war among the people of , say , Germany and France were possible , why would any sane person even try ?
Why not allow Europeans to busy themselves with their never - ending European unification project ?
It keeps them out of mischief .
Washington , however , finds it difficult to accept this extraordinary gift — purchased in part through the sacrifices of U.S. soldiers — of a Europe that has laid down its arms .
Instead , successive U.S. administrations have pushed , prodded , cajoled , and browbeaten European democracies to shoulder a heavier share of responsibility for maintaining world order and enforcing liberal norms .
In concrete terms , this attempt to reignite Europe ’s martial spirit has found expression in the attempted conversion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) from a defensive alliance into an instrument of power projection .
Washington ’s aim is this : take a Cold War - inspired organization designed to keep the Germans down , the Russians out , and the Americans in , and transform it into a post - Cold War arrangement in which Europe will help underwrite American globalism without , of course , being permitted any notable say regarding U.S. policy .
The allies have not proven accommodating .
True , NATO has gotten bigger — there were 16 member states 20 years ago , 28 today — but growth has come at the expense of cohesion .
Once an organization that possessed considerable capability , NATO today resembles a club that just about anyone can join , including , most recently , such military powerhouses as Albania and Croatia .
A club with lax entrance requirements is unlikely to inspire respect even from its own members .
NATO ’s agreed - upon target for defense spending , for example , is a paltry 2 percent of GDP .
Last year , aside from the United States , exactly four member states met that goal .
The Supreme Allied Commander in Europe — today , as always , a U.S. general — still presides in splendor over NATO ’s military headquarters in Belgium .
Yet SACEUR wields about as much clout as the president of a decent - sized university .
He is not a commander .
He is a supplicant .
SACEUR ’s impressive title , a relic of World War II , is merely an honorific , akin to calling Elvis the King or Bruce the Boss .
Afghanistan provides the most important leading indicator of where Washington ’s attempt to nurture a muscle - flexing new NATO is heading ; it is the decisive test of whether the alliance can handle large - scale , out - of - area missions .
And after eight years , the results have been disappointing .
Complaints about the courage and commitment of NATO soldiers have been few .
Complaints about their limited numbers and the inadequacy of their kit have been legion .
An immense complicating factor has been the tendency of national governments to impose restrictions on where and how their forces are permitted to operate .
The result has been dysfunction .
When Gen. Stanley McChrystal ’s famous assessment of the situation in Afghanistan leaked to the media last year , most observers focused on his call for additional U.S. troops .
Yet the report was also a scathing demand for change in NATO ’s International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) .
" ISAF will change its operating culture ….
ISAF will change the way it does business , " he wrote .
" ISAF ’s subordinate headquarters must stop fighting separate campaigns . "
The U.S. general found just about nothing in ISAF ’s performance to commend .
But McChrystal ’s prospects for fixing ISAF run headlong into two stubborn facts .
First , European governments prioritize social welfare over all other considerations — including funding their armed forces .
Second , European governments have an exceedingly limited appetite for casualties .
So the tepid , condition - laden European response to McChrystal ’s call for reinforcements — a couple of battalions here , a few dozen trainers there , some creative bookkeeping to count units that deployed months ago as fresh arrivals — is hardly surprising .
This does n’t mean that NATO is without value .
It does suggest that relying on the alliance to sustain a protracted counterinsurgency aimed at dragging Afghans kicking and screaming into modernity makes about as much sense as expecting the " war on drugs " to curb the world ’s appetite for various banned substances .
It ’s not going to happen .
If NATO has a future , it will find that future back where the alliance began : in Europe .
NATO ’s founding mission of guaranteeing the security of European democracies has lost none of its relevance .
Although the Soviet threat has vanished , Russia remains .
And Russia , even if no longer a military superpower , does not exactly qualify as a status quo country .
The Kremlin nurses grudges and complaints , not least of them stemming from NATO ’s own steady expansion eastward .
So let NATO attend to this new ( or residual ) Russian problem .
Present - day Europeans — even Europeans with a pronounced aversion to war — are fully capable of mounting the defenses necessary to deflect a much reduced Eastern threat .
So why not have the citizens of France and Germany guarantee the territorial integrity of Poland and Lithuania , instead of fruitlessly demanding that Europeans take on responsibilities on the other side of the world that they ca n’t and wo n’t ?
Like Nixon setting out for Beijing , like Sadat flying to Jerusalem , like Reagan deciding that Gorbachev was cut from a different cloth , the United States should dare to do the unthinkable : allow NATO to devolve into a European organization , directed by Europeans to serve European needs , upholding the safety and well - being of a Europe that is whole and free — and more than able to manage its own affairs .
As with Nixon and Sadat and Reagan , once the deed is done everyone will ask :
Why did n’t we think of that sooner ?
When the notoriously hard - driving talent manager Helen Kushnick died Aug. 28 after a nine - year battle with breast cancer , she had lost almost everything : her son , Sam , who died of an HIV - tainted blood transfusion in 1983 when he was 3 ; her husband , who died of cancer in 1989 ; her career , which ended when she was fired after four months as executive producer of The Tonight Show in 1992 ; and her close , almost symbiotic , 17 - year relationship with Jay Leno .
Kushnick ’s story is well - known to those who follow the late - night TV wars .
She was portrayed as an abusive tyrant in The Late Shift , Bill Carter ’s 1994 book about Leno and Letterman , and in last February ’s HBO movie ; and the image was no exaggeration .
In the end , many who had been her supporters , like former client Jimmie Walker , and even NBC executives , found her impossible to deal with .
Her stepdaughter , Beth Kushnick , 35 , still calls her a ” ghastly monster . ”
Even her only sibling , Joseph Gorman , 48 , had been estranged from her until shortly before her death at age 51 .
But what is not so well - known is the story of Kushnick ’s final years — years spent out of the media eye , years that ended in a kind of redemption and , for her daughter , Sara , 16 , in a reconciliation with Leno .
” Maybe she did have to be a bitch to get where she did , ” says Sara , Sam ’s surviving twin .
” But when she started out , women were supposed to be secretaries .
She did things with anger because it was the only way she knew how . ”
” They called her a bitch , ” says Mitzi Shore , owner of L.A. ’s Comedy Store , ” but if she were a man , she would n’t be called a bitch .
There are managers in town who are 10 times worse than she was and they do n’t call them bastards . ”
At one time , Kushnick could have been viewed as an inspiration for women in Hollywood .
The daughter of a truck driver and a housewife , Kushnick broke into the entertainment industry in her early 20s as a secretary at Twentieth Century Fox .
After moving from New York to L.A. , she teamed up with — and eventually married — entertainment lawyer Jerrold Kushnick ; they thrived as the managers of ’ 70s stars like Walker , Ben Vereen , and the then unknown Leno .
But as Kushnick became focused on Leno ’s career , pushing him to the ultimate prize — host of The Tonight Show — her lifelong temper grew worse .
” She could go ballistic in a matter of seconds , ” says Gorman , her brother .
Installed as executive producer of The Tonight Show in 1992 , she routinely bullied staffers , played hardball for star bookings , and alienated network executives with her frequent tirades .
Leno says he put up with Kushnick in part because of her string of personal tragedies .
” I was the client who stayed the longest , but it just got crazier and crazier , ” he says .
” Helen had so much success — but it just seemed to make her worse . ”
If you 're small and on a search , I 've got a feeder for you to perch on .

11/12/2012- A MESSAGE FROM BOBBY , JR . :
Well , not a message directly from his mouth , because , you know , he 's a dog , but an update , anyway .
Bobby , Jr , the EELS ' talented singing dog , is often called " the sixth EEL " because of his constant companionship and inspiration to all EELS projects .
Many EELS fans were aghast and voiced displeasure when a photo recently surfaced of EELS leader E looking very cozy with a kitten .
But there is no need for concern .
The kitten was merely a visitor that day and Bobby , Jr. is alive , well and feeling both wonderful AND glorious .
Bobby , now age 10 , did go through a major health scare recently that resulted in him having to endure spinal surgery that left his freak - show , low rider , backwards - legged body looking like Frankenweenie just in time for Halloween , but we 're happy to report that he has bounced back and is walking , running and chasing squirrels like the Bobby , Jr. of 9 years ago , and he was present for the entire recording of the new WONDERFUL , GLORIOUS EELS album .
" A kitten ? , " says E , " No kitten can take the place of Bobby , Jr . No one will ever take the place of Bobby , Jr. in my heart . "
See Bobby , Jr. resting between ping pong matches HERE and re-visit his stunning performance on " Last Time We Spoke " from BLINKING LIGHTS AND OTHER REVELATIONS HERE , and watch one of his finest video performances HERE .

Howard Zinn , the author of " A People 's History of the United States " and several other books , has died .
The Boston Herald reports he suffered a heart attack today in Santa Monica .
Zinn was 87 .
Zinn , a longtime professor at Boston University , was known for his left - wing politics .
Born in New York , Zinn served in the Army Air Forces during World War II , where he became a second lieutenant .
He attended New York University on the GI bill after the war , enrolling as a 27 - year - old freshman ; he did his postgraduate work at Columbia .
As a young professor , he became a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War .
He published books on the Vietnam War , as well as other books on history and American society .
But it was his 1980 book " A People 's History of the United States " and its follow - up , " Voices of a People 's History of the United States , " that made him required reading .
Literally -- " A People 's History of the United States " presented American history from alternative perspectives , including native peoples , slaves , disenfranchised workers , farmers and women .
Zinn 's works remain in print ; a new edition of " Voices of a People 's History of the United States " came out in November , and a revised edition of " A People 's History of the United States " is set to be published in July .

Avast , ye scurvy dogs !
The Oscar nominees were announced yesterday , which means it ’s time again to revisit the eternal war between the MPAA and Internet movie pirates .
I ’ve updated my spreadsheet with all the current available data , eight years of data tracking the online distribution of every Oscar - nominated film since 2003 .
I ’ve added this year ’s 34 nominated films to the list , a total of 245 films .
( Read about my methodology at the end of the entry . )
View or download all the data below , including a second sheet with some interesting aggregate statistics .
As always , I ’ll keep it updated until the Oscar broadcast .
( And let me know if you find any mistakes . )
View full - size on Google Spreadsheets .
Download : Excel ( with formulas ) or CSV
Findings
Since 2003 , I ’ve tracked the online distribution of Oscar screeners , and every year , the piracy scene manages to release nearly every film by nomination day .
Last year , all but three films were leaked in DVD quality by nomination day .
The tide may be turning .
There ’s still a month out before the Academy Awards , but so far , fewer Oscar screeners leaked online this year — only 14 out of 34 nominated films , the lowest percentage ever .
And they ’re taking twice as long to leak — a median 21 days after theatrical release , up from 11 days the previous year .
It ’s not limited to screeners , either .
Camcorder and telesync releases dropped this year .
Even the percentage of retail DVD rips has dropped , though this will likely shift before the broadcast .
In the chart below , you can see the percentage of films that were released in each format .
( For example , 21 % of this year ’s films had a cam release and 44 % had a retail DVD leak . )
And the R5 DVD releases that dominated previous year ’s Oscars is now mostly dead .
I ’m guessing the studios are moving away from the early distribution of R5 DVDs entirely .
But why the shift this year ?
Are studios doing a better job protecting screeners and intimidating Academy members ?
Or was this year ’s crop of films too boring for pirates to bother with ?
I ca n’t tell if this is a scene - wide trend or localized to the Oscars only .
If you have access to historical data tracking scene releases , get in touch .
And if you have any theories or inside information , leave a comment .
Other fun facts :
Academy members received screeners for 30 of the 34 nominated films .
The Avatar screener was the last to be received by Academy members ( Ken Rudolph received his on January 15 ) .
Amazingly , it has n’t leaked online yet .
February 4 : It leaked today .
It leaked today .
The Hurt Locker and The Young Victoria were both leaked online in DVD format over six months before their theatrical release .
As far as I can tell , The Secret of Kells is the first film since I started tracking to be nominated without a U.S. theatrical release .
It ’s currently slated to come out in March .
Methodology
As usual , I included the feature films in every category except documentary and foreign films ( even makeup and costume design ) .
I used Yahoo !
Movies for US release dates , always using the first available date , even if it was a limited release .
Cam , telesync , R5 , and screener leak dates were taken from VCD Quality .
I used the first leak date , with the exception of unviewable or incomplete nuked releases .
Finally , the official screener dates came from Academy member Ken Rudolph , who lists the date he receives every screener on his personal homepage .
Thanks again , Ken !

A BERLIN burglar 's break - in took an unexpected turn when he stumbled upon a corpse and felt compelled to call the police .
" He called to say he'd just broken into a flat and found a dead body , " said a spokeswoman for Berlin police Thursday .
" He gave the address of the place and then hung up . "
Officers discovered the 64 - year - old resident of the flat dead in his bedroom .
The man had passed away about two weeks ago , and authorities are not treating the death as suspicious .
The burglar has not been heard of since .
Local media said he fled the apartment empty - handed , but police could not confirm this .
GA144 144- computer Chip
The chip measures 4.7 x 4.5 mm in a 180 nm process .
That size was chosen because it is the largest chip we can presently package in the 10x10 mm QFN - 88 .
104 pads border the chip ( 16 ground pads connect to the exposed die attach paddle ; 16 power pads and 72 signal pads connect to the 88 pins on the edges of the package ) and 8 rows of 18 computers fit inside .
Low power results from our computer ( one node of an array ) being asynchronous ( unclocked ) .
Low energy results when each of the 144 computers is executing instructions only when it actually has something to do .
Spec sheets will be forthcoming .
Meanwhile this list of features should prove impressive .
Bill Muench composed a handy poster with much info .
GA144 has 88 pins .
Pins are numbered counter - clockwise from upper left .
18 pins for RAM data : 1 2 3 8 9 10 11 12 13 16 21 22 23 24 25 30 31 32

22 of the edge computers have one or more I/O pins , with specialized ROM ; six of these are capable of being used to boot the chip after reset .
The 96 interior computers , and the 26 edge computers that do n't have I/O pins , all have the same ROM with five exceptions noted below .
Any of the 144 computers may be used as compute engines , as wires to pass messages , or simply left fallow with minimal power leakage ; the 22 edge computers with I/O pins are assigned nominal functions based on their ROM and I /O pads .

Cleaving Computer Science : A Time for New Degrees
February 14 , 2010 at 4:06 pm
The former Dean of the College of Computing at Georgia Tech , Rich DeMillo , established three schools within the College .
I ’m not really sure how he came to decide these three groupings .
I am finding them useful for understanding the tensions in defining computer science today ( perhaps the “ malaise ” in Beki ’s blog post ) .
The School of Computer Science ( SCS ) is focused on the traditional definition of computer science .
It looks inward , into improving the computer and how it functions .
Systems , networking , programming languages , theory , and compilers go here .
Software engineering goes here , though flavors of it could go elsewhere .
The School of Interactive Computing ( IC ) looks at the boundary between the computer and everything else .
It includes human - computer interaction , learning sciences & technologies , computational journalism , and computing education research ( where humans are the “ everything else ” ) , and also includes robotics , computational photography , and vision ( where “ everything else ” is literally the world ) .
Intelligent systems and graphics go here , for using humans as the model for intelligence and form , but versios of each could go elsewhere .
The Division ( soon to be School ) of Computational Science and Engineering ( CSE ) focuses on the application of computing for advancing science and engineering .
This was the most innovative of the three .
Rich once told me that he wanted this School to provide an academic home for an important field that was n’t finding one elsewhere .
Computer science departments often do n’t tenure computational science researchers because their work may not necessarily invent new computer science , and science departments do n’t tenure scientists just for being code monkeys .
This area is too important to leave adrift .
I admit that I ’m a man with a hammer .
I see these three groupings at the various colleges and universities I visit , as the three competing images for what is computer science .
SCS faculty have history on their side — their view of computing is roughly what was defined in the computing curricula reports from 1968 onward .
( I do wonder if those early curricular reports may have defined CS for education too soon , before we really knew what would be important as computing evolved . )
IC faculty have modern day relevance on their side — much of the exciting new computing work that gets picked up in the press from this group .
Here in the College of Computing , these sides tussle over the shared ownership of our MS and PhD degrees in computer science .
( We do n’t argue so much about the BS in CS because Threads provides enough flexibility to cover a wide range of definitions . )
Do graduate students have to take a course in Systems ?
In Theory ?
Are n’t these “ core ” to what is Computer Science ?
And what is “ Computer Science ” anyway ?
Does ( or should ) the School of “ Computer Science ” have a particularly strong say in the matter ?
In the latest issue of Communications of the ACM , Dennis Groth and Jeffrey Mackie - Mason argue that we need “ informatics ” degrees as something separate than a computer science degree .
When they list informatics academic units , they include my IC School .
They define “ informatics is a discipline that solves problems through the application of computing or computation , in he context of the domain of the problem . ”
That ’s close enough to my “ computing at the boundary with everything else . ”
They are arguing that we can make greater advances in informatics by splitting those degrees off from computer science .
As we tussle over the name and identity of “ Computer Science , ” I increasingly value Dennis and Jeffrey ’s point .
I can see that IC and CS may be different bodies of knowledge .
Computer science students ought to know about RISC processors and assembly language .
Students in IC must understand and be able to use empirical methods , especially social science methods like interviews and surveys ( e.g. , how to put them together well , how to avoid bias in creating them and evaluating the results ) .
These methods are necessary to listen to someone else , figure out their problem , and then later , figure out how the technology solves ( or at least , impacts ) the problem .
When I look at IC - related professionals and researchers , I see few that use knowledge of RISC processors and assembly language in their work .
The empirical , social science methods do n’t fit well into CS .
I was on the committee that wrote the ACM / IEEE Computing Curriculum 2008 Update , and in particular , I was in charge of the HCI section .
We had to gut much of what SIGCHI felt was absolutely critical for students to know about working with humans ( and which I agreed with ) because we simply could n’t cram more into a CS student ’s four years .
IC and CS have a significant overlap , but there is a lot in each that is not in the intersection .
We tussle over these degrees and names because , in part , we fear creating a new name .
We worry that students wo n’t be interested in a degree from computing that ’s not named “ computer science . ”
IC co-owns our BS in Computational Media ( about 300 students , ~ 25 % female , placing students at places like Electronic Arts and Pixar ) and a PhD in Human - Centered Computing ( one of the few PhD programs in a computing school that is over 50 % female ) .
Students are willing to take a gamble , and we ’ll draw on a different demographic of students .
I ’ve not said much here about CSE yet , but that ’s because it ’s not big enough to tussle yet .
Recently , I got to interview students and teachers in interdisciplinary computational science classes .
These classes do n’t really work for CS ( or IC ) students .
The computer science being used is too simple for them ( so they ’re bored while the science students come up to speed ) , but the science is way harder than they can just jump into .
For CS students to succeed in CSE classes , they need to take a bunch of science classes to understand how real scientists are using scientific computing .
We run into the same problem as squeezing the important parts of HCI into CS — we run out of room .
As CSE grows in numbers and importance , we will eventually find that it does n’t fit into IC or CS , either .
By separating the fields , we encourage greater research advances through tighter focus , and we create better , clearer opportunities for student learning by removing the unnecessary and spending more time on the necessary .

The hot workout is getting more and more popular these days .
It is nothing but the workout done in a [ … ]
STOCKHOLM ( Reuters ) - Iceland is now staring at twin crises , one economic and the other political , after it failed to strike a new deal on repaying debts to Britain and the Netherlands .
As long as the so - called Icesave dispute hangs over the island , it can expect the economy to be starved of cash .
Add to that the chance of political instability as the government has to take responsibility for a mess which will leave Icelandic taxpayers with a huge bill for years to come .
“ Nobody dares invest anything in Iceland until this issue is resolved , ” said Danske Bank senior analyst Lars Christensen .
Talks collapsed this week on a new deal to replace one agreed late last year , which proved to be deeply unpopular on the island .
Britain and the Netherlands say Iceland owes them more than $ 5 billion after they compensated savers who lost money in Icelandic “ Icesave ” deposit accounts .
A referendum has been scheduled for March 6 on the old accord , and it is expected to be soundly rejected .
Angry Icelanders believe the terms are unduly harsh .
Had a new agreement been forged , Reykjavik might have been able to get financial aid flowing again .
But now , Iceland will be unable to prop up its sagging economy , which contracted around 7.7 percent last year and is likely to shrink again this year .
In the longer term , Iceland faces the risk of default on its foreign debt , the bulk of which falls due in 2011 , extending the country ’s exclusion from overseas financial markets and prolonging the current recession .
“ If this is not solved by then ( 2011 ) the risk of default would increase , but that ’s a long time from now , ” said Mats Olausson , chief emerging markets strategist at Swedish bank SEB .
Iceland ’s banking system and currency collapsed in late 2008 , plunging the country into recession and leaving it dependent on international aid .
Repeated attempts to solve the spat with the British and the Dutch have failed and foreign capital has dried up as a result .
Rating agencies have already downgraded Iceland ’s foreign currency rating sharply and Moody ’s Investors Service warned on Friday that Iceland ’s ratings were under pressure following the breakdown of talks .
Fitch already rates Iceland paper as “ junk . ”
Foreign currency borrowing totals around 355 billion crowns ( $ 2.78 billion ) , according to the central bank ’s website , though this does not include the debt to Britain and the Netherlands , nor money from the IMF aid package .
BLAME GAME
Icelandic Prime Minister Johanna Sigurdardottir held out hope on Friday that a deal might still be reached .
But time is running out ahead of the referendum .
Analysts say that vote could bring down Iceland ’s ruling coalition , sparking a political crisis .
“ If there is a ‘ no ’ vote on March 6 , it ’s not a necessity that the government would step down , but their position would be seriously damaged .
And I do n’t think there is an immediately viable alternative , ” SEB ’s Olausson said .
The largest opposition group , the Independence party , is widely blamed for the 2008 crash , while the popularity of the Social Democrats and Left - Green government has taken a beating over the handling of the Icesave issue .
Political uncertainty is also rife in Britain and the Netherlands .
The Dutch government collapsed last week and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown is widely expected to lose a general election to be held before June .
Despite all the difficulties , however , analysts expect a deal to be reached before Iceland runs out of cash .
Britain and the Netherlands want their money and are sensitive to accusations of bullying .
For Iceland , a new deal is a must , though it is likely to be a bitter pill to swallow whatever the final terms .
“ There is only one way forward for Iceland here , and that ’s extreme austerity , ” Danske ’s Christensen said .
Britain has already warned the country it faces financial isolation unless it accepts its Icesave responsibilities .
What a deal would acceptable to all three would look like , however , no one knows .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidGOP senators confident Trump pick to be confirmed by November Durbin : Democrats can ' slow ' Supreme Court confirmation ' perhaps a matter of hours , maybe days at most ' Supreme Court fight pushes Senate toward brink MORE ( D - Nev. ) lacks the votes to begin debating his targeted jobs bill , according to sources monitoring the legislation .
Reid needs 60 votes to open debate on the $ 15 billion jobs bill .
The vote is scheduled for Monday , when lawmakers return from the Presidents Day recess .

“ I understand Reid does not have the votes for cloture on Monday on his jobs bill , ” one source said .
A Reid spokesman said the vote is in the hands of Republicans .
Democrats have 59 senators in their conference .
“ It all depends on what Republicans do , ” said Jim Manley , a Reid spokesman .
Reid scaled back an $ 85 billion jobs bill created by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus Max Sieben BaucusBottom line Bottom line The Hill 's Morning Report - Presented by Facebook - George Floyd 's death sparks protests , National Guard activation MORE ( D - Mont . ) and ranking Republican Chuck Grassley Charles ( Chuck ) Ernest GrassleyGOP seeks to redirect criticism over Trump tax returns Grassley says disclosing Trump 's tax records without authorization could violate law Supreme Court nominee gives no clues in GOP meeting MORE ( Iowa ) to focus on a narrower package of tax cuts and infrastructure spending .
But since he announced his smaller jobs bill , it has been under siege by Republicans and Democrats alike .
Absent political arm - twisting by Senate leaders to bring their rank - and - file in line , opposition to the bill is expected to be bipartisan , sources said .
Democratic Sen. Blanche Lincoln ( Ark. ) called on Reid to “ reconsider ” the move and urged him to move the Baucus - Grassley bipartisan proposal .
“ I hope the majority leader will reconsider , ” Lincoln said in prepared remarks .
“ This bill was carefully crafted to achieve significant bipartisan support and contains several important measures to spur business growth and encourage new hires . ”
The centerpiece to Reid ’s bill is a $ 13 billion tax credit employers can claim for hiring employees who have been out of work for more than 60 days .
But not all Democratic senators support the initiative .
Sen . Ben Nelson ( D - Neb. ) has raised the concern that a shortage in customer demand could render the tax break useless .
“ There ’s a question of whether that puts the cart before the horse , ” said Nelson .
“ If I do n’t have enough customers for my product , hiring more people is not going to help and tax credits are not going to be to my advantage . ”
Sen . Tom Harkin Thomas ( Tom ) Richard HarkinThe Memo : Trump attacks on Harris risk backfiring Ernst challenges Greenfield to six debates in Iowa Senate race Biden unveils disability rights plan : ' Your voices must be heard ' MORE ( D - Iowa ) , chairman of the Senate Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ( HELP ) Committee , has noted the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate that extending unemployment insurance would create more jobs than providing tax credits to employers who hire new workers .
A spokeswoman for the majority leader said her boss would extend unemployment insurance before its expiration by the end of the month .
Lobbyists see this as the best vehicle for advancing many of the provisions in the Baucus - Grassley jobs proposal put aside by Reid .
Finance leaders included in their measure $ 31 billion in extensions of expiring tax provisions , including the research and development tax credit that is widely used by businesses .
The Information Technology Industry Council sent a letter to Reid on Wednesday urging passage on this and other expiring provisions .
“ At a time when creating and protecting jobs is critically important , extending these already expired tax provisions will help preserve and promote high - tech employment in the U.S. and help level the playing field for U.S. companies competing abroad , ” wrote ITIC president and CEO Dean Garfield .
“ We urge you to include this broadly supported , bipartisan legislation as you consider meaningful pro-growth legislation . ”
The extender package also resuscitates biodiesel tax credits whose expiration the National Biodiesel Board says has caused 29,000 jobs to be lost since the provision lapsed on Jan.
1 .
“ The biodiesel tax credit in the [ Baucus - Grassley ] jobs bill is the only option being considered that will guarantee that workers can be put back to work the day after it is signed into law , ” said Dan Farney , an Illinois Soybean Association farmer , in prepared remarks .
“ Illinois biodiesel plants are laying off more green - collar employees every day that the tax credit is allowed to go unsigned .
This just adds to our nation 's and state 's unemployment problems . ”
Grassley ’s state has been negatively affected by the tax credit ’s expiration .
On Tuesday the Iowa Republican condemned Reid for striking extenders from his jobs bill for political gain .
“ The industry is hemorrhaging jobs and we can do something to stop it , ” Grassley told reporters .
“ Yet Sen .
Reid decided that it was more important to play political games than actually saving and creating jobs in the private sector . ”

Cauliflower and Caramelized Onion Tart
Adapted from Bon Appetit , March 2007
This tart is lush , luxe and lovely .
Sure , we had it for a Thursday night dinner with the largest and hopefully most artery - clearing pile of salad greens , ever , but something about it seems even better suited for a Ladies Lunch , a brunch or a shower of some sort .
I think it ’s the truffles .
Or the two types of cream .
Or the three types of cheese .
Or the 30 - minute caramelized onions .
But should you , would you on a Thursday night while watching 30 Rock and The Office grrWinterOlympics , it is somehow even more welcome , out of place in the best of ways .
I made a slew of changes , from long notes expounding on my innermost feelings about truffle oil ( at the end , in case you were at the edge of your seat ) to smaller adjustments ( more oil for the roasted cauliflower , so it does n’t stick , as mine always does with less ; less parmesan ; a homemade crust if you ’re feeling it ; and the insistence that black pepper is equally welcome as white in this dish ; a couple adjusted cooking times ) but found the recipe , at its base , to be a delight .
Yields 8 servings
1 small head of cauliflower ( about 1 pound ) or 1 pound of a larger head of cauliflower , cut into 1 - inch flowerets ( Romanesco cauliflower , especially orange or green , would be a pretty substitute )
3 1/2 tablespoons olive oil
1 tablespoon truffle oil or a few pinches of truffle salt ( optional ) ( see Notes below )
1 refrigerated pie crust or a homemade tart shell ( recipe below )
1 large onion , halved lenghtwise and thinly sliced
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
2 large eggs
1 ( 7 - to 8 - ounce ) container mascarpone cheese ( see Note below for suggested substitutions )
1/2 cup whipping cream ( although any low - or full - fat milk or light cream will work as well )
1/4 teaspoon ground white or black pepper
Pinch of ground nutmeg
1 cup grated Gruyère cheese ( Swiss or Comté are great swaps )
1/3 cup Parmesan cheese
Position rack in center of oven and preheat oven to 425 °F .
Toss cauliflower with 2 tablespoons olive oil in large bowl .
Spread on rimmed baking sheet , sprinkle with salt and pepper and roast 15 minutes before turning florets over and roasting until brown and tender , another 15 minutes in my oven , 25 minutes according to the original recipe .
Cool cauliflower then thinly slice ( a direction I entirely missed when originally make this ; I left my florets in chunks and enjoyed it that way ) and drizzle with truffle oil or sprinkle with truffle salt , if using .
( See notes below about these ingredients . )
Reduce temperature to 350°F .
If using store bought pie crust , press it onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9 - inch diameter tart pan with removable bottom .
Line crust with foil , fill with pie weights and bake 20 minutes .
Remove foil and weights then bake until crust is golden , about 5 additionally minutes .
Press crust back with the back of a fork if bubbles form .
Cool crust and maintain oven temperature .
[ When using the homemade tart crust ( recipe below ) , I do not find that it needs to be par - baked .
It is thin and rather dry so it bakes up pretty crisp .
Store bought pie doughs are a little bit softer , so the par - baking keeps it from getting soggy . ]
Heat remaining 1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil in a heavy large skillet over medium - low heat .
Add onion , sprinkle with salt and pepper and cook until onion is a deep golden brown , stirring occasionally .
This took me just shy of 30 minutes , though the original recipe suggests 40 .
Cool slightly .
Use a knife or brush to spread the bottom and sides of crust with mustard .
Spread onion over crust .
Arrange cauliflower over the onion .
Set the tart on a rimmed baking sheet ( to protect against leaks ) .
Whisk eggs , mascarpone , cream , pepper and nutmeg in a medium bowl .
Stir in Gruyère .
Pour mixture over filling in tart pan , sprinkle with Parmesan .
Bake until tart is golden and center is set , about 40 minutes .
Transfer to rack and cool 15 minutes before serving .
Do ahead : Onions can be caramelized , dough can be parbaked ( or rolled and pressed into pan , if homemade ) and cauliflower can be roasted a day ahead .
Store a parbaked crust at room temperature , a rolled - out unbaked crust and cauliflower and onion in the fridge .
Cauliflower and onion should be kept in separate containers .
Whole tart can be made and baked a day in advance , reheated in a low oven before serving .
Substitutions for mascarpone cheese : RecipeZaar suggests combining an 8 - ounce package of cream cheese ( softened ) , 1/4 cup heavy cream and 2 1 / 2 tablespoons sour cream for an equal amount of mascarpone in a recipe .
However , while not a mascarpone substitute per se , swapping sour cream alone ( or even a good ricotta ) should yield an equally creamy , lush tart .
About that truffle oil :
You know me , right ?
I abhor fussy ingredients and truffle oil , although wildly popular everywhere outside my kitchen , is at the top of that list .
It ’s just not my thing .
It is expensive , it is synthetic ( chemically produced truffle essence ) , it has a very loud flavor that covers everything around it ( are n’t cauliflower and caramelized onions delicious enough ? ) and while I invite you to use it on this tart ( reviewers on Epicurious seemed to love it ) I can promise you that you will love the tart with or without it .
What I used instead :
The single fussy ingredient in the Smitten Kitchen is a jar of truffle salt I bought an eon ago , before I soured on excess for the sake of itself , and that I fell for because instead of being truffle flavored , it actually has flecks of truffle throughout ( something like 40 grams of air - dried and crushed black truffle for every 100 grams of sea salt ) .
Seven years later , my bottle is still three - fourths full because the smallest pinch over a dish ( or whisked into vinaigrette , oh you must ) and your dish ( and your fingers ) are delightfully truffled without the truffle flavor shouting over anything else .
In this dish , I nixed the salt as I roasted the cauliflower and sprinkled truffle salt over it at the end .
The truffle flavor was subtle , just the way I like it .
If you ’re looking to buy your own , Amazon still has it for the same price I paid back then .
A Great Savory Tart Shell
Adapted from Le Pain Quotidien , also seen here
This does n’t need par - baking to keep from getting soggy and barely shrinks in the oven .
Sold !
1 1/4 cups flour
1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons cornstarch
1/4 teaspoon salt
6 tablespoons butter , diced
1 egg
In a large bowl , combine the flour , cornstarch and one - fourth teaspoon salt .
Cut the butter in with a pastry blender , fork or two knives until it is in very tiny bits .
Add one egg and mix with a fork until a dough forms .
If this does not happen easily , toss it out onto a counter and knead it together .
This dough is rather tough but with a little elbow grease , it does come together nicely .
( Dough can also be made in a food processor , or as the original recipe suggests , in a stand mixer , though I have not tested in in the latter . )
On a lightly floured surface , roll the dough out to a 12 - inch circle .
Place the dough in a 9 - inch pie plate or tart pan and press to remove any air bubbles .
Crimp the edges , and refrigerate for 30 minutes .
Proceed with a filling of your choice , no parbaking required .

I can't help being struck by the volume and vehemence of apparently technologically sophisticated people inveighing against the iPad .
Some are trying to dismiss these ravings by comparing them to certain comments made after the launch of the iPod in 2001 : " No wireless .
Less space than a Nomad .
Lame . "
I fear this January - 26th thinking misses the point .
What you 're seeing in the industry 's reaction to the iPad is nothing less than future shock .
For years we 've all held to the belief that computing had to be made simpler for the " average person . "
I find it difficult to come to any conclusion other than that we have totally failed in this effort .
Secretly , I suspect , we technologists quite liked the idea that Normals would be dependent on us for our technological shamanism .
Those incantations that only we can perform to heal their computers , those oracular proclamations that we make over the future and the blessings we bestow on purchasing choices .
Ask yourself this : in what other walk of life do grown adults depend on other people to help them buy something ?
Women often turn to men to help them purchase a car but that 's because of the obnoxious misogyny of car dealers , not because ladies worry that the car they buy wo n't work on their local roads .
( Sorry computer / car analogy .
My bad . )
I 'm often saddened by the infantilizing effect of high technology on adults .
From being in control of their world , they 're thrust back to a childish , medieval world in which gremlins appear to torment them and disappear at will and against which magic , spells , and the local witch doctor are their only refuges .
With the iPhone OS as incarnated in the iPad , Apple proposes to do something about this , and I mean really do something about it instead of just talking about doing something about it , and the world is going mental .
Not the entire world , though .
The people whose backs have been broken under the weight of technological complexity and failure immediately understand what 's happening here .
Those of us who patiently , day after day , explain to a child or colleague that the reason there 's no Print item in the File menu is because , although the Pages document is filling the screen , Finder is actually the frontmost application and it does n't have any windows open , understand what 's happening here .
The visigoths are at the gate of the city .
They 're demanding access to software .
they 're demanding to be in control of their own experience of information .
They may not like our high art and culture , they may be really into OpenGL boob - jiggling apps and they may not always share our sense of aesthetics , but they are the people we have claimed to serve for 30 years whilst screwing them over in innumerable ways .
There are also many , many more of them than us .
People talk about Steve Jobs ' reality distortion field , and I do n't disagree that the man has a quasi- hypnotic ability to convince .
There 's another reality distortion field at work , though , and everyone that makes a living from the tech industry is within its tractor - beam .
That RDF tells us that computers are awesome , they work great and only those too stupid to live can't work them .
The tech industry will be in paroxysms of future shock for some time to come .
Many will cling to their January - 26th notions of what it takes to get " real work " done ; cling to the idea that the computer - based part of it is the " real work . "
It 's not .
The Real Work is not formatting the margins , installing the printer driver , uploading the document , finishing the PowerPoint slides , running the software update or reinstalling the OS .
The Real Work is teaching the child , healing the patient , selling the house , logging the road defects , fixing the car at the roadside , capturing the table 's order , designing the house and organizing the party .
Think of the millions of hours of human effort spent on preventing and recovering from the problems caused by completely open computer systems .
Think of the lengths that people have gone to in order to acquire skills that are orthogonal to their core interests and their job , just so they can get their job done .
If the iPad and its successor devices free these people to focus on what they do best , it will dramatically change people 's perceptions of computing from something to fear to something to engage enthusiastically with .
I find it hard to believe that the loss of background processing is n't a price worth paying to have a computer that is n't frightening anymore .
In the meantime , Adobe and Microsoft will continue to stamp their feet and whine .

Google says it works within EU competition law The European Commission is looking into complaints about Google 's behaviour , the company has revealed .
The complaints were made by UK price comparison site Foundem , French legal search engine ejustice.fr , and Microsoft 's Ciao .
Google 's senior competition lawyer Julia Holtz said the internet giant was " confident " it operated within European competition law .
Foundem claims that its site is demoted in Google 's search results .
" Foundem ... argues that our algorithms demote their site in our results because they are a vertical search engine and so a direct competitor to Google , " Google said .
" Ejustice . fr 's complaint seems to echo these concerns . "
Foundem 's complaint included screengrabs from Google searches which claimed Google 's own comparison service ( highlighted in red ) were too prominent
Market dominance
The complaint regarding price comparison site Ciao , which Microsoft bought in 2008 , concerns Google 's standard terms and conditions .
Microsoft initially took its case to the German competition authority , but Google said it had now been transferred to Brussels .
A Microsoft spokesman said : " Although we have n't been notified yet by the commission , we do believe it 's natural for competition officials to look at online advertising given how important it is to the development of the internet and the dominance of one player .
We just want a level playing field .
We are very hopeful that our case will inspire others
Shivaun Raff , founder of Foundem " In the meantime , we continue to co-operate with the German government 's investigation into complaints brought by Ciao . "
Google dominates the search engine market .
It has about a 65 % share of the US market and about 90 % in Europe .
In a statement , the European Commission confirmed that it had received three complaints against Google that it was looking into .
It emphasised that it had not opened a formal investigation .
" As is usual when the Commission receives complaints , it informed Google earlier this month and asked the company to comment on the allegations , " it said .
" The Commission closely cooperates with the national competition authorities . "
' Immediate threat '
In a blog , Google 's Ms Holtz revealed that the commission had told the company that it had received the complaints .
" Though each case raises slightly different issues , the question they ultimately pose is whether Google is doing anything to choke off competition or hurt our users and partners , " she said .
" This is not the case . "
Foundem said in its filing of complaint that Google had the " ability to arbitrarily penalise rivals and systematically favour its own services " .
It said Google 's Universal Search was a " mechanism for automatically inserting its own services into prominent positions within its natural search results " and " poses an immediate threat to healthy competition and innovation " .
Foundem founder Shivaun Raff said its problems with Google 's rankings were resolved in December 2009 , but it was filing the complaint on behalf of other search firms .
Ms Raff said Google had an " unprecedented " amount of control over its market .
" We just want a level playing field , " she told the BBC .
" We are very hopeful that our case will inspire others . "

Seeing a Boeing 747 destroy a liquid - fueled ballistic missile with a megawatt - class laser is undoubtedly one of the tech highlights of the year so far .
Unfortunately , as impressive as the demonstration was , it 's unlikely to be militarized in its current state .
While the Air Force 's chief of staff , General Norton Schwartz , called the demonstration " a magnificent technical achievement , " he has no intention of introducing the fat tub of chemical goo into the theater of war .
Solid state lasers are the future " coin of the realm , " according to Schwartz , not Boeing 's chemical laser which he claims , " does not represent something that is operationally viable . "
Of course , the chemical core of the laser was just a single component of the ALTB that managed to track , target , and destroy a moving projectile from an airborne platform .
And while the technology might not be viable for broad deployment , that does n't mean that it wo n't be fitted into a special forces AC - 130 Gunship for covert operations until solid state lasers ( currently limited to about 100 kW ) achieve megawatt status .
Just saying .
I was fortunate to see Shutter Island on Saturday night .
It almost did n’t happen as we celebrated Henry ’s birthday with family that day and he was amped up beyond measure .
Believe me , after hosting both sides of your family and catering to a sugar - powered 3 year - old who does n’t want to take a nap … you do n’t want to do anything .
But I knew if I did n’t see Shutter Island on Saturday night , I was n’t going to see it at all .
So , droopy - eyed and exhausted , I went .
It did n’t disappoint .
There is n’t a lot I can say about Shutter Island without spoiling the details .
But I have read a few reviews and the fan reaction online and I have to say I do n’t understand where some of the critics are coming from .
Some have complained that the ending is too predictable or that Martin Scorsese has given in to his inner M. Night Shamalyan .
These people , I think , have missed the point .
Yes , Shutter Island is rife with twists , turns and red herrings .
But the point is not to figure out “ the twist . ”
The point is that Scorsese is leading you down a rabbit hole .
He ’s trying to make YOU feel crazy .
He does a good job of it , too .
Thundering orchestral notes in the score communicate a foreboding , paranoid mood almost instantly .
Scorsese directs the pants off this thing .
People looking for the twist are only doing so because they want to feel smarter than the movie .
And when the ending is revealed not to be as potent a brain - scrambler as they had anticipated , they claim the rest of the film to be faulty .
I will admit that I spent a good part of the second act trying to to stay a step ahead of the movie .
I kept anticipating something dramatic would happen to Mark Ruffalo ’s character and convinced myself there was some significance to the Band - Aid Leonard DiCaprio ’s character wears on his forehead for the majority of the film .
Ultimately , these details do n’t matter .
But the film makes you question if they are .
This is what I mean when I say Scorsese is trying to give you the feeling of insanity .
You examine the details , your mind loops over the facts again and again .
You can never really trust what you ’re seeing , but you feel self - righteous in your focus and concentration .
As New York Times critic A.O. Scott puts it in his review , “ Mr. Scorsese in effect forces you to study the threads on the rug he is preparing , with lugubrious deliberateness , to pull out from under you . ”
Unfortunately , Mr. Scott saw this as a negative .
He panned the film as he continued “ As the final revelations approach , the stakes diminish precipitously , and the sense that the whole movie has been a strained and pointless contrivance starts to take hold . ”
What A.O. Scott found to be a strained and pointless contrivance , I found to be an expertly executed trip down the darkened mineshaft of one man ’s deteriorating mental state .
There are one or two conclusions to draw from this .
Either I am an extremely simple man who requires uncomplicated entertainment or critics like A.O. Scott are off - base in their assumption that Scorsese needs to be tackling more “ serious ” material .
Could there be a little hero worship mixed in with my support for Shutter Island ?
Sure .
I think the last few comics here on the site have revealed that .
But is there also the potential for critics like A.O. Scott to trying and buff some of the shine of Scorsese ’s career to counteract the esteem he ’s been given in his career ?
Absolutely .
Even if you do n’t like the film , I think there has to be something wrong with you to give it an outright pan .
Shutter Island is not a case of lost potential and there are certainly worse ways to spend 2 hours in a movie theater .
That sounds like faint praise .
But the point is , compared to what is usually in theaters this time of year , Shutter Island is like a sumptuous feast to a starving man .
I think curious , respectful film fans owe it to themselves to see it – if for no other reason than to watch Scorsese do what he does best .
Did you see Shutter Island this weekend ?
If so , what did you think ?
Leave your comments below !
Because comments can be left on my various blog posts , I suffer the same problem of comment spam as many other websites .
Armies of bots scour the Internet searching for pages which they can automatically post to .
They post URLs linking back to their own websites in an attempt to improve their rankings with the various search engines .
I moderate and manually approve all comments before they appear on my blog , so spam never actually manages to get through .
However , it is very annoying having to manually check and delete these messages .
I ’ve come up with a solution to automatically detect these bots and block them using ModSecurity .
My “ Add comment ” forms have several text fields .
They ’re named , “ name , ” “ email , ” “ website , ” and “ body . ”
I added an extra text field named “ confirm_email ” but I hid it inside an invisible container , similar to this :
< div style= " display : none ; " > < input type= " text " name= " confirm_email " > </div>
After I did this , the bots started filling in the “ confirm_email ” field with the same data they were putting in the “ email ” field .
Real people do n’t see this field because it is hidden , so it remains empty .
Some text - mode browsers do n’t support CSS so it might be worth leaving a comment next to the text field , inside the hidden container , specifying that it should be left empty .
Now , any post where “ confirm_email ” is not empty , can be blocked .
Rather than doing this in the application its self , I decided to use the web application firewall which I already had installed inside Apache , named ModSecurity .
Here is the relevant Apache config inside my VirtualHost :
SecRuleEngine On SecRequestBodyAccess
On SecRule REQUEST_METHOD
" @streq POST " " phase :2, deny , status:403 , chain " SecRule REQUEST_URI " ^/+[ ^/ ] + $ " " chain " SecRule ARGS : action " @streq add_comment " " chain " SecRule ARGS : confirm_email !^$
The first two lines turn on ModSecurity and enable filtering on HTTP request bodies .
The next four lines are chained together to create a single rule .
If the request method is “ POST , ” the URI matches a particular regular expression , and the request has an “ action=add_comment ” parameter and non-empty “ confirm_email ” parameter , then the request is intercepted and a 403 Forbidden page is returned .
Such is the awesome power of ModSecurity .
I ’m not the first person to think of using a hidden input field to detect and block comment spam bots , however I ’ve not seen it done with ModSecurity before .

The number of Britons who believe the science of climate change has fallen over the last 12 months , according to recent polls .
Although the vast majority of people still believe the planet is heating up , there has been an increase in those who believe climate change claims are exaggerated .
Public perception could have been influenced by the recent scandal of leaked emails between climate change scientists at the University of East Anglia .
The emails , which appeared to encourage data to be kept from Freedom of Information requests , have been seized upon by climate change sceptics – although none of them dispute the science behind the " greenhouse effect " of gases such as carbon dioxide , which traps solar heat and warms the atmosphere .
A BBC poll , which surveyed 1,000 people , revealed that 25 % of adults did not believe in global warming – a rise of 8 % since a similar poll in November – and the percentage of those who thought climate change was a reality fell to 75 % .
Of those who believed , one in three felt climate change had been exaggerated .
Only 26 % of people thought climate change was " established as largely manmade " .
Robert Watson , the chief scientific adviser for the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs , said the results were " very disappointing " .
" The fact that there has been a very significant drop in the number of people that believe that we humans are changing the Earth 's climate is serious , " he told the BBC .
According to an Ipsos poll of 1,048 people , the proportion of the public who believe in climate change has dropped from 44 % to 31 % in the past year .
It has been claimed most Tory MPs are sceptical about the party 's focus on climate change policy .
Tim Montgomerie , editor of the ConservativeHome website , said at least six shadow cabinet ministers were sceptical about the economic consequences of a low - carbon policy .
The polls come as Professor Phil Jones , the director of climate research at the University of East Anglia who is at the centre of the leaked emails scandal , said he had received death threats since the correspondence was published online .
He told the Sunday Times : " There were death threats .
I was shocked .
People said I should go and kill myself . "
Allegations about the accuracy of a 2007 report produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – including a claim that global warming could cut north African crop production by 50 % by 2020 – could damage public perception further .
The claim , used in a speech by Ban Ki-moon , the UN secretary general , has since been questioned .

A catastrophic collapse is imminent , according to the latest study ( Image : NASA / Jane Peterson , NSERC )
A major Antarctic glacier may have passed its tipping point , according to a new modelling study .
After losing increasing amounts of ice over the past decades , it is poised to collapse in a catastrophe that could raise global sea levels by 24 centimetres .
Pine Island glacier ( PIG ) is one of many at the fringes of the West Antarctic ice sheet .
In 2004 , satellite observations showed that it had started to thin , and that ice was flowing into the Amundsen Sea 25 per cent faster than it had 30 years before .
Now , the first study to model changes in an ice sheet in three dimensions shows that PIG has probably passed a critical “ tipping point ” and is irreversibly on track to lose 50 per cent of its ice in as little as 100 years , significantly raising global sea levels .
Advertisement
The team that carried out the study admits their model can represent only a simplified version of the physics that govern changes in glaciers , but say that if anything , the model is optimistic and PIG will disappear faster than it projects .
Richard Katz of the University of Oxford and colleagues developed the model to explore whether the retreat of the “ grounding line ” – the undersea junction at which a floating ice shelf becomes an ice sheet grounded on the sea bed – could cause ice sheets to collapse .
Warm seas
Climate change is warming the Amundsen Sea , which is at the southern margin of the Pacific Ocean .
As rising sea levels push the warm water beneath the ice shelves , it melts them from below , pushing the grounding line higher up the continental shelf .
By raising sea levels , and therefore the grounding line , in their model , Katz ’s team were able to find the point of no return beyond which the glacier would be unable to recover .
That ’s because the Antarctic sea bed has a small lip in it : it rises slowly up the continental shelf , then makes a slight dip before rising again to the shoreline .
The researchers found that as long as the grounding line is on the outer rise of the sea bed , before the lip , small changes in climate lead to correspondingly small changes in the glacier ’s ice volume .
But as soon as the grounding line moves over the lip and starts to move down into the dip in the sea bed , the situation changes critically .
“ Once the grounding line passes the crest , a small change in the climate causes a rapid and irreversible loss of ice , ” says Katz .
Past the point of no return
According to Katz ’s model , the grounding line probably passed over the crest in 1996 and is now poised to enter a period of accelerated shrinking .
The model suggests that within 100 years , PIG ’s grounding line could have retreated over 200 kilometres .
“ Before the retreating grounding line comes to a rest at some unknown point on the inner slope , PIG will have lost 50 per cent of its ice , contributing 24 centimetres to global sea levels , ” says Richard Hindmarsh of the British Antarctic Survey , who did not participate in the study .
This assumes that the grounding line does eventually stabilise , after much of PIG is gone .
In reality , PIG could disappear entirely , says Hindmarsh .
“ If Thwaite ’s glacier , which sits alongside PIG , also retreats , PIG ’s grounding line could retreat even further back to a second crest , causing sea levels to rise by 52 centimetres . ”
The model suggests Thwaite ’s glacier has also passed its tipping point .
Observations already show that the model severely underestimates the rate at which PIG ’s grounding line is retreating , says Katz .
“ Ours is a simple model of an ice sheet that neglects some important physics , ” says Katz .
“ The take - home message is that we should be concerned about tipping points in West Antarctica and we should do a lot more work to investigate , ” he says .

Yahoo has over 600 million users and is second in the search market Web giant Yahoo said it is still in the search game despite falling market share in a business it helped create .
The company held a press event to address what it called " misconceptions " about its search efforts .
Yahoo said a deal to let Microsoft 's Bing power searches on its sites might have led many to think Yahoo had abandoned one of its core businesses .
" Yahoo has been in search , is in search and will continue to be in search , " said Yahoo 's search boss Shashi Seth .
" That is the stake we have put in the ground .
We will continue to show innovation and drive lots of great features and products into the marketplace and wow our users , " said Mr Seth who took up his post just three weeks ago .
The partnership with Microsoft is still going through the regulatory process but is expected to be finalised in the next few months .
Many bloggers said at the time that the deal signalled Yahoo's departure from search .
Mr Seth admitted to the BBC the view of Yahoo changed as a result .
" I would n't say it killed us but it did make a dent .
It is going to be a really tough job going forward but I think we are well equipped to do well in that space . "
' Web of things '
During the SearchSpeak presentation at its California headquarters , a series of Yahoo executives defended the company 's commitment to search , and unveiled a number of products it said will solidify its position in the market .
The features under development were all aimed at producing what Yahoo described as " the next generation of search " .
Yahoo have called this feature " sketch-a- search "
These included a way to look for restaurants on a smartphone using a finger to draw a circle on a map .
Another example included shortcuts to organise related content and a variety of information without having to type in the search bar .
Images of albums , audio clips and videos were shown alongside results for the rock band U2 .
For nearly a year the company has been categorising information and pulling it together so that queries for things get more than just a list of blue links as the return .
Yahoo called it the " web of things " .
" It includes everything in your everyday life , " said Larry Cornett , Yahoo's vice - president of search consumer products .
" We are talking about people like celebrities and athletes , but also your friends and the people you are connected to .
We are talking about restaurants , stores , places you go , things you are thinking about buying and connecting them in a way you do n't have to think about when using search . "
' A fighting chance ' Can Yahoo succeed in a market where it is losing ground to both Microsoft 's Bing and industry leader Google ?
Both companies would share ad revenue from search results Research group comScore revealed this week that Yahoo's share of US search queries has dropped more than three percentage points to 17 % in the past year .
Google has solidified its hold on first place with around 65 % of all queries made while Microsoft 's Bing has gained share at Yahoo's expense rising to 11 % in January .
" I think the market wants a competitive Yahoo , " Greg Sterling , of blog SearchEngineLand , told BBC News .
" It does n't want to see just two players dominate this space .
It wants more diversity and innovation and that comes from competition .
I give them a fighting chance . "

Why not start of the new year with a terrible interview featuring Marina Sirtis , Jonathan Frakes , LeVar Burton , and Brent Spiner from 1996 .
Thanks to the fine folks at Cinematical , they dug up this uncomfortable video clip hosted by two rather annoying interviews that hopefully are n't in the business any longer .
Check out the annoyed looks on Brent 's face around 4:56 .
By the way , this was a part of the " First Contact " promotional tour and was originally aired on MTV UK .
This 8 minute long bit of talk show pain comes our way via the MTV UK show Hanging Out circa the end of 1996 .
The cast of Star Trek : First Contact had stopped by to promote their new film , however , the show 's two hosts were not only ill equipped to talk Trek , but seemed barely capable of forming words .
Marina Sirtis , Jonathan Frakes , LeVar Burton , and Brent Spiner ( who is constantly addressed as Data ) all do their best to save face despite the hosts increasing number of blunders but there was no saving the interview .
Things start off rough but salvageable with the female host , Simone , confusing who is who , but if name and character mix -ups were the only problem here , it would n't be worth talking about , now would it ?

Now the Government wants competence tests before you can be a dog owner
Ruff justice : Owners of all breeds , including border collies like this , may have to pay for tests
Every dog owner will have to take a costly ‘ competence test ’ to prove they can handle their pets , under new Government proposals designed to curb dangerous dogs .
Owners of all breeds would also have to buy third - party insurance in case their pet attacked someone , and pay for the insertion of a microchip in their animal recording their name and address .
The proposals are among a range of measures to overhaul dog laws in England and Wales being considered by senior Ministers , who are expected to announce a public consultation within weeks .
But critics said responsible dog owners would be penalised by yet more red tape and higher bills – one expert estimated the extra costs at £ 60 or more – while irresponsible owners of dangerous dogs would just ignore the measures .
They added that genuine dog lovers could end up paying for efforts to control a small number of ‘ devil dogs ’ that terrorised socially deprived areas .
The RSPCA said last night it would welcome a review of legislation which has failed to curb the numbers of dangerous dogs that can attack , and sometimes kill , children and adults .
But a spokesman for the charity added : ‘ We would not support anything that would hit sensible owners while failing to police those who are a danger . ’
A government source said the proposals , contained in a confidential document headed Consultation On Dangerous Dogs , have been drawn up by the Department for Environment , Farming and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) .
They follow mounting public concern about the spate of serious injuries and deaths inflicted by dogs .
Police figures show an increase in the number of ‘ status ’ dogs used to intimidate or threaten others .
According to the last available figures , there were 703 convictions for dangerously out of control dogs in 2007 – up from 547 in 2004 .
Under the proposals , would - be owners would have to show they had a basic understanding of their dogs before being allowed to keep one .
The document says : ‘ There have been suggestions for a competency test for all or some dog owners , akin to the driving theory test . ’
But the document admits the cost of setting up such a scheme to cover Britain ’s six million dog owners ‘ is likely to be prohibitive ’ , and would have to be met by either charging for the test or by imposing a dog licence fee .
Moreover , the officials concede that there were disagreements over what would constitute competence in looking after and controlling a dog .
Taking the lead :
The proposals are among a range of measures to overhaul dog laws
Third - party insurance would be less contentious , as owners of certain breeds of dogs are already required to take out such cover .
It is also included in the pet insurance taken out by owners to cover unforeseen vets ’ bills and it can be bought for a little as £ 5 , though it will be more expensive for larger and more powerful breeds .
In addition , many owners have had microchips implanted in the necks of their dogs – a process that costs about £ 30 .
Other proposals due to be floated by the Government include giving the police and local authorities the power to impose Asbos on the owners of unruly dogs , and extending the law to cover attacks everywhere .
At the moment , dogs which attack people on private property where they are allowed to be are exempt from the law , despite the complaints from injured postmen .
There are also plans to boost the enforcement powers of police , the courts and local authorities .
As part of the proposed overhaul , all dog laws , including the Dangerous Dog Act 1991 , often cited as an example of poorly drawn - up ‘ knee jerk ’ legislation , could be incorporated into a single law .
An RSPCA spokesman said : ‘ We welcome a review but the problem is that while responsible owners will abide by the rules , inevitably you are going to get a fraternity that does not .
There are always people who will buy a dog from their mate in a pub and wo n’t tell the authorities .
‘ So the danger is that sensible owners will be out of pocket while irresponsible dog owners will ignore any new rules unless the policing of them is rigorous . ’
He said , for example , that while the RSPCA encouraged the use of microchips , the system relied on owners keeping the information up to date .
‘ It is no good finding an aggressive dog roaming the streets , perhaps having attacked someone , and going to the address on the microchip to find that the owner has n’t lived there for years , ’ he said .
The Kennel Club said that it was in favour of measures to promote responsible dog ownership , but that the competence tests sounded impractical .
A spokesman for Defra said : ‘ We do not comment on leaked documents . ’

Explanation : Galaxies of the NGC 7771 Group are featured in this intriguing skyscape .
Some 200 million light - years distant toward the constellation Pegasus , NGC 7771 is the large , edge - on spiral near center , about 75,000 light - years across , with two smaller galaxies just below it .
Large spiral NGC 7769 is seen face - on to the right .
Galaxies of the NGC 7771 group are interacting , making repeated close passages that will ultimately result in galaxy - galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale .
The interactions can be traced by galaxy distortions and faint streams of stars created by gravitational tides .
But a clear view of the galaxy group is difficult to come by , as the deep image also reveals extensive clouds of foreground dust sweeping across the field .
The dim , dusty nebulae reflect starlight from our own Milky Way Galaxy and lie only a few hundred light - years above the galactic plane .
Libya had been in talks with Russia for several days
Russia is to supply Libya with small - arms and other weapons to the value of $ 1.8 bn ( £ 1.1bn , 1.3bn euros ) , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has announced .
The contract is worth nearly a quarter of the Russian state arms exporter 's entire sales last year , which were put at $ 7.4bn .
Mr Putin said the deal had been signed on Friday during a visit by the Libyan defence minister .
There was no immediate word from the Libyan side on the deal .
Abu Bakr Yunis Jaber , Libya 's defence minister , has been in Moscow for several days , meeting defence officials .
Keeping busy
Mr Putin gave no details of the arms covered by the contract .
Russian media speculated earlier that it might include fighter planes .
" Yesterday a contract worth 1.3 bn euros was signed , " Mr Putin announced at a meeting near Moscow with the director of the Russian small - arms manufacturer Izhmash , which makes the Kalashnikov assault rifle .
" These are not just small - arms . "
Mr Putin gave no further details .
However , according to a military diplomatic source quoted earlier by Russian news agencies , the deal included fighter aircraft , tanks and a sophisticated air defence system .
Rosoboronexport , Russia 's state - owned arms export monopoly , announced on Thursday that its 2009 sales had seen a 10 % increase on the previous year .
Customers included India , Algeria , China , Venezuela , Malaysia and Syria , with air force weaponry making up 50 % of sales .
This is the title of an upcoming symposium at the American Association for the Advancement of Science ( AAAS ) annual conference in San Diego , California .
And it 's a topic that should not be taken lightly .
NSERC - funded researcher Dr. Simon Donner , an assistant professor in the department of geography at the University of British Columbia , will be talking about the vulnerability of coral reefs to climate change due to higher ocean temperatures .
Dr. Donner studies coral bleaching .
Corals get most of their energy from microscopic algae that live in their tissue .
These algae are colourful and are what gives corals their vivid hue .
When environmental factors go out of the range that corals are used to ( such as warming water ) , the symbiosis between the coral and the algae breaks down and corals effectively expel the algae and turn white .
The coral is then deprived of its source of energy , and dies .
Dr. Donner studies the frequency of coral bleaching events , their consequences and the link to unusually warm oceans .
He says that mass coral bleaching events were thought to be extremely rare as far back as 30 years ago .
At the AAAS conference he will be talking about the predicted occurrence of bleaching events under different climate scenarios and , according to
Dr. Donner , it does n't look good .
" Even if we froze emissions today , the planet still has some warming left in it .
That 's enough to make bleaching dangerously frequent in reefs worldwide , " he says .
Given the hundreds of millions of people living in the tropics who depend on coral reefs for food , income , tourism and shoreline protection , the loss of reefs is a serious issue .
" Obviously , there 's an aesthetic concern because people see Finding Nemo and they 're worried about what 's going to happen to the world 's coral reefs , but the key thing is that there are hundreds of millions of people who depend on them for their livelihood , " says Dr. Donner .
However , the outlook is n't completely bleak .
Dr. Donner says that no one is predicting that coral reefs will go extinct ; they will continue to survive , but only in certain habitats , such as shaded areas .
The reality is a general loss of coral cover and a breakdown of the physical structure of reefs .
In order to see what the future of reefs might be , Dr. Donner is pursuing fieldwork in the central equatorial Pacific , because the islands and reefs in that area are affected by repeated El Nino events .
Because of this , they 've experienced higher year - to - year temperature variability than other areas on the planet .
Dr. Donner is studying the corals in these areas to understand how the reefs are biologically different , and how that has allowed them to persist through warm water events that would kill coral in other areas of the planet .
" It 's a natural model for the future , " he says .

If after yesterday 's interview with Anders Lee you were among those in comments discussing the Islanders ' targeting character players in the draft , let me tell you :
You 're going to like today 's interview .
Travis Hamonic this year added more scoring to his existing physical , shutdown role in Moose Jaw .
He was lauded for his shutdown performance for Team Canada at the World Junior Championships before a shoulder injury : cough : check - from - behind : cough : knocked him out of the final .
( One wonders , how would the final have been different if Hamonic had been on the ice against speedy U.S. forwards ? )
Considered a " late bloomer " ( here 's Chris Botta 's piece on how the Isles selected him 53rd overall in 2008 ) , you can find a good overview of what he 's been through in this piece -- and when you click that second link , do n't miss his fantastic quote at the end about what his late father 's reaction would be to his making Team Canada .
Finally , you probably know that Hamonic was recently traded by the Moose Jaw Warriors ( where he was co-captain ) to the Brandon Wheat Kings , who are currently second in the WHL's East Division .
That 's big for when Hamonic returns from his injury :
The Wheat Kings are not just a playoff threat , they 're also this year 's Memorial Cup host , which means Hamonic is guaranteed some very intense hockey in May .
I spoke with Hamonic about a range of topics , but I 'm sorry to report he could not accept my offer of paid airfare to get him to join the Islanders roster right now .
( Relax , I was going to charge it to Chickendirt 's Mr. Underhill 's AmEx . )
Our Q&A , edited for flow and brevity ( Me? Brief ? Never. ) , is after the jump .
' I Get More of a Thrill from Shutting Them Down '
Lighthouse Hockey : I know this has to be disappointing , but how 's the injury rehab going ?
Travis Hamonic :
You know , it is what it is .
If it did n't happen to me , it would have happened to someone else .
But rehab is going fine .
Hopefully better than expected so I can get back a little sooner .
But I try to look at the time off as a chance to maybe recharge my batteries a little bit before I get back to help the team .
Despite the injury keeping you from playing in the gold medal game , you decided to be on the bench in uniform .
I assume you do n't regret that decision one bit .
In all honesty , the team gave me that choice , and there was no way I was going to pass it up .
I knew it was the last time I 'd have the opportunity to be in the World Junior Championship , and being on the bench with the guys meant the world to me .
The whole tournament , the work we put in , changing my role to fit what we needed , I just wanted to do whatever I could to help .
They did n't let me wear shoulder pads on the bench though ; I think they were worried that I might jump out there .
And I probably would have .
Editor 's Note : How great is that ?
I can hear the announcer now : " Is that ... no ... is that Travis Hamonic 's song ? ! "
Have the Islanders been in touch about your injury ?
Yeah , they were on the phones right away .
I 'm already getting good treatment here , but they 'll have their docs look at me , too .
It 's just good to get as many opinions as possible and get the best care you can .
Whether it 's injuries or my trade or anything else , in my one - and - a - half years in the organization the Islanders have been first - class all the way .
Speaking of the trade , how excited are you about going to the Wheat Kings ?
Very .
I thought something would happen , but you never know how it will work out .
But this is just one - and - a - half hours away from my home -- really , it 's as close to home as I could possibly play -- so that 's exciting .
There are great guys on this team , and the team is really good .
It 's great to have the chance to contend , and obviously with us hosting the Memorial Cup it 's a great opportunity .
So you had some idea the trade was coming ?
I had heard some things from people , but you never know .
Sounds like it worked out .
Everyone 's been very welcoming here , I 'm loving it so far .
And I 'm just , I 'm very grateful to Brandon for believing in me , and I 'm very grateful to Moose Jaw for giving me the chance .
It 's been sort of an up and down year there , and this is my first experience with being traded , but I think both teams got what they wanted out of the trade .
So I 'm happy .
Editor 's Note : I think I safely speak for most here in saying I hope Hamonic never experiences being traded again .
' You Ca n't Beat the Opportunity to Play for the Memorial Cup '
You probably know that a lot of Islanders fans are hopeful for the future and thinking about your place in it .
Before the injury and trade to a playoff team , many were hoping you might get another taste in Bridgeport at the end of this season .
Was that kind of thing on your mind at all , or do you more focus on what 's right in front of you ?
I got to taste the American League last year , and even though I did n't play in games , that was an amazing experience .
But I know my time in the pros will come soon enough .
Right now , you can't beat the opportunity to play for the Memorial Cup .
So much I can learn from that experience .
So I 'm excited about that .
After all I 've learned in juniors , it 's great to have an opportunity to hopefully have a storybook ending to my career like that .
But there 's a lot of work left to do ; we 'll have to work our butts off .
Speaking of your pro experience , do you have any favorite memories or mentors from last summer 's camp ?
Of course all the veterans helped me out a lot .
Bruno Gervais , my roommate in training camp , he 's just a great guy , a great teammate .
He actually called to check on me after I got hurt .
They all helped a lot , off - ice more than anything .
Brendan Witt , Andy Sutton ... Freddy Meyer was my roommate for the road trip .
They 're a great group .
And the reception from fans , they have been more than great .
Fans have also noticed that you 're scoring picked up this year .
Is that a goal the Islanders asked you to work on , or something you personally wanted to do , or has it just evolved ?
The Islanders just want me to try to be a dominant player , period .
The scoring , that 's part of it , but I 've had a lot of help from my teammates .
I just wanted to round out my play this year and prove I could be a complete player .
Prove I could put the puck in the net , complete a hit , fight , be a shutdown guy , do it all ...
On that note , which do you enjoy more : Scoring a goal or delivering a big hit ?
{laughs} I 'll choose a different option and say I like shutting down the other team 's top player the most .
That 's something I take pride in .
If I can look at the scoresheet after a game and see I 'm +1 and he 's a minus or even , then I know I 've done my job and probably frustrated him , too .
I get more of a thrill from shutting them down .
[ Editor 's Note : Travis has no idea how happy he made Isles fans just now . ]
Finally , did you have a favorite NHL player , or do you have one who you model your game after ?
When I was younger , my favorite player was Keith Tkachuk , with the Winnipeg Jets .
As time 's gone on , my game 's kind of become the opposite of his {laughs} .
As far as the Islanders right now , I mean Brendan Witt plays hard , he plays honest , I really respect how he approaches the game ...
[ Editor 's Note : That 's right , Philly SUV drivers .
You 've been warned :
There 's more where that came from . ]
... and a guy like Shea Weber , who plays in all situations .
penalty kill , powerplay , is responsible in his own zone , puts the puck on net .
But it 's really about having that will to win and do whatever you need to do .
In the end I just want to be Travis Hamonic .
I want to be my own player in the NHL .
* * *
Here 's hoping he gets his wish .
Thanks again to the Wheat Kings and to Travis for his time and thoughtful answers .
Readers :
Another solid kid , eh ?
The federal government has a large presence in state and local policy activities such as education , housing , and transportation .
That presence is facilitated by " grants - in - aid " programs , which are subsidies to state and local governments accompanied by top - down regulations .
Federal aid spending was $ 697 billion in 2018 , which was distributed through an estimated 1,386 separate programs .
The number of programs has tripled since the 1980s , indicating that the scope of federal activities has expanded as spending has grown .
Rather than being a positive feature of American federalism , the aid system produces irresponsible policymaking .
It encourages excessive and misallocated spending .
It reduces accountability for failures while generating costly bureaucracy and regulations .
And it stifles policy diversity and undermines democratic control .
Cutting federal aid would reduce federal budget deficits , but more importantly it would improve the performance of federal , state , and local governments .
The idea that federal experts can efficiently solve local problems with rule - laden subsidy programs is misguided .
Decades of experience in many policy areas show that federal aid often produces harmful results and displaces state , local , and private policy solutions .
This study describes the advantages of cutting federal aid .
It discusses 18 reasons why it is better to fund state activities with state revenues rather than with aid from Washington .
Shrinking the aid system would improve American governance along many dimensions .
Growth in Federal Aid
Under the Constitution , the federal government was assigned specific limited powers and most government functions were left to the states .
To ensure that people understood the limits on federal power , the Framers added the Constitution 's Tenth Amendment : " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . "
The amendment embodies federalism , the idea that federal and state governments have separate policy areas and that proper federal activities are " few and defined , " as James Madison noted in Federalist 45 .
The federal government generally kept out of state and local affairs for the first century and a half of the nation .
But in recent decades , Congress has increasingly intervened in state and local activities with federal aid or grant programs .
The expansion of the aid system has created advantages for elected officials , but it has created costs and few benefits for the public .
Figure 1 shows the number of federal aid programs for state and local governments over the past century .
1
In the 19th century , aid to the states was rare other than grants of federal land .
In the early 20th century , the number of cash aid programs began growing steadily .
2
The biggest change came in the 1960s , when the aid system greatly expanded under President Lyndon Johnson .
His administration added hundreds of programs for housing , urban renewal , education , and other local activities .
Johnson and other policymakers at the time were optimistic that federal experts could solve virtually any local problem .
At the same time , moves to decentralize decisionmaking within Congress empowered members to seek benefits for local activities in their states .
3
The optimism of the 1960s was short - lived .
President Richard Nixon in 1971 lambasted " the idea that a bureaucratic elite in Washington knows best what is best for people everywhere .
" 4 Nixon and subsequently President Gerald Ford pursued modest reforms to the aid system by turning narrow grants into broader block grants .
After Ford , President Jimmy Carter promised a " concentrated attack on red tape and confusion in the federal grant - in - aid system . "
5
In academia , " the mainstream of economic research into fiscal federalism became increasingly critical of federal grants - in - aid in the late 1970s and early 1980s . " 6
Also at that time , the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations ( ACIR ) was regularly publishing studies about the aid system 's complexity and ineffectiveness .
7
The ACIR was a bipartisan body consisting of federal , state , and local officials that produced expert studies on federalism issues .
It was abolished in 1996 .
President Ronald Reagan came into office criticizing the " confused mess " of federal grants , and he pushed to cut the system under the theme of " New Federalism . " 8
He had more success with reforms than his White House predecessors and was able to cut the number of grant programs in his first term by about one - quarter.9
Unfortunately , Reagan 's efforts to trim the federal aid system were later reversed .
The number of aid programs rose from 463 in 1990 to 653 in 2000 .
That increase happened despite promises by Republicans in 1995 to " return power to our states and our people , " as Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole promised , and to " return money , power and responsibility to the states , " as House Budget Committee chair John Kasich remarked .10
The number of federal aid programs jumped to 967 by 2010 and then to 1,386 by 2018 .
The 2018 figure is based on a new count of aid programs for state and local governments in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance ( CFDA ) .
11
The CFDA lists all federal benefit or subsidy programs , but the program count here includes only programs for state , local , and tribal government recipients that were funded in 2018 .
Table 1 shows the number of aid programs and spending by federal department .
Federal aid spending was $ 697 billion in 2018 and is expected to jump to $ 750 billion in 2019.12
Aid programs allocate funds to the states either by mathematical formulas or by a competitive process as project grants .
13 Some aid is distributed as a lump sum , while other aid requires recipient states to partly match the federal funding amount .
The largest federal aid program is Medicaid , which accounts for 56 percent of overall aid .
Other large aid programs are for highway funding , school breakfasts and lunches , rental housing , and K–12 education .
Aside from these , there are many smaller aid programs for a vast range of activities , including rural housing , local police and fire services , nursing workforce diversity , boating safety , indoor radon , arts in education , sport fishing , brownfields redevelopment , healthy marriage promotion , and farmers markets .
All of this federal spending on state and local activities is misguided .
Experience has shown that federal aid and related regulations are not effective at solving state and local problems .
State and local funding and control of government programs is preferable , as this study discusses .
Cutting aid to the states should be a bipartisan goal .
Cuts should appeal to con­servative lawmakers because aid programs tend to be bureaucratic , inefficient , and beset by waste .
Cuts should also appeal to liberal lawmakers because the aid system undermines democracy , diversity , choice , and local control in government .
The Trump administration has proposed trimming some aid programs , including programs for health , housing , and community development .
14
But the administration has also proposed new aid programs for infrastructure , even though infrastructure aid has the same shortcomings as other aid , as discussed below .
Table 2 contrasts two ways of funding state programs : federal aid and state funding .
The table essentially summarizes 18 disadvantages of federal aid compared to state funding , and these are discussed in order in the balance of the report .
Federal aid distorts government spending levels and spending allocations , and it undermines program efficiency , program quality , and good governance .
In Table 2 and the balance of the report , the term " states " generally refers to both state and local governments .
Effects of Federal Aid
1. Deficit Effect
Supporters of federal aid often talk as if state governments lack resources to pursue spending programs , while the federal government has endlessly deep pockets .
But every dollar of federal aid that supports state and local governments ultimately comes from taxpayers who live in the 50 states .
There is no special , costless source of money that funds the federal budget .15
It is true that the federal government has a much greater ability to run deficits than state governments , which gives the illusion of deep pockets .
16
But the fact that the federal government can run large deficits is an argument against the aid system , not for it .
By pushing funding for state activities up to the federal level , the aid system biases American government in favor of imprudent deficit financing .
It is better to fund state spending activities at the state level because state governments must generally balance their budgets and limit their debt issuance .
17
2. Politics Effect
The aid system inflates the political benefits of spending and reinforces pro-spending advocacy .
With a state - funded program , state policymakers must balance the benefit of the spending with the cost of raising taxes to pay for it .
But if a program is partly funded with federal aid , both federal and state policy­makers can claim credit for the spending but may only be responsible for part of the tax cost .
In this way , aid programs increase the ratio of the political benefits of spending to the tax costs , thus inducing excess spending .
One can notice this political effect when federal aid goes toward a project such as a local transit line or highway improvement .
Federal , state , and local politicians all show up for photos at the groundbreaking and issue press releases claiming credit , yet each level of government may only pay part of the cost .
Economist Gordon Tullock called this a kind of " double counting " benefit to politicians of aid programs .
18
Support for aid programs is buttressed by the promotional efforts of multiple levels of government , and aid programs allow for multiple entry points into the legislative process for lobby groups .
Even when the federal government pays all a program 's costs , federal policymakers gain from the support of state policymakers and interest groups .
In this case , aid programs still provide a " mutual profit for political purposes , " as Tullock noted.19
When federal agencies hand out grants to state and local governments , they coordinate with the related members of Congress so that the members can claim credit .
The purpose of more than one - third of press releases from U.S. senators is to claim credit for federal spending in their states .
20 Members of Congress dedicate staff to helping local governments get aid , and they hold " grants workshops " in their districts .
21
At the same time , employees of federal agencies " make some grant awards strategically in order to maintain or expand political support for their program . " 22 Aid programs are a team effort and federal agencies are the quarterbacks .
3. Flypaper Effect
The federal government creates state aid programs because it wants the states to increase spending on activities that federal policy­makers think are important .
Put bluntly , the purpose of aid is to " drag states into programs they would otherwise not pursue , " notes federalism expert Michael Greve .23
The sections below discuss why that top - down approach to policy is misguided .
But we should first ask whether aid programs actually do raise state spending on the targeted activities .
Basic economic theory suggests that states will mainly use federal aid to reduce state taxes or increase other nontargeted spending in their budgets .
Money is fungible , and aid is simply like a state receiving a boost in overall income .
States will mainly use aid directed at , say , education to reduce state taxes and increase spending on other programs .
That is the basic theoretical result for lump - sum or nonmatching aid programs .
However , decades of empirical studies find that this is not what actually happens .
Federal aid aimed at a particular activity , such as education , mainly sticks on that target and is only partly reallocated to tax cuts or other spending .
This is called the " flypaper effect . "
Empirical studies generally find that each aid dollar increases state spending on the targeted activity by about 50 cents or more .
24
Economists have proposed numerous explanations for the flypaper effect .
It may be simply that state policymakers decide that they get more political benefit from boosting spending on targeted activities than from using aid for other purposes .
25 Federal aid seems free to state policymakers , so there is no downside to spending all the aid they get .
This includes spending it on activities chosen by the federal government that the states themselves view as lower value .
Also , federal policy­makers add features to programs to induce states to increase spending on the targeted activities .
Many programs include maintenance of effort ( MOE ) rules , which bar states from reducing state funding of a program when they take federal aid for it .
A problem with MOE rules is that they discourage states from finding efficiencies in programs and saving taxpayer money .
For example , state - level reforms in Wisconsin allowed local governments to save hundreds of millions of dollars on teacher health insurance plans .
26
But federal MOE rules prevented school districts from using the savings to trim their budgets , so schools spent the extra cash on lower - value items .
Another spending dynamic to note is that states put large efforts into finding state costs that can be shifted to the federal government .
It is common , for example , for states to hire consulting firms to mine their program data­bases for people currently receiving state - funded welfare who could be moved onto federally funded welfare .
By shifting costs to the deficit - fueled federal budget , these efforts contribute to the overspending problem .
4. Matching Effect
Many federal aid programs include a matching feature to stimulate added state funding of an activity .
Since the beginning of the aid system a century ago , a common match has been 50 - 50 , meaning that for every dollar the federal government spends on a program , recipient states must chip in a dollar of their own .
When the federal match is open ended , states can endlessly expand programs and draw additional federal cash .
Matching aid programs stimulate more state spending than nonmatching programs .
27
Medicaid is an open - ended matching aid program .
Currently , the federal government pays 60 percent of the overall program costs and states pay 40 percent .
28 So , on average , the states can proactively increase spending on Medicaid and send a bill to Washington for about 60 percent of the added costs .
Because of this feature , state policymakers have a strong incentive to expand Medicaid eligibility and covered services , and a reduced incentive to cut waste and fraud because only part of such cost savings would go to state taxpayers .
Most matching aid programs use a closed - ended match , meaning that there is a cap on the federal contribution .
The spending incentive is not as strong as on open - ended matching programs , but the purpose is the same — to induce states to increase their own funding of the targeted activities .
29
Federal policymakers may require a high state match on a program to try to induce more state spending , but if the state match rate is too high it may prompt some states to reject the aid altogether .
Grants may also vary in the stringency of MOE rules , and some education programs not only have MOE rules but also " supplement not supplant " rules to buttress state spending levels .
Whether spending is boosted or not , aid programs increase bureaucracy , reduce accountability , create a vehicle to impose costly federal regulations , and produce other harms as discussed below .
Instead of federal funding , it makes more sense for state policymakers to directly balance the benefits of a spending program with the state tax costs .
Thus , regardless of how much state spending is stimulated by federal aid , this study argues that aid programs are misguided .
30
5. Spending Allocations across the States
Supporters of aid hope that federal experts can efficiently allocate funds to high - value activities across the nation .
But there is little reason to think that federal officials are better able than state officials to target resources for education , housing , transportation , and other activities .
For one thing , the allocation formulas used in aid programs are blunt tools that do not measure need very well .
One study found , for example , that highway aid formulas are biased against states that have larger highway systems and more highway use , and thus biased against states that have greater needs .
31 Some states with growing populations consistently get shortchanged .
Texas , for example , has accounted for an average of 10 percent of gas taxes paid into the federal highway account over the past decade but has received only 8 percent of the spending from it .
32
One study found that the deadweight or inefficiency losses from federal highway aid misallocation amounted to 40 percent of the value of the spending .
33
Numerous studies find that politics explains aid allocations better than public - interest theories .
34
In theory , aid should be targeted to the neediest states or targeted to fix interstate externalities , such as when one state 's transportation policies affect neighboring states .
But according to an Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations ( ACIR ) study , " the record indicates that federal aid programs have never consistently transferred income to the poorest jurisdictions or individuals .
Neither do most existing grants accord with the prescriptions of ‘ externality ' theory .
"
35 And the ACIR noted , " The log­rolling style . . . through which most grant programs are adopted frequently precludes any careful ‘ targeting ' of fiscal resources . "
36
Summarizing the academic literature , economists Rainald Borck and Stephanie Owings noted that the public - interest view of aid " does not fare well in empirical studies .
Most papers find more evidence for politically motivated transfers .
" 37 Borck and Owings , for example , point to evidence that a disproportionate amount of aid goes to rural and less - populated states .
38
One can see this bias with federal aid for airports , which is tilted toward smaller rural airports and away from the largest airports where it would generate the most benefit .39
There has been a similar bias in homeland security aid , whereby rural areas with low terrorism risks have received an unduly large share of the grants , which in the years after 9/11 resulted in much low - value spending .
40
This bias is caused by the power of smaller - population states in the U.S. Senate .
41
This small - state spending distortion has apparently grown in recent decades because of differences in population growth across the states .
42
A large share of federal aid goes toward anti-poverty programs , including Medicaid , Section 8 housing , and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ( TANF ) .
Program supporters want to target resources to the lowest - income parts of the nation .
But every member of Congress wants a share of the aid , so anti-poverty programs usually expand into broad - based handouts that subsidize rich and poor congressional districts alike .
43
What economist Richard Nathan calls the " spreading effect " of sloshing aid money around for political reasons has always predominated over the desire to help the poorest areas .44
A 1946 study of the aid system by a Senate committee found that the 10 highest - income states received $ 70 per capita in federal aid , while the lowest - income states received $ 49 per capita .45 A 1975 study found that " federal expenditures per capita were $ 1,059 in the nation 's poorest counties . . . while the counties with above - average incomes received an above average allocation of $ 1,665 . "
46
In a major 1981 study , the ACIR concluded that the " Robin Hood principle of fiscal redistribution — ‘ take from the rich , give to the poor ' — has always received much more lip service than actual use in aid distribution .
. . .
Federal grant - in - aid dollars are commonly dispersed broadly among states and localities , including the relatively rich and poor alike .
" 47 And the ACIR reiterated , " The record indicates that federal aid programs have never consistently transferred income to the poorest jurisdictions or individuals .
"
48
ACIR 's conclusions still hold today .
For 2019 , the federal budget estimates state - by - state data for $ 666 billion of federal aid spending .
49
By my calculations , the 10 highest - income states received $ 2,354 per capita while the 10 lowest - income received $ 2,068 .
That pattern holds for many individual aid programs , including Medicaid , Section 8 rental housing , public housing , TANF , and Community Development Block Grants ( CDBG ) .
The website for the CDBG program states that the purpose is to " provide services to the most vulnerable in our communities .
" 50 But an Urban Institute study found that the program 's allocation of funding to the neediest governments has diminished over time , and it is " uncertain " whether governments " adequately direct funding to low and moderate - income people .
"
51 The 2020 federal budget said of the CDBG program , " Studies have shown that the allocation formula poorly targets funds to the areas of greatest need .
"
52
As for Medicaid , its allocation formula is based on state per capita income , so poorer states receive a higher federal match rate .
However , the match has encouraged wealthier states to expand Medicaid more than poorer states , so wealthier states end up getting relatively more dollars .
53
This sort of adverse result for matching programs has been observed for decades .
The 1946 Senate committee found , " as the matching principle came into use , the poorer states often found it impossible to match federal grants to the same extent as the wealthier states .
"
54
The main federal aid program for disadvantaged K–12 schools ( Title 1 ) does provide more aid per capita to the poorest states , but nonetheless much of the funding goes to well - off school districts .
A U.S. News and World Report investigation found that " billions of dollars end up in districts that are richer on average , while many of the nation 's poorest districts receive little Title I funding .
" 55 For example , schools in Shelby County , Tennessee , received $ 926 per poor child in 2016 in federal aid , but schools in Philadelphia received $ 2,000 per poor child .
Even when aid programs appear to target need or demand , the outcome is not necessarily efficient .
Consider federal disaster aid .
Some states — such as Florida and Texas — are hit by many hurricanes and receive more federal disaster aid than other states .
56 Disaster aid seems to follow need .
The problem is that federal disaster aid encourages people to live in dangerous places , such as on hurricane - prone seacoasts .
Federal subsidies for the seacoasts include funds for disaster rebuilding , beach replenishment , flood control structures , and flood insurance — all of which have encouraged development in risky areas .
Partly as a result , the number of Americans living in official flood hazard areas has increased 60 percent since 1970.57
So federal subsidies can have the negative effect of undermining prudent state and local decisionmaking .
In sum , federal aid tends not to be allocated the way that public interest theories suggest it should be .
Aid is often allocated bluntly and has never followed the Robin Hood principle consistently , even if that were a good idea .
58 Finally , even in cases where aid distribution does seem to match state needs , it may undermine prudent decisionmaking by state policymakers .
6. Spending Allocations within the States
Federal aid warps state and local spending decisions .
It induces states to spend more on federally subsidized activities , and less on other activities that state residents may value more .
For example , the rapid growth in state Medicaid spending — induced by generous federal matching payments — has likely squeezed out other activities in state budgets .
Urban transit provides another example of how aid warps state budgets .
Since the 1970s , federal aid for transit has been mainly for capital costs , not for operations and maintenance .
That has induced dozens of cities to purchase systems with big up - front costs , which usually means expensive rail systems rather than cheaper bus systems , even though the latter are usually more efficient , flexible , and safer .
59
The number of U.S. cities with rail transit has grown from eight in 1975 to 42 today , and the construction costs of nearly all these new systems were subsidized with federal aid.60
One consequence of the bias toward rail is that many cities are now getting stung by huge rail maintenance costs years after federal aid induced them to build the systems .
U.S. transit systems have deferred maintenance costs of more than $ 90 billion , and systems across the nation are suffering from breakdowns , delays , and safety hazards .
61 The New York City and Washington , DC , subway systems , for example , are in poor shape .
Yet those cities have been prompted by federal aid to keep expanding their systems rather than ensuring the good performance of the lines they already have .
A 2017 New York Times investigation of the Metropolitan Transit Authority found lavish spending on new projects — subsidized by federal aid — and at the same time a shocking neglect of subway maintenance .
The result has been declining service quality , fires , derailments , and other disasters .
The Times noted :
The estimated cost of the Long Island Rail Road project , known as East Side Access , has ballooned to $ 12 billion , or nearly $ 3.5 billion for each new mile of track — seven times the average elsewhere in the world .
The recently completed Second Avenue subway on Manhattan 's Upper East Side and the 2015 extension of the No. 7 line to Hudson Yards also cost far above average , at $ 2.5 billion and $ 1.5 billion per mile , respectively .
The spending has taken place even as the M.T.A. has cut back on core subway maintenance .
62
Meanwhile , the Washington , DC , metro system is building a $ 5.8 billion subway line to Dulles airport , with $ 2.9 billion coming from federal grants and loans .
63
That dubious expansion is going ahead even though the system has suffered from appalling maintenance and safety failures in recent years and ridership is declining .
Delays plague the system , and there have been crashes and dozens of incidents of smoke in tunnels in recent years .
64 It is a similar story with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority , which faces $ 7 billion in maintenance backlogs , but continues to build new lines .
65
A recent boondoggle in Albuquerque , New Mexico , illustrates how federal aid can also encourage cities to spend on ill - suited bus systems .
City leaders sprang for an expensive $ 133 million electric bus system because federal subsidies covered more than half of the costs .
But the Los Angeles Times reports that the " project resulted in parts of what 's now Central Avenue being ripped up to host dedicated lanes for the electric buses , which are currently out of commission and have so many problems that [ Mayor ]
Keller freely calls them ‘ a bit of a lemon . '
" 66 Residents did not want the buses , local businesses hated them , and dozens of businesses along the dedicated bus route have closed .
Another recent boondoggle is a 20 - mile rail project in Honolulu , which has soared in cost from $ 5 billion to more than $ 9 billion .
The Wall Street Journal reported on some of these problems in 2019 :
Honolulu pushed ahead before fully planning the project .
. . .
Officials misled the public about the train line 's shaky finances . . . [ and ] an audit by the city found HART 's [ Honolulu Authority for Rapid Transportation ] financial plan in disarray , with hundreds of millions of dollars unaccounted for .
67
This wasteful project was likely only approved because of the lure of federal aid secured by Hawaii 's late senator Daniel Inouye .
Federal aid induces state and local governments to make decisions that are divorced from the actual needs of their own citizens .
A classic example was the urban renewal or " slum clearing " wave of the mid-20th century , which used billions of federal aid dollars beginning in 1949 to bulldoze poor neighborhoods in favor of grand development schemes .
68 A 1963 analysis of these federally driven projects found that " wholesale clearance of slum areas and pillar - to - post relocation of the families who lived there have generated wide discontent .
Members of racial and ethnic minorities who have seen the slum buildings they occupied replaced by luxury apartment houses have grown resentful of city planning that rarely seems to make adequate provision for their needs .
" 69 At the time , urbanist Jane Jacobs said of these projects : " This is not the rebuilding of cities .
This is the sacking of cities .
"
70
One infamous federal - aid project in the early 1980s was the demolition of the Poletown neighborhood of Detroit .
The City of Detroit condemned more than 1,300 homes over 465 acres and removed 4,200 people through eminent domain so that General Motors could build a new plant .
The city demolished 143 businesses and 16 churches .71 Economist William Fischel argues that the Poletown expropriation would not have happened without hundreds of millions of dollars of federal grants and loans as well as state subsidies .
72
Many residents protested , but Ralph Nader noted that citizen activists were " muzzled by the grants machine that Washington provided city governments .
" 73 Local politicians would be much more cautious before proceeding with grandiose and harmful projects if they had to balance the expected benefits with local tax costs .
The dangling of federal and state money causes cities to make decisions that their own citizens do not want .
Fischel , for example , says that grants to cities encourage the excessive use of eminent domain , and he points to the 2005 Kelo v. City of New London case in Connecticut as another example of top - down subsidies inducing a local government to expropriate private property for the sake of developers .
Federal and state subsidies prompt city politicians to disenfranchise their own residents and spend on dubious projects that the cities would not pursue if they had to raise their own local funds .
7. Bureaucracy
Experts have been criticizing the large bureaucracy of the aid system for decades .
As the system has grown , new programs are overlaid haphazardly on old programs , and few are ever repealed .
A 1946 report by a Senate committee found :
The present situation on federal grants to state and local governments is extremely chaotic .
. . .
One federal - aid program has been piled on top of another — without sufficient effort to appraise the general effect of federal aid upon state and local activities or to achieve coordination among the innumerable federal - aid programs .
. . .
The net effect of our present federal - aid program , which has simply grown like Topsy , is a wild morass of red tape and administrative confusion .
74
In 1980 , an ACIR report on federalism concluded that the aid system is a " bewildering maze " in which the federal government 's role has become " more pervasive , more intrusive , more unmanageable , more ineffective , more costly , and above all , more unaccountable . "
75
At the time , there were 434 aid programs ; today there are 1,386 .
More recently , the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) said , " The federal grant system continues to be highly fragmented , potentially resulting in a high degree of duplication and overlap among federal programs .
"
76 The auditing agency , for example , identified 80 federal aid programs that provide funding for local economic development .
77
Aid programs need legions of federal and state administrators , accountants , consultants , and lawyers to prepare and review applications , draft program plans and procedures , file reports , submit waivers , audit recipients , litigate disagreements , and comply with regulations .
The federal rules for each aid program can run to thousands of pages .
The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) is a good example .
The statute is 94 pages long , while the regulations are more than 1,700 pages long .78
A recent annual report to Congress from IDEA 's administrators is 328 pages of dense text .79 Federal aid programs are not just simple , costless transfers of money to the states .
The federal administrative costs of aid programs range from a few percent of the value of the aid to more than 10 percent .
That includes the costs of federal salaries , benefits , travel , office rent , and supplies .
For example , federal administrative costs were about
5 percent of the value of the Department of Housing and Urban Development 's aid of $ 38 billion in 2018 ; 80
7 percent of the value of school lunch and breakfast programs aid of $ 24 billion in 2018 ; 81
13 percent of the value of the Economic Development Administration 's aid of $ 299 million in 2018 ; 82 and
and 18 percent of the value of the federal disaster aid to the states in a typical year .
83
On top of federal costs , there are state and local administrative costs .
Bureaucracy expert Paul Light estimated that federal grants directly support 1.6 million state and local employees such as schoolteachers .
84
In addition , he figured that roughly 4.6 million state and local government jobs exist to carry out federal mandates — both the rules tied to federal aid programs and other regulations for environmental , labor , and other social policies .
85
Light 's estimate of 4.6 million may be too high , but there do appear to be millions of state and local government employees tethered to the federal government .
Consider that between 1960 and 1980 the aid system and the number of federal social mandates were growing rapidly , and state - local government employment correspondingly doubled from 5.6 million to 11.2 million .86
Then , during the 1980s , aid spending and mandate production slowed and state - local employment in turn was flat .
Consider the large bureaucracy for Community Development Block Grants ( CDBGs ) .
The GAO found that local governments spent an average of 17 percent of CDBG funds on administration .
87
You can appreciate where the money goes by looking at the State of California 's CDBG webpage .
88
It has more than 170 links to forms , documents , and spreadsheets that local governments within the state must deal with for the program — applications , procedure guides , compliance instructions , reporting templates , certifications , demographic analyses , verifications , checklists , training videos , and much more .
Note that , as a block grant , the CDBG program is supposed to be a simpler type of grant with fewer rules than normal categorical grants .
Now consider federal aid for K–12 schools , which flows from the federal government to state bureaucracies to local school agencies and then to schools .
In a study for Wisconsin , the Badger Institute found that state - level administration consumed about 7 percent of the federal aid flowing to local school agencies .
89
In a poll , two - thirds of K–12 school administrators and board members found that the reporting requirements for federal aid programs were " very " or " extremely " " time - consuming . "
90
The Badger Institute investigated the funding sources of employee salaries .
In Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction , for example , 49 percent of the employees are paid with federal funds , while in the Department of Workforce Development , 73 percent are paid with federal funds .
Across a number of departments , Badger found that the function of a bit less than one - third of these employees was simply to handle federal paperwork .
91
Competitive grants generate a particularly large amount of bureaucratic waste .
That is because state and local agencies must prepare lengthy proposals to request grants , but then many of the requests are denied .
For example , in three rounds of TIGER grants the Department of Transportation ( DOT ) awarded $ 2.6 billion for 172 projects , but more than 3,000 state and local agencies sent in applications .
92
Thus , the efforts of 2,800 or so agencies were wasted .
In 2018 , the DOT handed out $ 1.5 billion in BUILD grants to 91 out of 851 applicants .
The DOT said that BUILD " applications were evaluated by a team of 222 career staff in the department .
" 93
One of the winning projects was a $ 14 million grant to widen Highway 157 near Cullman , Alabama .
A local newspaper noted , " Mayor Woody Jacobs said a lot of time and expertise was used to prepare the grant application . " 94 Another city official said , " It is a critical need that 's been important to us a long time .
" 95
But if that is true , then Alabama should have funded the project itself .
The Obama administration handed out $ 4.3 billion in Race to the Top school grants .
In the first round , just 2 of the 40 states that applied received aid , and in the second round just 10 of 30 states received aid .
96
The state applications for Race to the Top were generally more than 600 pages long , which would have required large teams of state employees to complete .
97
Finally , consider the federal Assistance for Arts Education Development and Dissemination program .
In 2018 , it awarded $ 12 million to school boards in 22 grants out of 96 applications received .98 Each application was more than 50 pages in length.99
That is a large paperwork effort for a small amount of federal money .
In sum , funding state and local government programs from Washington adds a substantial bureaucratic cost that would be avoided if state and local governments funded their own programs .
8. Waste
Many federal aid programs suffer from high levels of waste , fraud , and abuse .
State administrators have little incentive to reduce such costs because the funds come " free " from Washington .
At the same time , members of Congress have little incentive to reduce waste in aid programs because all federal spending in their districts is generally seen as a political positive .
The largest aid program , Medicaid , has huge amounts of fraudulent and erroneous spending , referred to as " improper payments . "
The GAO estimates that $ 37 billion in Medicaid spending in 2017 was improper , which was 10 percent of the program 's total cost .
100
As a matching program , the incentive for state administrators to reduce Medicaid waste is low because they would need to find more than two dollars of waste to save state taxpayers one dollar .
Indeed , the states themselves abuse Medicaid with dubious schemes to inflate the matching dollars they receive from Washington .
101
The school lunch and breakfast programs are subject to widespread abuse , with families taking benefits they are not eligible for .
The improper payment rate for school lunches is 16 percent and for breakfasts is 25 percent .
102 Local governments do little verification of recipient eligibility because they have no incentive to .
103 Indeed , school administrators have been caught illegally inflating the number of children receiving benefits .
104
When federal auditors have examined applications in detail , they have found that about half of them claim excessive benefits .
105
Government infrastructure funded by federal aid is plagued by cost overruns .
Boston 's Big Dig highway project more than quadrupled in cost from $ 2.6 billion to $ 14.6 billion , of which $ 8.5 billion came from the federal government .
106
Cost overruns are common on small projects as well .
In Arlington , Virginia , the local government built a single bus shelter that cost $ 1 million , whereas a " typical bus shelter costs between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 " noted the Washington Post .
107 Arlington chose to build a Taj Mahal bus shelter — with heated floors — because the federal and state governments were paying 80 percent of the costs .
108
Urban transit has suffered from bloated costs since the 1960s when federal aid began and private systems were taken over by city governments .
Construction cost overruns have averaged 43 percent on 64 major rail projects tracked by the federal government since 1990.109
With respect to operating costs , excessive union pay in transit systems has been sustained by large subsidies , while productivity has plunged .
Transit trips per operating employee across U.S. cities fell from about 60,000 in the 1960 to fewer than 30,000 today .
110
The unneeded imposition of federal bureaucracy on local infrastructure projects causes delays that push up costs .
The GAO points to the " fragmented approach as five DOT agencies with 6,000 employees administer over 100 separate programs with separate funding streams for highways , transit , rail , and safety functions .
This fragmented approach impedes effective decision making .
" 111 New York 's World Trade Center rail station , completed in 2015 , doubled in cost from $ 2 billion to $ 4 billion .
A Wall Street Journal investigation pointed to bureaucratic delays and complexities : " In public and private clashes , " federal , state , and local government agencies " each pushed to include their own ideas , making the site 's design ever more complex , former project officials said .
These disputes added significant delays and costs to the transit station .
" 112
In their 600 - page book on fiscal federalism , Robin Boadway and Anwar Shah describe the general perception across countries of the wastefulness of aid from national to sub­national governments :
Perceptions of intergovernmental fin­ance are generally negative .
Many fed­eral officials believe that giving money and power to subnational governments is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenagers .
They believe that grant moneys enable these governments to go on a spending binge and the national government then is faced with the con­sequences of its reckless spending behaviors .
113
The authors are not necessarily saying they agree with these perceptions , just that these are the sorts of views on federal aid they have come across in their studies of numerous countries .
For the United States , such views are well founded .
Government programs funded through federal aid tend to be executed inefficiently .
State administrators do not treat federal money in a frugal manner , and the involvement of multiple levels of governments in programs adds costs , complexity , and delays .
9. Regulations
The regulations that come part and parcel with federal aid create a great deal of inefficiency .
Since the first aid program in 1862 for land - grant colleges , the federal government has imposed on states detailed rules for operating programs and for reporting to Washington .
The aid system includes rules that are tied to particular programs , as well as rules that apply to a broad range of programs , which are called cross-cutting regulations .
The latter type greatly increased in the 1960s and 1970s as the federal government imposed dozens of labor , environmental , safety , and other social requirements on aid recipients .
114
Federalism expert John Kincaid says that during the 1960s and 1970s , the " conditions of aid , mandates , preemptions , and federal court orders experienced unprecedented increases .
Consequently , state and local governments took on the mantle of administrative arms of the federal government .
" 115
The rules tied to federal aid raise state and local costs .
For example , Davis - Bacon labor rules require that workers on federally funded construction projects be paid " prevailing wages , " generally meaning higher union wages .
These rules increase wage costs on highway projects by an average of 22 percent , while also slowing projects and piling paperwork on contractors .
116
Federal environmental rules tied to aid push up construction costs and cause delays .
A report for the Obama administration found that the average time to complete federal environmental studies for infrastructure projects increased from 2.2 years in the 1970s to 6.6 years in recent years .
117 The number of federal environmental laws and executive orders that transportation projects must comply with increased from 26 in 1970 to about 70 today .
118
In education , the Bush administration 's No Child Left Behind ( NCLB ) law of 2002 imposed many costly rules .
To receive NCLB grants , for example , the states had to implement extensive testing structures , create complex measurement systems , and adopt new rules for teacher qualifications .
The National Conference of State Legislatures found that the Act 's requirements cost the states about $ 10 billion more per year than the federal government covered with aid funding .
119
Perhaps some NCLB rules made sense for some schools in some states , but the law bluntly imposed a large array of costly rules on schools nationwide .
Many education experts argued that NCLB did not just generate bureaucracy , but also caused active harm .
120 Teachers and state policymakers revolted against NCLB , and dozens of states passed resolutions and statutes to counter the federal law .
The Obama administration pursued its own micromanagement of the nation 's schools .
The 2009 economic stimulus bill provided the administration funding for its Race to the Top grants , which required recipient states to impose all kinds of changes , including — essentially — the adoption of the Common Core national standards .
The administration also used " waivers " on aid programs in a uniquely aggressive manner to micromanage the schools .
The states were clamoring for waivers from the costly NCLB rules , so the administration created 18 " sets of policy commitments " that states had to agree to before waivers were granted .
121 One of the commitments was , essentially , to adopt Common Core .
Waivers have long been used as a pressure valve to release the states from costly federal rules , but the Obama administration used them for the opposite purpose — to impose new rules on America 's schools .
Education scholar Rick Hess said that the Obama administration 's " aggressive approach politicized nearly all that it touched , leaving in its wake unnecessarily divisive national debates over issues like Common Core . " 122
A final example of the cost - increasing effect of federal aid concerns the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) grants for local firefighting agencies , which total more than $ 600 million a year .
The grants fund the employee compensation and capital costs of local fire departments .
A few years ago , San Diego was ready to break ground on two new fire stations funded by local revenues .
Then the city heard that it could apply for a federal grant to pay for the buildings .
The city eventually received the federal aid , but its new stations were far behind schedule and cost $ 2.2 million more than they would have without the aid because of aid - related regulations .
123
10 . Management
Federal aid programs tend to be poorly managed by both federal and state governments .
Federal policymakers are too distracted to investigate failures and pursue improvements , while state policymakers cannot manage programs effectively because they are tied in federal regulatory knots .
The GAO has noted with respect to aid programs that the " sheer number of actors creates immense coordination problems " and that " high costs appear inevitable " in the aid system .
124
At the federal level , the huge size and scope of the government overwhelms the ability of lawmakers to oversee programs .
At more than $ 4 trillion , the federal budget is 100 times larger than the average state government budget of about $ 40 billion .
Economist Milton Friedman observed , " Because government is doing so many things it ought not to be doing , it performs the functions it ought to be performing badly .
" 125 Federal bureaucracy expert Paul Light has found that the number of major federal failures has increased over the past three decades .
126
Congress is supposed to oversee the 1,386 aid programs it has enacted , but members do not have the time or the expertise to do so effectively .
Committees hold occasional oversight hearings , but most members attend only briefly and make a few perfunctory comments aimed at the home - state media .
Members often miss their committee hearings altogether .
127
Economist Alice Rivlin observed that with the proliferation of programs , the federal government resembles " a giant conglomerate that has acquired too many different kinds of businesses and cannot coordinate its own activities or manage them all effectively from central headquarters .
" 128 In markets , business conglomerates are forced to shed low - value activities , but in government there is no similar mechanism .
When the aid system was initially expanding in the early 20th century , lawmakers naïvely thought that federal programs would be superior to state programs .
President Woodrow Wilson and other Progressives favored centralization so that experts could plan activities for the nation .
Wilson thought that power was too " dispersed " in America and ought to be concentrated .
129 Economist and later U.S. senator Paul Douglas was also optimistic about the expansion of aid .
In a 1920 essay about federal aid , he said that it " insures relatively economical expenditure of federal funds and prevents their misuse " while being " purely voluntary " for the states .
130
In a 1928 book about the growing federal aid system , political scientist Austin Macdonald captured the spirit of the times : " The old line of division between state and national powers is manifestly unsuited to present - day conditions " and the " bewildering patchwork " of state policies is unsatisfactory .
131 Diversity is old - fashioned — the modern approach to government management is national standards imposed with " infinite tact and skill " by federal officials , claimed Macdonald .
132
Not everyone was convinced .
Gov. Albert Ritchie of Maryland pushed back hard against aid , saying in 1925 , " the system ought to be abolished , root and branch .
" 133 The same year , President Calvin Coolidge warned in his State of the Union address that federal encroachment on local governments created the danger of " encumbering the national government beyond its wisdom to comprehend , or its ability to administer " sound policies .
134 And in 1926 , Coolidge opposed spending $ 109 million that was budgeted for state aid , saying :
I am convinced that the broadening of this field of activity is detrimental both to the federal and state governments .
Efficiency of federal operations is impaired as their scope is unduly enlarged .
Efficiency of state governments is impaired as they relinquish and turn over to the federal government responsibilities which are rightfully theirs .
I am opposed to any expansion of these subsidies .
135
Coolidge turned out to be right .
Federal lawmakers have far too much on their plates these days .
In his 2014 book on federalism , former U.S. senator James Buckley noted , " Congress 's current dysfunction is rooted in its assumption , over the years , of more responsibilities than it can handle .
" 136 Rather than focusing on national issues such as defense , members are focused on securing grants to fill hometown potholes .
Buckley writes that grants " absorb major portions of congressional time , thereby diverting Congress from its core national responsibilities .
" 137
Members are focused on the amount of spending in their districts , not on sound program management .
In a 2012 report on FEMA grants , then senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said that his colleagues are preoccupied with the amount of spending in their states , not on " how the money is spent , or whether it is needed in the first place .
" 138 State officials are similarly distracted from sound management .
Referring to federal aid , political scientist Steven Teles noted that " the multiplicity of overlapping and bewildering federal programs for K - 12 education creates a compliance mentality among school leaders . . . pushing them to focus on staying on the right side of the rules rather than on improving their schools .
"
139
State policymakers are distracted by the need to lobby the federal government .
State governments have long had lobbying offices in Washington , and hundreds of local governments hire Washington lobbying firms .
140
The number of local governments hiring federal lobbyists " has been on an upward trend for more than 30 years .
" 141 State and local leaders do regular " fly-ins " to Washington to twist arms on Capitol Hill .
There are nationwide lobbying groups , such as the National League of Cities ; there are regional groups , such as the Northeast - Midwest Institute ; and there are state - specific groups , such as the California Institute for Federal Policy Research .
All these groups track federal aid and try to increase their share of funding .
Some state governments have special state offices that track federal aid , and there is an industry of consulting firms that train people on how to secure federal grants .
142
There are also many lobbying organizations representing state and local government employees who rely on federal aid .
The National WIC Association , for example , lobbies the federal government on behalf of the 2,000 state and local government agencies that administer the $ 6 billion Women , Infants , and Children program .
And a slew of government - related groups lobbies the federal government to spend more on " economic development " programs , including the National Association of Development Organizations , the National Association for County , Community , and Economic Development , and a dozen others .
The federal Economic Development Administration helpfully lists these lobbying groups on its website .
143 Federal bureaucracies and these state groups have the same interest in higher federal aid spending .
But for state officials , such lobbying distracts from what they should be focused on , which is efficiently managing state and local services .
Federal aid has also undermined efficient state management by creating new layers of government .
Thousands of water authorities , public housing authorities , conservation districts , air quality regions , and other government entities have been created as a requirement of receiving federal aid .
144 The number of such " special district " governments in the nation increased from 12,000 in 1952 to 35,000 by 2002.
145 Transportation aid provides an example of such " capacity building " in government :
[ Federal transportation law ] requires that a Metropolitan Planning Organization ( MPO ) be designated for each urbanized area with a population of more than 50,000 people in order to carry out the metropolitan transportation planning process , as a condition of federal aid .
As a result of the 2010 decennial Census , 36 new urbanized areas were identified .
These areas will either have to establish and staff a new MPO , or merge with an existing MPO.
146
The proliferation of such structures has tied the hands of elected state and local policy­makers .
They are blocked from reallocating funds and restructuring programs because of the rules tied to aid .
Federal aid has balkanized state and local governments .
The GAO found , for example , that an array of 16 separate fed­eral aid programs for first responders has created fragmented disaster response planning .
147 The rise in federal aid has produced disjointed and uncoordinated state and local management .
11 . Diversity
Residents of each state may have different preferences for policies on education , highways , transit , and other items .
They may have different views on taxes and spending .
In America 's federal system , state and local governments can maximize value by tailoring policies to the preferences of their residents .
148
At the same time , individuals can improve their own lives by moving to juris­dictions that suit them best .
Economist Gordon Tullock noted , " The fact that people can ‘ vote with their feet ' and thus sort themselves out into different areas with different collections of public goods is one of the great advantages of federalism . " 149
Federal aid and related regulations undermine such beneficial state policy diversity .
A good example was the 55 - mile - per - hour national speed limit , which was enforced between 1974 and 1995 by federal threats of withdrawing highway aid .
Such one - size - fits - all rules destroy value because they ignore state variations in geography , traditions , and resident preferences .
President Reagan 's 1987 executive order on federalism noted , " The nature of our constitutional system encourages a healthy diversity in the public policies adopted by the people of the several states according to their own conditions , needs , and desires .
In the search for enlightened public policy , individual states and communities are free to experiment with a variety of approaches to public issues .
" 150 But the states cannot be free to experiment if Washington is calling the shots .
Reagan was a conservative , but diversity is also a social ideal championed by liberals .
It was liberal Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis who said that with federalism each state can " serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country .
" 151 Unfortunately , most policymakers on the left have been strong supporters of the federal aid system even though it undermines diversity and local choice .
Brandeis put his finger on something important — it is less risky to pursue policy experiments at the state level than at the federal level .
Federalism expert Adam Freedman notes , " When states are in charge , policy mistakes are localized , " but " when the federal government is in charge , all mistakes are Big Mistakes .
" 152 By contrast , he writes , with decentralization , " the failures stay local while the successes go national , " as states freely copy good ideas from other states .
153
A good example of a Big Mistake was federal aid for high - rise public housing projects in the mid-20th century .
Those projects are now widely regarded as a policy disaster .
154 The projects bred crime and social dysfunction , and government housing authorities allowed buildings to deteriorate rapidly .
Why did many major American cities bulldoze neighborhoods in slum - clearing operations and erect unsightly concrete fortresses for the poor ?
Because the federal government was paying for it and promoting it .
A more recent example of a Big Mistake generated by federal aid is light - rail transit .
Since the 1970s , federal aid has induced dozens of cites to install these expensive systems even though they are less efficient and flexible than buses .
In city after city , aid - backed rail systems have had large construction - cost overruns , a fraction of the riders originally promised , and severe maintenance problems .
155 Many cities would not have made the mistake without subsidies from Washington .
Instead , they would have likely explored other transportation options better tailored to local circumstances .
12 . Timeliness
Dependence on federal aid causes delays in state and local projects such as infrastructure .
Governments may stall needed projects for years as they wait for federal grants to be approved .
And then after aid is received , aid - related regulations can raise costs and delay completion .
Charleston , South Carolina , has long needed to dredge its seaport to accommodate larger ships .
Completion of the project is crucial to the state 's economy , but the project has moved slowly while the state has been waiting for federal funding .
156 The federal government finally kicked in money for the dredging in 2017 .
A local news source reported :
The Charleston Harbor deepening project has been allocated $ 17.5 million in federal funding , enabling construction to begin . . . .
The project will deepen Charleston Harbor to 52 feet .
It is estimated to cost $ 509 million ; the state already set aside $ 300 million for it .
The federal dollars bring the full amount of allocated funds to $ 317.5 million — roughly $ 192 million short of the total cost .
The federal dollars are crucial , though ; construction could not begin this year without them .
" The significance of this funding for the timeline of our deepening project cannot be overstated — it is tremendous news for Charleston , " S.C. State Ports Authority President and CEO Jim Newsome said in a news release .
157
If the federal government withdrew from seaport dredging entirely , state and local governments would proceed with projects when needed with their own funding .
Other nations , such as the United Kingdom , have shown that seaports can be funded , operated , and dredged privately without subsidies .
158 But because much of U.S. infrastructure is dependent on federal subsidies , upgrades and modernization can lag the privatized infrastructure elsewhere .
As another example , the government - run U.S. air traffic control system lags behind the privatized Canadian system on technology upgrades because of federal funding shortfalls and bureaucratic mismanagement .
159
Federal aid and related regulations can impede the response to and recovery from natural disasters .
160 FEMA 's main role is to hand out money , but the rules it imposes can slow and even block state , local , and private disaster response efforts .
During Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , federal supply efforts failed , communications broke down , and federal political appointees were plagued by indecision and confusion about complex federal rules and procedures .
FEMA obstructed the relief efforts of charitable groups , businesses , doctors , and others who rushed to New Orleans to help .
A New York Times article during Katrina said there was " uncertainty over who was in charge " and " incomprehensible red tape .
" 161 Today 's disaster - response system " fractionates responsibilities " across multiple governments , one expert noted .
162 Another noted that " during the past 50 years , Congress has created a legal edifice of byzantine complexity to cope with natural disasters .
" 163 FEMA is an unneeded extra layer of bureaucracy that impedes first responders , who mainly work for state and local governments .
Rebuilding after disasters can also be slowed as communities wait for federal funding .
It takes FEMA time to review the thousands of projects submitted to it for approval after storms .
Disaster expert James Fossett noted that FEMA " requires local governments to obtain advance approval for each project and pay for each project up front before getting federal reimbursement for their costs , which must be exhaustively documented .
These lengthy , complex processes inevitably delay recovery and make it difficult to spend money in a timely fashion .
" 164
In 2019 , $ 4 billion of federal aid for Texas to rebuild after a 2017 hurricane was delayed by the usual bureaucratic slowness in Washington , which caused Texas politicians to be " up in arms , " according to the Wall Street Journal .
The Texas leaders were " increasingly worried that the delay is leaving Gulf Coast communities still recovering from Hurricane Harvey vulnerable to more destruction just as another hurricane season is set to begin .
" 165 But Texas has a massive $ 1.7 trillion economy , so the state could have easily afforded to fund the $ 4 billion of improvements itself , rather than waiting for Washington to act .
13 . Freedom
The structure of American government is based on subsidiarity , meaning that " responsibility rests first with the lowest authority , the individual ; then , if necessary , with local , state , and finally national officials .
" 166 At the nation 's founding , that structure " maximized liberty by keeping authority as close to the individual as possible .
" 167
In discussing how federalism would restrain government power , James Madison said , " A double security arises to the rights of the people .
The different governments will control each other ; at the same time that each will be controlled by itself .
" 168
More recently , the idea that federalism undergirds our freedoms was articulated in a 1987 executive order by President Ronald Reagan .
The order was aimed at restraining federal overreach and stated : " Federalism is rooted in the knowledge that our political liberties are best assured by limiting the size and scope of the national government .
. . .
The people of the States are free , subject only to restrictions in the Constitution itself or in constitutionally authorized Acts of Congress , to define the moral , political , and legal character of their lives .
"
169
Alas , we have strayed far from the Founders or even Ronald Reagan 's vision of a decentralized federation .
The federal government has used aid programs to expand into many areas that should be left to states , businesses , charities , and individuals .
That expansion is creating a top - down bureaucratic society that is alien to American traditions .
Cutting federal aid and related regulations would reverse the tide .
It would expand freedom by limiting government power and moving its exercise closer to the people .
14 . Competition
In his book The Upside - Down Constitution , legal scholar Michael Greve says that the Founders did not have a fully articulated view of how federalism would restrain government .
170 Nonetheless , he argues , the Constitution they produced enshrined competitive federalism , which was a powerful restraint mechanism .
Most government functions were left to the states , and then the states were put in competition with each other .
The Constitution assigned the federal government specific limited powers , while the states had broader powers and could pursue different policies to fit their needs .
At the same time , the Constitution ensured open flows of trade , investment , and migration between the states .
It also allowed the states to choose their own tax bases and rates , thus setting up interstate tax competition .
Each state can choose a unique package of taxes and public services .
States that do not tailor their policies to match resident needs will lose people and investment to other states .
The experiences of different states over time will indicate what works and what does not .
Such competitive federalism enhances freedom by creating choice and encouraging the states to be responsive to their residents .
Greve 's book discusses how competitive federalism held sway until the early 20th century but has since been undermined by growing federal aid and regulations that impose conformity .
Supporters of federal intervention call it " cooperative federalism , " but Greve calls it " cartel federalism " because it undermines diversity and competition .
Like business cartels , cartel federalism has inflated costs and reduced performance .
Cartel federalism has turned the states as " laboratories of democracy " from a positive to a negative for limited government .
These days , Congress takes state - level experiments in government expansion and imposes them on the whole nation .
171 A good example was the 2010 Affordable Care Act , which was partly modeled on a 2006 Massachusetts healthcare law .
Economist Richard Nathan echoes Greve in observing that the " ratcheting - up theory of U.S. federalism " is an important pattern that has developed in federal - state interactions .
172 Government expansion through aid programs is akin to " venue shopping " in the judicial world .
Advocates find the most favorable jurisdiction to enact a program first , then they move to other states , and ultimately create momentum for a federal takeover through an aid - to - state program .
173
The aid system replaces healthy interstate policy competition with an unhealthy competition for federal aid dollars .
Aid programs often favor some states over others , which creates an uneven playing field .
States that receive more aid for highways , airports , and seaports , for example , gain an economic edge over other states .
While state competition over policies generally encourages efficiency , state competition over federal handouts generates little more than unproductive lobbying .
15 . Democracy
One of the casualties of the growth in federal aid has been democracy .
With aid programs , policy decisions are often made by unelected officials in Washington rather than by elected officials locally .
Aid programs move decisions away from the nation 's more than 500,000 elected state and local officials to thousands of unknown and inaccessible federal agency employees .
In theory , the 535 elected members of Congress oversee aid programs , but they have delegated much of their power to the federal bureaucracies .
If you do not like a policy in your child 's public school , you can voice your concern to local officials .
But if the policy was imposed by Washington , you will have a hard time making your concerns known .
Furthermore , the sheer size of the federal government works against democratic involvement .
There is empirical evidence that " both citizen influence and effort increase as the size of the government declines .
" 174 The federal budget is 100 times larger than the average state budget , so federal policymakers have only a fraction of the time state policymakers would have to handle citizen concerns about a particular program .
The federal government controls a substantial share of state policy .
Federal aid accounts for one - quarter of state and local government revenues .
175 Another measure of control comes from a study that looked at the share of all state agencies across the nation that receive at least some federal aid .
That share increased from one - third in the mid-1960s to four - fifths today .
176
Yet another measure of federal control comes from a large project that analyzed 22 policy areas across the 50 states and the fed­eral government every decade between 1790 and 2010 .
177 With this data , John Kincaid found that nearly all policy areas remained exclusively , or almost exclusively , state controlled from 1790 to 1900 .
But by 2010 , none of the 22 areas were exclusively state controlled , and nearly all areas were a heavy mix of federal and state .
The largest expansion in federal control occurred during the 1960s and 1970s .
Interestingly , a separate study using a similar method looked at Canada and found that since that nation 's founding in 1867 , the government 's structure has become slightly more decentralized .
178 Today , Canada is a substantially more decentralized federation than is the United States , with a larger share of overall taxing and spending at the subnational level .
179 Canada has only a handful of federal grants to subnational governments , and they are structured as block grants .
The upshot is that centralization is not inevitable .
Canada is a high - income democracy with more decentralized governance than the United States .
In the United States , state leaders do not control a substantial part of their own governments anymore .
" Citizens are effectively disenfranchised " because of the aid system , noted former U.S. senator James Buckley .
180
A similar view about aid comes from Richard Epstein and Mario Loyola : " When Americans vote in state and local elections , they think they are voting on state and local policies .
But often they are just deciding which local officials get to implement the dictates of distant and insulated federal bureaucrats , whom even Congress can't control .
" 181
Many state employees really " work for " the federal government because that is who funds their salary in full or in part .
State agencies know that " even if only a small percent of an employee 's salary or program resources comes from federal aid , loss of that portion can result in a job loss or program cutback .
" 182 Federal aid is the tail that wags the dog in terms of program control .
Organizations representing state employees funded by federal aid routinely lobby for federal policies counter to the positions of the elected officials of their own states .
183 State employee organizations have long been a pro-centralization lobby — state highway officials , for example , were a key lobbying group behind passage of the first federal highway aid bill in 1916 .
184 The main teachers ' union has pushed for federal subsidies for more than a century .
185
Former Nebraska governor Ben Nelson expressed his dismay at the limitations of his office : " I honestly wondered if I was actually elected governor or just a branch manager of the state of Nebraska for the federal government .
" 186 The U.S. Constitution guarantees to each state a " Republican form of government , " meaning a representative democracy , but that promise is undermined when the states are just " branch managers .
"
187 In his book on federalism , Adam Freedman says that the rise of federal aid and related regulations is an " assault on democracy because the point of such measures is to coerce states into doing things that their voters do not want , or at least would not be willing to pay for themselves .
" 188
16 . Accountability
Federal aid requirements have spawned the creation and expansion of state and local government agencies .
As noted , these agencies relying on aid often have substantial autonomy from state elected officials , and so aid has fragmented state government horizontally .
189
At the same time , federal aid has jumbled American government vertically .
Originally , the three levels of government were like a tidy layer cake with each layer handling separate functions .
Citizens knew whom to praise or blame for policy actions .
But with the rise of aid , American government has become like a marble cake with responsibilities mixed across layers .
190 Federal , state , and local governments play intermixed roles in such areas as education , housing , and transportation .
In his 1983 budget message , Reagan argued , " During the past 20 years , what had been a classic division of functions between the federal government and the states and localities has become a confused mess .
" 191 The mess has made it harder for citizens to hold government officials accountable .
In the 1780s , one of the concerns of the Anti-Federalists about the U.S. Constitution was the complexity it would add to government .
Complex governments " seem to bid defiance to all responsibility . . . as it can never be discovered where the fault lies , " noted one leading Anti-Federalist .
192
The Anti-Federalists were right .
Today 's marble cake structure of government allows politicians to point fingers of blame at other levels of government when failures occur .
That was clear in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , and it was evident during the water crisis in Flint , Michigan , a few years ago .
When every government has a hand in an activity , no government takes responsibility for failures .
Budget expert James Capretta noted that " Medicaid 's current federal - state design also undermines political accountability .
Neither the federal government nor the states are fully in charge .
As a result , each side has tended to blame the other for the program 's short­comings , and neither believes it has sufficient power to unilaterally impose effective reforms .
" 193
He concludes that " the fundamental problem in Medicaid is that neither the federal government nor the states are fully in charge .
" 194
The ACIR noted that the aid system " has become too big , too broad , and too deep for effective operation or control .
Where all responsibilities are shared , no one is truly responsible .
And , if everyone is responsible for everything , none can fulfill their obligations .
" 195
Political scientist Steven Teles coined the word " kludgeocracy " to describe a system in which the " complexity and incoherence of our government often make it difficult for us to understand just what the government is doing .
" 196 Kludgeocracy , he says , creates a " hidden , indirect , and frequently corrupt distribution of " costs , while aiding " those seeking to extract rents from government because it makes it hard to see just who is benefitting and how .
" 197 The aid system , Teles says , is a key part of the problem .
" The complexity of our grant - in - aid system makes the actual business of governing difficult and wasteful , " he concludes .
198
17 . Crowding Out
In many policy areas , the federal government 's role appears to be crucial because state and local governments and the private sector are not currently addressing public needs .
But that is often the case only because the federal government has partly or fully displaced ( crowded out ) state , local , and private efforts .
For better or worse , the states have usually led the way on expansions in government services over the past century .
199 Modern limited - access highways , for example , were pioneered by the states before the federal government passed the Interstate Highway Act of 1956 .
The Pennsylvania Turnpike opened in 1940 , and its success prompted more than a dozen states to launch their own superhighway programs .
200
The idea of weaving together state highways into a larger national system also predated the 1956 federal highway law .
State efforts to build interstate highways included the Dixie Highway from the Midwest to Florida , the Lincoln Highway from New York to San Francisco , and the Bankhead Highway from Washington , DC , to San Diego .
201
Section 3 discussed the extent to which federal spending either displaces or adds to the amounts that states spend on targeted activities .
Federal spending on interstate highways likely did increase overall highway spending initially and only partly crowded out state efforts .
But , either way , federal aid for highways has come with negative effects , such as raising construction costs , misallocating investments , and creating bureaucracy .
As a separate matter , a less examined phenomenon is how federal aid induces state and local governments to crowd out or displace the private provision of services .
This negative effect of federal aid is clear in the provision of transportation infrastructure .
Federal aid has crowded out private highway bridges .
A 1932 survey found that nearly two - thirds of 322 toll bridges in the United States were privately owned .
202
But then federal and state governments began handing out subsidies to government - owned bridges during the 1930s , and that put private bridges at a competitive disadvantage , as Robert Poole discusses in Rethinking America 's Highways .
Because private bridge owners did not receive subsidies and were already suffering from revenue declines during the Great Depression , many succumbed to government takeovers .
Urban transit systems in most American cities were privately owned and operated until the 1960s , but then the private share started falling rapidly .
Of the systems in the 100 largest U.S. cities , the private share fell from 90 percent in 1960 to just 20 percent by the late 1970s .
203
The rise of automobiles undermined transit ; transit firms had difficulty cutting costs because they were unionized ; and local governments resisted allowing transit firms to end unprofitable routes .
The nail in the coffin for private transit was the Urban Mass Transportation
Act of 1964 , which provided federal aid to government - owned bus and rail systems .
That encouraged state and local governments to take over private systems , and a century of private transit investment came to an end .
204
A similar thing happened in aviation .
About half of U.S. airports were privately owned in the early years of commercial aviation in the 1920s and 1930s .
The main airports in Los Angeles , Miami , Philadelphia , Washington , DC , and other cities were for - profit business ventures .
These airports were successful and innovative , but they lost ground from unfair government competition .
City governments could issue bonds exempt from federal tax to finance their own airports , giving them a financial edge over private airports .
Private airports had to pay taxes while government airports did not .
The federal government began handing out aid to government - owned airports during the New Deal , and then the Airport Act of 1946 began regular federal aid funding of government - owned airports .
Today , virtually all U.S. commercial airports are in government hands .
Sadly then , during the 20th century , state and local governments — supported by federal aid — displaced entrepreneurs from major parts of America 's transportation industries .
Federal aid for government infrastructure , combined with the tax - free status of government bonds , has created a strong bias in favor of government ownership .
The effect of the bias is clear when you consider that the global privatization trend in airports of recent decades has mainly bypassed the United States .
205
Federal aid has supported the states in crowding out private provision in other areas .
The expansion of Medicaid has crowded out private healthcare .
Estimates vary , but roughly every two persons added to the program has reduced private health coverage by one person .
206 Medicaid long - term care aid has induced many families who would have otherwise paid privately to take advantage of government benefits .
207
Government - supported schools have long crowded out private schools , and federal aid has exacerbated the problem .
School - choice programs are on the rise in many states , but generally parents wanting to escape a poor - quality public school have had to pay private tuition on top of paying taxes to fund the public system .
One of the earliest federal aid programs , passed in 1917 , was for subsidizing vocational schools — but only schools owned by governments .
208
So federal aid supporting the crowding out of private education goes way back .
As a last example , increasing federal aid for natural disasters may be crowding out state , local , and private efforts .
After the 1994 Northridge , California , earthquake , U.S. House and Senate reports concluded that the availability of federal aid had encouraged state and local governments to neglect disaster preparation and mitigation .
209 Around the same time , a report from Vice President Al Gore 's " reinventing government " initiative warned that " the ready availability of federal funds may actually contribute to disaster losses by reducing incentives for hazard mitigation and preparedness .
" 210
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , Florida governor Jeb Bush warned against increasing federal intervention .
He said , " As the governor of a state that has been hit by seven hurricanes and two tropical storms in the past 13 months , I can say with certainty that federalizing emergency response to catastrophic events would be a disaster as bad as Hurricane Katrina . " 211 And , he said , " if you federalize , all the innovation , creativity and knowledge at the local level would subside .
" 212
When states need help during natural disasters , a better alternative than federal aid is aid from other states .
Indeed , the states do help each other with manpower and resources under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact ( EMAC ) , which expedites the legal process of mutual aid .
Local governments also share police and fire assets during emergencies , and electric utilities across the nation routinely aid one another with crews and equipment after storms .
The EMAC is one of more than 200 interstate compacts in place today .
213
When tackling problems that affect multiple states , policymakers should consider state cooperation first before they call for a top - down imposition from Washington .
As Governor Bush noted , when the federal government gets involved , it displaces the innovation , creativity , and knowledge that come with nonfederal efforts .
18 . Trust
The rise of federal aid and the centralization of power in Washington have coincided with falling trust in the federal government .
Public polls show that the share of people who trust the federal government has plunged from about 70 percent in the 1960s to about 20 percent today .
214
It is an irony that Americans have grown less fond of the federal government as the number of federal programs ostensibly created to serve them has increased .
Polls find that general anger toward federal policies has increased .
A 2015 poll by Pew Research found that 22 percent of Americans feel " angry " about the federal government , and an additional 57 percent or so feel " frustrated " by it , leaving just 18 percent " contented . "
215 The anger and the fall in trust may reflect the increasing dysfunction of the federal government as it has expanded .
216
The rise in federal aid and top - down regulations have likely contributed to today 's anger and partisan divisions by trying to force policy conformity on a diverse country .
The aid system imposes one - size - fits - all policies on the nation when there is no national consensus .
The grassroots anger over the attempted imposition of Common Core school standards is a good example of the backlash against enforced conformity .
As John Kincaid noted about the rise of federal intervention into state affairs ,
[ It ] is the root cause of polarization because it has nationalized so many issues , especially sensitive social and cultural issues such as abortion and education that were previously diffused across the fifty state political arenas .
The cooperative federalism advanced by the nationalist school of federalism requires a national consensus on such issues , but there is no consensus .
Requiring state electorates to implement sometimes hotly contested national policies appears to have considerably exacerbated national conflict in ways that threaten the institutional fiber of the republic .
217
Reviving competitive federalism by reducing federal intervention would help heal political divisions .
Large majorities of Americans prefer state rather than federal control over education , housing , transportation , welfare , healthcare , and other activities .
218 Americans think that state and local governments provide more competent service than the federal government .
219
And when asked which level of government gives them the best value for their tax dollars , two - thirds of people say state and local governments and just one - third say the federal government .
For these reasons , there has been a shift in public opinion in recent decades in favor of decentralizing government power .
220 Americans are in favor of reviving federalism , but the hard part is convincing federal policymakers to start returning power to the states and private sector .
Conclusions
The $ 750 billion aid system is a roundabout way to fund state and local activities that the deficit - ridden federal government cannot afford .
The aid system does not deliver efficient public services , but rather delivers bureaucracy , overspending , and federal micromanagement .
It undermines policy diversity and political accountability .
The states are entirely capable of funding and operating their own programs .
President Reagan 's 1987 executive order on federalism noted , " In most areas of governmental concern , the states uniquely possess the constitutional authority , the resources , and the competence to discern the sentiments of the people and to govern accordingly .
" 221
President Trump 's most recent budget proposed small cuts to federal aid .
But that proposed reform provoked a prominent liberal think tank to issue a study defending aid .
The study 's first sentence was , " Federal funds that go to state and local governments as grants help finance critical programs and services on which residents of every state rely . " 222 But if aid funds " critical " programs , then federal cuts would prompt the states to fill the void with their own programs , and those programs would likely be superior for the reasons discussed .
It is understandable that federal policymakers are eager to try and fix the nation 's many ills .
But they should appreciate that the states can handle domestic policies by themselves and that federal intervention is often counterproductive .
The optimism of previous decades about the ability of federal aid programs to efficiently solve state and local problems was misguided .
Congress should work with the Trump administration to identify and eliminate low - value federal aid programs .
Over the longer run , the aid system should be fully phased out .
Americans want more responsive and effective government , and they can get it by devolving power to the states and reviving competitive federalism .

There was a shift from the previous view that grants could efficiently solve externalities to the new view that rent - seeking , fiscal illusion , and bureaucratic behaviors better explained the structure of intergovernmental grants .

13 Aid programs can also be categorized as either categorical grants or block grants .
Most are categorical grants , which target a narrow range of activities and include detailed rules for states to follow .
By contrast , block grants fund a broader range of activities and give states more flexibility .

15 A recent study by a prominent liberal think tank arguing against President Trump 's proposed aid cuts said , " State and local governments do not have the funds to replace the magnitude of funds that could be lost through cuts . "
Yet the federal government is running a $ 900 billion deficit and does not " have the funds " either .
See Iris J. Lav and Michael Leachman , " At Risk : Federal Grants to State and Local Governments , " Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , March 13 , 2017 .
16 Federalism expert John Kincaid notes , " Just as grants create the illusion of free money for state and local taxpayers , federal deficit spending encourages state and local officials to try to shift costs to the federal government because it appears to be costless and because state and local officials face comparatively hard budget constraints in the forms of constitutional or statutory tax , expenditure , and borrowing limits .

The first book about the new and growing federal aid system published in 1928 captured the political appeal of federal funding : " The voters have clamored loudly for better standards of service — more and better schools , more and better teachers , more and better roads .
At the same time they have voiced no less insistently their demand for lower taxes .
State legislators . . . have cast about for new sources of revenue .
One of the richest finds has been the federal treasury . "

17 In addition to legal limits on debt issuance , state budgeting is disciplined by credit ratings on state bond debt .
Some states have large unfunded obligations in their worker retirement plans , and so they are not fiscal saints .
However , state and local debt and unfunded obligations are a smaller problem than federal government debt and unfunded obligations .
Also , some states are quite prudent and have very low debt and unfunded obligations .

29 With a closed - ended grant , the state spending incentive depends on whether spending is below or above the cap amount .
If spending is above the cap amount , further increases do not trigger additional funds from Washington .
30 Economists who support federal aid point to two main advantages .
They argue that aid may address externalities or spillovers that states may impose on one another and that redistribution is better carried out by the central government .
See Wallace E. Oates , " An Essay on Fiscal Federalism , " Journal of Economic Literature 37 , no. 3 ( September 1999 ) : 1120 –49 .
But to properly address spillover effects , federal planners would need detailed local information that they usually do not have , and they would need to be guided by the public interest , not political pressures .
Experience over the past century shows that aid programs are generally not created and designed to address spillovers .
Also note that many actual spillovers , such as those relating to interstate water resources , can be handled by interstate compacts rather than federal programs .
Regarding redistribution , aid programs do not redistribute resources to low - income states in many cases , even if that were a good idea .
On these two theoretical advantages of aid , the ACIR concluded in a major 1981 study on federalism , " The record indicates that federal aid programs have never consistently transferred income to the poorest jurisdictions or individuals .
Neither do most existing grants accord with the prescriptions of ‘ externality theory . ' " Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations , " The Federal Role in the Federal System : The Dynamics of Growth , " no .

36 Ad
After maybe 13 years of messing around with Lisp , on and off , I 'm finally starting to like it .
Oh , sure , I 've been lightly acquainted with Lisp 's technical merits ( at least some of them ) for maybe a year now .
I 've been playing around with various Lisps and Schemes , and reading some books on them .
And I 've always done a moderate amount of Emacs - Lisp hacking .
But until recently I never really liked Lisp .
Even when I did my little Emacs typing - test application back in July , I only thought Lisp was so - so .
There were a few things I liked about it , sure .
Most languages have a few areas where they really shine .
Well , some do , anyway .
But I 've always felt like I was fighting with Lisp and Scheme , and when I really need to get something done , except in Emacs where you have no choice , I 've always found it easier and more natural to work in Java or Perl or whatever .
I 'm starting to like Lisp , though , and I 'm finding I particularly like Scheme .
It 's quite different from elisp and Common Lisp .
But I still think of them all as " Lisp " , and I think that in spite of all the squabbling between Lispers and Schemers , they really are still Lisp .
In fact , fighting over them is like arguing the relative merits of , say , skiing vs. snowboarding .
They 're both a lot of fun .
Skiers and boarders target each other for jokes , complaints , etc .
That 's natural , since they 're the only ones on the slopes .
They 've got an entirely different set of problems than the kids on the inner tubes down by the parking lot .
The Functional Skiing Community
Actually , skiers and boarders are n't entirely alone on the slopes , just as Lispers and Schemers are n't entirely alone in their problem space .
There 's the occasional Haskell - lover on snowblades , or an OCaml person on telemark skis .
Lispers and Schemers consider them part of the family — it 's hard not to when they 're there on the same slopes , going off the same jumps with you , looking weird but competent .
But they 're a fairly small minority .
Is it just me , or do those telemark skiers always look like they 're world - class ?
I 'm talking about those long skis where the heels lift way out of the bindings , so they have an entirely different style than Alpine / downhill skiiers .
They always seem to be coming down out of the forest above the runs I 'm on .
Maybe you have to be world - class if you want to master something not many others are doing .
They also look pretty lonely .
Snowboarders clump together with other boarders , skiers with skiers , and so on .
This is partly just ( sub - ) cultural — boarders like the baggy clothes and all that — but also partly because the natural arcs skiers and boarders make coming down the mountain are different , so they have an unfortunate tendency to collide at high speeds .
Telemarkers ' tracks are different from both .
So telemarkers , at least in the ski resorts I 've frequented , seem to be out on their own most of the time .
But they certainly know their stuff .
I remember it took me a few years before I really loved snowboarding .
It did n't happen until I was fairly advanced , and could go down any " sane " slope ( i.e. some double - blacks — no sharp rocks or 20 - foot sheer drops for me , thanks ) without fear .
I thought I loved boarding early on , but each year it kept getting better , as I got better .
I never got past intermediate level as a skier .
I only did it for 2 or 3 seasons , and always used rental skis , so I was n't comfortable on black - diamond slopes .
I 've been boarding for 12 or 13 seasons now , and after taking some advanced lessons , my technique got dramatically better .
You never really notice how much energy you 're wasting by doing things inefficiently , at least until someone actually shows you .
That 's true of boarding , and programming , and probably just about everything else as well .
I 've sometimes wondered how master - level techniques are discovered for totally new skill domains .
Maybe some people are just naturally good at it , and a few are articulate enough to show other people what they 're doing .
Maybe some people have skills that carry over from other domains , so initially the best boarders might have been surfers or skiers or skateboarders .
And maybe some people have just figured out that there are universal concepts like efficiency and economy of motion that apply to mastering just about anything .
Who knows .
Obviously the experts and masters of any skill have a much richer , deeper appreciation for it than a beginner .
I suspect that in general , that deep appreciation allows them to derive more enjoyment from their art / sport / craft than people who are less skilled in it .
I do n't know that for sure , but it's what all the circumstantial evidence seems to say .
Clearly non-masters can have a lot of fun too .
But most things seem to become more enjoyable as you get better at them , and spend less time fighting with insufficient knowledge or bad technique .
You can focus that much more on doing cool stuff .
If your art or sport or whatever is demanding enough , so that even the masters can continue to improve , then it rarely loses its novelty .
You can have fun sliding down a slope on an inner tube , and I suppose some people can enjoy the experience for their whole lives .
But when you learn how to ski ( and it 's a lot of painful work ! ) , new vistas open up that you probably were n't expecting .
To kids on inner tubes , it looks like skiers are just going up and down crowded slopes , so it 's hard to imagine that it 's any more fun than tubing and building snowmen .
Even most skiers and boarders never become skilled enough to experience the breathtaking beauty and solitude of the back - country .
Or the profound satisfaction of controlling your path through moguls , jumps , trees , and high - speed chutes .
But it just keeps getting more fun , and it's clear that the boarders better than me are loving it even more than I am .
Struggling takes a lot of the fun out of things .
Late - Night Scheming
Lisp and Scheme basically snuck up on me .
Until very recently , even though I 've been studying and using them both quite a bit , I still preferred Java and Ruby , and even C++ or Perl , over Lisp for real work .
I just had n't discovered that back - country wilderness yet .
Part of the key to understanding Lisp is realizing that you wo n't ever see its strengths if you just try to write your usual stuff in it .
Down on the beginner slopes , telemark skis and world - class artistry are fairly useless , because all you can really do is slide along at 10 mph .
You do n't need any real sophistication until you try tackling the the mountaintops .
I stayed up late last night doing programming exercises in Scheme .
That 's certainly not what I 'd planned on doing .
But finally , after months of reading ( books , websites , source code ) and experimentation , something " clicked " .
All of the sudden I was obsessed with it .
It was almost like I was discovering programming for the first time .
That did n't happen with , say , Ruby .
It only took a few days to learn a substantial amount of Ruby , and I immediately felt happier about solving the problems I used to solve with Perl .
Same with Java : it was just a better C++ , and Perl had been a better awk / sed / sh , etc .
I got very excited about all of them , and I still am , to some extent — you can't help but love all languages a little , after doing 5 years of nothing but hardcore assembly - language programming .
But learning those languages did n't feel like rediscovering programming .
I 'll confess readily : Lisp me took a long time to learn .
I 've screwed around with Lisp for years without liking it much — at least not enough to want to do any day - to - day programming in it .
And even after embarking on a serious undertaking to become proficient with it , it still took me more than a year of reading and practicing before I finally started to really like it .
And then it happened more or less all at once .
In that sense , it really was like learning my first language .
One big difference may have been my switching to focus more on Scheme , recently , but it 's hard to say .
Maybe it just takes a long time .
Or maybe you do n't actually try as hard to learn things until you really believe , deep down , that it will be valuable .
I do distinctly remember when I decided that I really was going to use Lisp or Scheme for something major , the books got a lot more interesting .
It was a weird , instant transformation from " academically interesting " to " I want to learn this stuff right now . "
Even after I 'd committed to really learning it , Lisp still felt , compared to languages like Java and Ruby , a bit like trying to go from tubing to telemarking .
It was n't intuitive , it did n't make me feel comfortable or happy , and it did n't seem to offer much value over other languages .
Anyway , once I finally got excited about it , which I 'd put right around " yesterday " , I started making my way through the exercises in various textbooks , even doing those 3 - star ones at the chapter ends that nobody ever does .
I also made up my own challenges as I went .
I spent an hour writing three or four versions of quicksort , and I can assure you I 've never before had the urge to implement quicksort for the " fun " of it .
Another exercise from one of the books was to walk a code tree and compute the lexical - address info for all the identifiers , annotate the tree with it , and then reconstruct the variable name from its address later .
Um .
I typically like to write web sites and games and scripts and stuff — not pieces of compiler back - ends .
But last night I wrote countless tree - walkers , mini theorem provers , all kinds of things that I 'd heard of but never implemented , except maybe for specific course projects back in school , after which I promptly and eagerly forgot everything about them .
Last night , in one night , I did stuff that probably would have taken a week or two in Java , a language I 'm vastly more familiar with .
I 'll never know for sure , though , because I 'd never want to implement any of those things in Java .
They just would n't be fun .
I tried doing a few of them in Ruby , and it was n't too bad , but it definitely was n't " fun " .
The same algorithm , right after I 'd done it in Lisp , felt like work in Ruby .
Evidently the problems that Lisp is immediately suited for , right out of the box , are problems that are fairly painful in Java or C++ , and none too fun in Perl , Ruby or Python either .
That 's one realization , but it 's far from the full picture .
What 's also become clear is that Lisp is better at adapting to new problem domains than any other language I 've used .
And I have n't used other functional languages like Haskell and OCaml much , but I suspect Lisp beats them in adaptability as well .
Evolution is King
Perl began as a scripting language , but it quickly adapted itself ( via libraries and language extensions ) to become a good language for Web programming as well .
Perl was really the first flag planted on that new moon , most likely because of its strong text - processing capabilities and Unix integration .
But Perl tends not to be used as much for the Web these days ; it 's nowhere near as popular for building websites as PHP , a Perl - like language made specifically for the web .
They probably would n't have felt the need to create PHP if Perl had been sufficiently adaptable .
As another example , Perl has never made significant inroads into the embedded - language space .
Perl ought to be an excellent language for embedding in other applications ; i.e. an " app scripting " language , which is after all very similar to Perl 's original purpose .
But it turns out to be a lousy embedded language for lots of reasons , most of them boiling down to Perl 's lack of adaptability , which most people do n't notice because it 's got so many shortcuts for Unix scripting and Web programming .
So cleaner languages like Python , Tcl , Lua and even Visual Basic now have the lion 's share of the embedded - language space .
Java has proven itself to be a moderately adaptable language — either that , or it 's just had a lot of people muscling it forward .
It began life intended as a replacement for C++ on embedded devices , detoured as a rich web - client language , and wound up taking a good deal of the enterprise - server space ( and other domains ) .
And it 's well on its way towards achieving its original goal of being the dominant application platform for mobile devices .
Java must be doing something right .
C is even more adaptable than Java .
It 's everywhere , and you can do anything with it , although it really starts to break down at a certain size system — perhaps a million lines at most .
Java scales to much larger code bases , although it unfortunately eats away much of this advantage by being inescapably verbose .
Like my blog !
C++ is much less adaptable than C .
It 's large , nonstandard , ungainly , and nonportable , and it has horrible linking problems , regrettable name - mangling , a template system that 's too complex for what you can do with it , and so on , and on .
These things all hurt its ability to evolve towards suitability for new ( or specialized ) problem domains .
C++ was able to move into the application - programming domain during a temporary historical anomaly , from the mid-80's to mid-90's , during which software demands outpaced Moore 's Law for a while .
The balance is restored , but C++ is still hanging around like a crusty old aunt , because of all the legacy app code out there .
How C++ made it onto the server - side of the web , I 'll never know .
It 's hit the Peter Principle for languages big time : promoted far beyond its capabilities .
Designing for growth
What makes a language adaptable ?
Well , languages are how you say things , so if you need to start expressing new concepts , your language needs to be able to grow to express them .
In particular , you have to be able to express them cleanly , without having to jump through strange hoops , mix in a bunch of historical gunk , and write tons of comments that say : " warning : severe hack ahead " .
So that rules out Perl and C ++.
A language also needs to be well - specified .
If nobody 's exactly sure how the language is supposed to work , then it 's difficult for people to build tools for it , develop implementations on new platforms , and build a community around it .
Having a rigorous language spec was a huge part of Java 's success .
C++'s spec is very large , but is still filled with holes .
Perl 's spec is a printout of Larry 's source code , which looks the same in ascii , ebcdic , and gzipped binary form .
It 's easiest to make a solid language specification if the language is small , orthogonal , and consistent .
Again , this rules out both C++ and Perl .
If the language has highly complex syntax and semantics , then you 've got a lot of writing ahead of you , and your spec may still never be very solid .
Java has only moderately complicated syntax and semantics , and the language specification was created by some of the world 's leading Lisp experts ( Gosling , Joy , Steele , and others ) , so they were able to do a first - rate job .
In addition to relative simplicity ( at least syntactic simplicity ) and a thorough spec , another key element of adaptability is that the language needs to be extensible .
If a particular feature of the language is getting in your way in some new problem domain , then you need to be able to change it , or soon you 'll be looking around for a new language .
C provides a simple but reasonably effective extension mechanism via its preprocessor macros .
These proved very useful for a wide variety of problems not addressed by the language , such as feature - conditional compilation .
In the long term , though , it does n't scale very well , being neither very expressive nor very well - integrated with the language and tools .
But at least C has a macro system .
Java has absolutely nothing in this space — admittedly the C preprocessor was n't something you 'd want to copy , and C++ templates are just about the ugliest thing ever invented by the hand of man , but that does n't mean you should leave the problem entirely unsolved .
Now there are all kinds of Java preprocessors , code generators , huge frameworks like AspectJ , new languages for the JVM and so on , sprouting up everywhere , all designed to give you the ability to make Java flex a little .
The lack of a macro system may well be the thing that finally kills Java , in ten years or however long it 's got left .
Do n't get me wrong : I think Java 's a very strong platform , with lots going for it , and Java introduced ( or at least packaged together ) a lot of novel ideas that people take for granted now .
But a language has to bend or break , and Java 's not doing much bending .
Very little of the innovation in Java these days is with the language , and almost none of it has fundamentally improved its expressive power or its extensibility .
Java 's turning out to be the New Pascal .
Python 's a very adaptable language , and does well in just about all of the categories above except for macros .
It does offer metaprogramming , which lets you solve similar classes of problems , albeit not with any assistance from the compiler .
So it 's found lots of niches and has a pretty good user following .
Good examples of its adaptability include Jython ( a port of Python to the Java VM ) and Stackless Python , which uses continuation - passing for its control flow .
Python 's also frequently used as an embedded scripting language .
All in all , it 's a pretty darn good language .
Google uses it a lot , or so I 've heard .
Unfortunately Python has some flaws that may prove fatal , and which have undoubtedly kept it from being more widely adopted .
One is that the user community consists mostly of frigid , distrustful , arrogant , unfriendly jerks .
Was n't it Thomas Hobbes who first observed that communities and organizations tend to reflect the personalities of their leaders ?
Python has other problems , such as the lack of optional static types , although they 're talking a lot about adding that in .
But most of Python 's technical problems would be easily surmountable if they were n't such a bunch of kneebiters .
I could go on comparing other languages , but you get the idea .
Times change , and new problems arise , but languages generally do n't evolve very quickly : they always have backward - compatibility issues , ones that grow more onerous as time goes by .
The only way to keep up is to provide users with language - extensibility mechanisms .
Of course , defining functions and types is the main way people grow their languages to fit their problem domains .
Those two mechanisms ( functions and an extensible type system ) can carry you a very long way .
The Java community has gotten pretty far with Java 's simple class system , mostly through sheer willpower .
But for Java it 's beginning to break down .
People are using code generators ( EJB , WSDL , IDL , etc. ) , and they 're offloading processing that should logically have been in Java into XML , e.g .
Ant and Jelly , to cite but two examples .
Java has sprouted a powerful 3rd- party metaprogramming system called AspectJ , and it's on the verge of becoming accepted by the majority , which means Sun is losing control of the language .
Many other languages are appearing for the JVM , not to mention templating preprocessors like JSP .
Java interfaces and code bases are becoming so huge that they have turned towards " refactoring tools " as a way to help them move masses of similar - looking code around .
If Java 's so fugging cool , then why does all this stuff exist ?
That 's not a rhetorical question .
I really want to know .
Some people claim that Java is just naturally the best language for solving large - scale business problems , so Java happens to be tackling the biggest problems in the world , and it 's hitting scaling walls long before other languages will see them .
That 's not what I think .
My theory is that Java naturally makes things large and complicated .
So large and complicated , in fact , that it requires unusually sophisticated automation tools just to keep normal - sized projects under control .
Take a look at any large Java framework these days ( they only come in one size ) and you 'll see what see what I mean .
JMX is a good random example , since it just got added to Java 5 .
It 's hundreds of classes , thousands of interface methods , and several large - ish mini-languages passed around in String objects .
For what , you ask ?
Well , it provides a mechanism for you to monitor your app remotely .
Er , sort of .
It actually provides a mechanism for you to build remote monitors .
I 'd have thought that would be a relatively straightforward problem , and more importantly one that 's already been solved in various ways .
But JMX is all - new , and all - huge , and it's not even generic or reusable , at least according to its documentation .
Actually , I 'll get sidetracked if I spend too long on Java frameworks .
I 'll save it for another blog someday , maybe .
Besides , I do n't want to come down too hard on Java , because it has a LOT of things going for it that it does really well .
And , ironically , AspectJ may well turn out to be the thing that keeps Java in the game .
I had no idea just how powerful or mature it was until Gregor came and gave his talk , and even then his talk did n't do it justice .
I just happened to be assigned as his " buddy " from Dev Services , so I grilled him for half an hour before the talk , and again for half an hour afterwards , and listened to other people grilling him as well .
I 'm convinced now , big time , but even so , it 's going to take a lot of slow , careful experimentation before I feel really comfortable about its suitability for production work .
And besides , Java's not the only language that has limitations .
C++ broke down a loooong time ago .
It 's just a body shop now .
The standard quantity of measurement for C++ tasks is the " body " , and the units typically range from dozens to hundreds .
Complexity Boundaries
The reality is that every language has a natural , built - in limit to its ability to help humans manage complexity before it poops out .
Every language has a natural maximum size for systems that can be written in that language .
Up to that maximum size , things go really well , and you spend a lot of time focusing on solving the business problem .
As the system grows beyond the language 's natural complexity boundary , people start to spend more and more time wrestling with problems caused by the language itself .
The code base gets huge , and the perpetual bug count grows linearly ( at least ) with the size of the code .
All kinds of inertia sets in , as people begin to realize that making certain changes will require modifying thousands of files , potentially not in an automated way , because tools can generally help you with syntactic problems , but not so much with semantic or architectural ones .
It starts to become overwhelming , and eventually progress slows to a trickle .
This has happened to me twice now outside of Amazon .
The first time was at Geoworks .
We wrote everything by hand in assembly language : apps , libraries , drivers , kernel — an entire desktop ( and eventually handheld ) operating system and application suite .
The system eventually collapsed under its own weight .
Many Geoworks people still do n't like to admit it , but that 's what happened .
You can laugh it up , saying how foolish we were to write everything in assembly language for performance reasons .
But you 're doing it right now at Amazon .
Same justification , same approach , and already some of the same outcomes .
C++ is assembly language : low - level , non-portable , occupying no useful niche ; squeezed out on the low end by straight C , squeezed on the high end by Java and even higher - level languages that are now shining as Moore 's Law runs ahead .
I know , I know : you and lots of smart people you know disagree .
That 's fine .
You 're welcome to disagree .
I can't blame you : I and everyone else at Geoworks felt the same way about assembly language .
We were doing great things with it .
C was for wimps , and C++ was for Visual Basic pansies .
Performance was King .
We all have a blind spot for performance , you know .
All programmers have it .
It 's in our bones , and we 're very superstitious about it .
So I hear you , and I 'm not going to try to change your mind .
Everyone has to figure it out for themselves .
I did n't figure it out until it had happened to me again , seven years later , after building a very large Java application mostly by myself .
At some indefinable point , the bulk of my effort had shifted from extending the application to maintaining it .
Never satisfied , I did several months of deep analysis on the code , and finally concluded that many / most of the problems were intrinsic to Java , hence unavoidable .
I had been immersed for seven years in blind devotion to Java , seeing as it was actually kinda nice compared to the old assembly - language gig , and my findings were surprising and frustrating .
So I spent another year or so of my free time on a massive quest , searching for a Java replacement .
It was n't as easy as I 'd hoped .
Lots of promise , lots of potential , but precious few high - level languages that actually deliver the vast number of tools and features you need for building production systens .
Given that AOP can help with about half the problems I was having , Java is still a very solid choice .
There 's really only one other contender , one I probably should have been using from the beginning .
But I wo n't bore you with the details .
The point I was trying to make in this section is that all languages have a natural system - size limit , beyond which your innovation starts to slow down dramatically .
It happens regardless of how well you 've engineered your system , and regardless of whether your team is one person or a thousand .
Overall productivity never goes to zero , but that 's moot ; the point is that you started out strong and now you 're weak .
The natural complexity boundary for any given language is also a function of your engineering quality , but that can only reduce the upper bound .
The natural limit I 'm talking about is the one you hit even if your system is engineered almost perfectly .
Adding engineers can help up to a point , but eventually communication , code - sharing , and other people - related issues outweigh the benefits .
You might think your problem domain determines the upper complexity bound more than the programming language you 're using .
I do n't think so , though , because eventually all systems grow to the point where they 're huge , sprawling , distributed / networked , multi-functional platforms .
Back in the 70's and 80's , Unix people joked that all applications eventually grow to the point where they can read mail , and any that do n't are replaced by ones that can .
There was some truth to that .
Today , systems grow to the point where they speak Web Services and other protocols , or they 're replaced by ones that can .
I do n't think your problem domain matters anywhere near as much as the language , because in some sense we 're all converging towards the same kinds of systems .
What language - level features contribute to a language 's scalability ?
What makes one language capable of growing large systems , while a similar system in another language spends all its time languishing in maintenance - mode ?
Type Systems
If my 18 months of intense study have answered any question at all , it 's what data types are exactly , how they work , and why I 'm always struggling with whether I prefer strong or weak typing .
The design of the static type system is an important determinant of language scalability .
Static type annotations improve system safety ( in the quality sense , if not necessarily in the security sense ) .
They also help the compiler produce optimized code .
They can help improve program readability if you do n't overdo them .
And type tags help your editor / IDE and other tools figure out the structure of your code , since type tags are essentially metadata .
So languages without at least the option of declaring ( or at least automatically inferring ) static types tend to have lower complexity ceilings , even in the presense of good tools and extensive unit testing .
You might think C++ and Java are strongly typed .
You 'd be wrong .
Ada and ML are strongly typed .
C++ and Java have some static typing , but they both provide you with lots of ways to bypass the type system .
To be honest , though , I think that 's good thing ; type - checker algorithms are often not very smart , and sometimes you need them to get out of your way .
In the end , if your strongly - typed system becomes too much of a pain , you 'll find ways around it — e.g. passing XML parameters as strings through your IDL interfaces , or whatever .
It might seem odd that type systems yield such great benefits , yet when you make them too strict , nobody can stand them anymore .
The problem is deeper than you might suspect , particularly if you subscribe to the view that Object - Oriented Programming is the be-all , end - all of type systems .
Take another look at that JMX interface .
It 's strongly typed — superficially , at any rate .
But if you dig one or two levels deeper , you 'll see they gave up on the rigorous typing and highly - specialized 32 - letter identifier names .
At the lowest level , it 's all weakly - typed string parameters and oddly generic - sounding classes like " Query " and " Role " .
Almost as if there 's a query language frozen in that mass of OOP interfaces , like Han Solo 's face sticking out of the carbonite .
The whole interface is massively overcomplicated , and it seems to exhibit a sort of struggle between strong and weak static typing , right there in the same framework .
What 's going on ?
Is this really so hard ?
The problem is that types really are just a classification scheme to help us ( and our tools ) understand our semantic intent .
They do n't actually change the semantics ; they just describe or explain the ( intended ) semantics .
You can add type information to anything ; in fact you can tag things until you 're blue in the face .
You can continue adding fine - grained distinctions to your code and data almost indefinitely , specializing on anything you feel like : time of day , what kind of people will be calling your APIs , anything you want .
The hard part is knowing when to stop .
If you 're struggling over whether to call a method getCustomersWithRedHairAndBlueNoses or getCustomersByHairAndNoseType(HairType.RED , NoseColor . BLUE ) , then you 've officially entered barkingUpWrongTreeTerritory .
Over -zealous typing is a dead giveaway that someone junior is doing the design .
At the other exteme , not putting in enough static type information is certain to create problems for you , as you muddle through your nests of untyped lists and hashes , trying to discern the overall structure .
This is the central problem of Object - Oriented design , and of program and system design in general .
And if designing your own types is hard , getting a language 's type system right is much harder , because there really is no " right " — it 's different for different people .
Some people clean their homes until every last speck of dust is gone , and some people are a bit sloppier , but we all manage to get by .
It 's mostly a matter of personal preference .
This is why advocates of " weak " typing do n't see any advantage to Java 's interface declarations and fine - grained primitive types .
They 're going to unit - test it all anyway ; the type system is just redundant bureaucracy to them .
Why do you need ints and longs , for instance ?
A good system should automatically use the smallest representation it needs , and grow it on demand , rather than overflowing and introducing horrible bugs , as Java and C++ both do .
Having fine - grained types for numeric precision just gets people into trouble .
In the real world , numbers have distinct , naturally - occurring types that do n't really map to the primitives you find in popular languages , most of which chose their built - in types based on machine word - sizes .
In nature , we have whole numbers , natural numbers , integers , rational numbers , real numbers , complex numbers , and then an infinite chain of matrices of increasing dimensionality .
That 's just how it works , and you sort of want your programming language to work that way too , if you think about it .
Java 's Type System
Many Java advocates are very excited by the notion of automatically - generated API documentation .
Gosh , I guess I am too .
But because JavaDoc does such a great job , and we rely on it so heavily , many people tend to confuse Java 's type system with the doc-generation system , and they think that you can't have that kind of documentation without being able to declare Java - style interfaces .
It 's simply not true .
Java definitely raised the bar on auto - documentation .
But Javadoc 's output quality is n't better because of the interface signatures ; the quality is almost entirely due to the JavaDoc tags , which you fill in by hand .
The documentation written by humans is far more useful than the dubious declaration that a function takes two ints , or two Strings , or even two Person objects .
You still need to know what it does with them , and whether there are any constraints on the data that are n't expressed by the type signatures — e.g. whether can you pass in the full range of 32 - bit integers to the function .
But many Java enthusiasts have latched onto interfaces , and they appear to think of interfaces as the holy grail of type systems .
They know , deep down , that Java 's type system is non-orthogonal , inflexible , and not very expressive , and they ask questions about how to get around problems with it on a daily basis .
But they 're used to assuming it's how the universe works , so you do n't question it , any more than you question why you have to commute to work when you ought to be able to teleport there instantly .
( The physical universe 's constraint system sucks , too . )
It would take a whole book to explain all the problems with Java 's type system , but I 'll try to throw out a few examples .
One obvious problem is that Java 's type extension mechanism is limited to defining classes and interfaces .
You can't create new primitive types , and there are severe limitations on what you can do with classes and interfaces .
As a random example , you can't subclass a static method — a feature that would occasionally be extremely useful , and which is present in other languages .
And a class can't get its own name at compile - time , e.g. to pass to a static logger .
( Jeez . )
One that really irks me : there 's no such thing as a " static interface " — an interface full of static methods that a Class object promises to implement .
So you have to use reflection to look up factory methods , hardwire class names in your code , and so on .
The whole situation is actually quite awful .
As a result of Java 's whimsical limitations , you often find objects or situations in the real world that are very difficult to express in Java 's type system ( or C++'s , for that matter , on which Java 's is modeled ) .
Many Design Patterns are in fact elaborate mechanisms for working around very serious limitations of the C++ and Java type systems .
An even more subtle point is that every single element of a programming language has a type , even though the language does n't actually recognize them as distinct entities , let alone typed ones .
Here 's an example of what I mean by being able to tag things until you 're blue in the face :
Take a for - loop .
It 's got a type , of course : for - loop is a type of loop .
It can also be viewed as a type of language construct that introduces a new scope .
And it 's a type that can fork program control - flow , and also a type that 's introduced by a keyword and has at least two auxiliary keywords ( break and continue ) .
You could even think of a for - loop as a type that has lots of types , as opposed to a construct like the break statement , which does n't exhibit as much interesting and potentially type - worthy behavior .
A type is just a description of something 's properties and / or behavior , so you can really get carried away with overengineering your type declarations .
In extreme cases , you can wind up with a separate Java interface for nearly every different method on a class .
It 's pretty clear why Python and Ruby are moving towards " duck typing " , where you simply ask an object at runtime whether it responds to a particular message .
If the object says yes , then voila — it 's the right type .
Case closed .
Ironically , even though every single Java language construct has many ( possible ) types , Java itself is oblivious to them .
Even Java 's runtime reflection system is only capable of expressing the types provided by the OO mechanism ( plus some stragglers like the primitive types ) .
Reflection has no visibility inside of methods .
If you want to write Java code that reads or writes Java code , then you have to come up with your own object model first , and potentially wrestle with complex parser generators and so on .
Many languages that do n't offer you much in the way of static type annotations ( e.g. Ruby , Python , Perl ) still have tremendously rich type systems .
They provide you with more flexibility in defining your types , using far less code , and still providing the same level of safety and automatic documentation .
Declaring a bunch of types does n't make your code safe , and not declaring them does n't make it unsafe .
Types are just helpers , and making the right type choices is a fuzzy art , one that boils down to taste .
This is one reason OO design ( and , by extension , service interface design ) is so difficult , and why interview candidates are often so " bad " at it .
I 'll have more to say about types in a future essay , I 'm sure .
I went slightly off - course in this section .
My goal was to illustrate that there 's life beyond Java , that Perl programmers are n't quite as disorganized as most Java folks would like to believe , and of course that a language 's type system is one of the most important contributors to how well the language " scales " .
Language Scalability
I could list other factors that contribute to language scalability : the complexity of the syntax , for instance , is a real barrier to scaling , for many reasons .
You really do n't want a complicated syntax ; it 'll come back to bite you .
Perl , C++ and Java all have artificially complicated syntax : too much for too little semantic benefit .
Java is the least bitten of the three , but it still inherits a lot of cruft from C++ , which was designed by a rank amateur .
( As was Perl . )
The module system is another big one .
Runtime introspection support is another .
In fact , all of the choices made in designing a language , whether explicit or inadvertent , have some impact on how far the language will scale before your system becomes too complex for human beings to keep evolving it .
But all of these contributors pale in comparison to extensibility — i.e. , the extent to which users can customize or change the behavior of the language itself to suit their needs .
And all languages , bar none , pale in comparison to Lisp when it comes to extensibility ( or adaptability , as I was calling this property earlier ) .
It does n't matter how cool or sophisticated or far - reaching you think your favorite language 's extension mechanisms are : compared to Lisp , all other languages are orders of magnitude less capable of evolution .
Lisp is DNA
Alan Kay ( co-inventor of Smalltalk and OOP ) said of Lisp : " it 's not a language , it 's a building material . "
Some authors have called it a " programmable programming language " .
Some people say : " it looks like fingernail clippings in oatmeal . "
People have in fact said all sorts of amusing and interesting things about Lisp .
All of the descriptions fall short of the mark , though .
And mine very likely will , too .
But I 'll try .
Or at least I 'll try to give you the barest outline in the next few paragraphs .
Every programming language runs on a machine .
That machine is NOT the hardware , because all languages can be made to run on different machines — even assembly language , which can be run on emulators .
Programming languages are built atop an abstract machine conceived by the language designer .
This machine that may or may not be very well specified .
For instance , many languages have at least a few constructs whose behavior relies on the implementation of a system - dependent system call .
All languages have at least part of their underlying machine 's functionality implemented in software .
Even C and C++ have software runtime environments , and of course both languages also rely heavily on OS services , which are also implemented in software and supported by the hardware .
In fact , all programs run on a tower of machines .
Even the hardware , which you might think of as pretty " low level " , is actually constructed out of smaller machines , all the way down to the level of quantum mechanics .
OK .
Got it .
Programs in all languages run on virtual machines .
Languages also provide some amount of syntax : a set of input symbols you can use for constructing your program , a set of mostly - formal rules governing how you may arrange those symbols , and a set of mostly - informal descriptions of how your symbol arrangements will be interpreted .
Most languages limit you to the symbols in the ASCII character set , for historical reasons , and they 're gradually migrating toward Unicode .
But a symbol could be anything at all , as long as it can be distinguished from all other symbols used by the language .
It 's just a unique string of bits , usually with a predetermined way of displaying and / or entering it .
The machine interprets your program 's symbols according to the language rules .
Hence , all machines are interpreters .
Some of the interpreting goes on in hardware , and some in software .
The hardware / software boundary is flexible .
For instance , CPUs have started offering floating - point arithmetic in hardware , and video cards now offer polygon rendering and other algorithms that used to be pure software .
With me so far ?
Compilers are just programs that pre-interpret as much of your program as possible .
Technically they 're unnecessary ; you can interpret any language directly from the input symbols .
Compilers are a performance optimization .
They 're quite useful , and we grossly under - utilize them , but talking about performance would take me a bit too far afield today .
I 'll have more to say about performance at some point , I 'm sure .
Hardware is also a performance optimization , if you separate the notions of storage and computation .
Ultimately computations can be performed by people or any other kind of physical process that knows how to interpret your program .
When you hand - simulate your program , you 're the machine .
So " interpreters " are a much more fundamental notion than hardware or compilers .
An interpreter is a tower of machines , some software and some hardware , running at different times , all working together to execute your program .
And your program is just a bunch of instructions , specified by your arrangement of the language 's symbols according to the rules of the language .
Languages and interpreters go hand in hand .
Some programming languages are designed with the goal of being interpreted directly by the hardware , with as little intervention from software as possible .
C is such a language .
This approach has the advantage of being pretty fast on current hardware .
It has all the disadvantages attendant to premature optimization , but I can't get started on performance ; I 've already deleted about ten paragraphs about it .
I 'll leave it for another blog .
Some languages , e.g. C++ and Java , are designed to run on more abstract machines .
C++'s abstract machine is a superset of the C machine , and includes some OOP abstractions .
C++ has very complex syntax , partly due to inexperienced design , and partly because it made many concessions to hardware performance over people performance .
Java runs on a virtual machine , but it was designed to map very closely to existing hardware , so in reality it 's not so far removed from the bare metal as people tend to think .
Perl has its own complex , baroque , ad - hoc machine : the Perl interpreter .
Perl has a very complex syntax , with many shortcuts for common operations .
When you create classes and functions and libraries , you 're not extending the programming language .
You 're extending the machine .
The language stays the same .
If it was hard to say certain things before , then adding libraries of classes and functions does n't really help .
For instance , in Java you must double - escape all the metacharacters in your regular expressions , not to mention create Pattern and Matcher objects , all because you can't make any changes to Java 's syntax .
Unless you want to use the hundreds of non-standard preprocessors that have sprouted up precisely for reasons like this one .
Another example : you can't write logging , tracing , or debugging statements intelligently in Java .
For instance , if you want to write something like this :
debug ( " An error occurred with this object : " + obj ) ;
where " debug " is a function that checks whether a debugging flag is set , and if so , prints the message somewhere .
If you do this , someone will happily point out that in Java , function arguments are evaluated before calling the function , so even if debugging is turned off , you 're doing a bunch of work with that string concatenation : creating a StringBuffer object , copying in the string literal , calling a polymorphic toString ( ) function on obj , creating a new string to hold the object 's description , which possibly involves more StringBuffers and concatenation , then returning the StringBuffer on the stack , where its contents are appended to the first StringBuffer , possibly resulting in a reallocation of the memory to make room , and then you 're passing that argument on the stack to the debug ( ) function , only to find that debugging is off .
Oops .
And that 's the best - case scenario .
In the worst case , you could trigger a thread context switch , or a garbage collection , or an unneeded operating system page - cache fetch , or any number of other things that you really do n't want happening in production because of that debug line , at least when debugging is off .
There 's no way to fix this .
Even a preprocessor could n't do it for you .
The standard hacky workaround is to write something like this instead :
if ( DEBUG ) debug ( " An error occurred with this object : " + obj ) ;
where " DEBUG " is a constant in your code somewhere .
This approach is fraught with problems .
The debug flag may need to be shared across multiple classes , so you need to either declare it in each class , or export it from one of them .
The name of the flag appears right there , inlined with your code , and there 's no way to avoid typing it in hundreds of places ( unless you use AspectJ ) .
And it 's just plain ugly .
My third and final Java example : sometimes you really do need multiple inheritance .
If you make a game , and you have a LightSource interface and a Weapon interface , and behind each interface is a large implementation class , then in Java you 're screwed if you want to make a Glowing Sword .
You have no recourse but to manually instantiate weapon and light - source implementation objects , store them in your instance data , implement both interfaces , manually stub out every single call to delegate to the appropriate instance , and hope the interface does n't change very often .
And even then , you have n't fully solved the problem , because the language inheritance rules may not work properly if someone subclasses your GlowingSword .
The regexp - escaping problem is a lexical problem : an eval - time or compile - time macro system wo n't help you , because the lexical analyzer has already done its dirty work before the parser ever sees the string .
If you wanted to provide a way around this in Java , without using a preprocessor ( which is a hack ) , you 'd need an API that allows you to interact with the lexer .
That 's all .
Just an API , and a way to arrange to invoke it before the rest of your code is lexed .
The debug - flag problem is an evaluation - time problem .
You can fix problems like this either by adding support for lazy evaluation to your language , or by adding a macro system .
They amount to mostly the same thing , except a macro system lets you add some syntactic sugar as well , which is sometimes appropriate .
The multiple - inheritance / delegation problem is a problem with the interpreter semantics not being flexible enough .
It manifests later than eval - time , and it 's conceivable that you could fix it without needing to change the language syntax .
For instance , if Java simply had a methodMissing method in java.lang .
Object , one that was called every time someone tried to invoke a nonexistent method on you , then you could very easily implement your own delegation strategy .
It would be far easier to code , far more resilient to interface changes , and it would even allow you to abstract your delegation policy into another class , so you could share it with other classes .
Because no syntax changes are needed , the third problem illustrates a class of problems that can be solved using metaprogramming , which lets you change the built - in behavior of classes , e.g. by adding methods or properties , overriding built - in methods , and so on .
Three problem classes , three different techniques : Lexer ( or " Reader " ) macros , evaluator macros , and metaprogramming .
C++ lets you do a little of all three of these things with its Template system , and with its operator overloading , which is a limited ( but often useful ) form of metaprogramming .
Not enough with any of them , sadly , and it's too hard to implement what little flexibility it allows you .
But it 's much better than C's preprocessor , and it's a thousand times better than Java 's big fat nothing .
It of course would be infinitely better , being a divide - by - zero error , except that we 'll give Java some credit for at least not copying C++'s broken templates .
Ruby and Python offer fairly flexible metaprogramming models , but no macros or reader - macros .
So they 're both susceptible to the first two kinds of problem I mentioned .
Perl has ... I dunno .
Something .
A whole mess of somethings .
I know they do n't have macros , since they were discussing adding them on the Perl newsgroups a year ago .
Perl has some metaprogramming features , but they 're relatively limited in scope .
And I do n't think it has reader macros , although it may offer some sort of preprocessor .
I hope I 've demonstrated that reader macros , compiler macros and metaprogramming really can make your code a lot smaller , a lot faster , and a lot more robust .
Like any other language feature , you can abuse them horribly .
Unlike other language features , however , you can use macros and metaprogramming to fix broken language features , and in fact make the other features less easily abused .
No language is perfect .
The perfect language does n't exist .
A language perfect for one domain can be awful for another .
A language that 's pretty good today can be awful tomorrow .
Because languages are n't perfect , they need to provide mechanisms to let you evolve them to suit your needs .
A language 's extensibility is one of the most critical keys to its long - term survival .
Again , Java programmers would n't be using XML - based build systems , weird HTML / Java templating systems , code generators and all those zillions of other frameworks and tools out there , if Java had been capable of adapting to meet the needs of those users .
Why do n't most language implementers add macros and metaprogramming ?
They know that ultimately their language will face extinction if the users can't evolve it .
So what are they thinking ?
Sometimes they say that it's to protect the users , or make the language friendlier to beginners .
That 's almost always a baldfaced lie , because they then proceed to pile on horribly confusing features for " experts only " .
In a few rare cases ( Python , Basic and Cobol come to mind ) , they may actually mean it .
Most of the time , though , it 's because they 've made it way too hard to implement .
The language designer tries really hard to guess which features you 'd like , and they create a nice big abstract machine , and a bunch of syntax rules ( and parsers for those rules ) , and semantic rules for interpreting the syntax .
After they 've piled all that stuff on , their interpreter and / or compiler becomes horribly complex , and the language spec is horribly inconsistent , and they spend all of their time trying to think of ways to fix their busted language .
I tell you : they 'd add extensibility if they could .
But extensibility has to be designed in from the ground up , and it makes your system many times harder to build .
As if designing a language is n't hard enough already .
Was n't this blog supposed to be about Lisp ?
Yup .
And now I think I 'm finally in a position to explain why Lisp is the king of evolution among programming languages .
In stark contrast with every other language out there , Lisp only has two syntactic forms , atoms ( i.e. symbols , numbers , strings ) and the s-expression ( which stands for " symbol expression " ) , which looks like this :
( I am an s-expression . )
They can be nested to arbitrary depth :
( I am an s-expression .
( I am a sub-expression .
( We make a tree , actually . )
( Pleased to meet you ! ) ) )
OK , that 's Lisp 's syntax .
Most versions of Lisp add in a small handful of shortcuts , as long as they do n't change the overall tree - structure of the code .
And Lisp 's runtime machine only needs to support a handful of things :
anonymous functions , also called " lambda " expressions named variables nested scopes , one per lambda expression a single control - flow construct called a " continuation " some kind of I /
O
Lisp runtimes provide far more than this , of course , but what I 've described is the core of Lisp , and it 's all you need .
In theory , you do n't even need special support for strings or numbers ; they can be represented by chains of ( and compositions of ) lambda functions .
All operators and control - flow constructs , including conditional logic , loops , exception handling , multithreading , preemptive multitasking , object - oriented programming , everything can be implemented using only the five constructs above , and all using the world 's simplest syntax .
Try describing the " core of Perl " in anything under a thousand pages — and you still wo n't be successful .
The system above gives you more metaprogramming ability than any other language , but just in case that 's not enough power for you , Lisp has macros : both reader macros and compiler macros .
With reader macros , there 's an API to hook into the reader 's token stream and make any changes you like before handing the result back to the reader .
You can implement preprocessors this way — not just * do * preprocessor stuff , but actually implement arbitrary preprocessors for other people to use .
You can change the language syntax however you like : remove all the parens and use whitespace for indentation , for instance , if that 's what 's most appropriate for your problem domain .
With compiler macros , you can pretty much change anything you like about the language .
This scares a lot of people .
They prefer their current , very real pain to some imagined possibility of a different kind of pain .
Weird , but all too common .
Me , I 'll take the flexibility of macros , only hire great people , and make sure we all write good code .
Problem solved .
I 've learned how to use Lisp and Scheme macros , or at least I 'm getting a good feel for them , and they 're a LOT easier ( and more powerful ) than C++ templates .
Scheme macros use pattern - matching and template substitution .
It 's similar to XSLT and is n't much harder to learn than XSLT .
Lisp macros are just pure Lisp , and are very easy to learn , although it can take a long time to fully appreciate them .
The result : Lisp is pure DNA .
You can build anything with it , and you always have the ability to evolve even large existing systems in new directions .
And that 's exactly what you need , because your problem domain is unique .
But I do n't like all those parens !
I know .
I did n't either .
I only started getting used to them maybe a few months ago , and I only started to prefer Lisp to other languages a few days ago .
Do n't blame ya .
But with what you know now , it should be clear that Lisp 's syntax is a technical advantage .
For starters , macros need to parse and generate code , right ?
That 's why C++ templates are so dang complicated .
There are a zillion edge - cases to worry about , and that 's just in the syntax ; there are also lots of ill - specified semantic problems with them .
If you have a complex syntax , then it 's hard for you to implement macros , and it 's hard for people to use them .
Most languages , in trying to give you lots of syntactic options , have actually limited you permanently to using only those options .
And Lisp is tree - structured code ( and data ) .
It 's just lists of lists of lists ... it 's way simpler syntactically than XML , and we all love XML , right ?
Well , most people evidently do .
Even XML , with its allegedly " ultra - simple " syntax , is still kinda complicated , and working with SAX and DOM parsers is n't entirely trivial .
But it beats working with C++/ Java / Perl / Python parsers hands - down .
Trees are just data structures .
We know how to deal with data structures programmatically .
But most languages need to have their syntax converted tortuously into a tree structure in order to operate on it programmatically , and by then it's far less recognizable than the original language .
With half a day of work , you could implement XPath expressions to operate on your Lisp code , and start building your own refactoring and analysis tools , rather than waiting around for months , hoping someone else will build them for your Java IDE .
In fact , traversing Lisp code is simple enough to do almost trivially in any language — but it 's far easier in Lisp .
So writing Lisp macros and evolving the language to suit your needs is so natural that you wind up doing it all the time , almost from the beginning of a project .
The upshot is that your language gradually winds up being tailored precisely to the system you 're building .
That 's why Emacs - Lisp looks so different from Common Lisp .
It 's not so different , really , and it supports many features of Common Lisp , even though they differ in a few core areas ( as elisp is older , and RMS does n't care for CL ) .
But Emacs - Lisp has tons of specialized language features designed specifically for editors .
In fact , although I do n't have firsthand evidence of this yet , I suspect that the size of Lisp systems tends to grow logarithmically with the size of the feature set .
Or maybe an nth - root function .
But definitely less than linearly , because unlike in Java , where refactoring tends to make the code base larger , refactoring Lisp code makes it smaller .
Lisp has far more abstraction power than Java .
I noticed ten years ago that even though Perl seems superficially concise and expressive , the reality is that adding more features to a Perl system makes the code base grow ( roughly ) linearly .
Need a feature , add a function .
Need a system , add a module .
It never seems to get easier as your system grows .
And Java is even worse ; the code grows at a ( slightly ) greater - than - linear rate as a function of the feature set , because unanticipated design changes can't be bridged with programming or macros , and you wind up having to build the bridges using huge frameworks of objects and interfaces .
So Lisp may seem like it's no better than Perl or Java for small programs — possibly worse , depending on the program .
But that 's missing the point :
Lisp only shines when you use it to build a system that would have been huge in another language .
Every sufficiently large problem domain ( from JMX to ordering coffee at Starbucks ) is best expressed using custom mini-languages , and Lisp lets you build them easily and naturally .
OK , fine .
But I do n't want to implement a whole language .
Just because you can implement specialized language extensions in Lisp does n't mean that you need to .
Common Lisp and Scheme implementations have huge libraries of carefully - chosen , powerful features .
Many of these features are unavailable in Java and C++ , and some can be expressed in those languages only indirectly .
Hence , ironically , Java and C++ programmers wind up implementing new languages , very awkwardly , using " design patterns " and other heavy frameworks , layering on classes and interfaces in an attempt to build a machine powerful enough to emulate a subset of Common Lisp .
As a language platform , Common Lisp is on par with C++ or Java .
It 's the only language I 've found , out of the 20 or 30 that I investigated , that I 'd consider to be " production quality " .
Even Erlang , which is very mature , still worries me a bit .
And Common Lisp is Lisp , which means it will gradually change its shape to fit your problem space in the most natural way .
Common Lisp and many Scheme implementations sport powerful compilers , state - of - the - art garbage collectors , rich IDEs , documentation generators , profilers , and all the other stuff you 've come to expect of production - quality languages .
They have powerful type systems with the ability to declare static types as desired , to improve performance or readability .
There are multiple commercial and free / open - source implementations for both languages .
Common Lisp is production - quality and has been for at least as long as C++ ;
Scheme is less ready for prime - time , although it 's gradually getting there .
If I were using Common Lisp , I 'd definitely miss one or two features from Java , and I 'd have to take a few days to implement them .
After all that , I still do n't believe you .
You 're weird .
I know .
Do n't sweat it .
It 's just a blog .
I disagree with the previous caller .
I want to use Common Lisp at Amazon !
In a word : No .
Languages need large communities on site to do well .
And you should n't underestimate the difficulty of learning Lisp .
It generally takes longer to master than even C++ or Perl .
Well , about as long , anyway .
We do have a fair number of experienced Lispers scattered about Amazon — maybe thirty or so , more if you count Emacs - Lisp hackers .
But you 'd really need a bunch of them in your group , not just scattered around , in order to get the right critical mass on your team .
And even then , it would be a highly questionable decision .
People would be watching you constantly , waiting for you to fail , because most people do n't like Lisp and they do n't want it to succeed .
I was one of those people not too long ago .
I was looking for the perfect language , and I never suspected the best candidate would be the one that looks like oatmeal with fingernail clippings .
I know * exactly * how Lisp - dislikers feel , and I do n't really blame them .
And when you failed , e.g. your service had some sort of highly public outage ( as ALL services do , but that would be overlooked ) , Common Lisp would go on trial , and would be ceremoniously burned at the stake , as a warning to any other would - be Lispers out there .
It has happened at many other companies ( Yahoo , NASA and JPL come to mind , but there are many of them ) , and it would happen here .
If you somehow managed to get a team of good Lisp hackers together , and you somehow hid the fact that you 're using it , and you were lucky enough to have C++ neighbors who have all the outages , then you might get away with it .
But if you did n't get away with it , Lispers would hate you for giving it a bad ( well , worse ) name .
Languages are religions , political campaigns , and social communities , all rolled into one .
Never underestimate the ability of one language community to gang up and kill another one .
Java , Perl and C++ only thrived here after well over a hundred people per language more or less simultaneously just started using them , and screw you if you think they 're not doing their job .
Incidentally , none of our core three languages were allowed at Amazon for the first few years .
The only languages allowed were C and Lisp .
Lisp was mostly used for huge , much - loved customer - service application called Mailman .
Mailman was later hastily rewritten as a somewhat less - loved customer - service application : one that did n't have quite as much mail - composition functionality , but at least it was in Java , which solved the embarrassing problem that nobody in CS Apps at the time knew much Lisp .
The point is that C++ , Perl and Java did n't just show up , they barged right through the front door : first Perl , then C++ , then Java , and it took a LONG time before Java folks were viewed as first - class citizens .
It 's taken them even longer to try to integrate with the existing systems , e.g. the build systems , which were written mostly to solve horrible build / link problems with C++ that do n't really exist in Java .
You really do n't want to go there .
One individual recently tried doing a highly visible internal project in Ruby , and it barfed in a highly public way on its first day of operation ; now the Ruby community is mad because it makes Ruby look bad , when Ruby had nothing to do with it .
It was a poor decision on the engineer 's part .
Not because there 's anything wrong with Ruby , but because we do n't have enough experience with it at Amazon to understand its idioms and performance characteristics , and also because very few people have much experience with it here .
Languages need to " bake " for a few years before they become ready for prime - time at Amazon .
They need to be available for personal scripting and productivity tools , and eventually people will start dabbling with getting their feet wet with small systems .
Over time , as the systems prove themselves , larger ones are built , and eventually the painful transition to " trusted , first - class language " completes , typically about five years after its first introduction .
Today , there are only three languages that have been well - tested enough in our environment to be considered stable : C , Java , and Perl .
And I suppose some people use C++ , even though " stable " is n't a very good word for the systems produced with it .
For general - purpose programming , and particularly for services that other teams rely on , those are the only languages * I* would use .
If a hundred people stood up and announced they were going to start using Common Lisp , I 'd probably stand up with them — after asking around to see how well they actually knew it .
But it ai n't gonna happen .
So do n't get too carried away .
This is just a speculative blog .
Lisp is a cool language , or at least it appears to have great potential .
It 's worth a look , and maybe even a second look .
But do n't touch , just look !
That Ruby incident has made all the language enthusiasts a bit paranoid , and we 're going to be a little extra jumpy for a while .

" Compiler macro " actually means something specific in Common Lisp ( see the second paragraph ) :
http://olympus.het.brown.edu/doc/gclinfo-html/gcl_3.html#SEC190
What you refer to as compiler macros are normally called " macros " without special qualifications .
You can probably safely call them " interpreter macros " .
Did n't we actually compile our early C code with a C++ compiler , to get better typechecking ?

Xurf kuzl farq lozy !
You do n't understand ?
Well , I 'm taking advantage of a hypothetical framework for extending English in fundamental ways .
Unbeknownst to you , " kuzl " is part of a new grammatical construct that makes expressing recursive ideas much more natural .
I have heard enough smart people describe the profundity of their experiences with LISP to believe that it's a lot more awesome than I currently realize .
But when the selling point is how radically you can redefine the language , I feel like they miss the value of language consistency , which translates into being able to read foreign code and know what the hell is going on .
In your first Java example , you wrote one line of code , and with that alone you were able to explain exactly what Java does to evaluate that line .
Any experienced Java programmer in the world would be able to tell you the same thing , just by looking at that one line .
Now pretend that you 're up at 2 AM trying to debug some system that you just inherited , the guy who wrote it is no longer with the company , you know he 's a smart guy but sometimes too clever for his own good .
And you have somehow localized the problem to this line :
( make - it - happen ( widget - functor asin ) ( map make - it - happen data ) )
I do n't know enough crazy things you can do with LISP to come up with a plausible example , but you get the idea .
How much other code will you have to read to even discover what * sort * of thing this does ?
I believe there is value in language consistency , namely that it makes it very transparent what your code is actually doing .
Not that you necessarily understand * why * it 's doing what it 's doing , but you at least know * what * it 's doing .
If LISP really gives you the expressive power to implement Perl with LISP macros , then I hardly see how it could be consistent enough to allow a large group of people to share / maintain LISP code .
Unless you restrain yourself from making these deep extensions to the language , but then why waste your time writing clunky things like ( setq x 1 ) when you could just write x = 1 ?

Hey Steve ,
Which Scheme environment have you been using ?
I 've been playing around with a couple of them .
PLTScheme , Scheme48 / scsh and SISC appear to be the more complete ones I 've found so far .
Posted by : Daniel C. at February 8 , 2005 12:03 AM
Josh : I put a comment here that tried to do some more explaining .
Then I re-read my entry , and I see now that I 'd just be repeating myself .
I do n't think it 's possible to be convinced of the benefits of Lisp by reading about it , or by tinkering a little with it .
You just have to do a bunch of it .
Lots .
Tons .
Then eventually it clicks .
That 's why I called this blog " Scheming is Believing . "
So if my explanations were n't compelling , and I seriously doubt they were , then do n't sweat it .
It 's just a blog .

Daniel —
I 've been mostly using Kawa , a Scheme for the JVM that compiles to bytecodes , although I would n't really recommend it .
It 's not a full Scheme implementation yet — e.g. continuations are upward - only , and it has an incomplete set of SRFIs , and lots of bugs in general .
Kawa 's got a lot of long - term potential , but it 's not useful for production - quality work in either Java or Scheme .
I looked at the info pages for MIT Scheme recently , and they 've implemented a LOT of features from other languages — e.g. list comprehensions like Haskell's .
For commercial implementations , Chez Scheme is allegedly the best .
Fast , complete , portable , and actively developed .
All the Schemes implement a different feature set , and the code from one does n't always run immediately on another .
This is a serious problem with Scheme in general , and I believe it currently renders Scheme unsuitable for production work .
But I 'm gradually working on figuring out if any of them is promising enough to try to work with .

In response to Josh Haberman 's comment about considering this line of code :
( make - it - happen ( widget - functor asin ) ( map make - it - happen data ) )
What would you do if you were staring at this line of code :
if ( ( * self -> mark_funcs [d ] ) ( self , changed_field_number ) != SUCCESS ) return FAILURE ;
{pointer to actual Amazon function containing this code}
... trying to figure out why the tax was computed incorrectly !
My point is that any language can be obfuscated and it seems to be pretty popular in both perl and C .
Steve -
I completely agree that lisp 's macro system sets it apart and gives the language more power .
Also , I like the fact that scheme is so " light - weight " because it comes with a tiny library .
However , big bulky libraries are also power .
It can become difficult to integrate many different libraries into your application if they have over - lapping problem domains ( with different implementations ) .
So , Common Lisp is very nice in the fact that many common functions are already available to you .
Of course small vs big libraries is a problem with any language .
So , when is the Scheme Codigo implementation going to be ready ?
